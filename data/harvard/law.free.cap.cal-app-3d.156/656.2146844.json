J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">Marie Black (Black) appeals a January 18, 1983 order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Orange County Superior Court which sustained, without leave to amend, the demurrer of Helen Hepner (Hepner) to her complaint for malicious prosecution. The order stated \u201ccourt orders action dismissed.\u201d However, a judgment of dismissal was never entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">An order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is not an appealable order (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 64, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>p. 4078), and an appeal lies only from the ensuing judgment. <em>(Berri </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 856, 860 [279 P.2d 8].) However, we deem the minute order\u2019s intended dismissal of the action tantamount to a judgment of dismissal <em>(Beazell </em>v. <em>Schrader </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 577, 579-580 [30 Cal.Rptr. 534, 381 P.2d 390]),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and proceed with Black\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"> Black sued Hepner alleging malicious prosecution of a small claims court proceeding in which judgment was rendered in favor of Black.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hepner demurred to the complaint claiming an action for malicious prosecution may not be based on institution of a small claims proceeding, relying on <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Motor Co. </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 476 [161 Cal.Rptr. 662].</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Black contends the 1981 amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 117.18<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> undermines the rationale and effect of <em>Pace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Motor Co., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 476, the court affirmed an order dismissing an action for malicious prosecution on the ground a small claims proceeding does not give rise to such a cause of action. After discussing the theory behind the small claims process, the court found \u201c[t]o permit an action for malicious prosecution to be grounded on a small claims proceeding would frustrate the intent of the Legislature in adopting an expeditious and informal means of resolving small disputes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>would inject into a simple and accessible proceeding elements of time, expense, and complexity which the small claims process was established to avoid, and <em>would require a prudent claimant to consult with an attorney before making use of this supposedly attorney-free method for settling disputes over small amounts. </em>\u201d (Italics added; <em>id., </em>at p. 479.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Section 117.18, as amended,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires each county to create and make available an advisory service to render individual assistance to small claims litigants at no additional charge. The section has no direct bearing upon a subsequent malicious prosecution action. Black, however, urges the mandatory availability of an advisory service satisfies the <em>Pace </em>court\u2019s concern over the need of a prudent claimant to consult with an attorney. Her argument fails for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Section 117.18 does not prescribe the nature or extent of the services to be made available. Persons providing assistance need not be members of the bar; they may include law students, paralegals and \u201cpersons experienced in resolving minor disputes and familiar with small claims court rules and procedures.\u201d Thus, a litigant who avails himself of the service may not necessarily confer with a lawyer nor obtain advice as to the merits of his grievance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Nor does section 117.18 <em>require </em>a litigant to avail himself of the advisory service. Yet, were we to sanction a subsequent malicious prosecution action it would have the effect of requiring a potential litigant to seek assistance, thus making section 117.18 inconsistent with the rationale for the small claims process, i.e., to provide an inexpensive and <em>expeditious </em>means to settle disputes over small amounts informally. <em>(Pace </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Motor Co., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 476, 478-479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Black further contends a small claims litigant may suffer as much as a litigant in a more formal proceeding. We do not disagree a small claims litigant may be inconvenienced or become emotionally distraught by virtue of the lawsuit. However, the small claims process eliminates, or at least considerably diminishes, the extent of harm to a litigant by its malicious commencement. Thus, although there is potential for abuse of the process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>by the \u201cmalicious institution of unfounded claims\u201d <em>(Pace </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Motor Co., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 476, 479), any deviation from its summary nature because some defendants may be recipients of such abuse would countervail the reason for its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We also recognize a litigant seeking damages of $1,500 or less may file an action in municipal court. Thus, where the small claims process is selected, a defendant who would otherwise have the right to sue for malicious prosecution had the action been brought in municipal court, cannot do so. However, the defendant in a small claims proceeding also benefits from its expeditious and summary nature. Neither the services of a lawyer nor substantial time to defend are required. The same action brought in municipal court could subject a defendant to protracted litigation resulting in substantially more abuse over a longer period of time. Attorney fees and costs of defense may also be incurred. Therefore, we cannot say a defendant permitted to seek damages for the malicious prosecution of a municipal court action receives more favorable treatment than a defendant who cannot bring an action because it arises out of an alleged malicious prosecution of a small claims court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Notwithstanding her contention section 117.18 invalidates the holding of <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Motor Co., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 476, Black infers <em>Pace </em>was incorrectly decided. We disagree. Relying on <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Vial </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 577 [311 P.2d 494], and <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 460 [181 Cal.Rptr. 878], she claims \u201cthe right to redress for malicious conduct should not depend upon the <em>form </em>of the proceeding by which the injury is inflicted.\u201d (Italics added; <em>Hardy </em>at p. 581.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, <em>Hardy </em>involved the right to seek damages for malicious prosecution arising from an administrative proceeding; <em>Stanley </em>held a malicious prosecution action is not barred when the prior litigation terminated after judicial arbitration. Both pertain to the <em>form </em>of a proceeding, not to the <em>court </em>in which a proceeding is instituted. In fact, <em>Stanley </em>distinguishes <em>Pace </em>on the grounds no attorneys are permitted in a small claims action; the rules of evidence are not observed; there is no provision for discovery; and there is no pleading.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Legislature\u2019s clear intent was to provide a judicial forum in which individual minor civil disputes may be resolved in an expeditious, inexpensive and fair manner (\u00a7 116.1), and it certainly did not contemplate further litigation arising from alleged malicious prosecution of these matters. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>do we view the mandatory availability of an advisory service as a departure from this attorney-free method for settling disputes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude the reasoning and logic of <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Motor Co., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 476, has not been diluted by the amendment to section 117.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Wallin, J., and Sonenshine, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-13\"> Black's notice of appeal indicates she is appealing the judgment of dismissal entered January 18, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> In <em>Beazell </em>an order which stated \u201c \u2018It Is Ordered that the demurrer to the first amended complaint of plaintiff is sustained without leave to amend; and that plaintiff take nothing from defendant, \u2019 \u201d was interpreted as incorporating an order of dismissal.

The advisory service may be provided in person, by telephone, or by any other means reasonably calculated to provide timely and appropriate assistance.
