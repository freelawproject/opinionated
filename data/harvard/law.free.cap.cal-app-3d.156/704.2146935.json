(The Gap) appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiff Harvard Investment Company (Harvard) in an action against The Gap for waste and breach of a lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The facts necessary to the disposition of this appeal are undisputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harvard bought a building in which The Gap was a tenant. Sometime after The Gap vacated the premises, Harvard sued it for waste and breach of the lease. Harvard prayed for more than $400,000 in actual damages. Harvard also sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a clause in the lease agreement that provided that if either party sued the other on the lease, \u201cthe losing party shall pay the successful party a reasonable sum for attorneys\u2019 fees . . . .\u201d Prior to answering the complaint, The Gap made an offer of judgment, pursuant to section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, of $65,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Harvard rejected this offer. The Gap then answered the complaint, denying all liability and also seeking its attorney\u2019s fees. Discovery commenced and the lawsuit continued. The case was to be tried on December 15, 1980. On December 5, 1980, The Gap made a second offer of judgment, this time for $125,000, inclusive of all costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Again Harvard rejected the offer. After a continuance, the trial began on February 23, 1981, and lasted for <em>13Vi </em>days. On March 20, 1981, the court filed an intended decision, finding in favor of Harvard for $131,669 ($81,669 for actual damages and $50,000 in attorney\u2019s fees). On April 6, 1981, The Gap filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law on three specific issues, only two of which figure in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201c1. (a) The value of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by plaintiff for services rendered on those issues upon which plaintiff was successful, and (b) the value of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by plaintiff for services rendered on those issues as to which plaintiff was not successful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201cSaid allocation is necessary by reason of defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff is not entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered on those issues as to which plaintiff was not successful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201c2. (a) The value of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by plaintiff for services rendered during the period ending on December 5, 1980, and the value of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the plaintiff for services rendered during the period commencing on December 6, 1980, to the conclusion of the trial, and (b) the allocation of the Court\u2019s allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiff as between said two periods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cSaid allocation is necessary by reason of the fact that on December 5, 1980, defendant served upon plaintiff a Statutory Offer of Judgment pursuant to \u00a7 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Harvard objected to this request for findings. On April 16, 1981, the court entered judgment in accordance with its intended decision. In addition, the court denied The Gap\u2019s request for findings. After entry of judgment, The Gap filed a motion to vacate the judgment on grounds that the court\u2019s failure to make the requested findings rendered the judgment defective. The Gap renewed its request for the findings and also moved for various orders amending the judgment. First, on the theory that Harvard did not recover more than The Gap\u2019s statutory offer of $125,000, The. Gap sought an order under section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure that (1) limited Harvard\u2019s awardable costs to those incurred up to the date of the offer, and (2) granted The Gap the costs which it incurred after the date of the offer. Second, on the theory that The Gap was the \u201csuccessful party\u201d within the meaning of the fee clause in the lease from the date that Harvard rejected The Gap\u2019s offer, The Gap sought an order awarding it the attorney\u2019s fees that it incurred from the date of Harvard\u2019s rejection. Third, on the theory that the fee clause permitted the recovery of fees by the successful party on an issue-by-issue basis, The Gap sought fees which were incurred from the commencement of the action with respect to the issues on which it prevailed at trial. The court denied The Gap\u2019s motions \u201cfor the reasons set forth in [Harvard\u2019s] opposition (filed 4/9/81),\u201d namely, (1) that a request for findings on fewer than all material issues is unauthorized and unl\u00e1wful and therefore must be denied; and (2) assuming that limited findings are proper, the specific findings requested need not be made because they did not involve material issues. The Gap here contends that the court erred when it denied its request for findings on certain specified issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> At the time of The Gap\u2019s request, section 632 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided, in pertinent part:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhere findings are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>quired, they shall fairly disclose the court\u2019s determination of <em>all </em>issues of fact in the case.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Also at this time, rule 232(e) of the California Rules of Court provided, in pertinent part: \u201cFindings shall fairly disclose the court\u2019s determination of <em>all </em>issues of fact material to the judgment in the case and shall be concisely and chronologically stated whenever practicable.\u201d* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"> From this authority, it appears that the trial court concluded that, if a court intends to issue findings, it must make findings on <em>all </em>material issues;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> further, that a party can <em>only </em>request findings on <em>all </em>material issues. Thus the court denied The Gap\u2019s request because, in its view, such request invited the court to commit error by making incomplete findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">This unfortunate application of the rules exalted the allegedly defective form of The Gap\u2019s request over its legitimate substance. Clearly, The Gap sought findings of some sort; however, because it asked for findings on only <em>some </em>and not <em>all </em>issues in the case, the court treated its request as a nullity, as if no request had been made at all. Even assuming the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>of the rules divined by the court, it does not follow from them that a party who \u201cerroneously\u201d requests limited findings is therefore not entitled to <em>any </em>findings. Under these circumstances, it would have been appropriate for the court to have treated The Gap\u2019s limited request as a request for findings on <em>all </em>issues. Doing so would have provided The Gap with the only findings it really wanted and also would have protected the court from the error of failing to make a requested finding. (Cf. <em>Chapple </em>v. <em>Big Bear Super Market No. 3 </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 867, 873-874 [167 Cal.Rptr. 103] [where a finding on a material issue is requested, a judgment rendered in the absence of such a finding is reversible].) In this connection, we note that, in its opposition to The Gap\u2019s requested findings, Harvard asked that the request be denied, but alternatively suggested that the court make findings on <em>all </em>issues.  We believe that, at the very least, the court should have permitted The Gap to amend its request to ask for findings on all issues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All things considered, we conclude that the court\u2019s summary denial of The Gap\u2019s request was error.  Whether such error constitutes a basis for reversal of the court\u2019s judgment depends on whether the findings requested by The Gap involved material issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">As noted, The Gap requested that the court make findings concerning what part of the $50,000 attorney\u2019s fee award represented fees for services rendered to Harvard up to December 5, the date of the statutory offer. This request was based upon the contention that section 998 was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Under section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if Harvard\u2019s actual recovery was less than The Gap\u2019s December 5 offer of $125,000, then (1) The Gap would be liable for only the pre-offer costs incurred by Harvard; and (2) Harvard would be liable for the post-offer costs incurred by The Gap. (See <em>Shain </em>v. <em>City of Albany </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 294, 297-298 [165 Cal.Rptr. 69].) Superficially, it appears that section 998 was inapplicable, and, therefore, that the court properly denied The Gap\u2019s request for a finding. The face of the judgment shows that Harvard recovered $131,669, $6,669 more than The Gap\u2019s offer. The Gap contends, however, that despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>this appearance, Harvard did not obtain a judgment more favorable than its $125,000 offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The Gap points out that, in determining whether a party has obtained a more favorable judgment, the court must exclude from the total recovery the costs incurred <em>after </em>the offer was made. The rationale for this rule was stated by the court in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 685, 688 [28 Cal.Rptr. 485]:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cWe believe that the Legislature enacted section 997 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the purpose of encouraging the settlement of litigation without trial. The section was designed to give a defendant the right to offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified amount and to provide that if the plaintiff did not accept said offer he could not recover any costs incurred after the date of the offer if he failed \u2018to obtain a more favorable judgment. \u2019 To determine whether a plaintiff has recovered a more favorable judgment costs incurred after the offer has been received must be excluded. If not, the portion of section 997 denying plaintiff his costs becomes meaningless, [f] It is true, as respondent contends, that one must look to the judgment in order to determine whether it is more favorable than the offer of settlement. . . . [W]hen you have a cause of action seeking damages only and the verdict of the jury is less than the offer of settlement plus costs incurred to that time, the judgment is not more favorable and the rule of section 997 must be applied, [f] If the rule were as contended by the respondent and all costs incurred could be included in determining whether the recovery was more favorable than the offer of settlement, then a plaintiff could in many instances by costs alone insure a more favorable judgment. Such result would defeat the purpose of the section and does not comport with the decisions of the decided cases. (See <em>Douthitt </em>v. <em>Finch </em>[1890] 84 Cal. 214 [24 P. 929]; <em>Robinett </em>v. <em>Brown </em>[1914] 167 Cal. 735 [141 P. 368].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The Gap urges us to adapt and apply this rationale to the circumstances of this case. It notes that $50,000 of the total judgment represents the award for attorney\u2019s fees that were incurred both before <em>and after </em>the offer. The Gap argues that, in determining the applicability of section 998 (i.e., whether Harvard obtained a more favorable judgment), the court, following <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 685, should exclude that part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>$50,000 fee award that represents fees incurred after the December 5 offer. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Just as the inclusion of <em>costs </em>incurred after an offer is made defeats the purpose of section 998, so would the inclusion of <em>damages </em>incurred after the date of an offer. This is especially so when those postoffer damages are attorney\u2019s fees incurred in continuing the litigation after the offer. For example, in this case, if $30,000 of the total fee award represents the fees incurred for services rendered to Harvard up to December 5, then Harvard\u2019s judgment was really for $111,669, and only by litigating the case <em>after </em>the offer was Harvard able to generate more fees (damages) and thereby insure a judgment more favorable than The Gap\u2019s $125,000 offer. Clearly, the application of the <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brown </em>rationale is appropriate under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">We hold, therefore, that where a judgment includes attorney\u2019s fees awarded pursuant to a contractual fee clause, the court must exclude that part of the fee award which represents services performed <em>after </em>a statutory offer is made when it determines whether the provisions of section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure are applicable. Such a rule clearly promotes the purpose and policy behind that section. It encourages settlement; it discourages litigation aimed solely at. insuring an award greater than a statutory offer; and it penalizes a plaintiff who fails to accept what, in retrospect, is seen to have been a reasonable offer. (See <em>Shain </em>v. <em>City of Albany, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d 294, 299; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Nolan, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.3d 445, 449; <em>Distefano </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 380, 385 [69 Cal.Rptr. 691] [construing former \u00a7 997]; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 685, 688 [construing former \u00a7 997].)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">After The Gap made its statutory offer of December 5, and after the court issued its intended decision, The Gap was entitled to a determination of whether the cost shifting mechanism of section 998 was applicable. Given our holding, The Gap\u2019s requested finding was both material and essential to that determination. Therefore, we find that the court\u2019s failure to make this finding was reversible error. (Cf. <em>Chapple </em>v. <em>Big Bear Super Market No. 3, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d 867, 873-874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">For yet another reason, The Gap requested findings concerning the amounts of the attorney\u2019s fee award attributable to pre- and postoffer legal services. It claimed that, because Harvard failed to obtain a more favorable judgment after the December 5 offer, The Gap was, in reality, the successful party thereafter. Therefore, The Gap argues, it was entitled to its attorney\u2019s fees after December 5 pursuant to the fee clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In addition, The Gap sought findings that determined who the successful party was on an issue-by-issue basis. This request was based upon its contention that, under the terms of the fee clause, each party was entitled to fees for the services rendered in litigating those issues that it won and conversely neither party was entitled to fees for services rendered on issues that it lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The court denied the request for such findings because there was no basis to support The Gap\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause. We conclude that the court\u2019s refusal to make these particular requested findings was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The fee clause in the lease agreement provided: \u201c19.6. Costs of Suit, [f] (a) If Tenant or Landlord shall bring <em>any action </em>for any relief against the other, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of this Lease, including any suit by Landlord for the recovery of rent or possession of the Premises, <em>the losing party </em>shall pay <em>the successful party </em>a reasonable sum for attorneys\u2019 fees which shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action and shall be paid whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> Underlying each of The Gap\u2019s requested findings is a different interpretation of what \u201cthe successful party\u201d means in the fee clause. To The Gap, the fee clause contemplated more than one successful party. According to its theory, there was a successful party before and after its offer of judgment, and there was a successful party on each and every issue and item of damage litigated. Both of these interpretations have a common aspect, namely, they contradict the court\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause and its findings that (1) Harvard was <em>the </em>successful party, and (2) only Harvard was entitled to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The court rendered judgment in favor of Harvard and awarded it attorney\u2019s fees. From the judgment we can infer that the court found (1) that the fee clause contemplated one successful party in the action, and (2) that because Harvard won on both of its causes of action, it was the successful party, entitled to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The threshold question, then, is whether the court erred as a matter of law by failing to adopt The Gap\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The parties\u2019 intention as it was expressed through the words they used is the source of their rights under the fee clause. (See <em>Pacific Gas and E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 39 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373].) With respect to the words used, the court must view them in their ordinary and popular sense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>unless there is evidence that the parties intended to use them in a unique sense or to give them some different, specialized meaning. (See <em>Moss Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Geary </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 1, 9 [115 Cal.Rptr. 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"> Here, the fee clause refers to <em>\u201cthe </em>losing party\u201d paying reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to <em>\u201cthe </em>successful party\u201d in \u201cany action\u201d based on the lease agreement. (Italics added.) The plain and ordinary meaning of this language is that, in an action between the parties involving this lease, there will be <em>one </em>successful party and <em>one </em>losing party for the purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In <em>Distefano </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, 263 </em>Cal.App.2d 380, plaintiff was awarded damages and attorney\u2019s fees in an action on a contract with a fee provision similar to that in this case. It read: \u201c \u2018Should either party hereto bring suit in court to enforce the terms hereof, it is agreed that the losing party shall pay to the successful party his costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 385.) Not unlike The Gap\u2019s contentions here, the defendants in <em>Distefano </em>contended that \u201csince plaintiff\u2019s original complaint was for $128,458.05, but was by the time of the second trial brought down to a figure of $39,382.58, and resulted in a judgment of only $12,559.96, they were \u2018successful\u2019 pursuant to [the fee clause] and, therefore, entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Given the language of the fee clause, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 contention and found it unnecessary under the terms of the fee clause to probe beneath the judgment in favor of the plaintiff to determine who the successful party \u201creally\u201d was.  The court cited numerous cases supporting the proposition that, under the \u201csuccessful patty\u201d type fee provisions, \u201cthe party recovering the net judgment is the successful party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>(Distefano </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 380, 387.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In this case, Harvard sued The Gap on two causes of action. The Gap denied all liability. Harvard prevailed on both of its causes of action, and the court rendered judgment in its favor. In light of <em>Distefano </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>we find the court\u2019s implicit finding that Harvard was \u201cthe successful party\u201d to be reasonable, proper, and entirely consistent with the language of the fee provision. Separate subsidiary battles of proof with respect to individual items of alleged damage do not alter the fact that Harvard won the action and under the plain meaning of the fee clause was entitled to fees. We conclude that the court\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause was not erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The Gap cites numerous cases in which courts, faced with unique factual, procedural, and legal circumstances, adopted equitable approaches to attorney\u2019s fees awards, rather than basing them simply on who won the final judgment or on a rigid application of the fee clauses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the basis of these cases, The Gap urges us to construe its meaning of \u201cthe successful party\u201d into the fee clause for equitable reasons. Doing so, The Gap states, will discourage \u201coverreaching litigants\u201d and \u201cunreasonable litigation\u201d and promote \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201ccommon sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The circumstances of this case are clearly distinguishable from the cases cited, hence we decline the invitation to add, by interpretation, what the parties could have, but failed to include, in the fee clause. (Cf. <em>A.B.C. Distrib. Co. </em>v. <em>Distillers Distr. Corp. </em>(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 175, 185 [316 P.2d 71].) Because the fee clause is not ambiguous or vague, we find its meaning in the plain and ordinary sense of the words used, as did the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We recognize, of course, that courts may be guided by equitable principles when awarding attorney\u2019s fees <em>(International Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 218, 223-224), in part because such awards involve the careful exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>(Melnyk </em>v. <em>Robledo </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624 [134 Cal.Rptr. 602].) Moreover, we note that equitable considerations may properly influence the court\u2019s construction and application of a fee clause that is uncertain and could lead to oppressive results if literally applied. (See, e.g., <em>Ecco-Phoenix Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Howard J. White, Inc., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 266.)  However, under the circumstances of this case, the court\u2019s failure to apply The Gap\u2019s interpretation of \u201cthe successful party\u201d did not produce an oppressive result and cannot be considered error as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">It is interesting to note that to a certain degree the court\u2019s fee award did reflect the equitable interpretation urged by The Gap. As earlier noted, The Gap contended that, under the fee clause, a party was not entitled to fees for litigating issues which it did not win. Although the court rendered judgment in favor of Harvard, it nevertheless found that Harvard had not proved all of the items of damages which it had alleged in its complaint. Indeed, it appears that Harvard proved fewer than half of them. Appropriately, the court granted Harvard only half of its estimated attorney\u2019s fees. Doing so was fully consistent with The Gap\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Since we have concluded (1) that the court\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause was reasonable and not erroneous as a matter of law, and (2) that the court did not err in failing to construe the fee clause according to The Gap\u2019s interpretation, we find that the court\u2019s refusal to make the requested findings concerning who the successful party was on an issue-by-issue basis and on a pre- and postoffer basis was proper and did not constitute reversible error. Such findings were not material to the court\u2019s interpretation of the fee clause and would have been inconsistent with and contradictory to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">To the extent that it purports to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court in order to make the following factual and legal determinations and enter judgment accordingly: (1) the amount of the $50,000 fee award attributable to services rendered to Harvard before and after the December 5, 1980, offer of judgment; (2) the applicability of section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in light of the above finding; and (3) if section 998 is found to be applicable, a reallocation of allowable costs between the parties pursuant to the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the applicable case law, and the opinions expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Kline, P. J., and Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 26, 1984, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> In the words of appellant\u2019s opening brief, \u201c[t]he present appeal does <em>not </em>relate to the merits of the trial court\u2019s disposition of the main issues in the case. Defendant The Gap was content, indeed well satisfied, with that disposition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(c) If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff shall not recover his costs and shall pay the defendant\u2019s costs from the time of the offer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\"> Although both parties agree that section 632 has changed (see Stats. 1981, ch. 900, \u00a7 1, p. 3425), they disagree concerning the meaning of the change. Section 632 now provides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>in pertinent part: \u201cUpon the request of any party appearing at the trial, made within 10 days after the court announces a tentative decision, or if the trial has lasted less than one day, made prior to submission of the matter for decision, the court shall issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal controverted issues at trial. <em>The request for a statement of decision shall specify those controverted issues as to which the party is requesting a statement of decision. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The Gap contends that section 632 now clearly permits a court to make findings on less than all of the material issues in a case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The plain language of the statute, common sense, and judicial economy strongly support The Gap\u2019s interpretation. Section 632 expressly requires that a party specify the issues on which it seeks findings. We assume that the inclusion of this requirement was not an idle act or a superfluous enactment (see <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Realty Bond Service Corp. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241]); rather, that the Legislature intended that it have meaning and effect. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 1, 4 [77 Cal.Rptr. 741].) Since the statute expressly requires that a party specify issues, we conclude that a court may make findings on only those issues specified, i.e., on fewer than all the material issues. To so construe section 632 is logical and makes sense. (See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 85, 96 [8 Cal.Rptr. 56].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\"> This requirement is no longer set forth in rule 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\"> Although the rule seems plausible in light of the versions of section 632 and rule 232(e) which applied at the time of The Gap\u2019s request, we can find no cases holding that the failure of a court to make findings on <em>all </em>material issues is per se reversible error regardless of whether the \u201cmissing\u201d findings are relevant or necessary to the resolution of the case. Indeed, we note that courts have no duty to make findings on every matter on which evidence is received at trial. <em>(Placentia Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Placentia </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 9, 27 [129 Cal.Rptr. 126].) Moreover, it has been held that the failure to make findings on material issues is not reversible error when the missing findings may be reasonably inferred from the other findings or when the missing findings would necessarily have been adverse to the appellants. <em>(McAdams </em>v. <em>McElroy </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 985, 996 [133 Cal.Rptr. 637].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> On appeal, The Gap argues that the court found that The Gap had waived its right to findings by making an unlawful request for limited findings. Harvard denies that the court based its denial on a waiver theory. However, Harvard claims that, in fact, the court could have found that The Gap waived its right to findings. Given the circumstances of this case, we conclude that The Gap could not have waived its right to findings. First, section 632 stated, \u201cfindings . . . may be waived by consent in writing ... or by oral consent in open court. . . and shall be deemed waived by a party by failure to appear at the trial.\u201d The Gap did not consent to waive findings nor did it fail to appear at trial. Second, a waiver of rights generally involves a clear, voluntary, intentional, and knowing expression. (See 30 Cal.Jur.3d, Estoppel and Waiver, \u00a7 21 and cases cited therein.) The record reflects that The Gap did not express a waiver of <em>all </em>findings, but only those which it did not need. Finally, it is illogical to hold that a request for a few findings constitutes a waiver of any findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"><em> Bennett </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>dealt with section 997 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was later repealed and replaced by section 998. (See Stats. 1971, ch. 1679, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 3, p. 3605.) Section 998 was amended in 1977. (Stats. 1977, ch. 458, \u00a7 1, p. 1513.) However, the part of section 998 pertinent to this appeal is virtually identical to former section 997. Moreover, courts have cited cases which construed former section 997 as authority when dealing with its successor section 998. (See, e.g., <em>Shain </em>v. <em>City of Albany, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d 294, 297-300; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Nolan </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 445, 451-452 [159 Cal.Rptr. 469].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> Section 1717 of the Civil Code validates contractual attorney\u2019s fees provisions where, as here, they provide that the prevailing (i.e., successful) party in an action on the contract shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>(Presley of Southern California </em>v. <em>Whelan </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 959, 960-961 [196 Cal.Rptr. 1].) Assuming, arguendo, that section 1717 applies in this case, we find that it supports the trial court\u2019s determination regarding fees. When the decision below was rendered, section 1717 expressly defined \u201cprevailing party\u201d as the party \u201cin whose favor final judgment is rendered.\u201d Clearly, the trial court\u2019s awards of fees to Harvard alone was consistent with section 1717 as it then provided. Since the time of the trial court\u2019s decision, section 1717 has been amended so as to delete the definition of \u201cprevailing party.\u201d That section now provides that upon notice and motion, the trial court is required to determine who is the prevailing party. Section 1717 now gives the trial courts wide discretion in determining which party \u201cprevailed.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Krueger </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 752, 756-757 [198 Cal.Rptr. 174].) Absent a clear abuse of discretion, such determination will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The expansion of the trial court\u2019s discretion, however, did not invalidate the previous definition; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>rather, it simply eliminated its binding effect on the court\u2019s determination. We conclude that the trial court acted well within its discretion when the judge determined that Harvard was the only prevailing party (see <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 204, 217 [193 Cal.Rptr. 322]); also that its determination was consistent with the current version of section 1717.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\"> See, e.g., <em>Ecco-Phoenix Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Howard J.
