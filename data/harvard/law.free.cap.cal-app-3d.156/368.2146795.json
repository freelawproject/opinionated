The issue is whether a policy of insurance issued by respondent Vigilant Insurance Company afforded coverage for the alleged liability of Cari Naumann arising from a fatal single vehicle accident. We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The vehicle involved in the accident at issue was a 1965 Chevrolet owned by Emile Giovanna, appellant\u2019s husband and stepfather of her two natural daughters, Cathy and Cari Naumann. All four individuals lived together in the same household at the time. On July 29, 1978, Cari was driving the Chevrolet when it overturned and caused the death of her sister Cathy. The Chevrolet was insured under a State Farm insurance policy. Appellant was also insured under a personal automobile policy issued by respondent Vigilant. The Vigilant policy described and covered appellant\u2019s 1973 Ford station wagon; it did not describe or cover the 1965 Chevrolet involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The only question before us is whether the trial court erred in holding that the Vigilant policy did not afford coverage for Cari on the claims arising from the fatal automobile accident. Appellant argues that both of her daughters were \u201cnamed insureds\u201d under the policy as a result of the addition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>her daughters to the Vigilant policy as \u201coccasional operators.\u201d There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The Vigilant policy identifies a \u201ccovered person\u201d as, inter alia, \u201cyou or any family member.\u201d The term \u201cyou\u201d, is defined to refer to \u201cthe \u2018named insured\u2019 shown in the Declarations and the spouse if a resident of the same household\u201d; a \u201cfamily member,\u201d in turn, is \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household . . . .\u201d The only named insured in the policy declarations is appellant. Thus, the term \u201cyou\u201d includes appellant and her husband; Cari is insured under the policy only as a \u201cfamily member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The broad coverage provisions of the policy are limited by several express exclusions. Relevant here are exclusions 9 and 10, which state: \u201cWe do not provide Liability Coverage: . . . [f] 9. For the ownership, maintenance or use of any vehicle, other than your covered auto, which is owned by you or furnished or available for your regular use. [f] 10. For the ownership, maintenance or use of any vehicle, other than your covered auto, which is owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of any family member. However, this exclusion does not apply to you.\u201d The phrase \u201cyour covered auto,\u201d defined as \u201cany vehicle shown in the Declarations,\u201d refers only to appellant\u2019s 1973 Ford station wagon. The 1965 Chevrolet driven at the time of the fatal accident is not described in the Vigilant policy, and was not covered thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Under exclusion 9, the Vigilant policy does not cover <em>any </em>person\u2019s use of an automobile owned by appellant or her spouse if the automobile is not shown in the declarations. As a result, there is no coverage available to anyone under the subject policy for the Chevrolet involved in the accident. Under exclusion 10, there is no coverage for the use by anyone <em>other than \u201cyou\u201d </em>of an automobile owned by, or furnished or available for the use of, any \u201cfamily member.\u201d This broad exclusion, like exclusion 9, precludes policy coverage of the vehicle involved in the accident, since it was owned by a resident of appellant\u2019s household related to appellant by marriage (appellant\u2019s husband).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Exclusion 10 does not apply to persons in the \u201cyou\u201d category, and the crux of appellant\u2019s argument to this court is that Cari is in fact included in the group of persons described as \u201cyou.\u201d In support of this interpretation, appellant points to the following phrase on the policy declarations page: \u201cChange name insured\u2014add driver No. 2, 3.\u201d Appellant argues that the fact that the policy was amended to add her two daughters as \u201coccasional operators\u201d of the covered vehicle lends credence to her interpretation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The only individual whose name appears on the policy is appellant, whose name is typed in the box on the declarations page under the words \u201cItem 1. Named Insured &amp; Mailing Address.\u201d Cari\u2019s name does not appear anywhere on the declarations page or elsewhere in the policy or the endorsements thereto. She is described by sex and birthdate under Item 6, \u201cDriver Information,\u201d on the declarations page. The phrase \u201cchange named insured\u2014add driver No. 2, 3\u201d merely reflects the addition of appellant\u2019s daughters as <em>drivers </em>of the automobile, and appellant\u2019s own name change from Naumann to Giovanna. This occurred after appellant\u2019s remarriage in September 1977, shortly before the addition of her daughters as additional drivers on the policy. This interpretation is confirmed by a letter dated April 7, 1978, to appellant from her insurance broker, Richard Greenfield, referring to the revision of the policy to reflect appellant\u2019s name change and the addition of her daughters as \u201coccasional operators.\u201d There is no basis for interpreting the phrase on which appellant relies as sweeping \u201coccasional operators\u201d such as appellant\u2019s two daughters into the category of \u201cnamed insured,\u201d and the trial court was correct in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We note, moreover, that appellant\u2019s interpretation of the subject policy is contrary to the express language of exclusion 9, which clearly eliminates coverage for <em>all </em>insureds, including occasional operators and the named insured, when the accident vehicle is not specifically covered and is owned by the spouse of the named insured. Pursuant to this exclusion, appellant\u2019s daughters would not be covered even if they were \u201cnamed insureds\u201d under appellant\u2019s strained interpretation. Appellant\u2019s argument that exclusion 10 somehow annihilates the scope of exclusion 9 is logically fallacious and contrary to pertinent California case law. <em>(McBride </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins.

J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 24, 1984, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 27, 1984.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
