In compliance with the subpoena, General Dynamics supplied a four-page document consisting of a copy of the employee\u2019s 1981 W-2 form and a copy of a three-page computer printout of the employee\u2019s wages and deductions for January to June 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Pursuant to Evidence Code section 1563, General Dynamics requested from Husband its costs of compliance with the subpoena, in the amount of $45.40, which consisted of $.40 for copying at $.10 per page, $5 for clerical time of one-half hour at $10 per hour, and $40 for \u201ccomputer costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Pursuant to section 1563, subdivision (b)(4), Husband petitioned the superior court for a reduction of the charges, contending there is no provision in the statute for recovery of computer <em>costs. </em>General Dynamics submitted its response. Both parties also requested that in the event they prevailed they be awarded their reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The trial court denied Husband\u2019s petition to reduce the fees, finding that the $40 computer charge was allowable under the statute. The court declined, however, to award attorney\u2019s fees to General Dynamics. Both Husband and General Dynamics have appealed the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">At issue is interpretation of Evidence Code section 1563, subdivision (b)(1), which provides: \u201c(b) All reasonable costs incurred in a civil proceeding by any witness which is not a party with respect to the production of all or any part of business records the production of which is requested pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum may be charged against the party serving the subpoena duces tecum, [f] (1) \u2018Reasonable costs,\u2019 as used in this section, shall mean ten cents ($.10) per page for standard reproduction of documents of a size of 8 Vi by 14 inches or less, and actual costs for reproduction of oversize documents or documents the reproduction of which require special processing, necessarily done in responding to the subpoena together with additional reasonable clerical costs incurred in locating and making the records available. The clerical costs may be billed at the rate of ten dollars ($10) per hour per person, computed on the basis of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per quarter hour or fraction thereof, and actual costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>if any, charged to the witness by a third person for retrieval and return of records held by such a third person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">General Dynamics contends that subdivision (b) constitutes a general allowance of all reasonable costs and that subsection (1) merely limits the amounts recoverable for the specific costs listed in that subsection. Husband contends that subsection (1) defines the term \u201creasonable costs\u201d used in subdivision (b) and that therefore the only costs recoverable are those which fall within the categories mentioned in subsection (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Husband\u2019s interpretation is clearly supported by the language of the statute. While subdivision (b) opens with language that \u201cAll reasonable costs\u201d incurred may be charged, subsection (1) states \u201c \u2018Reasonable costs,\u2019 <em>as used in this section, shall mean </em>. . . . \u201d (Italics added.) This is language of definition rather than limitation or qualification. It shows that subsection (1) defines the term used in subdivision (b).  The Legislature has power to prescribe legal definitions of its own language, and when an act passed by the Legislature embodies a definition it is binding on the courts. <em>(Buchwald </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 347, 354 [62 Cal.Rptr. 364].) Terms defined by the statute in which they are found will be presumed to have been used in the sense of the definition. <em>(Application of Monrovia Evening Post </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 263, 270 [248 P. 1017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">However, even assuming that the statutory language is ambiguous, we find nothing in its historical background which is persuasive of General Dynamics\u2019 interpretation. (See <em>Stockton Sav. &amp; Loan Bank </em>v. <em>Massanet </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 200, 207 [114 P.2d 592]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mel Mack Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 621, 626 [126 Cal.Rptr. 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Under prior law, there was no provision entitling a nonparty witness served with a subpoena duces tecum to be reimbursed for the expenses of complying with the subpoena. Compliance, even at considerable inconvenience and expense, was a burden of all persons subject to the court\u2019s subpoena powers. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1976) 71 F.R.D. 88, 92.) If the burden of compliance was oppressive, however, a nonparty witness could seek a protective order under Code of Civil Procedure section 2019, subdivision (b)(1), which empowered the court \u201c[To] make any other order which justice requires to protect the party or witness from annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression. In granting or refusing such order the court may impose upon either party or upon the witness the requirement to pay such costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, as the court may deem reasonable.\u201d (2 Hogan, Modern Cal. Discovery (3d ed. 1972) \u00a7 7.08, pp. 25-28; Grossman &amp; Van Alstyne, 14 Cal. Practice (1972) \u00a7 675, p. 141; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Columbia Broad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>casting System, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 666 F.2d 364, 371-372 [reviewing federal cases under the analogous rule 45(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.; witnesses sought reimbursement of $2.3 million in costs of compliance].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Since 1961, a person required to attend a deposition was entitled to receive the same witness fees and mileage as a witness subpoenaed to attend a court session. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1986.5; <em>DiNapoli </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 202, 204 [60 Cal.Rptr. 394].)  However, Evidence Code section 1563 is part of a streamlined procedure which enables a custodian of business records to supply the records without having to attend a deposition. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1560 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Until 1972 there was no provision for a fee or recovery of costs by a custodian of records who used the streamlined procedure. In that year, the Legislature amended Evidence Code section 1563 by adding that in the case of patient records, where the personal attendance of the custodian was not required, \u201cthe sole fee for complying with such subpoena is twelve dollars ($12.00).\u201d (Stats. 1972, ch. 396, \u00a7 1, p. 719; 4 Pacific L.J. 321 (1973).) The $12 amount was the same as the witness fee then provided for a witness whose personal attendance was required. (4 Pacific L.J. 321, <em>supra; </em>Stats. 1972, ch. 396, \u00a7 1, p. 719; Stats. 1970, ch. 1061, \u00a7 2, p. 1892 [Gov. Code, \u00a7 68093].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">A commentator suggested that the distinction between patient and other business records was unjustified, and that section 1563 should be amended to provide the same compensation for expenses incurred in duplication and delivery of all business records. (4 Pacific L.J., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 321-322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The Legislature did not follow this suggestion precisely but instead, in 1980, enacted former Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.4, the predecessor of the statute under consideration in this case. Former Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.4 provided \u201cAll reasonable costs incurred by a custodian of records, or other qualified witness, of a business which is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen, with respect to the production of all or any part of the records of the business pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum may be charged against the party who requested the issuance of the subpoena duces tecum. The custodian, upon demand, shall be paid costs pursuant to this section before being required to deliver the subpoenaed records. \u2018Reasonable costs\u2019 as used in this section, means actual copying costs plus any additional reasonable clerical costs incurred in locating and making the records available. Such additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>clerical costs shall be based on a computation of the time spent locating and making the records available multiplied by the employee\u2019s hourly wage.\u201d (Stats. 1980, ch. 830, \u00a7 1, p. 2607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">This approach did not eliminate the distinction between patient records, still governed by the $12 fee in former Evidence Code section 1563, subdivision (b), and other business records governed by former Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.4. In 1981 the Legislature acted to harmonize the provisions by (1) repealing Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.4; (2) reenacting those provisions, as substantially amended, in Evidence Code section 1563, subdivision (b); and (3) eliminating the $12 fee for patient records. (Stats. 1981, ch. 1014, \u00a7\u00a7 1.5, 2, p. 3913; 13 Pacific L.J. (1981) 624, 629.) The same legislation enacted the procedure for contesting the validity of the charges. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1563, subd. (b)(2) et seq.) It is this enactment, chapter 1014 of 1981, which we must construe.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">First, we note the striking similarity between former Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.4, enacted in 1980, and chapter 1014 enacted in 1981. In chapter 1014, the Legislature did not change the definitional format of the statute. Both versions open with the statement that all reasonable costs incurred may be charged against the party serving the subpoena duces tecum, but then define \u201c \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 as used in this section.\u201d  Given the fact that prior to 1980, there was no right to reimbursement of the cost of compliance with the subpoena where attendance at a deposition was not required, except a $12 fee in the case of patient records, there is nothing in the language, history or background of either the 1980 or the 1981 legislation to indicate that the Legislature intended suddenly to make <em>all </em>reasonable costs reimbursable, as distinguished from the costs specifically defined in those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The differences between the 1980 and the 1981 versions are that under the former, reasonable costs meant \u201cactual copying costs\u201d plus \u201cany additional reasonable clerical costs\u201d (computed at the particular employee\u2019s hourly wage for the time spent), whereas reasonable costs now means (1) $.10 per page for standard reproduction of documents of the size of <em>8V2 </em>by 14 inches or less; (2) actual costs for reproduction of oversized documents or documents the reproduction of which requires special processing; (3) additional reasonable clerical costs billed at the rate of $10 per hour; and (4) actual costs charged to the witness by a third person for retrieval and return of records held by such third person. The thrust of the legislative changes in 1981 was toward greater consumer protection, uniformity and simplicity of determination. The rate per page for copying and the wage per hour for clerical work are now fixed arbitrarily by the statute. These provisions indicate a concern about possible overcharging. The elaborate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>cedures in the new legislation permitting the requesting party to challenge the fees as excessive, and to recover attorney\u2019s fees if the charges are determined by the court to have been excessive and in bad faith (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1563, subd. (b)(4)) bear the earmarks of consumer protection legislation. Specifying by statute the rate to be charged for copying and clerical work also contributes to simplicity of determination and avoidance of disputes over the reasonableness of costs. General Dynamics\u2019 interpretation of the statute opens the door to burdensome involvement of the courts in disputes over the reasonableness of charges. This case is illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The record in the trial court included affidavits from four General Dynamics employees attempting to explain the basis for the $40 computer charge. These described in some detail how General Dynamics Western Data Services Division charged its Pomona Division, through an internal accounting procedure, for the use of computer time at the rate of $62 per \u201ccomputer use unit\u201d (which takes into consideration both clerical time and computer time). Requests for payroll information had over a period of time averaged a charge of between $30 and $50, and on that basis a flat fee of $40 was fixed. We note that one of th\u00e9 affidavits describes typical steps in the process of obtaining the records, many of which involve clerical work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no showing that these clerical steps were billed at the rate of $10 per hour,  The Legislature was presumably aware in 1980 and 1981 of the use of computers in modern businesses, but did not specifically mention computer use in the statute. The Legislature may well have been unprepared in 1981 to fix a statutory price for computer use, as it had for copying and clerical costs, and unwilling to allow \u201cactual computer costs,\u201d as it had for copying oversized documents, in light of the difficulty of determining an appropriate charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Finally, General Dynamics seeks support for its interpretation in the legislative counsel\u2019s digest to chapter 1014, which states in pertinent part \u201cThis bill would . . . provide that all reasonable costs of a witness which is not a party with respect to a subpoena duces tecum of business records may be charged against the party serving the subpoena. It would limit copying costs to $.10 per page for standard documents, and actual costs for oversized documents plus clerical costs as specified.\u201d (1981 Summary Digest, pp. 320-321.)  Although a legislative counsel\u2019s digest may be helpful in interpreting an ambiguous statute, it is not the law. Where the digest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>conflicts with the unambiguous language of the statute, or the clear intent of the legislation as shown by its background and history, the digest is not controlling. <em>(California Teachers' Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 606, 614 [193 Cal.Rptr. 650]; <em>Travelers Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Sierra Pacific Airlines </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1144, 1151 [197 Cal.Rptr. 416].) General Dynamics\u2019 argument is, in any event, unpersuasive in light of the fact that the legislative counsel also stated in 1980 that the bill which enacted the predecessor statute, former Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.4, \u201cwould define reasonable costs.\u201d (1980 Summary Digest, p. 240.) In 1981, the Legislature retained the basic definitional format of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Thus, we conclude the trial court erred in holding that Evidence Code section 1563, subdivision (b) allows a nonparty witness to recover all reasonable costs of compliance with a subpoena duces tecum in addition to those costs specified in subsection (1) thereof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We next consider whether, in the alternative, the computer costs charged by General Dynamics fall within any of the specific definitions of subsection (1) of section 1563, subdivision (b). First, General Dynamics argued to the trial court that a computer printout is a \u201cdocumento the reproduction of which require[s] special processing\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Such contention is without merit because the legislative history shows that this clause deals solely with copying costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In the form in which it was presented, General Dynamics\u2019 computer charge may not reasonably be construed as a \u201cclerical\u201d cost within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>meaning of the statute. Subsection (1) obviously contemplates a human clerical cost, billed at a rate of $10 per hour \u201cper person.\u201d As noted, apparently many of the steps involved in the computer process were clerical, but General Dynamics did not keep track of the time spent by clerks performing those functions on Husband\u2019s subpoena, nor show that the time was billed at the statutory rate of $10 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Finally, General Dynamics strenuously contended that the computer cost was an \u201cactual cost[] . . . charged to the witness by a third person for retrieval and return of records held by such a third person\u201d as specified in the statute. It contended that General Dynamics Data Services Division, Western Data Center Group (San Diego) should be considered a \u201cthird person\u201d in relation to General Dynamics\u2019 Pomona Division, which received the subpoena. It submitted an affidavit of an accounting supervisor showing that the Data Services Division regularly charged the Pomona Division $62 per computer use unit, which represented Data Services Division\u2019s actual cost without profit, and that the charge was handled through interdivisional invoices and resulted in a transfer from the Pomona Division\u2019s clearing account in General Dynamics\u2019 corporate office in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">A corporation is a person. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 17.) There is no suggestion that the Data Services Division is separately incorporated. A \u201cdivision\u201d of a corporation is a unit within the corporation and has no status as a separate \u201cperson\u201d in the eyes of the law. <em>(Automatic Canteen Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Agriculture </em>(1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 18, 22-23 [55 Cal.Rptr. 857]; 64 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 640, 646-647 and fn. 7 (1981).) Moreover, the purposes of the legislation would better be served if \u201cthird person\u201d were interpreted to mean a separate person in the business of record storage and retrieval. The reasonableness of the cost charged by such a person would presumably be established by the competitive market. In addition, the actual cost charged is easily proved by the invoice submitted to the witness by the storage company. The Legislature might believe that no such assurance of reasonableness nor simplicity of proof could be achieved by interdivisional accounting within a single corporation. Some corporations might have fair accounting procedures, and others might not. Moreover, the consumer (requesting party) would be at an unfair disadvantage because the corporate records custodian has employees familiar with internal accounting procedures, of which the requesting party has no knowledge. The cost of expert advice to challenge the interdivisional accounting would exceed the charge being contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">We conclude, therefore, that neither under the language of subdivision (b) of Evidence Code section 1563, nor the specific language of its subsection (1), was General Dynamics entitled to compensation for the $40 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>puter costs charged by it. The trial court should have ordered General Dynamics to reduce its charge by $40. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1563, subd. (b)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Husband also requests that his expenses and attorney\u2019s fees in litigating this matter be awarded against General Dynamics. Evidence Code section 1563, subdivision (b)(4) provides, in pertinent part, \u201cIn the event that the court finds the costs excessive and charged in bad faith by the witness, the court shall order the witness to remit the full amount of the costs demanded and collected, or excuse the requesting party from any payment of costs charged but not collected, and the court shall also order the witness to pay the requesting party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Under the statute, an award of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees against the witness requires a finding that the charges were excessive and \u201cin bad faith.\u201d We find no basis in the record for attributing bad faith to General Dynamics. As the trial court noted, the statute and its predecessor were new and there was no case law interpreting them. (See also 13 Pacific L.J., <em>supra, </em>625, 629, 630, fn. 9.) Husband is not entitled under the statute to an award against General Dynamics of his attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The order is reversed and the trial court is directed to enter an order pursuant to Evidence Code section 1563, subdivision (b)(4), reducing the charge by $40.
