It is also a member of an international consortium which owns and operates commercial satellites orbiting in outer space. As a member of the consortium, Comsat owns an interest in the satellites and receives income from their use. It also derives income from transmitting telecommunications signals to the satellites, and receiving signals from them, at an \u201cearth station\u201d located in California and similar facilities elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Defendant and appellant Franchise Tax Board (the Board) assessed certain corporate income taxes against Comsat pursuant to a special formula which resulted in an apportionment of its total income, to California, on the bases of factors which included the value of the satellites and income received by Comsat from their use. Comsat paid the taxes and commenced this action against the Board to recover them, challenging the validity of the special formula. After a nonjury trial on stipulated facts and other evidence, the court found in favor of Comsat and entered a judgment ordering refund of the disputed taxes plus interest. The Board appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\n<em>The Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Comsat commenced the action by filing a \u201cComplaint For Refund Of Income Taxes\u201d in which it alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">Comsat is a corporation \u201cduly organized and existing\u201d pursuant to the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, et seq.) and the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act. Its principal place of business is located in Washington, D.C. Comsat returned and paid California income taxes to the Board for the calendar years 1970, 1971, and 1972. In May of 1975, the Board notified Comsat that it \u201cproposed to reassess additional income taxes\u201d for these years. Comsat \u201cprotested the proposed reassessments,\u201d but the Board \u201caffirmed the proposed assessments in full and denied . . . [Comsat\u2019s] protest.\u201d Comsat paid \u201cthe additional amounts\u201d and \u201cadditional interest,\u201d and filed timely claims for refunds. The claims were \u201cdisallowed\u201d by the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Comsat further alleged: \u201cThe income taxes assessed . . . and the interest paid thereon, were illegally, erroneously and arbitrarily determined, assessed and collected . . . , without factual basis for such determination, assessment and collection,\u201d and that they were \u201cvoid\u201d on specified grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In the prayer of the complaint, Comsat requested \u201crefund\u201d of the additional income taxes paid for the years 1970, 1971, and 1972, \u201cplus all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>interest paid thereon . . interest \u201con the said amounts of tax and interest paid . . . from the date of said payments[] to the date of refund\u201d; and general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The Board filed an answer in which it generally denied the allegations made in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\n<em>The Stipulated Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">After the issues had been joined on the pleadings, the parties filed a written \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d executed by their respective attorneys. This document, and the facts stipulated in it, may be summarized and quoted as follows (paragraphing ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201cComsat is the United States participant in the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (\u2018Intelsat\u2019), an international joint venture which operates the [szc] global commercial communications satellite system. The joint venture consisted of 83 member countries as of December 31, 1972. Intelsat was established in 1964 by an intergovernmental agreement known as the Agreement ... for a Global Communications Satellite System, which was signed by the United States Government and other governments. Comsat was designated by the President of the United States as the United States signatory to a companion agreement known as the Special Agreement, which governed the operation of Intelsat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cThe function of the Intelsat system is to relay telecommunications between countries throughout the world. Telecommunications relayed through the . . . system include \u2018voice\u2019 (telephone) traffic, \u2018record\u2019 traffic of various types (telegraph, telex, facsimile, photogram and data)[,] and television.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The Intelsat system consists of a \u201cspace segment\u201d and a \u201cground segment.\u201d The assets in the space segment \u201care owned in undivided shares by members of Intelsat, including Comsat, in varying percentages.\u201d In 1970, 1971, and 1972, Comsat\u2019s \u201cpercentage ownership interest\u201d in these assets was \u201capproximately 52.5 percent.\u201d Comsat \u201cserves as manager\u201d of \u201call facilities\u201d in the space segment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The assets in the space segment consist of (1) \u201ccommunications satellites\u201d orbiting in outer space and (2) four \u201ctracking, telemetry[,] and command stations\u201d from which the satellites are \u201cmonitored and controlled.\u201d The four tracking stations are located in Maine, Italy, Australia, and Hawaii. The satellites are launched into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Each satellite is \u201clocated in outer space in a \u2018synchronous\u2019 orbit 22,300 miles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>over a fixed point on the Equator. A \u2018synchronous\u2019 orbit is one in which the orbital speed of the satellite is synchronized with the speed of the earth\u2019s rotation so that the satellite appears to remain stationary over a fixed point on earth.. Intelsat satellites are positioned over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They never pass over California, even during launch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u201cA communications satellite performs a function similar to an ordinary microwave tower; it receives and transmits signals carrying telecommunications. The principal difference is that microwave towers must be spaced within a few miles of each other because of the curvature of the earth and because the signals travel in a straight line, while a satellite, being 22,300 miles in space, can receive and transmit signals across thousands of miles of the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The \u201cground segment\u201d of the Intelsat system consists of \u201cearth stations in various countries owned by entities in the respective countries. Earth stations have large antennas with supporting electronic equipment. They transmit signals to, and receive signals from, the satellites. . . . Comsat has a 50 percent ownership interest in seven United States earth stations in the Intelsat system.\u201d One of these seven stations (the California earth station) is at Jamesburg, in Monterey County, California, where it was located because of favorable atmospheric and related conditions. The other six earth stations are at Brewster, Washington, and in Maine, West Virginia, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Guam. Comsat also owns \u201ca 100 percent interest\u201d in an eighth earth station located at Talkeenta, Alaska. \u201cAll of these earth stations became operational before 1970 (with the exception of the Talkeenta station, which did not become operational until July 1970) and remained in operation throughout 1970, 1971[,] and 1972.\u201d Comsat \u201cserves as manager\u201d of all of these earth stations except for the one in Guam.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u201cIn addition to the California earth station, Comsat maintains a small engineering office\u201d in Los Angeles County. Intelsat has no property or employees in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\u201cComsat\u2019s revenues are generated primarily from the leasing of \u2018half circuits\u2019 ... to United States international communications common carriers .... A \u2018half circuit\u2019 is a two-way communications channel between an Intelsat satellite and an earth station. This channel, when combined with a similar channel (another half circuit) between the satellite and another earth station, permits the establishment of a whole satellite circuit capable of carrying telecommunications between the two earth stations. In order to be able to lease half circuits to the carriers. Comsat leases from Intelsat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>capacity in the Intelsat satellites and pays \u2018use charges\u2019 to Intelsat for such capacity.\u201d All of Intelsat\u2019s revenues are generated by \u201cuse charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u201cComsat is not involved in transmitting telecommunications between the California earth station [at Jamesburg] and other points in California and does not receive any income from such transmission. Comsat\u2019s activities at the California earth station are concerned only with the leasing of half circuits between the California earth station and Intelsat satellites. The California earth station communicates with Intelsat satellites operating in the Pacific Ocean region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cThe California earth station operates as follows: (1) A communications signal destined for a foreign country or an offshore United States point is received at the California earth station from its place of origin in the United States through terrestrial facilities (telephone lines, microwave relay systems, etc.) owned and operated by communications carriers other than Com-sat. (2) The earth station transmits the signal to an Intelsat satellite in orbit, which in turn transmits it to an earth station in a foreign country or an offshore United States point. (3) Likewise, communications from foreign countries and offshore United States points are received via satellite by the California earth station and are then transmitted to their point of destination in the United States through terrestrial facilities owned and operated by communications common carriers other than Comsat. The telecommunications transmitted by the California earth station originate at, and the telecommunications received by the California earth station terminate at, locations all over the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The rates charged by Comsat for half circuits are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission \u201caccording to the traditional \u2018rate base\u2019 method of regulation. Under this method, Comsat is permitted to make charges designed, but not guaranteed, to generate revenues sufficient to cover its operating expenses (including taxes and depreciation) and provide a fair return on its rate base. The \u2018rate base\u2019 consists chiefly of the investment in property devoted to the regulated business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In addition to the revenues it derives from leasing half circuits, Comsat receives 52.5 percent of Intelsat\u2019s gross revenues by reason of its (Com-sat\u2019s) 52.5 percent ownership interest in the assets in Intelsat\u2019s space segment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">As of December 31, 1970, Comsat had leased to its customers 2,139 half circuits, of which 405 were between the California earth station and Intelsat satellites (\u201cCalifomiahalf circuits\u201d). The \u201coriginal cost\u201d of Comsat\u2019s interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>in the eight U.S. earth stations during 1970 was $43,492,000, of which $3,835,846 (8.8197 percent) was attributable to the Jamesburg station. The \u201coriginal cost\u201d of Comsat\u2019s interest in the Intelsat satellites in orbit as of December 31, 1970, was $65,893,307.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">As of December 31, 1971, Comsat had leased to its customers 2,537 half circuits, of which 468 were California half circuits. The \u201coriginal cost\u201d of Comsat\u2019s interest in the earth stations during 1971 was $43,810,000, of which $3,933,460 (8.9785 percent) was attributable to the Jamesburg station. The \u201coriginal cost\u201d of Comsat\u2019s interest in the Intelsat satellites in orbit as of December 31, 1971, was $88,355,540.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As of December 31, 1972, Comsat had leased to its customers 2,971 half circuits, of which 490 were California half circuits. The \u201coriginal cost\u201d of Comsat\u2019s interest in the eight earth stations during 1972 was $47,477,000, of which $4,114,449 (8.6662 percent) was attributable to the Jamesburg station. The \u201coriginal cost\u201d of Comsat\u2019s interest in the Intelsat satellites in orbit as of December 31, 1972, was $132,006,758.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u201cIn 1970, 1971[,] and 1972, Comsat derived its income from sources both within and without California, and therefore was subject to the apportionment provisions of section 25101 et seq. of the Revenue and Taxation Code</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\n<em>The Law Involved</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">As will appear, the issue on this appeal requires identification of the apportionment formula which should be used to determine the corporate income tax owed and payable by Comsat for each of the years in dispute. In the passage last quoted from the stipulation of facts, the parties agreed that the propriety of the formula is controlled by the Uniform Division of Income for Taxation Purposes Act (hereinafter the Uniform Act), which appears in the Revenue and Taxation Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A discussion of the Uniform Act will be interpolated at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The Uniform Act was proposed in 1957 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It was intended to promote uniformity in allocation practices among the states which impose taxes either on, or measured by, the incomes of corporations. (See Keesling &amp; Warren, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>California's Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act </em>(1967) 15 UCLA L.Rev. 156.) The Uniform Act was enacted into California law in 1966. (Stats. 1966, ch. 2, \u00a7 7, p. 177.) It has also been adopted by at least 23 other states. (See Table, 62 West's Ann. Rev. &amp; Tax Code (1984 pocket supp.) p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The pertinent provisions of the Uniform Act may be summarized as follows: Any taxpayer who receives income from business activity inside <em>and </em>outside the state must \u201capportion\u201d its net business income to the state. (\u00a7 25121.) The taxpayer\u2019s total net business income is apportioned to California by multiplying the total by a fraction, of which (1) the numerator is the sum of the \u201cproperty factor,\u201d the \u201cpayroll factor,\u201d and the \u201csales factor,\u201d and (2) the denominator is \u201cthree.\u201d (\u00a7 25128.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Each of the three \u201cfactors\u201d mentioned is itself a fraction which is defined by a provision in the Uniform Act. The numerator of the property factor fraction is the \u201caverage value of the taxpayer\u2019s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the income year.\u201d The denominator is the \u201caverage value of [all] the taxpayer\u2019s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used . . . during the income year.\u201d (\u00a7 25129; see also \u00a7\u00a7 25130, 25131.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The numerator of the payroll factor fraction is the \u201ctotal\u201d compensation paid by the taxpayer in this state during the income year. The denominator is the \u201ctotal compensation paid everywhere during the income year.\u201d (\u00a7 25132.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The numerator of the sales factor fraction is the sum of \u201cthe total sales of the taxpayer\u201d in this state during the income year. The denominator is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the sum of the taxpayer\u2019s total sales \u201ceverywhere\u201d during the income year. (\u00a7 25134.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Uniform Act also provides that the taxpayer may request, or the Board may require, variation from the standard formula if it does \u201cnot fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity\u201d in California; and that the variation may, \u201cif reasonable,\u201d consist of the \u201cexclusion of any one or more\u201d of the three factors described above, or the \u201cinclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state,\u201d or the \u201cemployment of any other method which will effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\u2019s income\u201d to California.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>Comsat\u2019s Apportionment Formula</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We return to the stipulation of facts. In 1970, 1971, and 1972, pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Act described above, Comsat \u201capportioned its net income to California by use of a three-factor formula based on property, payroll, and sales.\u201d We now find it necessary to describe Comsat\u2019s calculations (and later the Board\u2019s) with the complicated details shown in the stipulation. We depart from the parties\u2019 exact language on occasion, but not from the essential facts to which they stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\n<em>Comsat\u2019s Calculation of Its Property Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">In pertinent part, the stipulation continues as follows: \u201cIn each of the income years in question, Comsat computed the property factor according to the fraction prescribed by section 25129 . . . .\u201d (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>The numerator of Comsat\u2019s fraction for each year was the value, in the particular year, of Comsat\u2019s interest in real and tangible personal property in Califor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>nia (i.e., the California earth station at Jamesburg and the office in Los Angeles County). Comsat thus excluded from its numerator (i.e., from the value of its California property) any value representing its interest in the Intelsat satellites. Its denominator was the value, in the particular year, of its interest in all real and tangible personal property everywhere, \u201cincluding its undivided [52.5%] interest in the Intelsat satellites. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The property factor Comsat calculated from this fraction for 1970, expressed as a percentage, was 2.8296 percent. In fraction format, with translations to the real dollar figures Comsat used for 1970, its calculation of the property factor may be shown as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Comsat made similar calculations for each of the other years in question. The property factors it produced were 2.5464 percent for 1971 and 2.2114 percent for 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">\n<em>Comsat\u2019s Calculation of Its Payroll Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">We here quote the stipulation of facts as follows: \u201cIn each of the years in question, Comsat computed the payroll factor according to the fraction prescribed by section 25132 . . . . [See fn. 4, ante.] The numerator consisted of Comsat\u2019s payroll in California and the denominator consisted of its payroll everywhere. . . . The payroll factors thus computed by Comsat, expressed as percentages, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6u9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>Comsat\u2019s Calculation of Its Sales Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Comsat calculated its sales factor for each of the years in question by using a fraction in the format prescribed by section 25134. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>The numerator of the fraction used in each year was a figure which Comsat called \u201cCalifornia earth station revenue\u201d and which excluded any part of the revenue Comsat had received from Intelsat, in that year, by reason of its (Comsat\u2019s) interest in the satellites. Comsat limited its \u201cCalifornia earth station revenue\u201d (i.e., its numerator) to a so-called \u201cground percentage\u201d of the revenue it had received from leasing half circuits at its California earth station in the particular year. It calculated the \u201cground percentage\u201d by dividing (1) the \u201cnet book value\u201d of the real and tangible personal property at the eight earth stations in the year by (2) the \u201cnet book value\u201d of all its real and tangible personal property everywhere in the year, including its interest in the satellites. Its calculation of the \u201cground percentage\u201d in each year may be shown in fraction format as follows (we here quote the stipulation of facts in pertinent part):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Comsat next applied the \u201cground percentage\u201d to the dollar amount of revenue it had received from leasing half circuits at the California earth station in the particular year. It had separately compiled this dollar amount for 1972, but not for 1970 and 1971. It accordingly calculated the amount for 1970 and 1971, and the numerator (California earth station revenue) for each year, by using this two-step formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">As previously stated, Comsat had compiled a figure representing the revenue attributable to its leasing of half circuits at the California earth station in 1972. It accordingly calculated its \u201cCalifornia earth station revenue\u201d for that year (i.e., the numerator of its sales factor fraction for 1972) by applying its 1972 \u201cground percentage\u201d to the figure, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-27\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">According to the stipulation of facts as pertinent here, the denominator of Comsat\u2019s sales factor fraction for each of the three years was its total revenue: i.e., the sum of the revenue it had received \u201cfrom leasing half circuits\u201d at all the earth stations and its \u201cshare of Intelsat revenue\u201d in the particular year. Applying the fraction for each year, Comsat calculated its sales factors as 4.4214 percent for 1970, 3.0098 percent for 1971, and 3.0039 percent for 1972.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-32\">\n<em>Comsat\u2019s Apportionment Factor and Further Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">Having calculated its property, payroll, and sales factors for each of the three years as described, Comsat added the three percentage figures for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>year, and divided their sum by three, as prescribed by section 25128. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>It thereby produced averaged percentages of its \u201cbusiness income . . . apportioned to this state\u201d (see <em>ibid.) </em>which it showed on its corporate income tax returns as 4.1900 percent for 1970, 3.7369 percent for 1971, and 3.4819 percent for 1972. Its California income tax for each year was computed and paid accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In 1974 and 1975, the Board notified Comsat that it (the Board) \u201cproposed adjustments\u201d for 1970, 1971, and 1972 on the basis that it had \u201crevised\u201d some of the factors Comsat had calculated. The Board\u2019s \u201crevised\u201d factors are described next.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Property Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In calculating Comsat\u2019s property factor for each of the three years, the Board also used a fraction in the format prescribed by section 25129 (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>but with a numerator greater than Comsat\u2019s. The Board enhanced Comsat\u2019s numerator by adding to it (i.e., adding to the value of its California property) a fraction of the value of Comsat\u2019s interest in the satellites in the particular year. The fraction used by the Board for this purpose was calculated as (1) the value (original cost averaged for the year pursuant to sections 25130 and 25131) of Comsat\u2019s interest in real and tangible personal property on the ground in California (i.e., of its interest in the earth station at Jamesburg and the office in Los Angeles County) divided by (2) the value (similarly averaged) of its interest in real and tangible personal property on the ground everywhere (i.e., excluding the value of Comsat\u2019s interest in the satellites).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Application of this fraction to the value of Comsat\u2019s interest in the satellites during the particular year (again, their original cost averaged for the year pursuant to sections 25130 and 25131) produced a result which the Board called \u201cValue of satellites to be apportioned to California.\u201d The numerator of the Board\u2019s property factor fraction was the sum of this value and the value of Comsat\u2019s interest in property on the ground in California (No. 1 above). The Board used the same denominator Comsat had used: i.e., the value, similarly averaged for the year, of Comsat\u2019s interest in all real and tangible personal property everywhere during the year, including the satellites.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Working out this fraction for 1970, the Board calculated a property factor of 4.9187 percent. The calculation may be shown in fraction format, with its elements designated for reference, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">With the real dollar figures used by the Board for 1970, its property factor fraction for that year may be shown as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">Similar calculations by the Board produced property factors of 4.8429 percent for 1971 and 4.8280 percent for 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Payroll Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-21\">The payroll factors Comsat had calculated for 1970, 1971, and 1972 were accepted by the Board without dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Sales Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">In calculating Comsat\u2019s sales factors for 1970, 1971, and 1972, the Board also used a fraction in the format prescribed by section 25134. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>With some editorial interpolations by this court, the Board\u2019s fraction is partly described in the stipulation of facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-24\">\u201cFor each of the years in question, the Board determined that. . . [Com-sat\u2019s] . . . sales attributable to California (the numerator of the fraction used [by the Board] for the sales factor) consisted of a portion of Comsat\u2019s revenue from Intelsat and a portion of its revenue from . . . [the leasing of half circuits everywhere] .... The denominator consisted of [Comsat\u2019s] total revenue\u201d from the two sources described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201cThe formula used by the Board in determining the portion of Comsat\u2019s revenue from Intelsat and the portion of its revenue from . . . [the leasing of half circuits everywhere] ... to be included in the numerator of the sales factor was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cBasing said computation on information then available to it, the Board determined that the sales factor for each of the years in question, expressed as a percentage, was 16.4154 [%].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The stipulation thus describes the Board\u2019s sales factor fraction and the result it yielded, but without illustration. Translating some of the stipulation\u2019s nomenclature for clarity, and designating the elements of the fraction the Board used for the year 1972 only (see fit. 9, <em>ante), </em>we reconstruct the full fraction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-16\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\n<em>The Board\u2019s Apportionment Factor and Further Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Adding its property and sales factors to Comsat\u2019s undisputed payroll factor for each year and dividing the sum by three, pursuant to section 25128 (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>the Board calculated percentage figures apportioning Com-sat\u2019s income to California at 8.9444 percent for 1970, 8.9709 percent for 1971, and 8.8246 percent for 1972.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Board thereupon notified Comsat that it \u201cproposed to assess additional income taxes\u201d for those years in specified amounts based on the Board\u2019s revised apportionment formula. Comsat \u201cprotested the proposed assessments.\u201d The Board denied the protest and gave formal notice of its assessment of the additional income taxes. Comsat paid them and filed claims for refunds, which were also denied. Comsat thereupon commenced this action.

Los Angeles engineering office, but did not include any of the cost of its interest in the Intelsat satellites, which clearly are not property used in any stretch of the imagination in California.\u201d The \u201cproperty factor as derived by Comsat fairly represents the extent of Comsat\u2019s business activity related to property in California during the years in question.\u201d As to the sales factor, Utley testified that Comsat\u2019s figures \u201cfairly represent the extent of Comsat\u2019s business activity related to sales in California during the years in question,\u201d and that the figures \u201cmay be slightly overstated\u201d because \u201cthere is no market of Comsat [sic] in California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Utley also testified to his opinions that the Board\u2019s calculation of the property factors was \u201cunreasonable\u201d; that it did not \u201crepresent the extent of Comsat\u2019s business activity in California\u201d; and that it did not \u201cresult in an equitable allocation of income related to property.\u201d He expressed essentially the same opinion as to the sales factors computed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">A. J. Stotler, the manager of the earth station at Jamesburg, testified that there is \u201cno reason\u201d why Comsat has to have an earth station in California.

This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">The Board contends that this court is not bound by the findings of fact made by the trial court because \u201cthis case involves the application of a statute to uncontradicted facts.\u201d This argument must be sustained. The application of a taxing statute to uncontradicted facts is a question of law, and this court is accordingly not bound to accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact made from the uncontradicted facts shown in the parties\u2019 stipulation and the documentary evidence. (See <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 652, 659, fn. 8 [102 Cal.Rptr. 766, 498 P.2d 1014]; <em>Anaconda Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 15, 23 [181 Cal.Rptr. 640]; <em>Peninsula Covenant Church </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 382, 391 [156 Cal.Rptr. 431]; <em>Chase Brass &amp; Copper Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 496, 502 [95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 805]; <em>Standard Register Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 125, 129-130 [66 Cal.Rptr. 803].)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Comsat argues that Utley\u2019s testimony supports the trial court\u2019s findings that the results of Comsat\u2019s calculations fairly represented its business activity in California, and that the findings must therefore be sustained on appeal pursuant to the substantial evidence rule. We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In the first place, the validity of Comsat\u2019s calculations depends on resolution of the legal question whether the income it received from the use of the satellites was subject to taxation by the State of California. The trial court\u2019s determination of this question is a conclusion of law, not a finding of fact, and it is not binding on this court. <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 278, 284-285 [332 P.2d 281]; <em>Pac. Pipeline Const. Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equal. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 729, 736 [321 P.2d 729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Moreover, Utley\u2019s testimony was essentially to the effects that the results of Comsat\u2019-s calculations \u201cfairly represent Comsat\u2019s business activity in California\u201d and that the Board\u2019s results did not. This testimony reflects his views on questions of law based on his interpretation of provisions of the Uniform Act. An expert witness may not properly testify on questions of law or the interpretation of a statute. (See <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 650, 664 [136 Cal.Rptr. 203]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clay </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 87, 98 [38 Cal.Rptr. 431, 100 A.L.R.2d 1421].) Utley\u2019s testimony in these respects was received over a timely objection made on the appropriate ground. (See fn. 11, <em>ante.) </em>The testimony, and the trial court\u2019s findings based on it, are therefore not binding on this court. (See <em>Standard Register Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 125 at pp. 129-130; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 256, pp. 4247-4248.) We proceed with an independent review of the uncontradicted evidence shown in the stipulated facts and the documents introduced at the trial. (See <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 652 at p. 659, fn. 8; <em>Peninsula Covenant Church </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d 382 at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The parties expressly stipulated that when the Board recalculated Comsat\u2019s property and sales factors it \u201crelie[d] on the authority granted it by section 25137. \u201d That statute provides in effect that the Board may deviate from the \u201callocation and apportionment provisions\u201d of the Uniform Act if their application produces results which do \u201cnot fairly represent the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state\u201d; and that the deviation, \u201cif reasonable,\u201d may consist of \u201c(d) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\u2019s income\u201d to California. (See \u00a7 25137 as quoted in fn. 6, ante.) In the first instance, therefore, the Board was warranted in recalculating the property and sales factors if the results of their computation by Comsat, pursuant to sections 25129 and 25134, did not \u201cfairly represent\u201d Comsat\u2019s \u201cbusiness activity in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We have seen that Comsat produced a property factor for each year in the fraction format prescribed by section 25129. The denominator of Com-sat\u2019s property factor fraction was the total value of its real and tangible personal property everywhere, as section 25129 prescribes. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>In its numerator, however, Comsat did not include any value assigned to the satellites orbiting in outer space. Section 25129 provides in pertinent part that the numerator of the property factor fraction shall include the \u201cvalue of the taxpayer\u2019s real and tangible personal property owned . . . and used in this state during the income year.\u201d (See <em>ibid.) </em>Comsat\u2019s exclusion of a satellite value from its numerator obviously rested on the premise that the satellites are not <em>located </em>\u201cin this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The pertinent language of section 25129 defining the numerator of the property fraction refers to property \u201cowned\u201d and \u201cused\u201d in this state, not to property \u201clocated\u201d here. Moreover, the satellites are not located in California but the Jamesburg earth station is. Because it is, Comsat is conducting \u201cbusiness activity\u201d and generating income in California. There is an invisible, but apparently continuous and very real, connection between the earth station and the satellites. The earth station has a value only because this connection exists, and it is otherwise of no value. Without the connection, the satellites function in outer space to no purpose involving this state. With it, they function in California. The ascription of a \u201cfunction in California\u201d to the satellites is a recognition of the realities of telecommunications and space technology, not an indulgence in fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Because Comsat owns an interest in the satellites, and because they function in California at and through the Jamesburg earth station, we conclude that they are \u201ctangible personal property owned . . . and used in this state,\u201d by Comsat, within the meaning of section 25129. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Com-sat\u2019s exclusion of their value from the numerators of its property factor fractions therefore produced results which, for purposes of the factor, did not \u201cfairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state\u201d within the meaning of section 25137. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>This being so, the statute authorized the Board to recalculate Comsat\u2019s property factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>by using \u201cany other method\u201d which was \u201creasonable\u201d and would \u201ceffectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\u2019s income\u201d to California. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Board\u2019s method also involved the use of a fraction format, which was \u201creasonable\u201d because it was permitted\u2014but not required\u2014by section 25137, subdivision (d). The Board used a numerator which included a value assigned to the satellites. This was done on the theory that the satellites were \u201ctangible personal property owned . . . and used in this state,\u201d as we have just concluded. For purposes of the numerator, the Board fixed their value as a fraction of their total value based on the ratio between (1) the value of Comsat\u2019s real and tangible personal property at the two locations and (2) the total value of its real and tangible personal property everywhere except for the satellites. This step was taken on the theory that the same California-versus-everywhere ratio should be applied in fixing the value of Comsat\u2019s interest in the satellites for purposes of the numerator. The two theories described, and their successive applications in the Board\u2019s numerator, were \u201creasonable. \u201d The Board completed its property factor fraction by adding the value of Comsat\u2019s other California property to the numerator and using the total value of its property everywhere as the denominator. Each of these steps was \u201creasonable\u201d because it was consistent with section 25129. (See fti. 3, ante.) The overall property factor fraction was \u201creasonable\u201d as the sum of its parts. The Board\u2019s consequent property factor for each year, expressed as a percentage, was accordingly authorized by law and valid in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Comsat also calculated its sales factor for each year in the fraction format prescribed by section 25134 (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>but it used a numerator which (1) was limited to a so-called \u201cground percentage\u201d of the revenue Comsat received from leasing half circuits at the California earth station in the year and which (2) excluded any part of the revenue Comsat received from Intelsat in that year by reason it its (Comsat\u2019s) interest in the satellites. For purposes of the section 25134 numerator, and as pertinent here, the Uniform Act defines the term \u201csales\u201d as the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cgross receipts\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (e)) and the term \u201csales of the taxpayer in this state\u201d with reference to the location of the \u201cincome-producing activity\u201d in California or its location as between California and \u201cany other state.\u201d (\u00a7 25136.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Comsat apparently calculated its \u201csales\u201d as \u201csales in this state,\u201d only, on the theory that the pertinent \u201cincome-producing activity\u201d was conducted at the California earth station only; and applied a \u201cground percentage\u201d to it to exclude any part of the \u201csales in this state\u201d which were attributable to the satellites (as distinguished from the earth station itself). The latter step involved a subformula which was not expressly authorized by section 25129. Even if use of the subformula was permissible, it had the effect of omitting from Comsat\u2019s \u201csales in this state\u201d any California half circuit revenue attributable to the use of the satellites. This exclusion, and the parallel omission of any part of the revenue Comsat received from Intelsat by reason of its (Comsat\u2019s) interest in the satellites, turned up a numerator which was substantially less than the sum of its actual \u201csales in this state\u201d for purposes of 25134.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The denominator of Comsat\u2019s sales factor fraction comported with section 25134 because it was the total of Comsat\u2019s \u201csales\u201d everywhere i.e., its \u201cgross receipts\u201d from the leasing of half circuits everywhere and its share of satellite revenue received from Intelsat. Because of the diminished numerator, however, the fraction produced a percentage result which, for purposes of the sales factor, did \u201cnot fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state\u201d within the meaning of section 25137. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>Again, the Board was authorized by section 25137, subdivision (d), to recalculate the sales factors by employing \u201cany other method\u201d which was \u201creasonable\u201d and would \u201ceffectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment\u201d of Comsat\u2019s income to California. (See ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The sum, however, was properly the denominator of the sales factor fraction\u2014as both parties used it\u2014because it represented Comsat\u2019s \u201csales\u201d everywhere. As a numerator reducing it to Comsat\u2019s \u201csales in this state\u201d only, the Board used a fraction of the sum based on the ratio between the number of half circuits Comsat leased at the California earth station and the number of half circuits it leased everywhere. Stated another way, the Board\u2019s numerator represented a calculation of Comsat\u2019s \u201csales in this state,\u201d from its \u201csales\u201d everywhere, in the same proportion its telecommunications traffic at the California earth station bore to its telecommunications traffic everywhere. The calculation was \u201creasonable\u201d because it fairly apportioned Comsat\u2019s \u201csales\u201d to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The Board\u2019s numerator included part of the revenue Comsat had derived from leasing half circuits. That part was properly characterized as Comsat\u2019s \u201csales in this state\u201d because the \u201cincome-producing activity\u201d which generated it was the leasing of half circuits at the California earth station: i.e., the activity was \u201cperformed in this state\u201d within the meaning of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>25136, subdivision (a). (See fn. 12, <em>ante.) </em>The balance of the numerator was part of the satellite revenue Comsat received from Intelsat. The \u201cincome-producing activity\u201d which generated that revenue was the operation of the satellites themselves. Because they actually \u201cfunction\u201d at the California earth station (as we have seen), their \u201cincome-producing activity\u201d is also \u201cperformed in this state\u201d within the meaning of section 25136, subdivision (a). For that reason, the part of Comsat\u2019s \u201csales\u201d representing revenue from their use was properly characterized as its \u201csales in this state\u201d within the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The calculation of the Board\u2019s numerator was thus \u201creasonable\u201d because it applied the concept of \u201csales in this state\u201d which is provided in section 25134 (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>and because it did this on a reasonable basis of apportionment. The Board\u2019s use of Comsat\u2019s \u201csales\u201d everywhere as the denominator was \u201creasonable\u201d because it was also consistent with section 25134. (See <em>ibid.) </em>As we concluded with regard to the Board\u2019s property factor, its sales factor fraction was \u201creasonable\u201d as the sum of its parts. The Board\u2019s consequent sales factor, expressed as a percentage, was accordingly authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We here reach the fact that the Board calculated the sales factor at 16.4154 percent for each of the three years in question. (See fn. 9, <em>ante.) </em>Comsat complains of this on the appeal, contending in effect that the results are necessarily inaccurate because the figures used in the calculation (Com-sat\u2019s total revenue, the number of half circuits it leased, and the number of half circuits it leased everywhere) differed from year to year.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The parties stipulated that the Board\u2019s calculation of the 16.4154 percent sales factor for each year was \u201c[b]ased on information then available to it . . . .\u201d (See fn. 9 and the accompanying text <em>ante.) </em>This passage is not explained in the stipulation, but it fairly appears that the half circuit numbers \u201cthen available\u201d to the Board were for 1972 only; that it computed the 1972 sales factor with those numbers and Comsat\u2019s total revenue for 1972 (see fn. 8); that the result was a 1972 sales factor of 16.4154 percent; and that the Board applied the same factor in 1970 and 1971 because it lacked half circuit numbers for those years. It further appears that the Board\u2019s half circuit numbers for 1972 were wrong, or that it made an arithmetical error in the calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">However, all of the pertinent figures for each year are accurately shown in the stipulation of facts or the documentary evidence received at the trial. They demonstrate that their use in the Board\u2019s sales factor fraction would have produced a sales factor of 16.4928 percent for 1972, not 16.4154 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>percent; and sales factors in excess of 18 percent for each of the other years. Because errors or omissions in the Board\u2019s calculations thus favor Comsat, the latter has no cause to complain. We treat the Board\u2019s sales factors as valid in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The parties exchange opposing contentions as to which of them bears the burden of proof on such issues as the validity of Comsat\u2019s calculation of its property and sales factors. The trial court concluded that the burden was on the Board (see its conclusion of law No. 8, quoted <em>supra), </em>but we need not decide this question. If the Board has the burden, it has been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The parties argue many other points in their lengthy briefs. The points include such subjects as the effect of the Board\u2019s action in other jurisdictions reached by the Uniform Act and whether the Board has followed its own administrative precedents in this case. Consideration of all of these points is not essential to our disposition of the controversy before us. With two exceptions, we do not reach them.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The first exception is a contention by Comsat that application of the Board\u2019s special apportionment formula denies it (Comsat) due process and equal protection of the laws. This contention was raised in the pleadings, but the trial court did not reach it for obvious reasons. Comsat appropriately makes it in this court by way of defending the judgment. We reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The United States Supreme Court has recently stated the following principles governing state taxation of a business engaged in interstate commerce: \u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes two requirements for such state taxation: a \u2018minimal connection\u2019 or \u2018nexus\u2019 between the interstate activities and the taxing State, and \u2018a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.\u2019 [Citations.] The tax cannot be \u2018out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted by the . . . [taxpayer] ... in that State. \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 207, 219-220 [65 L.Ed.2d 66, 79, 100 S.Ct. 2109].) Comsat\u2019s maintenance of the California earth station at Jamesburg, and the office in Los Angeles County, satisfies the \u201cnexus\u201d requirement because Comsat has thereby availed itself of the \u201c \u2018substantial privilege of carrying on business\u2019 within the State.\u201d (See <em>id., </em>at p. 220 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 220].) The second requirement has been satisfied because there is \u201c\u2018a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The California Supreme Court has pointed out that the state has broad discretion in classifying property for purposes of taxation: \u201c. . . A state tax law is not arbitrary although it \u2018discriminate[s] in favor of a certain class ... if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state policy\u2019 . . . . [t] . . . There exists no \u2018iron rule of equality, prohibiting the flexibility and variety that are appropriate\u2019 to schemes of taxation. [Citations.] So long as a system of taxation is supported by a rational basis, and is not palpably arbitrary, it will be upheld despite the absence of \u2018a precise, scientific uniformity of taxation.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 234 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281].)  Comsat is unique by its nature, and its unique character has been fairly taken into account in the special apportionment formula applied by the Board. It has not been shown that the formula denies Comsat due process or equal protection of the laws. (See <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 272, 277 [170 Cal.Rptr. 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We. also consider a claim by Comsat, made for the first time on appeal, that the Board\u2019s application of the Uniform Act amounts to an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. This claim fails because it has not been shown that Comsat has been subjected to excessive and duplicative taxation, and that interstate commerce has thereby been discriminated against or otherwise impeded. (See <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, supra, </em>447 U.S. 207 at pp. 227-230 [65 L.Ed.2d 66, 83-85]; <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 267, 276-281 [57 L.Ed.2d 197, 206-209, 98 S.Ct. 2340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Our independent review of the uncontradicted facts requires reversal of the judgment with directions as ordered below.
