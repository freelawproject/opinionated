Plaintiff\u2019s action against his former employer and its branch manager for slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress was based on statements made during the course of a grievance hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court agreed with defendants that the statements were absolutely privileged. Plaintiff contends the statements were covered only by a qualified privilege, which does not protect statements made with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>After plaintiff was dismissed from his employment with defendant Vienna Sausage Manufacturing Company, he requested a meeting of the grievance committee for review of his dismissal. According to the collective bargaining agreement between Vienna and plaintiff\u2019s union, the employer was required to present to a grievance committee the reasons for plaintiff\u2019s termination together with supporting evidence. Present at the hearing were plaintiff, Robert Bartlett (Vienna\u2019s branch manager) and four members of the grievance committee. Both plaintiff and Bartlett presented evidence. Plaintiff testified, inter alia, as to his activities on a particular day in question prior to his termination. Bartlett requested a continuation of the hearing and, during the continued portion thereof, he stated that plaintiff\u2019s earlier testimony was false and presented documentary evidence to support his claim. The grievance committee voted to support plaintiff\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Plaintiff thereafter filed this action for slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming that both the testimony and the evidence presented by Bartlett during the hearing were false and made with knowledge of their falsity, i.e., with malice. After hearing, the court awarded summary judgment to defendants, without a statement of its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The rules for review of summary judgments are well known and need no repetition. (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 173 et seq.) Primary among them is the rule that summary judgment will not be sustained if triable issues of material fact exist. The parties concede the absence of factual disputes and acknowledge the issue to be one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Section 47, subdivision 2, provides, in clause (4), an absolute privilege for a publication made \u201cin the initiation or course of any other proceeding authorized by law and reviewable [by mandate]. \u201d  Section 47 was amended in 1979 to add the quoted language, apparently in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hackethal </em>v. <em>Weissbein </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 55 [154 Cal.Rptr. 423, 592 P.2d 1175, 9 A.L.R.4th 791]. <em>Hackethal </em>held that defamatory statements made during the course of a hearing before the judicial commission of a private medical society were not cloaked with the absolute privilege of section 47 as it then read (without clause (4) in subd. 2). The decision was announced in April 1979, and the bill<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> adding clause (4) to subdivision 2 of section 47 was amended in the Legislature immediately thereafter to provide the absolute privilege. The legislative digest of the bill before the Assembly Committee on Judiciary reveals that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>meant to establish the absolute privilege denied by the <em>Hackethal </em>decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the 1979 amendment of section 47 expanded its umbrella of absolute privilege to a host of quasi-judicial proceedings not deemed \u201cofficial,\u201d and hence not previously protected thereunder. (See <em>Hackethal </em>v. <em>Weissbein, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 55.) The only requisites for protection are that the statements be made in the initiation or course of a proceeding authorized by law and reviewable by mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Collective bargaining agreements and grievance machinery are not only authorized, but favored by the law (Lab. Code, \u00a7 923; <em>Posner </em>v. <em>Grunwald-Marx, Inc. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 169, 176, 180 [14 Cal.Rptr. 297, 363 P.2d 313]; <em>International Assn. of Bridge etc. Workers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 346, 352 [145 Cal.Rptr. 592]), and are enforceable at law or in equity. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 1126.) The vast majority of collective bargaining agreements contain grievance procedures which preclude discharge except for good cause. (See <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>See's Candies, Inc. </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 311, 320-321, fn. 5 [171 Cal.Rptr. 917].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">When grievance hearings result in the loss of fundamental vested rights, they are subject to review by mandate.  In <em>Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 802 [140 Cal.Rptr. 442, 567 P.2d 1162], our Supreme Court extended the coverage of administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) to decisions of nongovernmental agencies. The Supreme Court held that except under certain conditions not relevant here, the statutory procedure of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 \u201cis to be utilized in all cases in which review of a final adjudicatory order is sought by mandate and the three indicated elements [(1) a hearing is required to be given, (2) evidence is required to be taken, and (3) discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or officer] are present.\u201d <em>(Anton, supra, </em>at p. 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The parties have implicitly conceded the presence of the three statutory elements. The collective bargaining agreement provides for a \u201cBoard of Adjustment\u201d (grievance committee) consisting of two members selected by the union and two by the employer to resolve the grievance or dispute. It further provides that \u201cthe findings of this Board shall be binding\u201d on both parties and that \u201cthe decision of the Board shall be by a majority.\u201d In supplemental briefs the parties liken the grievance hearing to an arbitration proceeding governed by title 9 of part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1280 et seq.) However, the collective bargaining agreement specifically provides that a grievance or other dispute may only be submitted to arbitration before an impartial arbitrator if not resolved by the board of adjustment.  Hence, in many instances the parties will be bound by the decision with no right of arbitration, appeal or judicial review other than by mandate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We do not suggest that every decision of a grievance committee operating under similar contracts is so reviewable. However, when the decision of such a tribunal affects a fundamental right such as the right to employment, California courts have historically intervened to insure that the loss of that right was accomplished through a procedure that was fundamentally fair. <em>(Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 802; <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists </em>(1974) 12 Cal. 3d 541 [116 Cal.Rptr. 245, 526 P.2d 253]; <em>Thorman </em>v. <em>Intl. Alliance etc. Employees </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 629 [320 P.2d 494], overruled on other grounds in <em>Consolidated Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Theatrical Stage Employees Union </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 713 [73 Cal.Rptr. 213, 447 P.2d 325]; <em>Cason </em>v. <em>Glass Bottle Blowers Assn. </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 134 [231 P.2d 6, 21 A.L.R.2d 1387]; <em>James </em>v. <em>Marinship Corp. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 721 [155 P.2d 329, 160 A.L.R. 900]; see also <em>Frink </em>v. <em>Prod </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 166, 174-175 [181 Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476].)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Consequently, we conclude that section 47, subdivision 2, affords an absolute privilege to statements made during and as part of a grievance procedure hearing which is reviewable by mandate. The wisdom of affording such a privilege was stated by Justice Tobriner: \u201cThe important public policy served by according witnesses an absolute privilege against defamation actions is not difficult to ascertain. As one tribunal explained more than a century ago, the absolute testimonial privilege \u2018was established, not for the benefit of witnesses, but for that of the public and the advancement of the administration of justice, to prevent witnesses from being deterred by the fear of having actions brought against them from coming forward and testifying to the truth.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Hackethal </em>v. <em>Weissbein, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 55, 65; dis. opn.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The privilege also necessarily precludes the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>(Kilgore </em>v. <em>Younger </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 770, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number><em>777 </em>[180 Cal.Rptr. 657, 640 P.2d 793]; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Higham </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677, 681-682 [197 Cal.Rptr. 145]; <em>Lerette </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Organization, Inc. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 573, 579 [131 Cal.Rptr. 592].)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">In light of our holding, we need not address defendants\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Low, P.

Proc., \u00a7 1280 et seq.), it is absolutely privileged as a statement made during judicial or official proceedings authorized by law. This privilege attaches if \u201cthe publication (1) was made in a judicial proceeding; (2) had some connection or logical relation to the action; (3) was made to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) involved litigants or other participants authorized by law.\u201d <em>(Bradley </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem.
