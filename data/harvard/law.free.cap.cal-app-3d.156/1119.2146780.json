D.), Acting P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfC\">Appellant Frank Edward Stevens was convicted of possession of a controlled substance (amphetamines) for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378) and admitted a prior felony conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). We reverse the judgment of conviction because the record shows the court unjustifiably denied appellant\u2019s request to relieve his volunteer attorney and appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">\n<em>Trial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">On May 5, 1982, at approximately 9:15 p.m. in Modesto, appellant, driving his 1960 Chevrolet pickup, was stopped by Stanislaus County sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>deputies. Appellant\u2019s truck had been under surveillance by Deputy Carrillo for 30 to 45 minutes prior to the stop which was undertaken to conduct a search of appellant and his vehicle for controlled substances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was and had been the sole occupant of the truck during the period of observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Appellant was ordered out, handcuffed and placed in a patrol car while the officers searched the vehicle. Above the transmission housing, between the bucket seats, the officers found a razor blade to which a small amount of whitish powder adhered. Concealed behind the console between the seats was a cigarette package containing nine plastic bags of a yellowish-tan powder. In the glove compartment, the officers found several empty clear plastic bags. The bindles of powder in the cigarette packet, totaling 13.25 grams, were found to contain amphetamine. Carrillo estimated the street value of the amphetamine to be $1,060. A presumptive test was conducted on the residue on the razor blade, with negative results. Carrillo testified that razor blades are commonly employed by users and dealers of amphetamines to \u201cline out\u201d the powder prior to ingesting it, or to mix it with cutting agents in preparation for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Appellant testified he did not place the drugs or other paraphernalia in his truck and had no knowledge of their presence. On May 5, 1982, in the early afternoon, he went to see his parole officer, Ron Schumacher, and mentioned that he was going to a friend\u2019s house to discuss the possibility of working in Alaska. Thereafter, appellant went to Oakdale to apply for a job at Hunt-Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">At approximately 5 p.m., appellant went to Sandy Bolton\u2019s house to meet one of her friends to discuss a job in Alaska. Bolton had been introduced to appellant by his sister a week earlier. Appellant dated Bolton two times but did not know her very well. On the evening of May 5, Bolton borrowed appellant\u2019s truck from about 5 to 7 p.m. Appellant testified he had no idea how the drugs came to be in his vehicle \u201c. . . except for I went over to [Bolton\u2019s] house and she used my car.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>Ronald Schumacher testified that appellant met with him on the afternoon of May 5 and mentioned he was going to talk with someone about going to Alaska to work as a welder.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Victoria Osborn testified she had known appellant for nine years. She never knew appellant to use drugs or to offer them; also, appellant did not smoke cigarettes. After appellant was arrested, he called Osborn and told her to contact Bolton. Appellant did not ask Osborn to contact appellant\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Appellant\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that Bolton, the \u201cmysterious missing witness,\u201d had intentionally or unintentionally left the drug and other paraphernalia in appellant\u2019s truck. \u201c[Wjith the somewhat mysterious missing witness, the absence of control by the defendant of his vehicle for two hours . . . you have plainly a reasonable doubt setting.\u201d Counsel also argued it would be illogical to assume appellant put the drugs in the truck, because he had driven in it to visit his parole officer earlier that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The district attorney argued that appellant\u2019s story was incredible and that the location of the items found in the truck overwhelmingly proved appellant was aware of their presence. The prosecutor repeatedly stated that the officers were entitled to claim a privilege given to law enforcement to withhold information regarding Bolton\u2019s police contacts. The district attorney argued if appellant wanted corroboration that another person used his car before the officers searched it, the defense was the logical party to call the \u201cmissing witness\u201d into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The crucial question is whether appellant, an indigent, was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel by the trial court\u2019s refusal of appellant\u2019s request to discharge his volunteer attorney and appoint the public defender. Although the circumstances of this case are unusual, well-settled principles mandate an affirmative answer. The violation of appellant\u2019s right to counsel requires reversal (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Holland </em>(1978) 23 Cal.3d 77, 87 [151 Cal.Rptr. 625, 588 P.2d 765]).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Appellant was represented throughout the trial by Attorney Cliff McGhee, who volunteered to represent appellant without compensation because appellant was married to McGhee\u2019s sister. McGhee appeared with appellant at the preliminary hearing and at appellant\u2019s arraignment in superior court. At the arraignment, the court set a hearing on the alleged prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>for July 21, 1982, a pretrial conference for July 29, and a jury trial date of August 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">On July 21, the date set for hearing on the validity of the prior, McGhee failed to appear. Appellant immediately told the judge that the attorney was his brother-in-law and, \u201cI would like to have a Public Defender appointed.\u201d Further, appellant informed the court he had called his attorney\u2019s office \u201cfor the last three weeks and he\u2019s been gone all the time.\u201d The judge refused to substitute counsel, indicating he would not relieve the attorney without notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court recessed briefly; when the matter was called again, the judge stated he had been unable to reach appellant\u2019s attorney and would continue the hearing one week to attempt to contact McGhee by letter. Appellant mentioned that his wife, McGhee\u2019s sister, was present and might have information. Upon the court\u2019s inquiry, she responded: \u201c. . .he has a drinking problem. He\u2019s not going to show up in court.\u201d The hearing continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">\u201cThe Court: Is he presently on a toot of some kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cMrs. Stevens: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">\u201cThe Court: Do you know where he is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">\u201cMrs. Stevens: No. I can find him, I hope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, all right. I would appreciate it because before he\u2019s relieved as attorney of record, he should at least have the opportunity to appear in court and indicate what his reasons are. We will attempt, however, to notify him and it may well be that this case is going to have to be continued. Certainly would be true if we have to appoint different counsel. But we will continue this until July 28th at 8:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your Honor, I am supposed to be back in court on the 29th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">\u201cThe Court: I know. That\u2019s for pre-trial. If we have to appoint new counsel for you, if we don\u2019t have Mr. McGhee here and he\u2019s not able and prepared to go to trial, unquestionably it will probably mean there will have to be a continuance of the trial date, but that would happen anyway. I\u2019m certain if I appointed the Public Defender there would be no way he would be ready on August 2nd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: I realize that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">\u201cMr. Ritchey: What was the date, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">\u201cThe Court: July 28th, a week from today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">On July 28, appellant appeared with McGhee. The judge asked McGhee where he had been on July 21. McGhee said he was ill and, although he had asked another attorney to appear for him, there was some confusion about the time of the hearing. The court then inquired whether appellant had discussed his dissatisfaction with McGhee\u2019s representation. McGhee responded that appellant wanted to relieve McGhee, and because appellant was indigent the public defender\u2019s office should be appointed. The judge stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I am prepared to do that. The matter is now set for trial, unless there\u2019s some good reason for doing it.\u201d Asked by the court to state his wishes, appellant said, \u201cWell, I just, rather, you know, get a different lawyer.\u201d The judge rejoined, \u201cWell, I am not disposed at this point to grant\u2014to appoint counsel to represent you when you\u2019re already represented by an attorney, especially where that would require a continuance of the trial, which it would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">McGhee explained he and appellant did not communicate well and were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d on the proper strategy, motions and approach to the case. The court indicated it did not consider such differences a ground to relieve McGhee. Appellant stated he felt there was a conflict of interest because appellant was married to McGhee\u2019s sister. Appellant alluded to problems with his wife and said, \u201cI just don\u2019t think I could get a fair representation.\u201d The court concluded it was necessary to hold a <em>Marsden </em>hearing <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]), and cleared the courtroom of spectators and the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\"><em>In camera, </em>the judge asked appellant to state his concerns \u201ca little more explicitly . . . .\u201d Appellant said McGhee twice had failed to make court appearances, once in municipal and once in superior court. Appellant thought McGhee failed to appear at the latest superior court hearing because McGhee was intoxicated. McGhee denied the latter charge, stating he was ill, but was unable to recall whether or not he was absent in municipal court. McGhee said, \u201cIt may be that [appellant\u2019s] interests are best served by some other lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Asked whether there was a family problem that might affect his representation of appellant, McGhee said: \u201cMr. Stevens recently became my brother-in-law. I found out about the trouble and I volunteered my services as one would for the family. It occurs to me that Mr. Stevens may think be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>cause his wife is my sister that that somehow means that he\u2019s going to get less than adequate representation. I am not being paid for the services. I don\u2019t know how that influences his thoughts one way or the other.\u201d McGhee said he was unaware of a family problem and did not <em>think </em>his representation of appellant would be affected by the relationship or lack of a fee. He explained he felt his best efforts would be to negotiate a plea with the district attorney, but recognized he had an ethical duty to assist appellant if the latter chose to go to trial. McGhee did not answer the court\u2019s question whether he was prepared to represent appellant at trial \u201cas vigorously and as competently as you possibly can[.]\u201d Instead, he stated, \u201cI think the question before the Court is whether Mr. Stevens figures he will get his representation. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The court then terminated the discussion, ruling: \u201cWell, we have the problem come up many times that a defendant may feel, for one reason or another, . . . dissatisfied with his attorney, but because he may feel dissatisfied, does not mean that there has to be a change of attorneys. There has to be some basic reason for the dissatisfaction that the Court can consider as legally sufficient in making an order relieving counsel and here we have a trial date of August 2nd, and, under the circumstances, I am not going to, on the kind of showing we have had here, I am not going to relieve Mr. McGhee from further representation. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Appellant contends the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request for substitution of counsel was reversible error because the court failed to explore the state of mind of appellant\u2019s attorney (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Munoz </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 62, 66 [115 Cal.Rptr. 726]) and the court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance and to appoint the public defender.  Appellant\u2019s second contention is correct; appellant\u2019s request to discharge McGhee and substitute a new attorney should not have been determined by a <em>Marsden</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>standard, and no circumstances justified denial of a continuance for appointed counsel to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">McGhee had not been appointed by the court to represent appellant. Although he was not being paid for his services, McGhee in effect was privately retained by appellant. (See <em>Magee </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 949, 952 [106 Cal.Rptr. 647, 506 P.2d 1023].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>We reject respondent\u2019s contention that a <em>Marsden </em>analysis governs substitution of appointed for retained counsel. A defendant has a constitutional and statutory right to counsel of his choice. (U.S. Const., 6th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 284; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gzikowski </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 580, 586-589 [186 Cal.Rptr. 339, 651 P.2d 1145]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crovedi </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 199 [53 Cal.Rptr. 284, 417 P.2d 868].) We conclude that a defendant\u2019s interest in discharging a retained attorney is included within the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice, and is subject to the same limitations: \u201cThe right to effective assistance of counsel [citations] encompasses the right to retain counsel of one\u2019s choice. [Citation.] Though entitlement to representation by a particular attorney is not absolute [citation], \u2018the state should keep to a necessary minimum its interference with the individual\u2019s desire to defend himself in whatever manner he deems best, using any legitimate means within his resources\u2014and . . . that desire can constitutionally be forced to yield only when it will result in significant prejudice to the defendant himself or in a disruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gzikowski, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 586-587,)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">It is undisputed that appellant was indigent; accordingly, the court was under an absolute duty to appoint counsel if appellant was unrepresented. <em>(Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 335 [9 L.Ed.2d 799, 83 S.Ct. 792, 93 A.L.R.2d 733].) Had appellant initially entertained the same misgivings about his brother-in-law\u2019s ability to represent him adequately and refused when McGhee offered his services, there is no question the court would have appointed counsel. Contrary to the assumption of the trial court and respondent, appellant\u2019s initial acceptance of the volunteered representation did not prevent appellant from thereafter terminating the relationship without demonstrating McGhee\u2019s incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\"><em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1 [136 Cal.Rptr. 354] presents an analogous situation. In <em>Mandell, </em>the court granted an attorney\u2019s petition to compel the superior court to grant petitioner\u2019s pretrial motion to be relieved as counsel for a criminal defendant. The attorney had been hired to represent the defendant at the preliminary hearing after which defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>funds were exhausted. When the attorney appeared in superior court and requested to be relieved, the judge refused and informed counsel he was \u201c \u2018on the hook, . . <em>(Id., </em>at p. 3.) Citing Code of Civil Procedure section 284,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the appellate court held: \u201cThe case law establishes that the court has discretion to deny an <em>attorney\u2019s </em>request to withdraw where such withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding. [Citations.] But the court\u2019s discretion in this area, as elsewhere in the law, is one to be exercised reasonably. Here there was no reason at all for refusing to relieve counsel except the court\u2019s notion that counsel had placed himself \u2018on the hook\u2019 by inadvertence at the time of the preliminary.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 4, italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Prince </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 404-406 [74 Cal.Rptr. 197]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 218 [103 Cal.Rptr. 671].)  Were we to accept respondent\u2019s position that appellant could not discharge his retained attorney without showing assistance of counsel to be constitutionally ineffective, we would be affording less deference to the interest of a criminal defendant in defending himself \u201c \u2018in whatever manner he deems best\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gzikowski, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 580, 586-587) than to an attorney\u2019s interest in obtaining a fee. (See <em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.3d 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The right to effective assistance of counsel is \u201cbroader than ... the bare right to legal representation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Byoune </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 345, 348 [54 Cal.Rptr. 749, 420 P.2d 221].) Here, the court\u2019s refusal to grant appellant\u2019s request to discharge McGhee violated appellant\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights.  In <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 606, 615 [180 Cal.Rptr. 177, 639 P.2d 248, 18 A.L.R.4th 333], the Supreme Court stated that a \u201c[defendant's confidence in his lawyer is vital to his defense. His right to decide for himself who best can conduct the case must be respected wherever feasible.\u201d The court further noted that \u201cthe right to chosen counsel extends, insofar as feasible, to the poor.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. 4, citing <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 832, 840-841 [73 Cal.Rptr. 410, 447 P.2d 650, 36 A.L.R.3d 1391].) As a matter of logic and justice, a defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in obtaining counsel of his choice encompasses the right to discharge retained counsel regardless of financial ability to hire another attorney. Absent a proper finding of unwarranted disruption of the orderly processes of justice, a court may not force a defendant who timely requests substitution to go to trial represented by retained counsel he no longer trusts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>The only grounds for the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request were its concern that the trial, set for the following week, would be delayed if the court appointed the public defender, and its mistaken belief that appellant was required to show constitutionally inadequate representation by McGhee. \u201c[A] myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crovedi, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 199, 207.) As in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gzikowski, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 580, 589, good cause to grant a continuance for the purpose of allowing new counsel to prepare appears in this case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Appellant brought his difficulties with counsel to the court\u2019s attention at the first hearing in superior court following arraignment;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> counsel did not appear and the matter was continued; the hearing on substitution was held a week later before the same judge. There is not the slightest indication that appellant\u2019s purpose in seeking substitution was a desire to delay the proceedings; no previous requests for continuance had been made. Furthermore, the record shows \u201c[n]o prospect of possibly impairing efficient judicial administration . . . sufficient to overcome [appellant\u2019s] interest\u201d in appointment of a public defender. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gzikowski, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 589.) As appellant points out, all the prosecution witnesses were law enforcement officers, and the record contains no evidence that a continuance would prevent their appearance. Indeed, the court had discussed the possioility of a continuance at the hearing on the validity of the prior, and the prosecutor raised no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Under these circumstances, denial of appellant\u2019s request to substitute the public defender deprived him of due process and requires reversal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gzikowski, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 580, 589; <em>People </em>v. <em>Byoune, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 345, 348; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 334, 349 [161 Cal.Rptr. 762, 605 P.2d 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">II<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Andreen, J., and Hamlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-8\"> State Parole Agent Ronald Schumacher testified at the preliminary hearing that a few days before May 5, 1982, he received information from the Stanislaus County Drug Enforcement Unit (SCDEU) that appellant, a parolee, \u201cpossibly was in possession and selling or dealing in controlled substances.\u201d Appellant, on parole from a prison term for violation of Penal Code section 261.5 (statutory rape), was subject to a warrantless search condition and Schumacher instructed the SCDEU to carry out a parole search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\"> During the prosecution case, <em>on </em>cross-examination of Deputies Carrillo and Mann, the court sustained claims of official privilege under Evidence Code sections 1040-1042 to questions concerning the nature of the officers\u2019 contacts with Bolton. In a brief hearing out of the presence of the jury, Mann indicated he knew Bolton \u201c[t]hrough past contacts with her over the past couple of years.\u201d Mann did not believe he had arrested Bolton, and did not know where she was or how she might be located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\"> We can infer from the record that if funds had been available to appellant he would have <em>retained </em>other counsel; the brother-in-law attorney was representing appellant without remuneration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\"> We need not discuss whether the court\u2019s inquiry also was deficient under <em>Marsden </em>standards. However, the hearings on July 21 and 28 raised questions of divided loyalty from family tensions or the pecuniary interest of an uncompensated attorney which were never satisfactorily answered; the court should have been more careful to protect appellant\u2019s right to effective and conflict-free representation. <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 261, 272 [67 L.Ed.2d 220, 230, 101 S.Ct. 1097]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Munoz, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 62.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\"> A recent appellate opinion adopted respondent\u2019s position in a case in which the defendant sought to substitute the public defender for retained counsel after trial and prior to sentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 663 [194 Cal.Rptr. 317].) The court stated without analysis or authority that a motion to relieve retained counsel and appoint the public defender is \u201ctantamount to a substitution of appointed counsel . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 666.)
