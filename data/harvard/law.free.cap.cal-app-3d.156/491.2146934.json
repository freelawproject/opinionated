J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGG\">Appellant Daniel O. Kayfetz, M.D., sued the State of California, the Board of Medical Quality Assurance (Board), the Physicians Diversion Program, and the diversion program administrator, Jerome S. Becker, for damages arising from publication of disciplinary action against him in the official \u201cAction Report\u201d which is distributed to hospitals and doctors. Kayfetz alleges that the published report was inaccurate and violated promised confidentiality concerning his participation in the Diversion Program for Impaired Physicians, a drug rehabilitation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the complaint, on the grounds that the publication in the Board\u2019s official report was privileged, or the defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were immune \u201cor both.\u201d We conclude that Government Code section 821.6 cloaks the action in immunity, and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">On April 10, 1980, the Division of Medical Quality (Division), a part of the Board of Medical Quality Assurance, which enforces the disciplinary and criminal provision of the Medical Practice Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2001, 2003, 2004), issued an accusation charging appellant with theft and possession and self-administration of dangerous drugs, in violation of Business and Professions Code sections 2361, subdivision (e) and 2390.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alleging unprofessional conduct, the Board sought suspension or revocation of appellant\u2019s physician\u2019s and surgeon\u2019s certificates under Business and Professions Code section 2360.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">On January 7, 1981, appellant, his attorney, and the attorney for the Board of Medical Quality Assurance signed a stipulation in which appellant admitted the charges and allegations, and accepted a decision revoking his license, staying the revocation, and placing appellant on five-years\u2019 probation subject to certain terms and conditions concerning his use and prescription of controlled drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Paragraph 8 of the stipulation provided: \u201cThe Division agrees to make the effective date of its decision sixty days after adoption of this Stipulation. During that sixty day period respondent on his own initiative will apply for admission to the Impaired Physicians Program. If the Impaired Physicians Program in its sole discretion determines that the respondent is a suitable candidate for the Impaired Physicians Program and if the respondent enters said program, then the decision of the Division shall not become effective and shall be suspended during such time as the respondent remains in good standing in the program. Upon successful completion of the Impaired Physicians Program, the decision of the Division and the Accusation shall be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Appellant subsequently applied for admission to the diversion program and was admitted. The next year, after appellant successfully completed the program, on May 18, 1982, the Division set aside the decision and dismissed the accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Meanwhile, in October 1981, the Board published its quarterly \u201cAction Report,\u201d listing among the Board\u2019s disciplinary actions from March 1, 1981 to June 30, 1981, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cKayfetz, Daniel O. M.D. (C-8918)\u2014Oakland 2390, 2361(e) B &amp; P Code Stipulated Decision. Dishonest conduct involving thefts. Unlawful possession of controlled drugs for self administration. Revoked, stayed, 5 years probation on terms and conditions. ([Fjurther stipulated that Decision is suspended if within 60 days he is accepted into the Board\u2019s Impaired Physicians Program.) April 24, 1981.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The announcement accurately describes both the charges and disposition. The problem is that the announcement implies that appellant was then on five-years\u2019 probation with conditions, when, in fact, the Division\u2019s decision was suspended because of his admission to and continued participation in the drug diversion program.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Appellant filed a complaint<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seeking damages for libel, publication of confidential information, and breach of an agreement and duty to keep confidential his application to and participation in the diversion program. Defendants demurred to this complaint on various grounds, and were successful in forcing the dismissal of all but the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>With leave to amend appellant filed his first amended complaint alleging four causes of action: libel; breach of Civil Code section \u00cd798.24 by revealing confidential information; breach of the Business and Professions Code section 2355 confidentiality requirement for all records \u201cpertaining to the treatment\u201d of a physician in a program; and breach of an agreement to keep confidential appellant\u2019s application to and participation in the diversion program. Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted. It is this order that is the basis for the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">A motion for judgment on the pleadings admits all material and issuable facts contained in the challenged pleading, accepting properly pleaded facts as true. <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 321, 326-327 [195 Cal.Rptr. 84].) The standard of review of a judgment on the pleadings is the same standard that is used to review the propriety of a judgment following the sustaining of a demurrer. <em>(Baillargeon </em>v. <em>Department of Water &amp; Power </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 670, 675-676 [138 Cal.Rptr. 338].) The ultimate question on appeal \u201c \u2018. . .is whether, disregarding imperfections of form which could be cured by amendment, the facts pleaded and judicially noticed entitle [plaintiff] to any relief, . . . [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pacific Architects Collaborative </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 110, 118 [166 Cal.Rptr. 184], quoting <em>Kachig </em>v. <em>Boothe </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 626, 632 [99 Cal.Rptr. 393]; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, supra, </em>at p. 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Defendants claim immunity under Government Code section 821.6 which provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously and without probable cause.\u201d If the employee is immune from liability, section 815.2 also immunizes the public entity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue is whether the publication in the official \u201cAction Report\u201d is a part of the \u201cprosecution\u201d of a proceeding within the meaning of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In <em>Citizens Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Spohn </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 887 [184 Cal.Rptr. 269], section 821.6 was applied to immunize the state and officials from claimed injury resulting from widespread publicity charging appellant business with improper collection methods. The charges led to license revocation proceedings.  On appeal the court affirmed dismissal of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>pellant\u2019s complaint, saying \u201cimmunity, even from wrongfully motivated action, is granted, as a matter of public policy, to avoid the risk of public officers avoiding their public duty for fear of the burden of trial and risk of its outcome.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 889, quoting <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Vial </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 577, 572-583 [311 P.2d 494].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As <em>Citizens Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Spohn </em>demonstrates, section 821.6 is not limited to suits for damages for malicious prosecution, although that is a principal use of the statute. (See <em>Engel </em>v. <em>McCloskey </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 870 [155 Cal.Rptr. 284], [\u00a7 821.6 bars blackmail claim]; <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 134 [53 Cal.Rptr. 482] [\u00a7 821.6 bars actions for damages from negligent autopsy and subsequent prosecution for murder]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 849 [73 Cal.Rptr. 364] [\u00a7 821.6 and other statutes bar a claim for damages erroneously notifying businesses to cease and desist from zoning violations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Publication of disciplinary action is part of a statutory scheme for the enforcement of the Medical Practices Act for the public benefit. The Board of Medical Quality Assurance is part of the Department of Consumer Affairs (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Publication of the \u201cAction Report\u201d is part of the mechanism for disseminating information on practices \u201cinimical to the interests of the consumer.\u201d (\u00a7 335, subd. (a).) The Medical Practices Act is intended to protect the public from unscrupulous, careless, or dishonest practitioners. <em>(Sobey </em>v. <em>Molony </em>(1940) 40 Cal.App.2d 381, 387-388 [104 P.2d 868].) The Division is required to take action against any licensee who is charged with unprofessional conduct. (\u00a7 2234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Here, as appellant argues, there is also a need for confidentiality to foster participation in the drug diversion program.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 2355 provides that all diversion program records \u201cpertaining to the treatment of a physician\u201d are confidential, and that upon rehabilitation \u201call records pertaining to the physician\u2019s and surgeon\u2019s participation\u201d in the program shall be purged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>While the statutory scheme does protect records pertaining to treatment in the drug diversion program, nowhere does it clothe in secrecy the fact of drug abuse. Revocation or suspension of a certificate for drug abuse, for example, is a matter of public record. (\u00a7 2017; Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Appellant argues that section 821.6 does not apply because \u201cthe act which Appellant claims injured him did not arise or result from the institution of a proceeding but rather from an unauthorized publication which occurred five months after the action was dismissed.\u201d But, the action was not dismissed at the time of publication. Dismissal occurred the following year, after successful rehabilitation. The publication of this case was actually part of an ongoing proceeding, contemplating continued diversion program participation to earn suspension of the decision, and eventually, dismissal. (Cf. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 710 [117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 527 P.2d 865], refusing to apply this section to immunize the county from damages for false imprisonment for retaining plaintiff after his time was served.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Also, appellant\u2019s argument ignores the two-fold coverage for institution <em>or </em>prosecution of proceedings, which taken together appear to cover both the charges and the disposition. Further, the \u201cAction Report\u201d publication was authorized as part of the statutory scheme and was clearly \u201cwithin the scope of [defendant\u2019s] employment,\u201d within the meaning of section 821.6. As appellant appears to concede, <em>Citizens Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Spohn, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d 887, applies where publication is an integral part of the prosecution process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Appellant argues that publication was prohibited by Civil Code section 1798.24, which bans disclosure of certain \u201cpersonal or confidential\u201d information.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Section 1798.3 defines \u201cconfidential information\u201d to include \u201c[information containing medical . . . material.\u201d The provision is similar to the exception to the Public Records Act which protects \u201cmedical . . . files\" from disclosure. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 6254, subd. (c).) Similarly, sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tion 2355 bans disclosure of records \u201cpertaining to the treatment\u201d of a physician in the drug diversion program.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We fail to see how the publication at issue unduly reveals \u201cmedical\u201d history. The nature of the charge \u201cunlawful possession of controlled drugs for self-administration\u201d unavoidably implies drug consumption. But, appellant cites no authority for the proposition that the public interest in being informed should be frustrated because a physician is in a rehabilitation program. The \u201cAction Report\u201d states in parenthesis that the \u201cdecision is suspended if within 60 days he is accepted into the Board\u2019s Impaired Physicians Program,\u201d without revealing whether or not appellant opted for the program. If anything, appellant is claiming that <em>the failure </em>to reveal his participation in the program miscasts his license status.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Because we find that the defendants are immune from suit for the action in question, we need not decide other issues raised by the parties, principally whether Civil Code section 47 grants absolute, qualified or any privilege to the publication; whether truth constitutes a defense in this case; or whether defendants breached promised confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We affirm the order granting judgment on the pleadings and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Scott, J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> The immunity statutes cover both the defendant public entities (Gov. Code, \u00a7 815) and Becker, a state official (Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.2). However, in the judgment on the pleadings and underlying motion only defendant entities are represented. Whether Becker was served is unclear. No explanation is given for the failure to include him in the relief granted defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> These sections, in effect at the time of the accusation, have been renumbered as sections 2234 and 2239 respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\"> Now section 2221.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> Dr. Kayfetz first filed and was denied a claim with the State Board of Control against the Board, the program, and Becker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> Section 815.2, subdivision (b): \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> Section 2340 states: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that the Board of Medical Quality Assurance seek ways and means to identify and rehabilitate physicians and surgeons with impairment due to abuse of dangerous drugs . . . affecting competency so that physicians and surgeons so afflicted may be treated and returned to the practice of medicine in a manner which will not endanger the public health and safety.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\"> Section 2355 states: \u201c(a) After a committee in its discretion has determined that a physician and surgeon has been rehabilitated and the diversion program is completed, the committee shall purge and destroy all records pertaining to the physician\u2019s and surgeon\u2019s participation in a diversion program, [f] (b) All board and committee records and records of proceedings pertaining to the treatment of a physician and surgeon in a program shall be kept confidential and are not subject to discovery or subpoena.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> Under section 2229 rehabilitation of the licensee is a Division concern for other types of misconduct as well.
