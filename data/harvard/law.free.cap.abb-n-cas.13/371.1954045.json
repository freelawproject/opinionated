Supreme </em>Court, <em>Third </em>District, Albany, <em>Special </em>Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuB\">January, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-8\">Motion to set aside Taxation of Costs.\u2014Costs on Reference of disputed Claim against Estate ; Taxation, now REVIEWED.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-9\">Where an order, confirming a referee\u2019s report in favor of defendants directs \u201c that the defendant have judgment for costs and disbursements of this <em>action </em>against the plaintiff,\u201d it is not error for the clerk to tax costs as in an action, as the order is his guide; if costs should have been taxed as in a special proceeding, the remedy is by-appeal from the order, and not by motion to set aside the taxation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AXt\">Whether a reference of a disputed claim against an estate under 3 R. S. 89, \u00a737, be deemed a \u201cspecial proceeding \u201d or an \u201c action,\u201d the court has power, under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 3340, to award costs \u201casin actions brought in the same court.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-10\">Motion to set aside a taxation of costs, and for a new taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-11\">Plaintiff presented a claim against the estate of defendant\u2019s intestate, which was rejected and by agreement of the parties referred under the statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>89, \u00a7 37). After trying the issue, the referee reported that the estate was not indebted to plaintiff, and that defendant, as administratrix was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>costs ; and on January 8, 1884, an order was granted by Mr. Justice Ingalls at special term confirming the report, and awarding costs and disbursements to the defendant. The essential part of the order was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">\u201cOrdered, that the said report be and the same hereby is in all things confirmed, and that the defendant have judgment for costs and disbursements of this action against the plaintiff, to be taxed by the clerk of Rensselaer county, according to the statute in such case made and provided, together with $10 costs of this motion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">The order was duly entered, and on January 11, 1884, the defendant\u2019s costs and disbursements were adjusted by the clerk in the sum of $102.69, under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 3251, the items allowed being the usual taxable costs in an action. Plaintiff objected to such taxation and afterwards moved at special term to set it aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-7\"><em>Townsend &amp; Townsend, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWo\">I. The prevailing party is entitled to recover disbursements only. <em>Code Pro. </em>\u00a7 317; Avery <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 <em>How. Pr. </em>349 ; Van Sickler v. Graham, 7 <em>Id. </em>208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-8\">II. The proceeding is not \u201c an action,\u201d but a \u201c special proceeding; \u201d the clerk accordingly erred in taxing the costs under <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 3251. Boyd <em>v. </em>Bigelow, 14 <em>How. Pr. </em>511 ; Roe <em>v. </em>Boyle, 81 <em>N.

The only question to be considered on this appeal is as to the <em>items </em>allowed and taxed. The propriety of the allowance of costs can be reviewed only on an <em>appeal from the order </em>awarding costs. <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 3265; Bailey <em>v. </em>Stone, 41 <em>How. Pr. </em>346; Wehle <em>v. </em>Bowery Savings Bank, 40 <em>Super. Ct. </em>(J. <em>&amp; S.) </em>161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-10\">II. The provision of the order awarding costs was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>imperative, and the clerk was not at liberty to disregard it <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 3262; Ballou <em>v. </em>Parsons, <em>55 N. Y. </em>673), even although the awarding of costs was <em>coram non judice. </em>Olcott <em>v. </em>Maclean, 11 Hun, 394; Bailey <em>v. </em>Stone, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">HI. Whether the proceeding is \u201can action\u201d or a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d the defendants might have costs: 1. Under the revised statutes, 2 <em>R. S. </em>89 \u00a7 37; (Linn <em>v. </em>Clow, 14 <em>How. Pr. </em>508; Boyd <em>v. </em>Bigelow, <em>Id. </em>511; Munson <em>v. </em>Howell, 20 <em>Id. </em>59 ; Radley <em>v. </em>Fisher, 24 <em>Id. </em>404 ; Coe <em>v. </em>Coe, 37 <em>Barb. </em>232). 2. Under the Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 3240.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b397-6\">Westbbook, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-d\">The clerk did not err in allowing costs as in an action. The order of the special term, awarding costs, was his guide. The order was \u201c that the defendants have judgment for costs and disbursements of this action.\u201d The order designates the proceeding as \u201can action,\u201d and the remedy, if any, was by appeal from the order, and not by appeal from the taxation of this clerk, and thus to ask one special term to overrule another.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">But the order of the special term was right. It is unnecessary to discuss the question whether this proceeding was a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d or an \u201caction,\u201d for the statute (3 <em>R. S. </em>[6 ed.] 97, \u00a7 48), has declared that when costs are awarded in such a matter they shall be \u201cas in actions against executors,\u201d and although it <em>was </em>a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d the court had power <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a73240) to award costs \u201cas in actions brought in the same court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
