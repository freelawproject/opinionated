Irving, an infant, to vacate that order, and for leave to continue the suit as a poor person. The motion was based on a petition which, among other things, alleged that he was the father of the plaintiff ; that he was a street car conductor by occupation, poor, and not worth $100, and had a large family dependent upon him for support; that the infant plaintiff was also poor, and without property ; that petitioner had used his best endeavors to obtain sureties to go on an undertaking for costs, and had failed; and that unless this action was allowed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>continued by plaintiff <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the action could not be continued, and the right of the plaintiff to redress her wrongs would be defeated, and great injustice done her. To the petition was annexed the \u25a0 affidavit of one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys to the effect that the plaintiff had a good and substantial cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-5\"><em>Morris &amp; Pearsall, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArF\">I. By section 458 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is provided that \u201c <em>a poor person, </em>not being of ability to sue, who alleges that he has a cause of action against another person, may apply .... for leave to sue as a poor person.\u201d Section 460 provides, that where the court is satisfied of the truth of the facts alleged, it may allow by order the applicant to prosecute the action as a poor person. Section 461 provides that if the application is granted, costs shall not be awarded against him. The code also provides (\u00a7 468) that \u201c When an infant has a right-of action, he is entitled to maintain an action thereon.\u201d It must be prosecuted, however, through a guardian <em>ad litem (Code, </em>\u00a7 469). By those provisions our legislature has given to infants the same rights in our courts to prosecute their claims, and redress their wrongs, as is given to adults. When an infant is poor, and is, for that reason unable to prosecute a good cause of action, he falls clearly within the provisions of sections 458 and 460 of the Code. He has a right to apply for the relief therein provided for, and the court is vested with the power to grant it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-6\">II. It is true that section 8268 of the Code provides that the defendant <em>may </em>require security for costs where the plaintiff \u201cis an infant whose guardian <em>ad litem </em>has not given such security.\u201d All the provisions above referred to are parts and parcels of the same general law. In order, therefore, to carry out the intention of the legislature and further the ends of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>justice, those provisions should be construed together. Now, the legislature clearly intended that the doors of justice should not be closed against any person because of his <em>infancy </em>or <em>poverty. </em>The law recognises and provides for those misfortunes. The application, therefore, of section 3268 is limited and qualified by sections 458, 460, 468 and 469. It should be construed in connection with those other provisions. Otherwise the beneficent provisions of sections 458 and 468 will be practically defeated in a very great measure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">III. It will be observed, that the language used, in section 458 is as clear and positive as that in section 3268. It applies, not only to adult litigants, but to every man, woman and minor who, by reason of poverty, is unable to prosecute a good cause of action. Had our legislature intended that the provisions of section 458 of the Code should not apply to poor infants, and should apply solely to <em>adult </em>paupers, it would certainly have declared so in express terms. Such a narrow interpretation of the provisions referred to would be against reason, and the spirit of our law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">IY. It may be argued, that the court having already directed security for costs to be given, it is now too late to apply for the relief provided for in sections 458 and 460. It will be seen, however, that no particular time is mentioned in the Code within which the application shall be made. The Code says that it may be made to the court \u201cin which the action is <em>pending P, </em>Prom that it would seem that the application may be made at any time <em>during </em>the pendency of the action. Certainly the plea of poverty could not be set up in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for security for costs. That plea can only be properly brought before the court in a direct application for leave to prosecute <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-7\"><em>James J. </em>Rogers, for defendants, opposed.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\"> In Lewis <em>v. </em>Lewis, N. <em>Y. Com. Pl., Sp. T., March, </em>1883, the court, under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 3371, ordered a plaintiff suing an executrix to furnish security for costs, where it appeared that he was pecuniarily irresponsible and that an execution against his property bad recently been returned unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The moving papers alleged that the action was brought against the defendant in her representative capacity of executrix, and was at ;sue and awaiting trial upon the general calendar ; that defendant had good defenses to the causes of action alleged in the complaint, specifically stating them, and that the action had not been brought in good faith, but simply for the purpose of annoying the said executrix and extorting money to discontinue the suits and allow her to obtain a final settlement of her accounts. It was further alleged that file plaintiff was insolvent and pecuniarily irresponsible; that a judgment for \u00a7134 had been recovered in this court against him in 1878, !-y another person, and was unsatisfied of record, execution thereon laving been returned unsatisfied and supplementary proceedings having failed to result in the discovery of any property.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\"><em>Albert W.

The stay of plaintiff's proceedings resulting from his failure to pay costs of the former motion although continuing for seven months is no defense to this application (James <em>v. </em>Shea, 15 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>359 ; 28 <em>Hun, </em>74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\"><em>Sidney H.

It provides for any poor person. The spirit of the law would necessarily include minors ; for why leave them out ? The object was to enable all conditions to obtain justice. Infants are generally favored in this regard. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>is himself poor and unable to pay costs. The case seems to be one where the order should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
