The facts found by the referee show that the total accounts of both parties did not exceed $400. The defendant\u2019s payments constituted no part of the account, but they reduced the demand or account <em>pro tanto </em>(Crim <em>v. </em>Cronkhite, 15 <em>How.

The entire claim of both parties was unliquidated and litigated upon the trial, and the Supreme Court had jurisdiction (Parker <em>v. </em>Eaton, 25 <em>Barb. </em>122; Gilliland <em>v. </em>Campbell, 18 <em>How.

Y. C. P., 10 <em>Wend. 557, </em>note; Stilwell <em>v. </em>Staples, <em>5 Duer, </em>691; Bradner <em>v. </em>Howard, 14 <em>Hun, </em>420, 422; Glackin v.

The referee\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for, $12.02, with costs, was conclusive (Bailey <em>v. </em>Stone, 41 <em>How. Pr. </em>346; Fuller <em>v. </em>Conde, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>89).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-7\">Bockes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARO\">I am of the opinion that this case was within the jurisdiction of a justice\u2019s court. The question is whether the sum total of the accounts between the parties, exceeded $400 ; that is, as we shall hereafter see, whether the <em>balance </em>of accounts between the parties, after an application of all <em>payments </em>made by them, exceeded $400. This question is to be determined by the findings of the referee (Fuller <em>v. </em>Conde, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>89), which in this case state specifically the claims of the respective parties, the nature of the claims, and the payments made. It must be held in mind that payments go in <em>extinguishment </em>of the accounts, and that it is the <em>balance </em>unpaid after an application of the payments which settles the question of jurisdiction. In Crim <em>v. </em>Cronkhite (15 <em>How. Pr. </em>250) the referee found that the plaintiff\u2019s claims as proved amounted to $260.90 ; that the defendant\u2019s payments and counter-claim as established by the proof amounted to $232.28 ; and that the payments included in the latter sum amounted to $95.85. The recovery by the plaintiff being less than $50, it was held that the defendant was entitled to costs. In Matteson <em>v. </em>Bloomfield (10 <em>Wend. </em>555), the sum total of the plaintiff\u2019s demands <em>as proved </em>was $550.36. Payments were proved to have been made reducing the <em>balance </em>remaining due to less than $50. Costs to the' plaintiff were refused. In Mills <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. P. (10 <em>Wend. </em>557, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>note), the plaintiff\u2019s demands were in the aggregate $521.60. The defendant\u2019s set-off, as claimed, was $143, and his payments $374.68. The referee certified that the demand of the plaintiff, \u201c as established at the trial, exceeded $400, which was diminished more than. $300 by divers payments.\u201d The recovery was less than $50. Costs to the plaintiff were refused. In this case Judge Nelson said, \u201c The debts, demands and accounts of both parties <em>in </em>dispute, between them, did exceed $400. The accounts as exhibited, exceeded that sum, but payments were shown on each side; and as far forth as payments were made, the account or demand of each of the parties was extinguished.\u201d The learned judge added, in conclusion, \u201c The payments mutually made cannotbe considered as debts, demands, or accounts, within the meaning of this statute ; and deducting them from the accounts, the whole amount in controversy was less than $100.\u201d So in Lamoure v. Caryl (4 Denio, 370, 372), it is said that \u201cwhen payments have been made, the <em>balance only </em>would constitute a claim, demand or account within the statute.\u201d The same rule of construction is recognized in Fuller <em>v. </em>Conde (47 <em>N. Y. </em>89), and was there given application by the court. So it was held, in this case (Fuller v. Conde), that although the claims in suit exceeded $400, yet as there was an <em>extinguishment of them by payment </em>to an extent that left the balance less than $400, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery being less tlian $50, the defendant, and not the plaintiff, was entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Now, let us apply the law so settled by repeated decisions to the case in hand. The question is, did the balance of the accounts between the parties, after an allowance of the payments, exceed $400. Most certainly it did not. This is clearly shown by tabulating the items of the claims of the respective parties, setting down in the table the items of payment allowed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the referee. The case thus stands on the facts, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">Deft in account with pl\u2019ff\u2019s firm. Cb. Db.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqF\">Goods, etc...... . $308.28</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aye\">Cash advanced . \u2022 165.70</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtA\">$473.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT4Q\">By lumber, hides, etc. $69.83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">\u201c cash paid on account 198.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT3r\">\u201c payt. July 19, 1878 . 175.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT_K\">\u201c payt. Dec. 13, 1878 . 20.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6N\">Judgment for balance 10.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">$473.98 $473.98</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Now certainly, here are three items of payments, to wit, $198.90, $175.00, $20.00, $393.90. To this extent, according to the cases cited, the plaintiff\u2019s account, demand or claim yvas extinguished, and, to adopt the language of the court in Lamoure <em>v. </em>Caryl, \u201c the balance only constituted the claim, demand or account within the statute,\u201d to be considered in determing the question of jurisdiction. The balance in this case, under this construction of the law, was but $149.91; hence it was a case within the jurisdiction of a justice\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">It really makes no difference whether the defendant\u2019s payments be applied in extinguishment of the money advancements, or in extinguishment of the items for goods, etc., sold and delivered. If applied upon the demand, for money advanced, the payments extinguished that demand, and left abalance of $228.20 to apply on the item for goods, etc. If applied upon the demand for goods, etc., the payment extinguished that demand and left $85.62 to apply on the money advances. It comes to this, that the payments by the defendant operated in extinguishment of the plaintiff\u2019s demand <em>pro </em>tanto, and only the balance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the accounts between the parties can be taken into consideration in determining the question of jurisdiction here presented. Make the extinguishment by an application of the payments, and the balance of those accounts falls far short of $400. The case was therefore within the jurisdiction of a justice\u2019s court. I need not comment on the distinction which exists and to be observed, in cases like the present, between payment and set-off. The question here is as to the effect of payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The referee awarded costs to the plaintiff. In this, he was in error ; indeed, he had no right to pass upon that question (Fuller <em>v. </em>Conde, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>89). The right to costs is declared by statute, and is absolute on the facts found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">I am of the opinion therefore that the order appealed from should be reversed; and that the motion made by the defendant should be granted. This will, in effect, also reverse that part of the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The defendant should have $10 costs of appeal and disbursements for printing; and also $10 costs of motion at special term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
