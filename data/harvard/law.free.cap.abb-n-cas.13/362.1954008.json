Anger, for specific performance of defendant\u2019s contract for the purchase of certain real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\">Plaintiff claimed title to the premises under William J. Pease, who purchased them at a sale on foreclosure of a mortgage by one Bancker to one Mott. Prior to the sale on foreclosure, Bancker made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, which was duly recorded before the decree ; but the assignees were not made parties to the foreclosure suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">Prior to the assignment, Bancker\u2019s interest in the land had been sold by the sheriff on execution on an undocketed judgment, and after the assignment, the sheriff gave a deed of the land to another creditor of Bancker who had redeemed from the original purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and he became a party to the foreclosure suit, and applied for and received the surplus arising on the foreclosure sale as the owner of the equity of redemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">Defendant objected that the assignees had an interest in the land which had never been divested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">Defendant further objected that the conveyance to plaintiff by trustees under the will of Pease, was ineffectual to pass the title. Testator, after devising the residue of the estate, real and personal, in trust, to manage, rent, lease, &amp;c., directed the trustees, by the second subdivision of the trust, to \u201cinvest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>keep the principal of the personal estate of which I shall die possessed, and the proceeds of the sales of any real estate, in bonds secured by mortgage upon real estate within forty miles of New York City, which shall be a first lien upon the same, &amp;c.\u201d The further facts upon which this objection was based appear in full in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">It was also objected, thatin the conveyance to plaintiff by the trustees of whom the test\u00e1tor\u2019s widow was one, no mention was made of her dower.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-6\"><em>Browne &amp; Babe, </em>for plaintiff, cited the following authorities:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXn\">Smith v.

PitsJike, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU6\">I. Wurtz (and his successor), on his purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale, had only a fifteen months\u2019 lien on Bancker\u2019s undivested title, when this general assignment was made and the foreclosure took place ; and that lien was cut off by such foreclosure of a precedent mortgage (Southworth v. Scofield, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>513 ; <em>Exp. </em>Peru Iron Co., 7 <em>Cow. </em>540, 554). But the Iddings judgment itself has no hold on these premises, because of the neglect to docket it; wherefore the sheriff\u2019s sale only constituted the purchaser thereon a transferee of the judgment; and as such, he was foreclosed by operation of <em>L. </em>1840, <em>e. </em>342, | 9\u2014and he so took the surplus (see Catlin v. Jackson, 8 <em>Johns. </em>520 ; Klock v. Cronkhite, 1 Hill, 107, 110).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\">II. The unforeclosed \u201cgeneral assignees\u201d held the whole title (Briggs v. Davis, 21 <em>N. Y. </em>574, 577); and their rights do not (when the trust is accomplished) enure to the foreclosure vendee, or those claiming under him (Jackson v. Littel, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>108).</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">1 The general assignees, being on record before judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>toent in the foreclosure case, were requisite parties, though coming in but shortly before the decree (Hall v. Nelson, 14 <em>How. Pr. </em>32-35 ; Reed v. Marble, 10 Paige, 410, 414; Strong v. Dollner, 2 <em>Sandf. </em>444; Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co. v. McKay, 5 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>445, 450, 458; Hale v. Clauson, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>339, 341). The time of filing the complaint was, in chancery, the commencement of a foreclosure suit (Murray v. Blatchford, 1 <em>Wend. </em>583, 618 ; Leitch v. Wells, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>585, 594, 602, 604). The date of the assignment gives the time it was made (Costigan v. Gould, 5 <em>Pen. </em>290).</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-4\">III. Pease\u2019s trustees on selling, could not accept a second mortgage for the price or part thereof (Waldron v. McComb, 1 <em>Hill, </em>111, 112 ; Cumming v. Williamson, 1 <em>Sandf. Ch. 17, </em>25; Carpenter <em>v. </em>Stillwell, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>61, 76). But their vendee was bound to pay all in cash immediately on the sale or in a first mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">IY. The trustees, after such disposal of this property, had no power to re-acquire from Wilcox the realty as it was sold to him (Stokes v. Payne, 58 <em>Miss. </em>614; Hoyt <em>v. </em>Jacques, 129 <em>Mass. </em>286; Legrange v. Lamoureux, 1 <em>B. Ch. Rep. </em>19, 20).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">Y. The cash obtained (and yet to be had, in lieu of said second mortgage) formed a \u201ctrust fund,\u201d deemed real estate, belonging in whole or part to future issue, and therefore, so far inalienable (Dominick v. Michael, 4 <em>Sandf. </em>375, 399; Bloomer <em>v. </em>Waldron, 3 <em>Hill, </em>361, 364; Erwin v. Loper, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>521). Indeed, the omitted future issue can, hereafter, take the land itself, in their time (Ten Eyck v. Craig, 62 <em>N. Y. </em>406, 419 ; Boyd v. McLean, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>582, 587, 588 ; and see People v. Board, &amp;c., 15 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>527).</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-7\">YI. Pease\u2019s widow conveying as co-trustee, did not act individually; and she transferred only the testator\u2019s estate as at his death to plaintiff, and <em>that </em>was liable to \u201c dower.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-15\">For the present statute, see <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1430, &amp;c. Compare \u00a7\u00a7 1365, 1850.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Sedgwigk, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">The first objection is that the general assignees, &amp;c. of Bancker not being made parties to the foreclosure suit of Mott <em>v. </em>Bancker, their title has not been affected by the decree in that suit and is still outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We will first ask, what title did they acquire, by the assignment made to them by Bancker in trust fer his creditors ? The deed of assignment, on its face, conveyed only the interest in real estate that Bancker owned,- and the' assignees stood in Bancker\u2019s place. This deed of assignment was dated February 28,1843, and was recorded May 17,1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Bancker\u2019s title was affected by the following facts. March 5,1841, Iddings had obtained a judgment against Bancker, in the superior court. A transcript of the judgment was not docketed in the county clerk\u2019s office, and it was not a lien upon real estate. The sheriff, however, had power under <em>fieri facias, </em>to sell Bancker\u2019s interest in real estate. At this point, resort may be had to the statutes, for they clearly describe the rights and interests of the parties concerned in such a proceeding (2 <em>Edm. Stat. </em>383 <em>et seq.). </em>On the sale the sheriff shall make out the certificates of sale. In this case the interest was sold on February 1, 1842, to one Wurtz, and the certificate of sale delivered to him, within ten days thereafter. The interest thus sold is described in, and its qualities may be inferred from, the following clauses, .through the different sections. By \u00a7 45, the land so sold may be redeemed by the payment to the purchaser of the sum bid by him and interest at the rate of ten per cent. By \u00a7 46, this redemption may be made by the execution-debtor, or his heir or devisee, or by any grantee of such debtor, <em>e. g., </em>the general assignees in this case. In \u00a7 <em>BO, </em>the right acquired under the sale is called, \u201c the interest vested in the purchaser.\u201d In \u00a7 51, it is called, the rights of the original purchaser. In \u00a7 53, it is said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>that a junior judgment-creditor may acquire the title of the purchaser to the whole of such lot. In \u00a7 <em>54, </em>the interest of the purchaser is again said to be, the title of the purchaser to such undivided share or interest in the real estate. In \u00a7 <em>55, </em>the title of the original purchaser, is several times alluded to. In \u00a7 <em>58, </em>the right is called, \u201cthe title of the original purchaser to the premises sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In \u00a7 61, it is enacted that the right and title of the person against whom the execution was issued, to any real estate, which shall be sold thereby, shall not be <em>divested </em>by such sale until the expiration of fifteen months from the time of such sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">One Burtis, who became one of the general assignees of Bancker, redeemed from Wurtz, the original purchaser. In several cases it is said, that before the sheriff\u2019s deed is, by the statute, to be delivered, the right acquired by the purchaser is not a <em>title, </em>but is a <em>lien. </em>In Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall or Ramsey (3 <em>Cow. </em>79), it is said that the deeds relate back to the day of sale, by the sheriff (Smith <em>v. </em>Colvin, 17 <em>Barb. </em>162). And the application of such a doctrine will reconcile the apparent contradiction of the statutes that have been cited, in declaring that the purchaser has <em>title </em>and yet that the title of the execution-debtor is not divested.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">If the purchaser have a lien, it is manifest that it is not the lien of the judgment, but it is the lien of the sale. It is a lien of the character that is formed by the consequences of the sale, as enacted in the statute. The execution-deb tor, then, had the title, subject to being divested at the end of fifteen months, if there were no redemption. The purchaser had a lien, which at the end of fifteen months would ripen into a title, if there were no redemption ; and it was a lien, which upon ripening into a title, and when the debtor\u2019s title was divested, became, by relation, a <em>title from the time of sale. </em>Third parties did not become interested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>between the sale and the sheriff\u2019s deed, for, as has been already said, the general assignees stood in Bancker\u2019s shoes and had no other right than he had. Their interest in the land was a right to redeem for a certain time, with what was otherwise a naked title subject to being divested at the end of fifteen months from the sheriff\u2019s sale, and which was divested at the end of that time. The result is, that neither they, nor any one claiming under them, can have any interest in the premises which would entitle them to redeem from the Mott mortgage (Wright <em>v. </em>Douglas, <em>2 N.Y. </em>376; Miller <em>v. </em>Lewis 4 <em>Id. </em>558; Bank of Vergennes <em>v. </em>Warren, 7 <em>Hill, </em>93).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">It has been argued, that under \u00a79, act of 1840, chap. 342, inasmuch as judgment-creditors, and those claiming under them, were foreclosed without their having been made parties to the foreclosure-action, Burtis\u2019 interests, as one redeeming from the original purchaser, were foreclosed, his claim being under Iddings\u2019 judgment. I am of opinion, however, that his claim was not under the judgment, but under the sheriff\u2019s statutory power of sale, which, when consummated, by relation put him in privity with Bancker, the judgment-debtor, from the time of sale (Mason <em>v. </em>Lord, 40 <em>N. Y. </em>476).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Burtis, by petition, claiming to be the owner of the equity of redemption, made himself a party to the foreclosure proceedings, and took the surplus. This seemed to have been under section 10 of the act of 1840, c. 342. He, and all claiming under him, are estopped from questioning the title of Mr. Pease, the purchaser under the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">' The objection that has been now considered, is not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The second main objection, rests upon the trusts of the will of William J. Pease. My opinion is that the executors of the will were the devisees of the <em>land </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>trust, with the power in trust to sell the real-estate devised, for the purpose of changing the investment under the directions of the will, in the second subdivision of the trust\u2014that is, to invest the proceeds of the realty in bonds and mortgages which should be <em>\u201cfirst </em>liens,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The executors, therefore, had power to sell to Will-cox, for the purpose indicated. They sold to Mm in this wise : Wilcox paid them $5,000 in cash, but the remaining part of the consideration-money, viz. $7,000, in a <em>second mortgage, </em>the first mortgage being one by Willcox to The Mutual Insurance Company and given for the $5,000 which Willcox paid cash on the sale. As the executors had no power, at least under the conditions in proof, to raise money by mortgage, or invest any part of the consideration in second mortgage, and as Willcox was not only cognizant, but assisting in the violation of the trust and in the act which was without power, it may be assumed that any one of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>might reclaim the property from Willcox, and subject it to the trust; that is, while the trust was still unfulfilled, might demand that the title and possession be again placed in the trustees, or their successors. Any pecuniary claim, against Willcox and the trustees, for the violation of the trust, would affirm the title of Willcox; and this litigation respects <em>title </em>alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The fact was, that Willcox, by conveying the property <em>back </em>to the executors or trustees, gave the practical remedy to the wrong that had been done in the improper conveyance by the executors. The possible claim of a <em>cestui que trust, </em>as to the title, had thus been answered, and satisfied. If it be suggested, that the <em>cestui que trust </em>might elect to ask damages, for the executors not requiring Willcox to pay the amount of Ms bond and mortgage of $7,000 to the executors,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>then, as has been suggested, the sale to Willcox would be ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Disregarding for a moment the fact that, when the property was re-vested in the executors, there was the mortgage upon it to the Insurance Company, for $5,000, the condition of things was, that the property was in the same relation to the trust fund that it was before the sale to Willcox ; and as to it, the trustees had the power that has been described, under the trust, as to a change of investment. It would be, indeed, the duty of the trustees to sell, if expediency required it, and invest the proceeds in first mortgage. It cannot be said, that another sale would be beyond the power of the trustees, because the first sale was not <em>an exercise of </em>power, that power not having been given. The executors then had the power to sell to plaintiff Siegel, and the sale to him is only impeached on the assertion that it was for an inadequate consideration. Of this, however, there is no proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It may be said, that the premises were not returned to the executors in the same condition as when they were transferred by them to Willcox, inasmuch as, on their return, there was the mortgage of $5,000 still a lien upon them. I do not perceive that this objection is a reason for the defendants not taking title. If that mortgage were void, or voidable at the election of a <em>cestui que </em>trust, so far as that goes, the possibility of its being avoided would be a benefit to an owner of the property. So far as it is said to be a cloud upon title, the defendant cannot avoid it, because he has contracted with the plaintiff to pay it. So far as its , existence affected the <em>price </em>for which the property was sold to Siegel, the $5,000, which was the proceeds of this mortgage, represents any possible dimunition of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">As to Mrs. Pease\u2019s right of dower, her covenant in the executor\u2019s deed is personal, and extends to any estate she personally had.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>On the whole, I am of opinion that Mr. Pease had such a title by adverse possession, that the assignees could not now redeem, if at any time they had had an equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">There should be judgment for plaintiff as asked in 'the complaint, with costs. The case however is such that upon the defendant\u2019s appealing, a stay of proceedings on the judgment will be granted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\"> No appeal was taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
