STEEL, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 54) filed on May 8, 2018. Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition (Doc. # 59) on May 25, 2018. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This malicious prosecution case arises out of plaintiff David Swanson, Jr.'s arrest and prosecution for three controlled drug buys that took place in November and December of 2008. The underlying criminal prosecution resulted in a guilty verdict for which plaintiff served over three years imprisonment. Plaintiff's convictions and sentences were subsequently vacated due to ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's failure to present alibi evidence, and the State thereafter dismissed the charges against Swanson. Plaintiff then filed this lawsuit. The operative pleading alleges both common law and Section 1983 claims against all defendants for malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments (Counts I-IV) and a claim for conspiracy (Count V). (Doc. # 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment, arguing that probable cause existed for Swanson's arrest and prosecution, or alternatively, that they are entitled to qualified immunity because the officers had at least arguable probable cause to arrest Swanson. Plaintiff responds that he was arrested and prosecuted without either probable cause or arguable probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate only when the Court is satisfied that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

November 13, 2008 - The First Controlled Buy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After receiving a tip from a confidential informant, on November 13, 2008, the Lee County Sheriff's Office Special Investigation Division Narcotics Unit conducted an undercover operation at the Oaks at Omni Apartments in Fort Myers, Florida to purchase crack cocaine from a black male known as \"Ed.\" Defendant Jonathan S. Armato was the lead detective for the operation. (Doc. # 54-5, 13:16-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The confidential informant informed Detective Robert E. Smith that a drug dealer was working out of the apartments, and provided a cellular telephone number for Ed. (Doc. # 54-1, Smith Civ. Depo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , 14:10-16.) On a recorded line, the confidential informant and Detective Smith called Ed to arrange the drug deal. (Doc. # 54-2, Smith Crim. Depo. 4:1-7, 5:6-6:6.) Ed directed the pair to the Omni Apartments' parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once there, Detective Smith saw a black male exit the apartments and approach the car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 6:9-25.) The black male identified himself as Ed and handed Detective Smith several pieces of crack cocaine in exchange for money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 5:6-6:25.) Ed then returned to the apartment building, and Detective Smith observed him go to the second or third floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 7:4-11.) The transaction occurred in the late afternoon. (Doc. # 54-1, 29:5-7.) Although several other deputies were involved in the operation, only Detective Smith personally observed Ed, and this was for less than three minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 54-1, 31:17-22; Doc. # 54-3, Armato Civ. Depo., 6:22-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Identification of Plaintiff's Photograph\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next day, in an effort to determine Ed's true name, Detective Armato contacted the property manager at the Omni Apartments and requested a list of residents living in the building Ed was seen exiting during the first controlled buy. (Doc. # 54-5, 15:20-16:24.) Several names were given, including plaintiff's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 7:16-22.) Plaintiff Swanson was the only black male living in the particular building where Ed was seen exiting. (Doc. # 54-4, Swanson Depo., 36:2-9.) Following the meeting with the property manager, a photo of Swanson was located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detectives Armato and Smith have provided conflicting testimony as to whether Detective Armato located a single photograph and showed it to Smith, or whether an array of photographs including both plaintiff and other individuals was obtained and shown to Smith. Their testimony also varies as to who first located Swanson's photograph.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 54-1, 28:12-25; 36:22-37:5; 49:16-19; 59:6-20; Doc. # 54-2, 7:2-8:15; Doc. # 54-3, 7:9-8:4; Doc. # 54-5, Armato Civ. Depo., 18:18-19:19; 61:9-23; Doc. # 54-10, Crim. Tr., 102:25, 141:5-13. In any event, on November 14, 2008, Detective\n   Smith signed a color photograph identifying plaintiff as the drug dealer known as \"Ed.\" (Doc. # 54-1, 34:8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. December 3, 2008 - Second Controlled Buy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 3, 2008, Detective Smith participated in a second controlled buy with Ed. (Doc. # 54-1, 33:9-11.) By this time, Smith understood Ed to be David Swanson, Jr. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 34:5-7.) Calling the phone number provided by the confidential informant, Detective Smith arranged to meet Ed at the Omni Apartments to purchase marijuana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 33:17-21.) Ed came down the staircase to the car where the drugs and money were exchanged. (Doc. # 54-2, 11:8-12:17.) Smith was face-to-face with Ed for three to four minutes. (Doc. # 54-1, 33:12-16.) Following this second transaction, Detective Smith identified Swanson as Ed from a single photograph. (Doc. # 54-1, 48:21-49:19; 60:9-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. December 5, 2008 - The Buy-Bust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Detective Armato wanted to conduct a third, buy-bust operation and arrest Ed during the exchange. On the date selected, however, Detective Smith was out sick. Nonetheless, Detective Smith called Ed on the phone number used for the previous transactions and asked if someone else could pick up Vicodin pills. Detective Smith identified the voice on the phone as the same person he had dealt with in the second transaction. (Doc. # 54-10, 108:3-5.) Ed agreed, and Deputy Eric M. Zercher conducted the final undercover buy. (Doc. # 54-2, 13:1-14.) Unlike the other officers, Deputy Zercher was familiar with Swanson from his time as a patrol officer. He knew Swanson well enough to identify him by face and name. (Doc. # 54-6, Zercher Crim. Depo., 5:15-21.) Zercher was informed that the Lee County Sheriff's Office was targeting David Swanson that day, who was going by the street name Ed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 5:2-4, 7:24-8:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Using the same procedure as the first two buys, Deputy Zercher drove to the Omni Apartments and called Ed to arrange a pick up. Once in the parking lot, Deputy Zercher identified Swanson standing approximately sixty feet away on a second-floor balcony using a cell phone. (Doc. # 54-6, 6:4-11; Doc. # 54-10, 125:19-24.) Comparing the conversation with Swanson's movements and lips, Deputy Zercher concluded that Swanson was the person on the other end of the line - that Swanson was Ed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 6:12-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Zercher observed Swanson walk down the stairs with a second black male who Deputy Zercher recognized as Luis Powell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 54-5, 6:17-24.) Once descended, Swanson gestured and directed Powell towards Zercher's vehicle. Powell proceeded to Deputy Zercher's vehicle, and Swanson walked around the corner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 6:24-7:1.) Powell entered the car and showed Deputy Zercher the drugs. The take-down signal was given and several officers came to arrest Powell. Swanson was also arrested, without a warrant, at his mailbox around the corner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 7:2-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The day of plaintiff's arrest, Detective Armato prepared a probable cause statement (Doc. # 59-1, pp. 3-5) and Deputy Zercher prepared a sworn statement (Doc. # 59-2). Deputy Zercher's sworn statement did not mention that Swanson had directed Powell towards Zercher's vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Swanson and Powell dispute Deputy Zercher's version of events during the\n   buy-bust. Swanson claims that as he was coming down the stairs on the way to check his mail and passed Powell and his friends standing in the stairwell. Swanson claims that he did not have his cell phone with him but had left it in his apartment while going to check his mail. (Doc. # 54-1, 132:1-20, 135:17-19.) Swanson asserts that Powell did not follow Swanson down the stairs but stayed up on the stairwell landing while Swanson went to his mailbox. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 132:24-133:6.) As Swanson began to unlock his mailbox, he was arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 136:3-139:13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As to Powell's version of events, Powell testified that he received a call on his cell phone from the buyer while Swanson was in the apartment, and that Swanson knew nothing about it. (Doc. # 54-8, 42:18-24.) While talking on the phone, Powell walked down the stairs towards the car to conduct the drug deal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 43:3-13.) While walking down the stairs, Powell realized that Swanson was coming down the stairs behind him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 44:6-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although it is undisputed that a cell phone was recovered at the arrest scene, it is disputed whether it was recovered from plaintiff or Luis Powell. Detective Armato testified that a cell phone was recovered from Swanson at the scene, but it was not listed in the chain of custody evidence list. (Doc. # 54-5, 21:22-23:22, 28:7-9.) Detective Armato testified that after the cell phone was recovered from Swanson, Deputy Zercher called the number he had used to contact Ed and the cell phone rang. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 31:4-11; 36:10-18.) Swanson, on the other hand, says that officers did not retrieve a phone from him (Doc. # 54-10, 194:12-14) and Powell says that officers seized his cell phone at the scene. (Doc. # 54-8, 73:22-23.) No one in the investigation determined who owned the phone associated with the number that Deputy Zercher had called. (Doc. # 54-5, 31:21-24.) Swanson's mother, Barbara Smith, who went to the arrest scene, testified that Powell's phone was taken from him and that Swanson's cell phone was still in his apartment after the arrest. (Doc. # 54-9, 42:21-43:2.) Swanson's sister, Javarsha, retrieved Swanson's cell phone from his apartment after the arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 43:3-44:5.) Although a cell phone was admitted into evidence at Swanson's criminal trial, no cell phone records were presented and the Lee County Sheriff's Office did not subpoena any cell phone records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Post-Arrest and Alibi Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After arrest, Swanson denied that he was involved in any drug transactions. During Swanson's interrogation, Swanson claimed that police had the wrong guy, and told officers: \"I don't know what you all are talking about, I work at the airport and you all got the wrong guy, and I keep telling them that and so they sent me to jail.\" (Doc. # 54-4, 105:24-106:5.) Although the officers told plaintiff the dates of the drug buys he was being charged with, Swanson did not provide any further detail to police, such as his whereabouts during the dates and times of the previous drug buys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 105:10-106:5, 164:15-165:3.) Swanson was released from jail on bond that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 108:4-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At his deposition in this civil case, Swanson testified that the day after his arrest Powell called him and apologized, admitting that he was responsible for the drug sales that led to their arrest. (Doc. # 54-4, 102:15-103:11, 111:10-11, 125:12-19.) Swanson told his immediate family about Powell's confession; however, he did not tell anyone else. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 111:12-19.) Despite the possibility of a significant prison sentence, neither Swanson nor his family alerted the Lee County Sheriff's Office about Powell's confession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 100:18-25; 112:21-24.) In Swanson's words, \"I told [the Sheriff's Office] I didn't do it. I didn't tell them who\n   did...that's not my business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 113:11-16.) Powell's mother, Trenice Swanson, also testified that Powell told her that Swanson didn't do any of the things he was charged with, and that it was Powell who conducted the drug deals. (Doc. # 54-7, 30:3-17.) Ms. Swanson shared this information with Swanson's criminal attorney but did not tell the defendant officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 31:2-21.) At Powell's deposition, he testified that he did not tell police that he had done the things that Swanson was charged with because he \"didn't want to get in worse trouble.\" (Doc. # 54-8, 63:17-22; 69:25-70:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Swanson also had alibi evidence that he did not mention to the police at the time of his arrest or before his prosecution. According to Swanson, he was at his mother's (Barbara Smith) house during the first drug buy and at work at the Southwest Florida International Airport for the second. (Doc. # 54-4, 94:23-95:25, 98:8-101:14, 117:6-11.) He alleges that there were witnesses and documents to corroborate his alibi. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 96:1-6, 118:3-14; 121:22-122:3.) Swanson states that this information was provided to his criminal trial attorney, yet it was never communicated to the defendant officers. Swanson testified that he never produced exculpatory evidence to the Lee County Sheriff's Office prior to (or during) his trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 147:15-149:23.) Every witness deposed in this case has likewise confirmed that they did not provide any exculpatory information to the Lee County Sheriff's Office following Swanson's arrest. (Doc. # 54-7, Trenice Swanson Depo., 29:1-31:16; Doc. # 54-8, Powell Depo., 69:3-15; Doc. # 54-9, Barbara Smith Depo., 35:6-36:13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Swanson's Criminal Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On July 14, 2009, Swanson proceeded to a one-day jury trial on five charges - sale and possession of cocaine for the November 13, 2008 transaction; sale and possession of marijuana for the December 3, 2008 transaction; and drug trafficking for the December 5, 2008 transaction. Defendants Smith, Armato, and Zercher were called as witnesses for the State. (Doc. # 54-10, Crim. Tr.) In defense, Swanson offered only one witness - himself. Swanson did not testify that Powell confessed to him. Although Swanson testified that he was at his mom's during the first transaction, and at work during the second drug transaction, he offered nothing to corroborate this alibi. (Doc. # 54-4, 99:3-20.) The jury found Swanson guilty on all charges, and his conviction was upheld on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Post-Conviction Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Several years later, Swanson moved to vacate his sentence due, in part, to ineffective assistance of counsel; namely, his counsel's failure to present exculpatory evidence at trial. (Doc. # 54-11.) Among other things, Swanson had provided his counsel with a timesheet that showed he was at work during the second drug buy, which defense counsel never introduced at trial. (Doc. # 54-9, 33:7-34:10.) Defense counsel also never called any of Swanson's family members, who could have corroborated his alibi testimony. Presented with these facts, which were unknown at the time of trial, the State agreed to vacate Swanson's sentence. (Doc. # 54-11.) The State subsequently dropped the charges. (Doc. # 28, \u00b6 66.) The evidence from Swanson's criminal case was purged in 2015. (Doc. # 54-1, 43:2-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Florida Malicious Prosecution Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Counts I through III of the Amended Complaint set forth claims under Florida law for malicious prosecution. (Doc. # 28,\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-94.) Specifically, plaintiff alleges defendants committed the following:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Count I v. Zercher\n   </strong>\n   - Zercher made a statement on December 5, 2008 under oath which aided the institution of criminal action against plaintiff for which no arguable probable cause existed; and testified falsely against plaintiff at his criminal trial. (Doc. # 28, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II v.

Smith also took no steps to verify essential information or identify additional witnesses to confirm the identification of Swanson as Ed.

Probable Cause to Arrest/Detain - Initiation of Criminal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Giving plaintiff the benefit of each and every factual inference and dispute, defendants knew the following at the time of plaintiff's arrest: Detective Smith had conducted two face-to-face drug buys at the Omni Apartments with a black male named Ed and had the opportunity to see Ed for about three minutes on each occasion. Detective Smith identified Swanson as Ed by viewing a photograph after each controlled buy. Swanson resided in the relevant apartment building and was the only black male living at the building. Detective Smith spoke to Ed to set up the third transaction and identified the voice as the same individual who was involved in the first two transactions. During the third buy, Deputy Zercher identified Swanson as the person he called to initiate the drug buy and testified that Swanson gestured Powell towards Zercher's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Swanson argues that there was insufficient probable cause because Detective Smith was only shown a single photograph of Swanson by Detective Armato on the day after the first controlled buy, making the procedure unduly suggestive and not sufficiently reliable. But showing a single photograph does not inherently taint an identification. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Detective Smith made a hand-to-hand purchase of crack cocaine from Swanson in a vehicle on November 13, 2008, where he had the opportunity to view Swanson in close proximity in daylight for approximately three minutes. There was a short time between the first undercover drug buy and the officers' confirmation of defendant's identity when Detective Armato visited the apartment complex to speak with the manager the next day. Detective Smith then viewed Swanson for about three minutes during the second drug transaction. Detective Smith has never expressed doubt as to his identification. Based on this record, Deputy Smith's identification stands as trustworthy and would cause a prudent person to believe that Swanson committed the offenses alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Swanson also argues that prior to arrest a reasonable officer would have confirmed whether Swanson was Ed through \"additional witnesses and other verifiable evidence.\" (Doc. # 28, \u00b6 86.) However, an arresting officer is under no \"affirmative obligation to seek out exculpatory information of which the officer is not aware\" or \"track down every lead\" before making an arrest.\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

While the Court agrees that there is a dispute, even taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and assuming that the cell phone was Powell's and not Swanson's, probable cause would still exist for plaintiff's arrest. Detective Smith identified Swanson as Ed following two close face-to-face encounters, totaling more than seven minutes, and Deputy Zercher observed Swanson, who he was familiar with from his own personal experience, gesture Powell towards the vehicle during the buy-bust before walking off. This is sufficient for probable cause to arrest plaintiff for possession and sale even absent any evidence that it was Swanson's cell phone used for the drug transactions. Additionally, regardless of the ownership of the cell phone, there was ample probable cause to arrest Swanson for the first two drug sales.
