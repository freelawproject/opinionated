The argument that an agency's refusal to adopt a proposed rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposal might be true when the agency's statement of its then-existing policy and its proposal are both accurate. Here, however, where the Secretary misstated the agency's then-existing policy, the Court finds that the Secretary's refusal to adopt the agency's proposed rule cannot be presumed to be a logical outgrowth of the proposal, because the inaccuracy of the policy statement necessarily distorts the context of the proposed rule.

However, the Court finds that Empire challenges the Secretary's policy regarding the determination of which individuals are entitled to SSI benefits, which is not adopted as a substantive rule and which does not relate to the specific legal question of the validity of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Instead, Empire asks this Court to determine whether the Secretary's policy regarding the determination of which individuals are entitled to SSI benefits is valid, which is not within the scope of the Board's grant for expedited judicial review. Empire's attempts to frame the SSI entitlement issue in terms of the DPP provision fail. Accordingly, the Secretary's policy regarding the assessment of SSI entitlement falls outside the scope of the Court's jurisdiction in this matter and will not be addressed by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
