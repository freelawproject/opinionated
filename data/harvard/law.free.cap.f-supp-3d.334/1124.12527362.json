Christensen, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On June 15, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction/Temporary Restraining Order (Doc. 6) supported by the declaration of Michael Garrity, the Executive Director of Plaintiff Alliance for the Wild Rockies (\"AWR\"), and an excerpt of the Flathead National Forest Plan Amendment 21 Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"Amendment 21\"). (Docs. 6-1; 6-2.) On June 27, 2018, this Court granted Plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order. (Doc. 8 at 5.) On June 29, 2018, Defendants filed both a Motion to Dissolve Temporary Restraining Order (Doc. 10) and a Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1 (Doc. 12), which is Amendment 21. Per the Court's Order, the temporary restraining order automatically expired on July 20, 2018, the day a hearing on Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction was held. (Doc. 8 at 5.) Consequently, Defendants' Motion to Dissolve the Temporary Restraining Order will be denied as moot. For the following reasons, Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction will be granted and Defendants Motion to Strike will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At issue is the United States Forest Service's (\"USFS\") North Hebgen Project\n   in the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Plaintiffs assert that Defendants failed to conduct Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\") consultation on Gallatin Forest Plan Amendment 51 (\"Amendment 51\"), the Forest Plan controlling the North Hebgen Project, despite the fact that the changes included in Amendment 51 may have an effect on lynx, a species listed as threatened under the ESA (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (citing A-5:NH000224).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Amendment 51 replaced the existing standard requiring the retention of 30% of \"old growth\" forest with a less-stringent standard pertaining to \"over-mature\" forest, which would allow the initially non-compliant North Hebgen Project to comply with the forest plan. (Doc. 6 at 24-25 (citing D-7:NH002605-06).) Plaintiffs argue that this change, compounded with numerous other changes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"collectively reduce the quality and amount of 'old growth' and mature forest protection on the Gallatin National Forest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.) Moreover, Plaintiffs point out that USFS noted that the replacement of the \"old growth\" standard with the \"over-mature\" standard has \" 'a potential effect on wildlife associated with old growth.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (quoting D-10: NH003238).) After pointing to the alleged concession on the part of USFS, Plaintiffs cite to Amendment 21 as proof that USFS considers \"lynx to be a species associated with old growth forest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (citing Doc. 6-2 at 59, 61).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that USFS' statement that Amendment 51 could have \"a potential effect on wildlife associated with old growth\" coupled with USFS' statement in Amendment 21\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that lynx \"is included on the list of old growth associated species,\" means that Amendment 51 \"may effect\" lynx. (Doc. 16 at 8-11.) Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that USFS also states that Amendment 51 \"could possibly [have] some beneficial effect to [Threatened, Endangered, or Sensitive (\"TES\") ] wildlife\" immediately succeeding a discussion of Amendment 51's effect on bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and lynx, meaning that Amendment 51 is considered to have a potential beneficial effect on lynx. (Doc. 6 at 27 (quoting D-10:NH003247).) Plaintiffs contend that these statements clearly indicate that Amendment 51 may have an effect on lynx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"An agency has a duty to consult under Section 7 of the ESA for any discretionary agency action that may affect a listed species or designated critical habitat.\"\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe of California v.

Plaintiffs assert that Defendants failed to \"conduct ESA Section 7 consultation on Amendment 51 for lynx or lynx critical habitat\" despite the fact that Amendment 51 may affect lynx. (Doc. 6 at 28.) Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction enjoining the North Hebgen Project while this Court determines the merits of their claim. As Plaintiffs' Motion relies partially on the supplementation of the record, the Court begins by addressing Defendants' Motion to Strike Amendment 21 from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Doc. 15 at 2-3.) This Court has held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Kraayenbrink\n   </em>\n   leaves us uncertain whether the panel discarded the APA record review rule entirely or simply found that the extra-record documents presented to the district court in that case fit within one of the four standard exceptions outlined above. The better view, in the opinion of this Court, is that the traditional four exceptions still apply to plaintiffs' requests for supplementation of the administrative record for ESA claims, but the narrowness of the construction and application of these exceptions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lands Council v.

Absent more conclusive guidance, the Court maintains this position regarding the applicability of the Ninth Circuit's statements in\n   <em>\n    Kraayenbrink\n   </em>\n   to the four exceptions for supplementation of the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that the proposed extra-record submissions fit within these relaxed exceptions in this case.\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089927\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/930/#p943\">\n    450 F.3d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, Plaintiffs have presented no argument concerning the application of any of the four exceptions. Nonetheless, the Court finds Plaintiffs' statement made during oral argument-that they included Amendment 21 to provide a quotation from the Forest Service saying that lynx are an old growth associated species-amenable to application of the third exception. Amendment 21 states that \"lynx [are] included on the list of old growth associated species.\" (Doc. 6-2 at 59.) Although the Court remains without an explanation for\n   why Plaintiffs neglected to approach supplementation in this manner, the Court is satisfied that it is within the Court's discretion to allow supplementation of the record to explain that lynx are an old growth associated species. Consequently, Defendant's Motion to Strike will be denied and the Court declines to address the Parties' additional arguments on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Lynx Amendment only applies to \"mapped lynx habitat on National Forest System land presently occupied by Canada lynx.\" D-3:NH002396. While this project does include mapped lynx habitat, the entire project is not \"mapped lynx habitat\" and, therefore, the Lynx Amendment does not apply to all areas affected by Amendment 51. Additionally, Defendants consider lynx \"to be present on the [Hebgen Lake Ranger] District.\" A-5:NH000226. This statement does not differentiate between the entire Hebgen Lake Ranger District and those areas already designated as mapped as lynx habitat, instead implying that lynx may be present anywhere in the District. Since Lynx may be present in areas outside of mapped lynx habitat, yet still within the area affected by Amendment 51, there are potentially areas where the changes implemented by Amendment 51 \"may affect\" lynx but where compliance with the Lynx Amendment is not required. If changes implemented in Amendment 51 could have \"a potential effect on wildlife associated with old growth,\" irrespective of where on the project these effects are felt, then Amendment 51 \"may effect\" lynx irrespective of the Lynx Amendment, creating the potential that Plaintiffs arguments are not irrelevant and deserve more deliberative investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have established \"fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberative investigation,\"\n   <em>\n    Republic of the Philippines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825659\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/1355/#p1362\">\n    862 F.2d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , regarding whether Amendment 51 \"may affect\" lynx-\"a relatively low threshold for triggering [Section 7] consultation,\"\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886234\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1006/#p1027\">\n    681 F.3d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the Court is convinced that this finding is consistent with the policy of \"institutional caution\" Congress intended to \"guide district courts when confronted with requests for injunctive relief in ESA cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233197\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1075/#p1091\">\n    789 F.3d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Since lynx may be present in areas outside of those areas within the project designated as mapped lynx habitat, the Court is wary of allowing project activities to proceed which could diminish the viability of old growth forest, which is the \"most stable and consistent annual forest structure type for snowshoe hares and lynx.\" P-70:NH022454.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Irreparable Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has established that demonstrating \"irreparable injury should not be an onerous task for plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233197\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1075/#p1091\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1091 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201531\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Consistent with this statement, the Ninth Circuit has been satisfied by a showing that plaintiffs \"use the project area for wildlife viewing, and the projects will clearly cause harm to significant portions of lynx habitat,\"\n   <em>\n    Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20Fed.%20Appx.%20515\">\n    663 Fed.

Here, Plaintiffs have expressed just such use and desire through the declaration of Michael Garrity (\"Garrity\"). (Doc. 6-1 at 2-5.) Garrity states that AWR members have a particular interest in viewing \"old growth associated wildlife species undisturbed in their natural surroundings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) As further explained by Garrity, \"[i]f operations are allowed to proceed as planned, the area will be irreversibly degraded because once logging occurs, the Forest Service\n   cannot put the trees back on the stumps, and our interests in the area will be irreparably harmed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Court is convinced that Garrity's declaration satisfies Plaintiffs' non-onerous task of establishing irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs \"fail to demonstrate that irreparable harm to the lynx is likely from the North Hebgen Project.\" (Doc. 9 at 29.)

Cal. Aug. 13, 2013), Defendants claim that Plaintiffs need a \" 'concrete showing of probable deaths' arising from the Project [and] 'how these deaths may impact the species.' \" (Doc. 9 at 29.) However, this assertion is insupportable when the cited decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California was prior to the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood\n   </em>\n   , is inconsistent with that Court's directive that \"establishing irreparable injury should not be an onerous task\" in ESA cases,\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233197\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1075/#p1091\">\n    789 F.3d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and involved a request for \"mandatory injunctive relief\" which \"goes well beyond simply maintaining the status quo,\"\n   <em>\n    S.

The Court is convinced that, without Section 7 consultation, the reduction of old growth forest across the project area could potentially cause irreparable injury to lynx, consistent with the Court's policy of \"institutionalized caution\" regarding potential harm to TES wildlife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Citing to\n   <em>\n    Oakland Tribune, Inc. v.

Defendants state that Plaintiffs were aware that the project was going to begin on July 1, 2018, as early as August 31, 2017-nearly ten months before Plaintiffs filed their Motion on June 15, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) However, Defendants expect more from the cited cases than their facts will allow. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Oakland Tribune\n   </em>\n   was addressing a problem which had \"been in effect for a number of years.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366134\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/1374/#p1377\">\n    762 F.2d at 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while the Court in\n   <em>\n    Lydo Enterprises\n   </em>\n   was dealing with a plaintiff who had \"delayed five years before taking any action,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"592963\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1211/#p1213\">\n    745 F.2d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Flint\n   </em>\n   , the delay of approximately one year was \"not alone a basis to withhold relief, [but] is a fact to be considered in measuring the claim of urgency.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182122\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/336/1065/#p1070\">\n    336 F.Supp.2d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we are dealing with a delay of months. While the timing of Plaintiffs Motion is not ideal for either the Defendants or the Court, the Court is not convinced that a ten-month delay should impact the efficacy of Plaintiffs' request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lastly, Defendants contend that any injunction should be limited solely to those \"portions of the Project that could affect lynx habitat.\" (Doc. 9 at 38.) However, as discussed above, Plaintiffs allege that Amendment 51 will reduce old growth forest across the project area which, in turn, may affect lynx that are considered to be present in these areas. Accordingly, the entire project must be enjoined to preserve the status quo until a decision on the merits can be reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of the above, IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion (Doc. 5) is GRANTED.

(Doc. 9 at 30-37.) Because these factors \"\n    <em>\n     always\n    </em>\n    tip in favor of the protected species,\" the Court declines to address Defendants' balance of equities and public interest arguments.\n    <em>\n     Cottonwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233197\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1075/#p1091\">\n     789 F.3d at 1090-91\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Although Defendants assert that it has not been conceded that Amendment 51 \"may affect\" lynx, their argument does not focus on persuading the Court of this.
