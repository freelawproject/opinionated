SUMMARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Johnson Khath and Virginia Newton in these consolidated cases are Massachusetts residents with credit card debt who each initiated a putative class action suit against defendant Midland Funding, LLC (\"Midland\"), a debt collection company. Plaintiffs claim that Midland has harmed Massachusetts residents by wrongfully operating in the state without a debt collector license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Khath and Newton filed their cases against Midland in the Massachusetts Superior Court. Midland removed the cases to federal court, where they were consolidated. The cases were referred to the Magistrate Judge for pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Midland has twice moved to compel arbitration and stay the instant proceedings or, in the alternative, to dismiss plaintiffs' claims. On January 20, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued an Order denying without prejudice Midland's first Motion to Compel Arbitration, finding that evidence then in the record did not demonstrate an unbroken chain of assignment to Midland of the plaintiffs' credit card accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 82 at 11-12 (the \"January 20, 2017 Order\"). The Magistrate Judge also found a triable issue existed concerning whether the credit card agreement produced by Midland, which contains an arbitration clause, governs Newton's account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 14, 2017, the Magistrate Judge granted in part and denied in part Midland's Renewed Motion to Compel Arbitration. Docket No. 116 (the \"August 14, 2017 Order\"). The Magistrate Judge ordered\n   Khath to arbitrate, finding that Midland had presented sufficient evidence to prove that Khath's credit account was assigned to it, and that an agreement to arbitrate exists between Khath and Midland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 9. The Magistrate Judge also held that the validity of the Class Action Waiver provision found in Khath's credit card agreement was an issue that the agreement reserved for the court, as Midland conceded at oral argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. However, she decided to stay litigation concerning the validity of the Class Action Waiver provision until after arbitration of Khath's individual claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Magistrate Judge denied the Renewed Motion to Compel with respect to Newton, reaffirming her earlier ruling that a triable issue remains concerning whether an agreement to arbitrate exists between Newton and Midland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Now pending before the court are the plaintiffs' objections to the Magistrate Judge's January 20, 2017 Order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 83, and both parties' objections to the Magistrate Judge's August 14, 2017 Order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 117 &amp; 118. For the reasons set forth below, the court is affirming the Magistrate Judge's January 20, 2017 Order. The court is modifying in part the August 14, 2017 Order because the Magistrate Judge must decide whether the Class Action Waiver in Khath's credit card agreement is valid before ordering Khath to arbitrate because the Class Action Waiver provides that if it is found to be invalid the agreement to arbitrate is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following undisputed facts are taken from the Magistrate Judge's January and August 2017 Orders, and the record as cited in those Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Khath opened a credit card account with FIA Card Services, N.A. (\"FIA\") on or about October 11, 2007 (the \"Khath Account\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46-1 (\"Burger-Khath Decl.\") \u00b6 11. The Khath Account number originally ended in 5191, but was changed to end in 2958 after it was closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Khath incurred charges on his account after opening it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 (billing records for Khath Account dated between September 2008 and May 2009). The Khath Account was closed on April 30, 2009 with an outstanding balance of $1,028.56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burger-Khath Decl. \u00b6 14. Midland then allegedly purchased the rights to the Khath Account and sought to collect the debt by suing Khath in state court, which entered judgment in Khath's favor. Midland has submitted a credit card agreement that it argues governs the Khath Account and requires Khath to arbitrate his claims against Midland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2 (the \"FIA Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Newton opened a credit card account with Chase Bank USA, N.A. (\"Chase\") on or about September 9, 2001 (the \"Newton Account\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46-2 (\"Burger-Newton Decl.\") \u00b6 11. The Newton Account number ends in 0189.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Newton incurred charges on her account after opening it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., Ex. 1 (billing records for Newton Account dated between August 2007 and December 2008). On February 27, 2009, the Newton Account was closed with an outstanding balance of $21,798.45.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burger-Newton Decl. \u00b6 14. Midland allegedly purchased the rights to the Newton\n   Account from Chase and sought to collect the debt by suing Newton in state court, where Midland obtained a default judgment against her. Midland has submitted a credit card agreement that it contends governs the Newton Account and requires Newton to arbitrate her claims against Midland as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2 (the \"Chase Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When a party timely objects to a non-dispositive ruling of a magistrate judge on a pretrial matter, the district judge must modify or set aside any part of the order that is \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" 28 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(A) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). An order compelling arbitration is a non-dispositive ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PowerShare, Inc. v. Syntel, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220262\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/10/#p14\">\n    597 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14-15 (1st Cir. 2010). In both of her Orders, the Magistrate Judge characterized the motions to compel arbitration as non-dispositive and held, therefore, that she could decide the motions subject to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 20, 2017 Order at 2 n.2; Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 2 n.2. No party objected to this conclusion, which is in any event correct. Therefore, the Magistrate Judge's rulings are reviewed under the foregoing standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The \"clearly erroneous\" standard requires that the district judge accept the magistrate judge's findings of fact and the conclusions drawn from them \"unless, after scrutinizing the entire record, [the court] form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Phinney v.

The Magistrate Judge, therefore, denied Midland's first Motion to Compel Arbitration without prejudice, inviting the submission of additional evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, in her August 14, 2017 Order, the Magistrate Judge found that Midland had submitted sufficient evidence in support of its Renewed Motion to prove that both the Khath and Newton Accounts were assigned to Midland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 5.

However, the Magistrate Judge did not act \"contrary to law\" in declining to rule on the issue preclusion argument at the time because she had discretion to deny the motion to compel without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oliveira v.

The Maiden District Court judgment is a single-page form and does not explain the court's reasons for entering judgment for Khath. On the present record, this court cannot find that the Maiden District Court decided that Midland did not own the Khath account, which is the issue Khath seeks to preclude litigation of now. Although Khath's attorney's affidavit asserts that the ownership issue was his sole defense at the Maiden District Court trial, Khath's answer filed in that case contains numerous defenses.

Burger-Khath Decl., Ex. 6 (\"Bialkowski Aff.\"). Midland also produced a printout of electronic data concerning the Khath Account that it represents it received from Asset in the November 21, 2013 sale, but the data itself does not contain any reference to the sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burger-Khath Decl., Ex. 7 (electronic data).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Magistrate Judge found in her January 20, 2017 Order that this evidence was insufficient to prove that the Khath Account was in the portfolio of accounts that Asset sold to Midland in November 2013 because neither the Asset Bill of Sale nor the Bialkowski Affidavit identified Khath's Account, by name or number, as part of the portfolio sold to Midland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 2017 Order at 5, 11-12.

It also shows that Asset purchased the Khath Account from Bank of\n   America on May 18, 2009, and then sold the account to Midland on November 21, 2013. In addition, Midland submitted a declaration of Elizabeth MacLean, an authorized representative and records custodian for Asset, stating that Asset received this raw data concerning the Khath Account from FIA before transferring it to Midland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 97 (\"MacLean Decl.\") \u00b6 \u00b6 1-2, 5. After considering the additional evidence, the Magistrate Judge found that Midland had been sold the Khath Account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similarly, to demonstrate ownership of the Newton Account, Midland initially submitted the following evidence.

Midland produced a printout of electronic data concerning the Newton Account that it allegedly received from Chase in the October 20, 2010 sale, but the data itself does not indicate whether the Newton Account was part of the portfolio Midland purchased from Chase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753212\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1/#p4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753212\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1/#p4\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 7 (electronic data). Christine Sallie, an Officer of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., stated in her affidavit that Chase \"sold a pool of charged-off accounts\" to Midland and provided electronic records to Midland as part of the sale, but again, she does not reference the Newton Account specifically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753212\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1/#p4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753212\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1/#p4\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 4 (\"Sallie Aff.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As with Khath, the Magistrate Judge found this initial evidence insufficient to prove that the Newton Account was in the pool of accounts that Chase sold to Midland in October 2010 because neither the Chase Bill of Sale nor the Sallie Affidavit identified Newton's Account, by name or by number, as part of that portfolio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 20, 2017 Order at 7, 11-12. To address this deficiency, Midland submitted additional raw data that Midland claims it received from Chase in the October 20, 2010 sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 96 (\"Suppl. Burger-Newton Decl.\"), Ex. 1 (electronic data). The data is similar to supplemental data Midland provided for the Khath Account. It identifies the Newton Account by name and number and indicates that Chase sold the Newton Account on October 20, 2010. Burger stated in a supplemental declaration that Midland received this excel data from Chase in the October 20, 2010 sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Burger-Newton Decl. \u00b6 \u00b6 11-12. Based on this additional evidence showing that the Newton Account was in the portfolio Chase sold to Midland on October 20, 2010, the Magistrate Judge decided that Midland was assigned the Newton Account as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Considering the evidence in the record as a whole, this court has not formed \"a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made\" with regard to Midland's ownership of the Newton and Khath Accounts.\n   <em>\n    Phinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753212\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1/#p4\">\n    199 F.3d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Midland produced bills of sale and affidavits demonstrating how it obtained ownership of the Khath and Newton Accounts, as well as the underlying raw data that corroborates and provides more detail about the purchases. Therefore, the Magistrate Judge's findings that Midland was assigned the Khath and Newton Accounts are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As indicated earlier, plaintiffs also object to the Magistrate Judge's findings on evidentiary grounds. These objections are unmeritorious. Plaintiffs argue that the business records Midland submitted are inadmissible hearsay because the declarants cannot lay the proper foundation for the records to be admitted, since they did not participate in creating the records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 118 at 4-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 83 at 5-9.

Therefore, Midland and Assert were entitled to rely on the original creditors' business records, and Midland may introduce those records through custodians Burger and MacLean.

As explained by the Magistrate Judge, First Circuit precedent holds that to compel arbitration, Midland \"must demonstrate that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists, that [it is] entitled to\n   invoke the arbitration clause, that the other party is bound by that clause, and that the claim asserted comes within the clause's scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Grand Wireless, Inc. v.

This objection is based on a misunderstanding of the August 14, 2017 Order. The Order contains an implicit finding that once Midland demonstrated it was assigned the Khath Account, there were no disputed material facts; therefore, Midland had proven the existence of an agreement between Midland and Khath, which provided for arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 6, 9.

This objection is not meritorious because Midland argued for enforcement of the Class Action Waiver in its original Motion to Compel Arbitration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46 at 15-17, and incorporated this argument into its Renewed Motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 94 at 2 n.1, and its reply,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 107 at 10-12.

In addition, the issue was addressed at oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 9.

Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 7-8. The Magistrate Judge stated that Midland \"has not put forth any evidence that it mailed the Chase Card Agreement to Newton nor does it offer any declarations pertaining to that agreement,\" and the court had \"no basis ... to conclude that the Chase Card Agreement was the only agreement in effect during the time in which Newton used her credit card.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5886933\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5886933\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/1/#p6\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Midland argues that it submitted sufficient evidence to establish that the Chase Agreement governs the Newton Account. However, based on a review of the record, the Magistrate Judge's factual finding was not clearly erroneous. A reasonable factfinder could conclude, based on the evidence presented by Midland, discussed below, that Newton did not agree to the proffered Chase Agreement and/or that a different agreement governs her account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Midland produced the credit card agreement that it claims governs the Newton Account. The Chase Agreement states on the first page that \"[a]ny use of your account is covered by this agreement.\" Chase Agreement at 1.

However, there is no evidence that this particular Chase Agreement governs the Newton Account. Unlike the FIA Agreement concerning the Khath Account, the Chase Agreement does not have Virginia Newton's name on it. The declarations provided by Midland concerning the Newton Account do not state that the Chase Agreement was sent to Newton or that Newton ever saw it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Burger-Newton Decl.; Suppl. Burger-Newton Decl. Nor is there other evidence allowing the inference that Newton received this Chase Agreement. Burger only stated that the Chase Agreement is \"an exemplar of the Card Agreement for the Newton Account.\" Burger-Newton Decl. \u00b6 12. In contrast, Stephenson stated in her affidavit concerning the Khath Account that the proffered FIA Agreement \"is a true and correct copy of the account agreement that was provided to Khath\" and that he incurred charges on his account \"following the mailing of the card and Card Agreement.\" Stephenson Aff. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Midland asserts that the court must conclude the proffered Chase Agreement governs the Newton Account because the billing records reference a \"Cardmember Agreement, as amended,\" and invite Newton to visit Chase's website where her credit card agreement was purportedly available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burger-Newton Decl., Ex. 1 (billing records). However, this evidence\n   does not connect the proffered Chase Agreement to the Newton Account because the \"as amended\" language indicates that the terms governing her account changed over time. Moreover, assuming that the \"Cardmember Agreement\" governing the Newton Account was indeed amended over time,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5886933\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/1/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5886933\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/1/#p6\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   there is insufficient evidence that the \"exemplar\" agreement produced by Midland contained the pertinent provisions at the relevant time,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Burger-Newton Decl. \u00b6 12. Newton opened her account in 2001,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Burger-Newton Decl. \u00b6 11, but the proffered Chase Agreement was copyrighted by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in 2007,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Chase Agreement at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Midland also argues that the Magistrate Judge's August 14, 2017 Order is contradictory because it finds that: (a) Midland was assigned contract rights to both the Khath and Newton Accounts; and (b) Midland has the right to enforce the FIA and Chase Agreements; yet, she fails to compel Newton to arbitrate pursuant to the Chase Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 117 at 2, 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 6. Midland's contention is incorrect, and possibly based on a misunderstanding of the Magistrate Judge's rationale for finding it had failed to prove Newton agreed to arbitrate. It was not inconsistent for the Magistrate Judge to find that the Newton Account was assigned to Midland, while also finding a genuine dispute concerning the terms of the agreement concerning that account. For the reasons explained earlier, the Magistrate Judge permissibly found that Midland failed to \"demonstrate a proper nexus\" between the Newton Account and the Chase Agreement. Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 7. In other words, Midland did not prove that the terms of the proffered agreement, as opposed to some other version of a Chase credit card agreement, could be enforced against Newton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In support of its objection to the Magistrate's factual finding, Midland cites several cases, none binding on this court, in which an unchallenged \"exemplar\" agreement was used to demonstrate an agreement to arbitrate between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 117 at 9-10. However, based on the present record and the lack of nexus between the Chase Agreement and Newton Account, the court has not \"formed a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Phinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753212\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1/#p4\">\n    199 F.3d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the cases cited by Midland, there was evidence that an agreement was sent to the cardholder, which is lacking with respect to Newton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Danley v.

App'x 394 (6th Cir. 2017). Therefore, the Magistrate Judge's finding that a triable issue remains regarding whether the Chase Agreement governs the Newton Account is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Newton did not agree to arbitrate, a summary trial on the issue is proper. The Magistrate Judge noted in her January 20, 2017 Order that \"the FAA may require a summary trial on the issue,\" and requested briefing on the issue. Jan. 20, 2017 Order at 13. The parties complied. In her August 14, 2017 Order, the Magistrate Judge found that a triable issue exists with respect to Newton, but did not discuss whether a summary trial would be held.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Order at 9-10. Nevertheless, plaintiffs now argue that a summary trial should not be held because Midland has already had ample opportunity to prove that Newton agreed to arbitrate and has failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket\n   No. 118 at 8-9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 83 at 1, 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   However, the FAA states that \"[i]f the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
