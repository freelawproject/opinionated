Cal. State Grange\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:14-cv-676 WBS DAD (E.D. Cal. filed Mar. 12, 2014) (\"\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   \"). (Compl. (Docket No. 1).) Presently before the court are plaintiffs' and defendants' cross Motions for Summary Judgment (Docket Nos. 208, 210).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 15, 1873, the National Grange created the California State Grange as its affiliated state-level chapter. (Decl. of Betsy Huber (\"Huber Decl.\") (Docket No. 54-6) \u00b6 15.) As a chartered affiliate, the California State Grange collects dues from local Granges across California and turns over a portion of those dues to the National Grange. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) In 1946, the California State Grange registered as a corporation with the California Secretary of State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) The California State Grange elected McFarland as its leader in 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, a dispute arose between the National Grange and the California State Grange, leading to the suspension of the California State Grange's charter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The National Grange revoked the California State Grange's membership and the two disaffiliated in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Members of the disaffiliated chapter, led by McFarland, continued to exist as a separate entity under the corporate charter filed in 1946. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The National Grange chartered a new California State Grange in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) What resulted after the split, then, were two California entities: a newly chartered California State Grange (i.e., along with the National Grange, plaintiffs to this action) and a disaffiliated entity led by McFarland (i.e., defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The National Grange initiated a lawsuit in the Sacramento Superior Court,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry v. California State Grange\n   </em>\n   , No. 34-cv-2002-120439 CU MC GDS (Sacramento Super. Ct.)(filed Oct. 1, 2012)(\"the State Action\") seeking a declaration regarding the ownership of Grange property. The National Grange and the reorganized California State Grange succeeded in the State Action, although post-judgment proceedings continue to be ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2014 the National Grange filed an action in this court against defendants for federal trademark infringement, trademark dilution, trademark counterfeiting, and false advertisement under the Lanham Act (\"\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   \"). No. 2:14-cv-676 WBS DB (E.D. Cal.). On September 30, 2015, the court issued a final judgment and permanent injunction prohibiting the revoked entity's continued use of the \"Grange\" trademarks.

Accordingly, plaintiffs filed this action in February 2016. (Compl. (Docket No. 1).)

(First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\")(Docket No. 75) at 38-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' amended Complaint in its entirety in August 2016. (Docket No. 77.) The court granted defendants' motion as to plaintiffs' infringement of unregistered logo and trade dress claim and intentional interference with contractual relations claim, and denied the motion in all other respects. (Nov. 15, 2016 Order at 23 (Docket No. 106).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants then moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' remaining claims (Docket No. 138), which the court denied (Docket No. 153). Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion\n   for partial summary judgment on July 23, 2017. (Docket No. 142.) Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment was withdrawn in order to provide defendants an opportunity for further discovery. (Docket No. 166.) Defendants have now completed that discovery, and both parties have again filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

According to defendants, \"the federal doctrine against claim-splitting precludes plaintiffs from suing based on the same controversy as the State Action and\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   .\" (Defs.' Opp'n (Docket No. 214) at 11.) However, as the Ninth Circuit has explained, \"overlapping or even identical federal and state court litigation may proceed simultaneously, limited only by doctrines of abstention and comity.\"\n   <em>\n    Noel v.

Thus, the existence of a pending parallel action in the state court system will not bar proceedings regarding the same matter in federal court. Accordingly, defendants' request for dismissal of plaintiffs' federal action based on this claim-splitting theory is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue, as they have twice before, that plaintiffs' claims are subject to collateral estoppel and res judicata. The court rejected this argument in 2016 and again in 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 15, 2016 Order Re Mot. to Dismiss (Docket No. 106); Aug. 4, 2017 Order Re Mot. for Summ. J. (Docket No. 153).) With respect to plaintiffs' Lanham Act and California false advertisement claims, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   decided ownership of the word \"Grange,\" and enjoined defendants from the use of that term ... The conduct alleged to support plaintiff's Lanham\n   Act [and California false advertisement] claims in this action is different from the conduct enjoined in Grange I. It involves more than merely the use of the word \"Grange.\" To the extent that the complaint here alleges that defendants are representing they are the same organization as the California State Grange, that they are responsible for the history and achievements of the California State Grange, or making other false or misleading representations causing confusion among local granges, it goes beyond the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   and seeks to enjoin different conduct. Accordingly, the court will not dismiss plaintiffs' Lanham Act [and California false advertisement] claims on res judicata grounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Nov. 15, 2016 Order at 16-17.) The court wishes to express its frustration with defendants for presenting this argument a third time. For the same reasoning described in the court's previous orders, the court rejects defendants' argument that plaintiffs' Lanham Act and California false advertisement claims are precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, with respect to plaintiffs' trespass and conversion claims, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' trespass and conversion claims are not barred under the doctrine of res judicata by the underlying state court action in this case because that action remains pending on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichman v. Fotomat Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388245\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/1434/#p1439\">\n    759 F.2d 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1439 (9th Cir. 1985) (\"Under California law ... a judgment is not final for purposes of res judicata during the pendency of and until the resolution of an appeal.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Id. at 21-22.) As both parties recognized at the August 6, 2018 hearing, the state court action has now ended. Accordingly, plaintiffs' trespass and conversion claims are in fact barred and defendants' will receive judgment in their favor with respect to these two claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    California State Grange Lacks Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants also argue that the California State Grange lacks standing to assert the claims raised in this action, and thus that all claims asserted by the California State Grange must be dismissed. (Defs.' Mem. at 4-17.) Standing requires a showing that plaintiff has suffered actual loss, damage or injury, or is threatened with impairment of his or her own interests.\n   <em>\n    Gladstone Realtors v.

This is known as the \"real party in interest\" rule, which explains that the real party is the person who has the right to sue under the substantive law. In general, the real party is the person holding title to the claim or property involved, and not merely others who may be interested in or benefit from the litigation.\n   <em>\n    U-Haul Int'l v.

According to defendants, the California State Grange plaintiff is the incorrect corporation to bring the asserted claims in this case. The named plaintiff California State Grange is a 2016 corporation that was formed to safeguard the corporate registration of the name \"California State Grange\" after defendants were forced to relinquish the name in\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   . This corporation has no bank account records and it does not collect dues. (Defs.' Mem. at 9,\n   Ex. E.) There is a separate 2014 corporation, which is not a party to this case, named the Grange of the State of California's Order of Patrons of Husbandry Chartered which does collect dues and have bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Based on this information, defendants argue that the California State Grange party is merely a \"holding corporation\" for the name \"California State Grange\" and not the real party in interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In a misguided argument, plaintiffs claim that \"the party in interest is the California State Grange, not a 2014 or 2016 corporation.\" (Pls.'s Opp'n at 3.) Plaintiffs attempt to argue that this action was brought in the name of the California State Grange, not a specific corporate entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) However, \"[a] civil action can be maintained only against a legal person, i.e., a natural person or an artificial or quasi-artificial person; a nonentity is incalculable of suing or being sued.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

In this case, plaintiffs have explicitly admitted that they are not bringing this case on behalf of a specific corporation or entity. Plaintiffs cannot assert a claim on behalf of some amorphous entity vaguely known as the California State Grange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20324\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the court is not convinced by plaintiffs' argument and agrees with defendants that the California State Grange is not an appropriate plaintiff in this case.

(Komski Decl. at 2; Huber Decl. at 10.) The Jacinto Grange chapter explained that \"the letters 'CSG' were known ... as an abbreviation for 'California State Grange,' and [they] had referred to [their] statewide program as 'the CSG' for many years.\" (Decl. of Jacinto Grange (\"Jacinto Grange Decl.\") (Docket No. 208-3) \u00b6 17.) Thus, although \"CSG\" is not a registered trademark, based on the volume and length of time that the term has been used as a source identifier for the California State Grange, the court understands \"CSG\" to be a common law trademark of the California State Grange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fleischer Studios, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the National Grange owns the rights to the term \"CSG,\" and the National Grange has identified the California State Grange as the sole authorized user of \"CSG.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is undisputed that after the court's injunction in\n   <em>\n    Grange I\n   </em>\n   , defendants began using the name \"CSG.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McFarland's Resp. to Pls.' First Set of Req. for Admis., Req. No. 21.) They referred to their organization as \"CSG\" both in printed commercial materials and on their website. This use was not authorized by plaintiffs. Defendants' use of \"CSG\" has indisputably caused consumer confusion. For example, according to the Jacinto Grange, \"Mr. McFarland's continued reference to his organization as 'the CSG' up until April 2016 contributed to [Jacinto's] belief that 'the CSG' was the successor to the California State Grange and that Mr. McFarland was still authorized to represent the California Granges.\" (Jacinto Grange Decl. \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, the court concludes that defendants' misleading representations of itself as the \"CSG\", which are available on public websites and thus part of interstate commerce, caused confusion and damage to the National Grange's reputation.

To provide just a few examples, the court notes that: (1) defendants' membership brochures state that \"CSG is a grass roots organization that began in 1870,\" thereby falsely taking credit for plaintiffs' organization and not clarifying that defendants' organization did not in fact begin until 2013 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Komski Decl., Ex. 3); and (2) defendants' former website contained links to historical publications of the California State Grange as though they were publications of defendant California Guild (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638011\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1134/#p1139\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638011\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1134/#p1139\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Such statements, along with a multitude of others, have inarguably led the parties' members to believe that California Guild is a continuation of the California State Grange, and that in order to stay members of their local Grange they must pay dues to defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Jerry Allen (\"Allen Decl.\") (Docket No. 54-1, Ex. 1) \u00b6 3.) Accordingly, the court concludes that defendants have made false and misleading representations in interstate commerce that have materially affected and injured plaintiffs, and thus that the National Grange is entitled to summary judgment on its claim for federal false advertising.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Defenses to Lanham Act Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants raise several defenses to plaintiffs' Lanham Act claims, none of which have any merit. First, they argue that the representations plaintiffs attribute to them constitute protected political speech under the First Amendment. (Defs.' Opp'n at 39-41.) The court has already rejected this argument, explaining that \"it is well established that the 'First Amendment does not protect false or misleading commercial speech.' \" (Docket No. 106 at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Amarin Pharma, Inc. v. U.S. Food &amp; Drug Admin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013270\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/119/196/#p228\">\n    119 F.Supp.3d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) ).

Defendants also argue that they cannot be liable under the Lanham Act because their statements\n   were merely criticism and opinion. Again, as the court explained in a previous order, defendants' statements were clearly assertions of fact, not mere opinion or criticism, and thus are not protected. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 106 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court is growing increasingly frustrated with defendants and their repetition of previously rejected defenses. The court is now forced to waste its time and reject these arguments yet again.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem of P. &amp; A., Ex. 11.) The elements of their website that are protected by their copyright registrations were designed by Rick Keel in 2010, when he was still an employee of plaintiff the California State Grange. At this time, the California State Grange was still a functioning state-level division of the National Grange, and thus all intellectual property the California State Grange created and used was the legal property of the National Grange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   According to Keel's own testimony, members of the California State Grange created the contents of the website before its charter was revoked, and defendants used the same graphics when they created the website for the unaffiliated California Guild.

Defendants' membership brochure, also covered by copyright registration, was also created by the California State Grange prior to its charter revocation and thus is also owned by the National Grange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The evidence is undisputed that defendants, without permission, copied plaintiffs' copyrighted content onto their websites and into their new membership brochure in violation of section 106 of United States Copyright Law, which confers upon copyright owners the exclusive right to \"reproduce the copyrighted work\" or \"prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, Rick Keel explicitly admitted that he was specifically instructed by McFarland to maintain the website exactly as it was, with the minor exception of changing all appearances of the word \"Grange\" to \"CSG.\" (Docket No. 208, Ex. 5, 60:2-10.) Similarly, the membership brochure advertising the \"CSG\" organization was identical to the California State Grange's former brochure, but for the substitution of \"CSG\" for \"California State Grange.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 208, Ex. 4, California Guild's Resp. to Pls.' First Set of Req. for Admis. (Amended), Request No. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Even given the substitution of \"CSG,\" the court concludes that the works are \"substantially similar.\"\n   <em>\n    Unicolors, Inc. v.
