TUNHEIM, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action arises out of a dispute between two insurers of the same insured party. The Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America (\"Catholic Mutual\") brought this case for declaratory judgment against Arrowood Indemnity Company (\"Arrowood\"). Catholic Mutual issued insurance coverage certificates to the Diocese of St. Cloud (\"the Diocese\") and other parishes (\"the Parishes\") for periods during which they were also allegedly covered by policies issued by Arrowood's predecessor company. For decades, Arrowood's predecessor company acknowledged responsibility under those policies for sexual abuse claims filed against the Diocese and Parishes, despite the fact that the complete original polices could not be located. In 2011, however, Arrowood began denying claims under the same policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Catholic Mutual now seeks a judicial declaration that Arrowood is liable under its predecessor company's policies and therefore must defend and indemnify the Diocese against the sexual abuse claims covered by both insurers' policies. Catholic Mutual also seeks declaratory judgments regarding the terms of the policies and regarding a right of contribution from Arrowood for expenses incurred by Catholic Mutual in defending the Diocese. Arrowood seeks to dismiss this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Because Catholic Mutual has alleged\n   an actual case and controversy that is neither premature nor moot, the Court will deny Arrowood's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Catholic Mutual is a Nebraska non-profit corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska. (Compl. \u00b6 7, July 20, 2017, Docket No. 1.) Catholic Mutual \"operates as a self-protection fund of the Catholic Church in the United States and Canada\" and \"issues certificates of coverage to participating members, which provide the members with coverage for certain property and casualty risks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Diocese is a Minnesota general business entity with its principal place of business in Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). From February 1971 to February 1990, Catholic Mutual issued certificates to the Diocese that \"may provide coverage ... for liability arising from acts of sexual abuse that took place during each certificate's coverage period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Catholic Mutual alleges that the Diocese was also covered under occurrence-based general liability insurance protection policies issued by the Security Insurance Company of Hartford (\"Security\") for injuries occurring from 1964 through 1971.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) From at least 1990 to 2011, Security \"stood by its insured and paid claims submitted by the Diocese.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 30.) Security no longer exists, but its obligations are now managed by Defendant Arrowood, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in North Carolina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Catholic Mutual alleges that Arrowood - a \"run-off manager\" - has aggressively managed its claims, requiring \"exacting evidence of insurance coverage purchased over 50 years ago\" and routinely denying claims filed against the Diocese, despite the fact that Security previously acknowledged responsibility under the same policies and agreed to pay claims under the same policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) Catholic Mutual alleges that, \"starting in 2011, when it became clear that there was significant potential liability relating to alleged sexual misconduct claims ... [Arrowood] abandoned [the Diocese] and asserted defenses that [Security] waived long ago.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE UNDERLYING CLERGY SEXUAL ABUSE CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since the Minnesota Child Victims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20541.073\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 541.073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , became law, 75 actions (\"the Underlying Claims\") have been filed against the Diocese and the Parishes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15.) The Underlying Claims allege sexual abuse by members of the clergy or other individuals associated with the Diocese and Parishes between 1948 and 1995 and allege that the Diocese continues to conceal important information about priests accused of abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) The Underlying Claims allege public and private nuisance, negligence, negligent supervision, and negligent retention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Diocese and the Parishes tendered the defense of 35 of the 75 Underlying Claims to Catholic Mutual in September\n   2016. (Compl. \u00b6 23 &amp; Ex. 1.) At least a portion of the abuse alleged in each of the 35 claims took place during Catholic Mutual's coverage period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 23 &amp; Ex. 1.) In October 2016, Catholic Mutual accepted the defense and indemnity of 34 of the 35 claims without a reservation of rights. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25 &amp; Exs. 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Catholic Mutual alleges that Security \"issued at least three insurance policies to the Diocese\" that may cover the Underlying Claims: LGC 314009, covering 1964 to 1967; GLA 437394, covering 1967 to 1970; and GLA 606265, covering 1970 to 1973 but canceled November or December 1971. (Compl. \u00b6 26.) Catholic Mutual alleges that the Diocese has been unable to locate complete copies of any of the policies, but it has located a portion of GLA 606265 and offers secondary evidence of the existence of the other two policies and their material terms and conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Secondary evidence of the LGC 314009 policy includes a series of letters between Security and the Diocese regarding a claim within the policy's coverage period, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 35 &amp; Exs. 6-7), and a draft affidavit prepared based on those letters that was sent to an agent stating that he wrote a general liability insurance coverage for the Diocese, (Compl. \u00b6 34 &amp; Exs. 8-10). Security accepted the defense and indemnification of the claim without a reservation of rights. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36 &amp; Exs. 12.) Secondary evidence of the GLA 437394 policy and the GLA 606265 policy includes correspondence between Security and the Diocese indicating that Security agreed to defend various claims within the policies' coverage periods. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-41 &amp; Exs. 17-23.) Security explicitly stated several times that it would honor coverage of claims from November 1967 to December 1971 and acknowledged certain policy limits during that time period. (Compl. \u00b6 40 &amp; Exs. 19-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. ARROWOOD'S DENIAL OF COVERAGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 27, 2011, the Diocese sought indemnity contribution from Arrowood, as successor to Security, for a claim alleging abuse from 1967-1969 and in 1971. (Compl. \u00b6 44 &amp; Ex. 25.) Arrowood denied that it owed defense or indemnity to the Diocese under GLA 437394 because the Diocese could not provide an entire copy of the policy or any document that indicated the named insured, policy period, or limits of insurance. (Compl. \u00b6 44, Ex. 25 at 113.) Arrowood stated that it had paid out a prior claim under GLA 437394 \"in error\" and that it was \"unable to confirm the basis for which [Security] previously agreed to accept coverage for the Diocese\" for the period 1967 to 1973. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114.) Arrowood also noted that it did not have documentation of certain material terms for GLA 606265. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.) Arrowood appeared to be warning the Diocese that it would no longer honor the agreement the Diocese had with Security without additional documentation or evidence of the terms of the purported policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2016, the Diocese tendered 52 of the Underlying Claims to Arrowood, as they were purportedly covered by the Security policies, but Arrowood disputed that the Claims were covered. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) Catholic Mutual alleges that \"Arrowood abandoned the Diocese and refused to defend any of the Underlying Claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 &amp; Ex. 29.) Arrowood \"agreed to cover some defense costs and provide very limited indemnity to the Diocese\" for 20 of the 52 claims, (Compl. \u00b6 52), all of which allege abuse in the period covered by GLA 437394 and GLA 606265, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 &amp; Ex. 30). Eight of these 20 claims allege abuse in the time period covered by Security's policies and Catholic Mutual's policies (\"the Overlapping Claims\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Arrowood\n   maintains that this agreement was a compromise and not an admission of coverage. (Compl. \u00b6 51, Ex. 29 at 132.) Arrowood's compromise agreement is subject to a reservation of rights and applies to the Diocese alone - not to the Parishes. (Compl. \u00b6 54.) Arrowood has denied or refused to acknowledge any obligation whatsoever on the remaining claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Catholic Mutual filed its Complaint on July 20, 2017. (Compl.) Its complaint presents an action for declaratory judgment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2202. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) In Count One, Catholic Mutual \"seeks a judicial determination that, under [Security's policies], Arrowood has a duty to defend and indemnify the Diocese and Parishes in connection with these twenty-eight claims subject to a $100,000 per occurrence limit and no aggregate limit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) Catholic Mutual also seeks judicial declarations that the policies exist and contain certain terms and conditions, as well as costs and expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In Count Two, Catholic Mutual seeks \"a declaration that it has a right of contribution from Arrowood for a fair share of the defense costs incurred by Catholic Mutual in providing a defense of the Diocese and Parishes in connection with the Overlapping Claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Catholic Mutual also seeks a judicial declaration that the policies exist and require Arrowood to defend and indemnify the Diocese in connection with the Underlying Claims, a judicial declaration that it has a right of contribution from Arrowood for defense expenses incurred in defending the Diocese and Parishes in connection with the Overlapping Claims in excess of its fair share, and costs and expenses.

Not so. \"The fundamental question in an equitable contribution action is precisely the question [Catholic Mutual] seeks to have determined here - does [Arrowood] owe an obligation to [the Diocese] such that [Arrowood] can be liable to [Catholic Mutual] for contribution?\"\n   <em>\n    Cont'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223495\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/898/#p917\">\n    940 F.Supp.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To answer this question requires the Court to determine whether the Underlying Claims are covered by Arrowood's purported policies. As the Court has explained, \"[t]he right to seek contribution would be meaningless if a co-insurer could stymie attempts to seek contribution by asserting it does not have a duty to defend, and then preventing the paying insurer from examining the insurance policy to challenge that assertion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223495\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/898/#p917\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, in order to determine contribution, the Court must determine precisely \"which insurers have a duty to defend [the insured].\"\n   <em>\n    Cargill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7081462\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/784/341/#p354\">\n    784 N.W.2d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Justiciability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Arrowood argues that a declaratory judgment on contribution for the Overlapping Claims would be premature and \"would require this Court to ... issue an advisory opinion on a completely hypothetical set of facts.\" (Supp. Mem. at 8.) Arrowood argues that the Complaint fails to establish (1) common liability and (2) that Catholic Mutual paid more than its fair share of the common liability, which are the elements of a claim for contribution. (Supp. Mem. at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nuessmeier Elec., Inc. v. Weiss Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494004\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/632/248/#p251\">\n    632 N.W.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001) ).) Arrowood's argument fails because it asks the Court to determine the merits of the claim at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As the Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   , the threshold question in a contribution claim is whether an insurer owes an insured a duty to defend.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223495\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/898/#p917\">\n    940 F.Supp.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Catholic Mutual asks the Court to answer that question. Furthermore, Catholic Mutual plausibly alleges that Arrowood owes the Diocese and the Parishes a duty to defend on the Overlapping Claims; thus, it\n   plausibly alleges common liability. Common liability need not be \"established\" at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Arrowood's liability is also a threshold question in determining whether Catholic Mutual has paid more than its fair share. Catholic Mutual alleges that it has provided a defense to the Diocese for the Overlapping Claims. It follows that, if Arrowood is liable, Catholic Mutual has paid - and will continue to pay - more than its fair share. Should the Court determine that Arrowood is liable, a determination of contribution would not be hypothetical or premature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Arrowood also argues that a declaratory judgment on contribution would be moot because it would require the Court to \"make a declaration on a matter that Arrowood has already agreed to resolve with its purported insured, the Diocese.\" (Supp. Mem. at 8.) In support of this argument, Arrowood notes its \"good faith compromise with the Diocese\" whereby Arrowood agreed to \"contribute to the necessary and reasonable defense costs\" of 20 of the Underlying Claims, including the Overlapping Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) But - despite Arrowood's compromise - the issue of contribution is not moot as a practical matter or as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Catholic Mutual alleges that \"Arrowood has not agreed to provide what the Complaint alleges it owes: Arrowood has agreed to provide only limited defense and indemnity, and only to the Diocese.\" (Opp. Mot. at 12.) Thus, as a practical matter, Arrowood has not mooted the case. Furthermore, Arrowood \"expressly reserved its right to change or withdraw its agreement and seek recovery of amounts it has paid pursuant to that agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One important purpose of declaratory judgments is to afford the parties \"relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens v.

Arrowood's compromise was made with a complete reservation of rights, including the right to withdraw or seek recovery of amounts paid. Thus, as a mater of law, Arrowood has not shown that \"the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 203,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312236\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/199/#p203\">\n    89 S.Ct. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Arrowood cannot moot a case by promising that it will change only some of its conduct and reserving the right to change its mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because Catholic Mutual has standing to bring this case under Minnesota law and has alleged an actual case and controversy that is neither premature nor moot, the Court will deny Arrowood's Motion to Dismiss. Catholic Mutual has standing to seek declaratory judgment for contribution under Minnesota law to determine whether Arrowood, an alleged co-insurer, owes a\n   duty to defend. In determining whether Catholic Mutual is entitled to contribution from Arrowood, the Court must necessarily determine the threshold questions of whether the purported contracts with Arrowood exist and whether Arrowood is liable under them. The action is not premature because Catholic Mutual has plausibly alleged joint liability and payment of more than its fair share of costs, two issues whose merits can only be decided after the Court determines the threshold question of Arrowood's liability. Nor is the action moot because Arrowood's good faith agreement to pay some defense costs was done under a complete reservation of rights, which neither gives Catholic Mutual certainty nor shows that Arrowood's allegedly unlawful behavior cannot reasonably be expected to reoccur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Arrowood Indemnity Company's Motion to Dismiss [Docket No. 30] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Catholic Mutual alleges that several companies managed and/or administered claims under the Security Insurance Company of Hartford prior to Arrowood's management, but for simplification purposes refers to them all as \"Security Insurance Company of Hartford.\" (Compl. \u00b6 2.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Parishes \"are included within the protection provided by\" the certificates that Catholic Mutual issued to the Diocese.

Although complete copies of the policies have not been produced, Catholic Mutual has supplied supporting evidence of the policies and their terms, including acknowledgments by Arrowood's predecessor that the policies existed and acknowledgment of some of their terms. At this time, the Court need not decide whether the policies existed and what their terms were. The Court only decides that Catholic Mutual has sufficiently alleged a case and controversy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Arrowood's attempt to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Continental\n    </em>\n    from the present case is unavailing. Arrowood argues that\n    <em>\n     Continental\n    </em>\n    involved an interpretation and declaration of duties under insurance policies whose existence was not in dispute. But nothing in\n    <em>\n     Continental\n    </em>\n    suggests that the Court is precluded from making a threshold determination regarding the existence of a contract - and therefore the existence of a duty to defend - or from interpreting a purported contract when the complete policy is unavailable.
