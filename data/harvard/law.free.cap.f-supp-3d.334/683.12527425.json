Upon accepting employment on August 18, 2008, and then again on May 6, 2009, Plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\") which required all claims related to her employment to be submitted to arbitration. Plaintiff's employment was terminated on January 10, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to the motion to compel arbitration, Plaintiff argues that two provisions of the Arbitration Agreement are unenforceable/unconscionable;\n   <em>\n    to wit\n   </em>\n   : the provision regarding the payment of arbitration costs and the provision delineating a one-year limitation for submitting claims to arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The arbitration costs provision provides as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Company will pay one hundred percent (100%) of all costs peculiar to arbitration, including without limitation AAA administrative fees, arbitrator compensation and expenses, and costs of witnesses called by the Arbitrator (\"arbitration costs\"). Upon the conclusion of the arbitration hearing and based upon the evidence presented during the hearing, the Arbitrator shall determine and include in the final award an order that the employee reimburse the Company for up to 50% of the arbitration costs. In no event shall the employee be required to reimburse the Company prohibitive\n   costs that would effectively deny him or her a forum to vindicate his or her rights except to the extent set forth above and unless otherwise ordered by the Arbitrator under applicable law, each party shall bear his, her or its own expenses, such as attorneys' fees, costs, and expert witness fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to this provision, Plaintiff challenges only the portion which gives the arbitrator the discretion to order the employee to reimburse the company \"up to 50% of the arbitration costs.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The one-year temporal limitation provision provides that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   No dispute shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this policy where one year shall have elapsed from the occurrence of the event giving rise to the dispute. Filing a claim within this period is a condition precedent to arbitration-the exclusive method for resolving disputes arising out of or relating to Employee's employment with the Company. The one-year period set forth herein is not in the nature of a statute of limitations, but a temporal limitation on the substantive scope of this agreement. The parties, however, may submit his, her or its written arbitration request to the AAA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   To start the arbitration process, the complaining party must submit a written arbitration request to the AAA within\n   <strong>\n    one year\n   </strong>\n   of the date a cause of action accrues. A written arbitration request for a claim of wrongful discharge or discriminatory termination must be filed within\n   <strong>\n    one year\n   </strong>\n   of the date of termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Arbitration Agreement also includes a severability clause which Defendants urge this Court to apply in the event it determines any of the challenged provisions to be unconscionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When addressing a motion to compel arbitration, the Court must first determine which standard of review to apply: that which is applied to motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12 or that applied to motions for summary judgment under Rule 56. \"Where the affirmative defense of arbitrability of claims is apparent on the face of a complaint (or documents relied upon in the complaint), the FAA would favor resolving a motion to compel arbitration under a motion to dismiss standard without the inherent delay of discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Guidotti v.

Plaintiff concedes the Arbitration Agreement exists and that she signed it. However, she argues that it is unenforceable because two of its provisions are unconscionable;\n   <em>\n    to wit\n   </em>\n   , the arbitration costs provision and the one-year limitation for requesting arbitration. Plaintiff also argues that Defendants waived their right to arbitration by failing to notify Plaintiff of the Arbitration Agreement or her obligations under it, and that the one-year limitation provision is unenforceable due to the lack of mutuality. Defendants disagree with Plaintiff's arguments, and offer that even if the challenged provisions are unconscionable, the Arbitration Agreement is still enforceable. Based on the analysis below, this Court finds the two provisions are unconscionable as applied to Plaintiff's claims, but that said provisions are severable such that the matter must go to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   \"establishes a strong federal policy in favor of compelling arbitration over litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Sandvik AB v.

Resp. to Mot. to Compel. Arb. at pp. 17-24]. Plaintiff submitted evidence regarding the costs of the proposed arbitration, a cost Defendants have not disputed. She also submitted evidence of her financial status at the time she signed the agreement, showing that she earned $13.70/hour for thirty-five to forty-two hours a week. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Based on Plaintiff's unrefuted evidence with respect to her financial situation, this Court finds that the possibility of having to pay 50% of the costs associated with any arbitration of her underlying claims would discourage Plaintiff from filing a meritorious claim. Therefore, Plaintiff has met her burden to show that the arbitration would be \"prohibitively expensive,\" and that the costs provision is unconscionable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's challenge to the enforceability of the costs provision, Defendants make two arguments. First, they argue that while the provision provides for fee-splitting, it also \"expressly forbids unconscionable cost-shifting.\" [ECF 11 at p. 3]. Specifically, to support this argument, Defendants point to the inclusion of the following language in the Arbitration Agreement: \"In no event shall the employee be required to reimburse the Company prohibitive costs that would effectively deny ... her a forum to vindicate ... her rights.\" (Arbitration Agreement). Defendants essentially concede that the costs provision as written gives the arbitrator the discretion to order Plaintiff to pay up to 50% of the costs, but argue that\n   the provision is not unconscionable because it gives the arbitrator discretion to fashion an award that is not prohibitively expensive for Plaintiff. This Court is not persuaded by this argument. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Parilla\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit rejected a similar argument and held that such arbitrator discretion had no bearing on the unconscionability assessment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244022\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/269/#p276\">\n    368 F.3d at 284-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \"little difference between a 100% probability that the employee will have to pay half of the arbitrator's fees and expenses on the one hand, and an indeterminate (but less than 100%) probability that the employee would have to pay all of the arbitrator's fees and expenses on the other.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, Defendants suggest that the costs provision is not unconscionable because they have waived enforcement of it. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 11 at pp. 3-4]. While this waiver might be binding on Defendants, the Third Circuit has expressly held that such a litigation waiver does not alter or affect a court's unconscionability analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244022\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/269/#p276\">\n    368 F.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a court \"must determine unconscionability as of the time the contract was formed, and an after-the-fact offer to waive certain contract provisions can have no effect on [that] analysis.\"). Accordingly, this Court finds the portion of the arbitration costs provision which allows the arbitrator to require Plaintiff to pay \"up to 50% of the Arbitration Costs\" unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    b. One-Year Temporal Limitation Period Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff contends the one-year temporal limitation provision is unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable as to her FMLA, Title VII and PHRA claims. This Court comes to different conclusions as to these claims, finding the provision unenforceable as to the FMLA claim, and enforceable as to the Title VII and PHRA claims. As such, this Court will separate these arguments and analyses into two separate sections, as did the parties in their respective briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    i. FMLA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable as applied to her FMLA claims because it unreasonably and impermissibly requires such claims to be submitted to an arbitrator within one year of the event/action giving rise to the claim in violation of her rights under the FMLA. Defendants contend that the limitation is reasonable based on case law and, alternatively, if unreasonable, is severable from the Arbitration Agreement via the severability clause. This Court finds, however, that the one-year temporal limitation period as applied to Plaintiff's FMLA claim is unenforceable because applicable regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20825.220\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 825.220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (d), preclude any shortening of the statutory period in which a plaintiff can assert an FMLA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Though the Third Circuit has not addressed this particular issue, a majority of other courts that have addressed the issue have held that limitations clauses, which shorten the time in which an FMLA claim must be asserted, are unenforceable. In\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Harper Hosp.\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a six month limitations clause was \"an interference with employees' rights under the FMLA,\" and, therefore, was unenforceable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368501\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/241/769/#p772\">\n    241 F.Supp.2d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (E.D. Mich. 2002). The\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   court relied on FMLA regulations which provide that \"employers are prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to exercise) any rights provided by the act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368501\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/241/769/#p772\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20825.220\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ).

Plaintiff essentially argues that the one-year temporal limitation interferes with her ability to pursue and exhaust administrative remedies with the EEOC and/or PHRC and effectively prevents Plaintiff from administratively exhausting her claims.

Prestress Services Industries LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201884547\">\n    2011 WL 1884547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ind. May 18, 2011). There, an employee asserted a Title VII claim against his employer following administrative exhaustion of his claim through the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The employer responded by arguing that the claim was required to be submitted to arbitration, but that any arbitration demand was untimely pursuant to the arbitration agreement's one-year temporal limitation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff argued that the one-year temporal limitation should not be enforced because he had followed the statutory requirements for exhausting his claim with the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Rejecting plaintiff's invitation to invalidate the one-year temporal limitation, the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, as Cerna fails to recognize, the mandatory arbitration and the EEOC charge are not mutually exclusive. That is, Cerna was not required to wait for the EEOC to finish its investigation before requesting arbitration. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Cerna\n   </em>\n   could have simultaneously filed his EEOC charge and requested arbitration. The fact that Cerna neglected to seek arbitration, apparently through his own negligence, does not render the one-year limitation unenforceable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Volpe v.

While the Arbitration Agreement requires any Title VII/PHRA claims to be submitted to arbitration within one year of the action giving rise to the claim, it does not expressly or implicitly alter any of Plaintiff's\n   rights or obligations with respect to her pursuit of administrative remedies with either the EEOC or the PHRC. Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary are unfounded. As such, the one-year temporal limitation period as applied to Plaintiff's Title VII and/or PHRA claims is enforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Severability Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Having determined that the two challenged provisions in the Arbitration Agreement are unconscionable as applied to Plaintiff, this Court must next determine whether those provisions can be severed from the remainder of the agreement so as to allow the dispute to be subject to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puleo v. Chase Bank USA, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054464\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/172/#p186\">\n    605 F.3d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 (3d Cir. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Spinetti\n   </em>\n   , 324 F.3d at 219. For this determination, this Court again turns to Pennsylvania contract law.\n   <em>\n    Spinetti\n   </em>\n   , 324 F.3d at 219. Under Pennsylvania law, unconscionable terms in an arbitration agreement can be severed where such terms are not \"essential\" to the overall agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Spinetti\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's conclusion that both a costs provision and an attorney's fee provision in an arbitration agreement were unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216-217. The Court further found that these two provisions could be severed from the remainder of the agreement to allow the primary purpose of the agreement to be enforced,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , resolution of the parties' employment dispute by arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219-20 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 214 (stating \"[y]ou don't cut down the trunk of a tree because some of its branches are sickly.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Spinetti\n   </em>\n   , \"the essence of the [Arbitration Agreement] ... is an agreement to settle ... employment disputes through binding arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 214 (quotations omitted). The applicable AAA procedures and the bulk of the Arbitration Agreement itself are reasonably calculated to that purpose. The costs provision\n   and the one-year temporal limitation as applied to Plaintiff's FMLA claim can be severed without disturbing the central goals of the agreement or the parties' mutual obligation to arbitrate. Severing the invalid provisions will merely allow Plaintiff time to formulate and assert her claims without being thwarted or discouraged by the possibility of prohibitively expensive costs. Accordingly, the costs provision and the one-year temporal provision as applied to Plaintiff's FMLA claim are severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted. However, the provision regarding splitting of the arbitration costs and the provision providing a one-year temporal limitation as applied to Plaintiff's FMLA claim are unenforceable and, therefore, struck from the Arbitration Agreement. An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In adjudicating the underlying motion, this Court has also considered Defendants' reply, [ECF 11], Defendants' supplemental memorandum, [ECF 21], and Plaintiff's supplemental brief, [ECF 22].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    For purposes of this motion, this Court will construe the facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, here, Plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In their respective pleadings, both parties appear to agree that the underlying motion should be subject to a Rule 56 summary judgment standard. While ordinarily a party opposing a motion to compel arbitration should have an opportunity to conduct limited discovery to determine arbitrability, Plaintiff does not dispute the existence of, or her signing, the Arbitration Agreement. Rather, Plaintiff relies on the Arbitration Agreement itself to argue the unconscionability of the terms in the two Arbitration Agreement provisions. Because the Arbitration Agreement is part of the record, and Plaintiff uses the Arbitration Agreement in her unconscionability argument, additional discovery is not needed to resolve the unconscionability issue. Accordingly, this Court will apply the Rule 56 standard to determine whether to compel arbitration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Glenwright v. Carbondale Nursing Home, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201092541\">\n     2017 WL 1092541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (M.D. Pa.

Service Corp. Int'l\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160828\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/212/\">\n     324 F.3d 212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3d Cir. 2003), the Third Circuit found that an arbitration agreement that required the plaintiff to split the arbitration costs was unconscionable.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160828\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/212/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160828\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/212/\">\n     at 216-17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Alexander\n    </em>\n    , the Third Circuit found a \"loser pays\" provision in an arbitration agreement unconscionable.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098998\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/256/#p264\">\n     341 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    270 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Blair v.

This Court is unaware of any such regulation. As such, the above analysis with respect to Plaintiff's FMLA claim does not apply to her Title VII and/or PHRA claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that Defendants waived their right to arbitration by failing to notify Plaintiff of the Arbitration Agreement and one-year temporal limitation provision, particularly during the EEOC proceedings. Defendants assert that this waiver argument should be rejected as they had no obligation to notify Plaintiff of the Arbitration Agreement or that her opportunity to request arbitration was soon expiring.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Although undetermined by the Third Circuit, numerous district courts have held a party does not waive their right to arbitration by taking part in EEOC proceedings or failing to proactively raise the defense of arbitration.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Volpe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204916027\">\n     2008 WL 4916027\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *16 (holding \"a party's participation in EEOC or local agency proceedings is not inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.\"). This Court agrees with\n    <em>\n     Volpe\n    </em>\n    . Here, Plaintiff began the administrative proceedings under the EEOC shortly after the incident occurred, however, a claim was not filed in this Court until December 11, 2017. Defendants promptly and timely filed their underlying motion to compel arbitration in response. As in\n    <em>\n     Volpe\n    </em>\n    , Defendants' participation in the administrative proceedings did not constitute a waiver. Accordingly, Defendants have not waived their right to arbitration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    To support her argument with respect to the unreasonableness of the one-year temporal limitation, Plaintiff relies primarily on a number of courts which held various temporal limitations on a plaintiff's Title VII claims unenforceable. The majority of these cases, however, did not involve such temporal limitations in an arbitration agreement (like the case here) as opposed to temporal limitations to bring suit in the parties' general employment agreements. Those cases turned on the effect those temporal limitations had on the plaintiff's ability to administratively exhaust their Title VII/PHRA claims and eventually bring them following exhaustion in a federal court. Moreover, any argument that the one-year temporal limitation unreasonably shortens the time period in which Plaintiff could bring her underlying Title VII and/or PHRA claims is without merit since such claims were required to be filed with the EEOC/PHRA within 300/180 days, respectively, of the event giving rise to the claim, whereas the Arbitration Agreement provides Plaintiff one year to submit her claims to arbitration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that the one-year temporal limitation period \"unilateral[ly] and unreasonably favors the employer,\" because she is required to file her claims within one year while Defendants are not required to do the same. [ECF 8 at p. 16]. Plaintiff is wrong. The language of the Arbitration Agreement does not specifically limit just Plaintiff to a one year period, but states that \"[n]o dispute shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this policy where one year shall have elapsed ... [t]he parties, however, may submit his, her or its written arbitration request to the AAA.\" [Arbitration Agreement]. This language expressly applies to both parties. Moreover, even if the language was limited to Plaintiff, this would be enforceable. In\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    , the Third Circuit enforced a one-sided provision because \"a contract need not have mutuality of obligation as long as the contract is supported by consideration.\"\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544075\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/183/173/#p179\">\n     183 F.3d at 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because Plaintiff was given consideration in the form of employment for signing this Arbitration Agreement, there is no requirement that Defendants be bound by the same terms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
