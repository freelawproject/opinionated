On March 19, 2018, the Federal Circuit issued its mandate in the appeal of this matter following a jury trial. ECF No. [274];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arctic Cat Inc. v.

In its opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed this Court's denial of judgment as a matter of law that the patent claims asserted by Arctic Cat would have been obvious, that the jury-awarded royalty rate should be vacated, and that BRP did not willfully infringe the asserted claims.\n   <em>\n    Arctic Cat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267284\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1350/\">\n    876 F.3d at 1372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Federal Circuit found that BRP had satisfied the \"low bar\" of the burden of production by producing evidence of the licensing agreement between Honda and Arctic Cat showing Honda's license to practice \"Arctic Cat patents that patently cover Arctic Cat's Controlled Thrust Steering methods, systems and developments\" and identifying fourteen Honda personal watercrafts (\"PWCs\") from three versions of its Aquatrax series sold between 2002 and 2009 which allegedly practiced the patents at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Federal Circuit found, however, that once BRP had satisfied this burden of production, the Court should have required the patentee, here, Arctic Cat, to prove compliance with \u00a7 287(a). \"Arctic Cat, therefore, did not have a fair opportunity to develop its case regarding the Honda PWCs at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n    at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Federal Circuit vacated this Court's judgment as to marking \"so that Arctic Cat has an opportunity to proffer evidence related to the identified Honda PWCs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Federal Circuit remanded for new trial and left the issue of additional discovery to the discretion of this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n    at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1369 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After issuance of the mandate, the Court entered an order requiring the parties to advise the Court whether the parties believed any additional discovery was necessary, and whether the parties planned to file any pretrial motions. In addition, the Court required the parties to submit concise statements of the issues remaining for remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [275]. The parties thereafter complied, filing the Joint Scheduling Report, ECF No. [290]; the Concise Statement of Issues filed by Arctic Cat, ECF No. [291]; and the Concise Statement of Issues filed by BRP, ECF No. [293]. Meanwhile, Arctic Cat filed a Sealed Motion for Entry of Modified Judgment and Execution of Partial Judgment, ECF No. [284] (\"Judgment Motion\"). The Court set a briefing schedule for the Judgment Motion, ECF No. [286], and BRP filed an opposition to the Judgment Motion on April 23, 2018, ECF No. [292]. Arctic Cat replied on April 30, 2018. ECF No. [295]. On May 11, 2018 BRP filed a Motion for Protective Order Regarding Plaintiff's Notice of Deposition, ECF No. [298] (\"Motion for Protective Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Four days later, the Court entered an order ruling on all pending motions and setting a trial schedule based on the parties' representations in the Joint Scheduling Report and the Concise Statements of Issues. ECF No. [300] (\"Omnibus Order\"). In the Omnibus Order, the Court noted that the Federal Circuit found that \"the only dispute between the parties is whether any of the Honda PWCs was covered by the patent claims at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Arctic Cat Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Prod. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267284\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1350/\">\n    876 F.3d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Because the Federal Circuit found BRP had met its burden of production, the burden to show compliance with the marking requirements of Section 287 on remand lay with Arctic Cat. The Court accordingly allowed limited discovery and set a pretrial briefing schedule. The parties engaged in discovery and on June 1, 2018 filed the cross-motions now before the Court. Thereafter, on June 18, 2018, Arctic Cat and BRP both moved in limine, ECF Nos. [323] and [327], and filed a pretrial stipulation, ECF No. [326]. The Court now addresses the motions pending before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The standard of review for cross-motions for summary judgment does not differ from the standard applied when only\n   one party files a motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

First, Arctic Cat urges that BRP's Motion must be denied as Arctic Cat is entitled to damages from the date that Honda stopped selling the unmarked PWCs, that is, September 6, 2013. ECF No. [317] at 5. Arctic Cat argues that during the period between September 6, 2013 and October 16, 2014, Arctic Cat could not have violated Section 287's marking requirement since Honda sold no unmarked products. Thus, Arctic Cat is due damages during this period because there was no marking violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Arctic Cat additionally argues that it is entitled to all is pre-suit damages dating back to October 2008 based on the jury's finding of willfulness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Arctic Cat's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Arctic Cat also moves for summary judgment arguing that there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding its entitlement to pre-suit damages on two separate theories which mirror its theories in opposition to BRP's Motion. First, Arctic Cat argues that even if it failed to comply with the marking requirements of Section 287 and even if it did not give\n   actual notice of the infringement to BRP until October 16, 2014, Arctic Cat is due all its pre-suit damages from October 2008 onward based on the jury's finding of willfulness. In making this argument, Arctic Cat argues that the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Amsted Industries Inc. v. Buckeye Steel Castings Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504781\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/178/\">\n    24 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1994), which held that actual notice under Section 287 requires an affirmative communication or notification by the patentee, was wrongly decided. Arctic Cat argues that this Court should not follow this binding precedent and its progeny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the alternative, Arctic Cat argues that it is entitled to is pre-suit damages from September 6, 2013 onward-the date on which Honda stopped selling the unmarked PWCs-because after that date, there was no longer any products to be marked and therefore no need to comply with the marking requirements of Section 287.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   BRP opposes Arctic Cat's Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. [314]. First, it argues that the Court should reject Arctic Cat's \"invitation to ignore controlling law and Arctic Cat's own binding stipulation\" in order to find that Arctic Cat is due all its pre-suit damages from October 2008 onward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Further, BRP argues that Arctic Cat cannot avoid the marking requirements of Section 287 because Honda ceased to sell the unmarked PWCs. Rather, once the unmarked products are produced, BRP argues that the only cure is actual notice, which the parties stipulated occurred on October 16, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. THE MATERIAL UNCONTROVERTED FACTS ON REMAND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While the parties have filed lengthy motions in support of their cross motions for summary judgment, their Statements of Material Facts are brief and tailored to the narrow marking issue before the Court on remand. The following facts are not in dispute unless stated otherwise:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Arctic Cat developed an off-throttle steering system for PWCs and secured seven patents for the technology in 1999, including two at issue in this case, the '545 and '969 patents. ECF No. [310] at 8-9; ECF No. [326] at 6. On February 15, 2002, Arctic Cat entered into a licensing agreement with Honda that included the '545 and '969 patents. ECF Nos. [308] \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; [318] \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. The license agreement contained no marking requirement, and Arctic Cat made no effort to ensure that Honda marked the PWCs that it sold. ECF Nos. [308] \u00b6 4; [318] \u00b6 4. Thereafter, Honda sold at least fourteen models of PWCs in the U.S. which practiced the '545 and '969 patents. ECF Nos. [308] \u00b6\u00b6 2, 14; [318] \u00b6\u00b6 2, 14. These personal watercrafts were unmarked. ECF No. [310] at 9. Arctic Cat states that Honda stopped manufacturing in 2009 the unmarked personal watercraft which practiced the patents and stopped selling them in 2013. ECF No. [311] at 2. Arctic Cat further states that Honda has no unsold inventory of these personal watercrafts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   BRP disputes that Honda stopped manufacturing the PWCs that practiced the patents at issue in 2009, that Honda ceased selling those PWCs in 2013, and that Honda has no unsold inventory of these PWCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although Arctic Cat discussed licensing the patents with BRP, the parties never entered into a license agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In the meantime, BRP developed its own off-throttle steering system that, after a jury trial, was found to have infringed on the '545 and '969 patents. While the record supports that BRP consulted both internally and externally regarding whether its system may have infringed on the '545 and '969 patents, Arctic Cat did not affirmatively communicate to BRP about the alleged infringement until it filed this lawsuit\n   on October 16, 2014.

Constructive Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Under this standard, Arctic Cat is entitled to calculate its damages from when it constructively notified BRP of the patents by marking its products or when it engaged in an affirmative act to notify BRP of the alleged infringement. As to constructive notice by marking, the parties agree that Arctic Cat and Honda entered into a license agreement that included the '545 and '969 patents, and that the license agreement contained no marking requirement. The parties further do not dispute that Arctic Cat made no effort to ensure that Honda marked the PWCs it sold that practiced '545 and '969 patents, and that Honda sold at least fourteen models of unmarked PWCs. On remand, Arctic Cat specifically concedes that it cannot meet its burden to show that the unmarked Honda PWCs identified by BRP do not practice the '545 and '969 patents. As a licensee, the Honda PWCs which\n   practice the patents at issue fall under the marking statute,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Amsted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504781\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/178/\">\n    24 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   185 ;\n   <em>\n    Maxwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452665\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1098/#p1111\">\n    86 F.3d at 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Arctic Cat cannot demonstrate that the Honda products were marked in accordance with Section 287(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Actual Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Since Arctic Cat failed to mark the PWCs identified by BRP, Arctic Cat can only recover damages commencing when it provided actual notice to BRP regarding infringement. The parties agree that Arctic Cat first informed BRP of the infringement on October 16, 2014 by filing this lawsuit. The parties further agree that Arctic Cat never provided any affirmative communication or notification to inform BRP of the infringement prior to filing this action. In its statement of material facts, BRP states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   8. Arctic Cat has identified no specific charge of infringement communicated to BRP by any specific accused product or device prior to filing this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   9. Arctic Cat has produced no affirmative communication of a specific charge of infringement by a specific accused product or device dated prior to the filing of this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In response, Arctic Cat disagrees with these statements of material fact and clarifies by providing its own material facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Arctic Cat has not identified an affirmative communication from\n   <em>\n    Arctic Cat\n   </em>\n   to BRP communicating a specific charge of infringement by a specific accused product or device dated before this suit was filed. But that does not mean that BRP did not have actual notice that its personal watercraft infringed before this suit was filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Arctic Cat's material facts end the inquiry. Actual notice under Section 287(a) requires the patentee to provide an \"affirmative communication of a specific charge of infringement by a specific accused product or device.\"\n   <em>\n    Amsted Indus. Inc. v. Buckeye Steel Castings Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504781\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/178/\">\n    24 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Arctic Cat readily admits that prior to filing this suit, it never provided any affirmative \"act of notification\" to BRP.\n   <em>\n    Rosebud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085965\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1070/#p1074\">\n    812 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the parties agree that the first time Arctic Cat provided any affirmative notice to BRP was October 16, 2014 when Arctic Cat filed this lawsuit, Arctic Cat has failed to meet is burden to show actual notice at any time prior to October 16, 2014. Accordingly, Arctic Cat is statutorily precluded from recovering damages for infringement prior to that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Arctic Cat argues in its Motion and in opposition to BRP's Motion that its meets it burden to show actual notice under Section 287 based on both the Court's rulings and the jury's findings of willful infringement. ECF No. [318] at 2-3. Arctic Cat further points to evidence introduced at trial that BRP knew about the '545 and '969 patents and was aware internally about potential infringement. But the reading of the statute that Arctic Cat urges conflates the patentee-centered inquiry of notice under Section 287(a) with the infringer-centered inquiry of willfulness with regard to liability. Moreover, such a reading runs contrary to binding precedent from the Federal Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The actual notice inquiry under Section 287(a) requires the Court to examine the conduct of the\n   <em>\n    patentee\n   </em>\n   , regardless of the knowledge or understanding of the infringer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Amsted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504781\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/178/\">\n    24 F.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury's finding of willfulness does not relieve Arctic Cat of its obligation to mark or notify-neither of which Arctic Cat did prior to October 16, 2014. While Arctic Cat may disagree with the Federal Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Amsted\n   </em>\n   , that case and its progeny are binding on this Court. Accordingly, the Court declines Arctic Cat's invitation to disregard binding precedent and to rely on evidence of willfulness to circumvent its affirmative notice requirement under Section 287(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Arctic Cat argues in the alternative that it is entitled to pre-suit damages beginning on September 6, 2013. Arctic Cat states that from September 6, 2013 to October 16, 2014 it complied with the marking requirement of Section 287(a) because Honda sold no products-marked or unmarked-during that time. However, the binding authority Arctic Cat cites in support of this argument falls into two factually distinct categories: instances where no patented products were produced or sold at all,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Texas Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11442698\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/308/1193/\">\n    308 F.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2002), or instances where, after initially failing to mark patented articles, the patentee either began affirmatively marking them or provided affirmative actual notice to the alleged infringer,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Am. Med. Sys., Inc. v. Med. Eng'g Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515742\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/1523/#p1536\">\n    6 F.3d 1523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Moreover, Arctic Cat cites to no factually similar binding case law in support of this interpretation of Section 287(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court rejects the extension of Section 287(a) that Arctic Cat urges. Such a holding would run contrary to the statute's purpose to prevent innocent infringement, encourage patentees to give notice to the public that the article in question is patented, and aid the public in identifying whether an article is patented.\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Wireless Techs., LP v.

However, on remand, Arctic Cat concedes that it did no such thing. Thus, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, BRP is entitled to summary judgment.
