Mr. Raven claims that the decision was motivated by political bias, violating his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments. He may be right about the motivation, but he is wrong about the law. The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause does not limit the Gallery's art decisions, because it protects private speech, rather than curtailing government speech. Nor does the Fifth Amendment apply, as Mr. Raven has no legal right to the Gallery's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Raven also seeks to amend his complaint by adding claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, but the Defendants have committed no cognizable tort, even viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Mr. Raven. Without expressing any opinion about whether the Defendants' decision was right or good, the Court finds that Mr. Raven has not articulated a plausible violation of the Constitution, or the Federal Tort Claims Act. So the Defendants' Renewed Motion to Dismiss will be granted, and Mr. Raven's Motion for Leave to Amend will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his last will and testament, James Smithson \"bequeath[ed]\" a large sum of money \"to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\" Smithsonian Institution Archives, Last Will and Testament, October 23, 1826, https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/last-will-and-testament-october-23-1826;\n   <em>\n    O'Rourke v.

Second, the public would reasonably interpret the government to be the speaker, in that it selects specific art for display. Selected artists certainly have a voice in the Gallery, but the government's selection itself conveys a government message: the government considers the artist's work to be worthy of public display and consideration.\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968258,3443477\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/23/\">\n    414 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   28 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulphus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274200\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/238/\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the public would reasonably associate the art competition, and the art displayed ... with the government[.] ... Art displayed on public property is often treated as being endorsed by the government or representative of the government's views\"). Finally, the Smithsonian's Board of Regents and its subordinates maintain editorial control over the speech. The Board has expansive authority to accept a portrait \"on the basis of its general historical interest, its artistic merit, or the historical significance of the individual to which it relates, or any combination of any such factors.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 75e(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This analysis is fatal to Mr. Raven's First Amendment claim.
