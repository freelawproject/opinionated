Wesley Loucka brought this action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that Lincoln National Life Insurance Company improperly denied him disability benefits. Mr. Loucka says that Lincoln unreasonably concluded that he suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (\"CFS\"), a condition that the relevant policy limits to 24 months of long-term disability benefits. He asserts the he has Lyme disease, which is not subject to the policy's 24-month benefits limitation. Lincoln, however, maintains that the medical evidence shows that Mr. Loucka does not have Lyme disease and his symptoms suggest CFS. The parties\n   have filed cross motions for summary judgment. Mr. Loucka has also moved to strike exhibits from Lincoln's summary judgment papers. For the reasons explained below, Mr. Loucka's Motion to Strike will be denied, his Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied, and Lincoln's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wesley Loucka worked as a Systems Administrator at NOVA Corporation, which offered its employees long-term disability coverage through a group policy (the \"Policy\") issued by Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, the Policy's insurer and claims administrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00125-205.

But IGeneX did not conduct an EIA/ELISA or IFA test, which the Centers for Disease Control's (\"CDC\") two-tiered Lyme diagnostic procedure requires before any Western Blot testing. LIN00212. IGeneX also used its own criteria for interpreting the test results instead of the CDC's. LIN007246-47. Ultimately, the IgG blot test was negative for the presence of Lyme disease under both the CDC's and IGeneX's criteria, and the IgM blot test was negative under the CDC's criteria but indeterminate under IGeneX's alternative criteria.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2014, Dr. Jemsek noted that Mr. Loucka was \"still unsure about his Lyme diagnosis.\" LIN007140. Nonetheless, he put Mr. Loucka on an intensive antibiotic regime, a common treatment for Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00210-13. Even with antibiotics Mr. Loucka's symptoms persisted: he reported \"increased neuropathy ;\" \"increased anxiety, [joint] pain ..., paresthesia[ ] in the face and brain, as well as 'body agitation;' \" \"gastrointestinal tenderness;\" and \"increased arthralgias and ... lower back pain.\" LIN007142. After Mr. Loucka began antibiotic treatments, IGeneX tested Mr. Loucka's liver tissue\n   looking for evidence of DNA from the bacterium that cause Lyme disease. LIN07243-44. The tests were negative for bacterial DNA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that year a psychologist, internal medicine doctor, and infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic evaluated Mr. Loucka and suggested he had \"CFS and GAD [Generalized Anxiety Disorder ].\" LIN007146.

He diagnosed Mr. Loucka with \"Lyme borreliosis complex, a chronic, multisystemic, inflammatory illness.\" LIN15216. Lincoln's experts disagreed. Dr. Gary Greenhood, who is board certified in internal medicine and infectious disease, reviewed Mr. Loucka's claim and found that Mr. Loucka was impaired. LIN00014-15. But Dr. Greenhood warned that the evidence \"does not support that the claimant has Lyme disease. In addition to no report of a first tier test to Lyme disease, both IgM and IgG Western Blot tests are negative by CDC ... criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After Mr. Loucka submitted additional material, Dr. Greenhood conducted a supplemental review, but he maintained that Lyme disease was unsupported.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00035. He instead concluded that \"the likely diagnosis is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Kent Crossley, who is board-certified in internal medicine and infectious disease, also reviewed Loucka's medical records for Lincoln. While quibbling with Dr. Greenhood's conclusion on impairment, he also found \"no evidence of any infectious process including Lyme disease.\" LIN02301. Dr. Crossley noted that Mr. Loucka's physical limitations were \"entirely self-reported\" and that \"Western Blot testing was done in February 2014 and was negative.\" LIN02300. Dr. Crossley agreed that Mr. Loucka's symptoms \"support a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\" LIN2301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite the differing opinions with respect to impairment, Lincoln's claim examiner approved Mr. Loucka's claim for long-term disability, effective as of October 5, 2014. LIN14842. But because Mr. Loucka was found to be disabled due to CFS, the claims examiner explained that the Policy \"limits benefits to 24 months for the condition causing [Mr. Loucka's] disability.\" LIN14843. In April 2016, Lincoln sent a letter to Mr. Loucka reminding him of the Policy's 24-month benefits limitation and informing him that his long-term disability benefits would end that October. LIN06134. Mr. Loucka appealed Lincoln's decision through the company's appeals process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Mireya Wessolossky, who is board certified in infectious disease, reviewed Mr. Loucka's appeal. After reviewing the medical evidence, she concluded that there was \"a lack of clinical and laboratory evidence for Lyme disease.\" LIN08475. She observed that Mr. Loucka's \"numerous blood tests\" were \"normal and negative\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   for Lyme disease. LIN08474. She also noted that Mr. Loucka \"had endured cycles of antibiotic therapy with lacking improvements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And she disagreed with Dr. Jemsek's interpretation of Mr. Loucka's Lyme serology, because \"by the CDC's criteria, [Mr. Loucka]'s tests were repeatedly negative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Wessolossky concluded that Mr. Loucka's symptoms \"seem to be related towards CFS,\" and based on the medical evidence, she was \"under the impression that [Mr. Loucka] suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) associated with anxiety and depression.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on Dr. Wessolossky's report, Lincoln affirmed its decision limiting Mr. Loucka to 24 months of long-term benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Loucka then filed this suit. But because the Policy requires claimants to exhaust two levels of appeal before suing, the Court stayed the action to allow Mr. Loucka to pursue a second-level internal appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's September 13, 2017, Minute Order granting parties' Consent Mot. to Stay Litigation, ECF # 6. Dr. Joseph Vinetz, who is board certified in internal medicine and infectious disease, and Dr. Rajendra Marwah, who is board certified in rheumatology and internal medicine, reviewed Mr. Loucka's second-level appeal. Citing much of the medical evidence that has already been discussed, Dr. Vinetz concluded that Mr. Loucka did not \"meet the criteria for the diagnosis of Lyme disease.\" LIN00209-10. Dr. Marwah similarly concluded that Mr. Loucka does not meet the CDC's criteria for a diagnosis of Lyme disease. LIN00211. Drs. Vinetz and Marwah also agreed that Mr. Loucka's symptomology suggested that he suffers from CFS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00210-12. Even after Mr. Loucka submitted additional material, Drs. Vinetz and Marwah maintained that Mr. Loucka did not have clinical features or laboratory confirmation of Lyme disease based on the CDC's criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00238-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Lincoln subsequently upheld its decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   LIN00222-36, and Mr. Loucka returned to court, again seeking to clarify and enforce his rights under the Policy, as permitted by ERISA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its summary judgment papers, Lincoln included three footnotes referencing the CDC's webpages about the agency's Lyme-testing criteria and procedures. It also attached a declaration from Thomas Vargo, Lincoln's Director of Appeals, about Lincoln's procedures for reducing conflicts of interest and promoting accuracy during the claim review process. Mr. Loucka moved to strike the references to the CDC's website and Mr. Vargo's declaration, citing the general principle that \"[c]ourts review ERISA-plan benefit decisions on the evidence presented to the plan administrators, not on a record later made in another forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Block v.

First, Mr. Loucka contends that Lincoln bears the burden of proving that the Policy's 24-month benefits limitation for certain \"Specified Injuries and Sicknesses\" applies. He misplaces the burden. Under ERISA, \"the burden of proof is upon the insured as to questions of coverage and disability,\"\n   <em>\n    Heller v. Fortis Benefits Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219380,3713663\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/487/\">\n    142 F.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (D.C. Cir. 1998), and here the Policy provides that the claimant's proof of claim \"must show the date the disability began,\n   <em>\n    its cause\n   </em>\n   and degree.\" LIN00138 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. Loucka counters that the burden rests on \"administrators to demonstrate how a specific policy exclusion applies to deny benefits.\" Pl. Mot. for Summ. J., ECF # 16-1, Page 30 (citing cases). But while \"[f]acially, [a 24-month] limitation might appear to operate much like an exclusion,\" where a policy requires claimants to provide proof of the cause of disability, \"[o]ne could argue that these provisions put the burden on [the claimant] to establish the physical or organic etiology of h[is] disability in order for h[im] to be eligible to continue receiving benefits after two years.\"\n   <em>\n    Gent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697733\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/79/\">\n    611 F.3d at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regardless, when, as here, the Court must decide only whether an administrator's decision was reasonable, \"how the burden is allocated does not much matter unless one or both parties fail to produce evidence, or the evidence presented by the two sides is in 'perfect equipoise.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697733\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    LPP Mortg., Ltd. v.

Thus, Lincoln properly limited Mr. Loucka's benefits under the Policy. Five physicians-Drs. Greenhood, Crossley, Wessolossky, Vinetz, and Marwah-agreed after reviewing Mr. Loucka's file that he does not have Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00014-15 (Dr. Greenhood); LIN02301 (Dr. Crossley); LIN08474-75 Dr. (Wessolossky); LIN00209-10 (Dr. Vinetz); LIN00210-12 (Dr. Marwah). They cited Mr. Loucka's various blood tests, observing that he never underwent the CDC's two-step Lyme testing protocol and his IgM and IgG Western blot tests were negative by the CDC's standards.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LIN08474. Even under IGeneX's alternative criteria, Mr. Loucka's IgG Western blot was negative, and his IgM Western blot was \"indeterminate.\" LIN07246-47. Drs. Vinetz, Marwah, and Wessolossky also observed that Loucka saw no improvement despite intensive treatment with antibiotics when \"[m]ost cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LIN00210. And all five physicians agreed that Loucka's symptoms evinced CFS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00035 (Dr. Greenhood); LIN02298-2301 (Dr. Crossley); LIN08473-76 (Dr. Wessolossky); LIN01468-73 (Dr. Vinetz); LIN01458-67 (Dr. Marwah).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In fact, Dr. Jemsek, Mr. Loucka's treating physician, is the only physician to conclude that Mr. Loucka suffers from Lyme disease. His conclusion was based, in part, on his opinion that the CDC's Lyme-testing criteria and procedures are \"antique and obsolete.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LIN00237. So Mr. Loucka's argument, ultimately, is that Lincoln unreasonably credited the reviewing physicians' opinions-based on the CDC's Lyme-testing\n   standards-over his treating physician's opinion-based on alternative standards. But if Mr. Loucka's argument is that Dr. Jemsek's opinion is entitled to greater weight because he is Mr. Loucka's treating physician, the law disagrees. \"[C]ourts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician's evaluation.\"\n   <em>\n    Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v.

Dr. Jemsek's conclusion that Loucka suffers from Lyme disease conflicted with substantial, reliable evidence in the form of five separate medical opinions that ruled out Lyme disease and concluded that Loucka most likely suffers from CFS. As in\n   <em>\n    Pettaway\n   </em>\n   , the Court \"cannot conclude that [the plan administrator] acted unreasonably when it valued the opinion of its own personnel over that of [the insured's].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648516,3556981\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/427/\">\n    644 F.3d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   If Mr. Loucka's objection is to Lincoln's reliance on the CDC's Lyme-testing standards, his objection is similarly unavailing. Dr. Jemsek claims that the CDC's criteria are \"antique and obsolete,\" and perhaps he is right that there is reason to question the agency's Lyme-testing standards.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Holly J. Westervelt and Robert J. McCaffery,\n   <em>\n    Neuropsychological Functioning in Chronic Lyme Disease\n   </em>\n   , 12 Neuropsychology Rev. 153, 156 (2002) (noting that \"[m]any clinicians and scientists feel that [the CDC's] criteria are too strict\") (available at LIN01376). But Mr. Loucka's counsel's prolix discussion of Lyme disease, with little to no specific citations to the record or other authoritative material, ultimately does little to advance his client's case. Whether the CDC's Lyme-testing criteria and procedures are medically sound is not before the Court. The pertinent question is whether it was reasonable for Lincoln to rely on the CDC's standards to evaluate Mr. Loucka's file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It was. Courts frequently defer to reviewing physicians' reliance upon the CDC criteria. For example, the\n   <em>\n    Gent\n   </em>\n   court considered a claim like Mr. Loucka's, and in affirming the administrator's conclusion that the plaintiff did not suffer from Lyme disease, the First Circuit approvingly cited the administrator's use of the CDC's standards.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697733\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/79/\">\n    611 F.3d at 84-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that the \"arguments that Gent's disability was not caused by Lyme disease [was] the better-supported position,\" in large part because the laboratory data, evaluated under the CDC's criteria, \"lines up almost uniformly against such a diagnosis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697733\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697733\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/79/\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And other courts similarly have determined that administrators may reasonably rely the CDC's Lyme-testing criteria to determine whether a claimant has Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4169174\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/62/681/#p687\">\n    62 F.Supp.3d at 686-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding administrator's denial of benefits where claimant's Lyme blood tests were negative under the CDC's two-step testing regime). Ultimately, even if there is genuine medical disagreement about the efficacy of the CDC's Lyme-testing standards, conflicting medical evidence need not render an administrator's decision arbitrary and capricious, because \"[t]he ability to choose among conflicting evidence is essentially a natural outgrowth of the discretion that the plan affords to the plan administer.\"\n   <em>\n    Mobley v. Cont'l Causalty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"908123\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/405/42/#p48\">\n    405 F.Supp.2d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (D.D.C. 2005). In short, Lincoln's reliance on the CDC's Lyme-testing criteria and procedures was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Loucka's final line of attack is to assert that Lincoln's claim review\n   process suffers from structural conflicts of interest, a factor courts may consider when reviewing the lawfulness of an administrator's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n    554 U.S. at 115-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But any one factor will act only as a \"tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced, the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor's inherent or case-specific importance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n    at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the evidence is not \"closely balanced.\" Moreover, to show Lincoln's alleged bias and conflicts Mr. Loucka cites cases from other jurisdictions that are unrelated to the current action; some are nearly two decades old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mot. Summ. J., ECF # 16-1, Pages 35-36 (citing, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Vartanian v. Met. Life Ins.

Certainly, Mr. Loucka's evidence of Lincoln's alleged structural conflicts is not strong enough to overcome the overwhelming evidence in favor of finding Lincoln's decision reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   What is more, structural conflicts of interest are less important \"(perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Glenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n    554 U.S. at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677099\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/105/#p115\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Considering the content of Mr. Vargo's declaration, Lincoln has taken significant steps to reduce potential bias in the claim review process. Thus, the conflict factor approaches \"the vanishing point\" here, and it is even more true that it cannot overcome the overwhelming evidence supporting Lincoln's position. Because Lincoln's conclusion that Mr. Loucka suffers from CFS, not Lyme disease, is the product of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and is supported by substantial evidence, its decision to limit Mr. Loucka's benefits to 24 months under the Policy was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court does not doubt that Mr. Loucka has suffered greatly, and it acknowledges the medical uncertainties surrounding Lyme disease and the added difficulties patients like Mr. Loucka endure as a result. Unfortunately, these are issues courts of law are ill-equipped to address. In light of the CDC's current guidance on Lyme disease and the discretion ERISA grants to plan administrators, plaintiffs face a high bar when challenging an insurance company's determination in this area. Mr. Loucka has not cleared this bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For all these reasons, Mr. Loucka's Motion to Strike is denied, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied, and Defendant's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.
