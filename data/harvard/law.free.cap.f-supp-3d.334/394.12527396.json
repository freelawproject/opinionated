(\"South Bay\"), and others to recover payments made by the Massachusetts Medicaid program (\"MassHealth\") as a result of allegedly false claims submitted to MassHealth from August 2009 to the present. The other defendants are Community Intervention Services, Inc. (\"C.I.S.\"), and Community Intervention Services Holdings, Inc. (\"C.I.S.H.\"); H.I.G. Growth Partners, LLC, and H.I.G. Capital, LLC (collectively, \"H.I.G. Defendants\"); Peter J. Scanlon; and Kevin P. Sheehan. The core allegation is that Defendants submitted claims for services of \"unlicensed, unqualified, and unsupervised personnel\" in violation of MassHealth regulations at 17 South Bay mental-health centers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Commonwealth's 27-count Complaint-in-Intervention (\"the Complaint\") contains 368 paragraphs and multiple exhibits alleging false claims in violation of state law, regulations, and common law. It asserts claims under the Massachusetts False Claims Act (\"MFCA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 5A\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the Massachusetts Medicaid False Claims Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118E, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 44 ; Recovery of Overpayment regulations, 130 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 450.237, 450.260(A), 450.260(I) ; Unjust Enrichment; and Breach of Contract. The Commonwealth asserts subject-matter jurisdiction over state-law claims arising from the same transactions or occurrences as an action brought under the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203732\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a separate complaint, Relator has brought claims under the FCA. The federal government has declined to intervene. Because the Relator's allegations, causes of action, and theories of recovery are different, her claims will be addressed in a separate opinion with which the Court assumes familiarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2018, the Commonwealth reached an agreement to resolve its state-law claims against South Bay, C.I.S., and C.I.S.H., and dismissed them as Defendants. Accordingly, this memorandum focuses on the remaining 14 state-law counts against the H.I.G. Defendants and the individual Defendants, Scanlon and Sheehan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The remaining Defendants have moved to dismiss on multiple grounds. After a hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the motions as to Counts 13, 14, and 15 against the H.I.G.

South Bay was founded by Defendant Scanlon in 1986, and from then until April 12, 2012, he owned all outstanding capital stock. South Bay's Brockton Clinic is the parent mental-health center, at which most of the administrative, organizational, and clinical services are performed. The satellite facilities are in different locations, but operate under the license of the parent and fall under its fiscal, administrative, and personnel management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   South Bay submitted claims for mental-health counseling to MassHealth through the Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partnership (\"MBHP\"), which administers and pays mental health care plans for patients enrolled in the Primary Care Clinical Plan. Other patients are enrolled in Managed Care Organizations (\"MCOs\"), which contract with MassHealth to administer the payment of mental-health benefits. MassHealth also provides mental-health benefits on a fee-for-services basis. The MassHealth regulations governing the operations, staffing, licensing, and supervision requirements of mental-health centers are set out at 130 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 429.000,\n   <em>\n    et\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Private Equity Investors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants H.I.G. Growth, LLC, and its capital investment affiliate, H.I.G. Capital, LLC, are Delaware limited liability companies. The H.I.G. entities and Defendant Sheehan partnered to acquire South Bay. They established layers of corporations to accomplish this purchase. Scanlon sold his capital stock in South Bay to C.I.S., a Delaware corporation, and received a cash payment, common stock, and a promissory note, together worth over $31 million. C.I.S.H., a Delaware holding corporation, owns C.I.S., which owns South Bay. H.I.G. Growth owns 71.1 percent of C.I.S.H. Sheehan, who had over 30 years of behavioral health care experience and conducted \"substantial due diligence\" before purchasing C.I.S., became the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of C.I.S. until 2016, and Scanlon served as the Chief Clinical Officer until either 2013 or 2014. Scanlon was a member of the Boards of Directors of South Bay and C.I.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   H.I.G.'s managing director and principals form the majority of the C.I.S. board that owns and operates South Bay. Nicholas Scola, Steven Loose, Eric Tencer, Sheehan, and Scanlon served on the five-member Board of Directors of C.I.S. Scola, Loose, and Tencer are principals or directors of H.I.G. Growth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board of Directors of C.I.S. \"was aware of South Bay operating\" and was \"responsible for making strategic decisions\" including \"personnel changes,\" \"financial matters,\" and evaluations of \"specific long-term issues at South Bay\" like \"the struggle to recruit and retain clinicians.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     The Whistleblower\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Christine Martino-Fleming, the Relator, is a licensed mental-health counselor. She was employed by South Bay from June 2008 until September 2013. Initially, she was a Job Coach at South Bay, helping with documentation, billing, and time management. In March 2012, she was elevated to the Coordinator of Staff Development and Training position for C.I.S. Her duties included analyzing the education and experience\n   of South Bay employees. She also was responsible for the clinical training of new clinicians and the managerial leadership training for supervisors, directors, and regional directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In examining the qualifications of the employees, Martino-Fleming came across numerous supervision and credentialing deficiencies, which she communicated to the Defendants as early as 2012: (1) hundreds of South Bay employees were not licensed and were ineligible for licenses; (2) at least 28 clinic directors did not have one of the licenses required by the regulations, and 24 clinic directors did not have any type of license; (3) many clinicians could not obtain licenses because they had degrees from unaccredited schools, they had not taken the prerequisite licensing courses, some of their degrees were in programs such as art therapy and school counseling rather than one of the core disciplines, or they had not had the required internships; (4) even when employees did have the proper credentials, they did not have supervised training on a full-time basis once they obtained their master's degrees; (5) unqualified clinicians were not receiving the necessary supervision; and (6) in some facilities, none of the supervisors were independently licensed, and it was common to find unlicensed clinic and regional directors. Because every clinic needed to be managed by a core team of licensed individuals, every South Bay clinic, including the parent center, was in violation of the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2014, Martino-Fleming informed the Chief Operating Officer and the Compliance Officer that \" '32 directors/supervisors do NOT have their independent license,' 13 directors/supervisors are independently licensed but don't have 5 years' experience, 'only 8 directors/supervisors are independently licensed and have 5 years post MA experience' and only '4 out of 5 regional directors have their independent license.' \" Sara Hart, identified as a Director of Clinical Services and Compliance Officer, drove this point home with the President and Chief Operating Officer, noting that even if MBHP regulations were more flexible, \"[South Bay] still ha[d] to be compliant with ALL [MassHealth regulations].\" Hart went on to note that licensure supervision, necessary for clinicians to be license-eligible, was insufficient to meet the regulatory requirements of \"direct and continuous\" supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Tiger Teams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In early to mid-2014, the Board of Directors employed \"Tiger Teams,\" working groups tasked with investigating the cause of employee turnover. The Tiger Teams found multiple improper practices, particularly with respect to lack of licensure supervision, in violation of requirements set by MassHealth, MBHP, and the MCOs. The teams made recommendations to the C.I.S. Board and others, including, but not limited to, Defendants Sheehan and Scanlon, to remedy the improper practices. The teams encountered supervisors who expressed concern about signing off on documentation from clinicians they had never met. Although H.I.G. and C.I.S. knew about the licensing violations, South Bay did not adopt the recommendations to rectify the noncompliance and continued submitting false claims to MassHealth, MBHP, and MCOs. It did not report the noncompliance to MassHealth. Over $120 million in unlawful reimbursements were made to South Bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The MFCA, Mass.

Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(3), which subjects\n   to liability any person who conspires to violate \u00a7 5B(a)(1) or \u00a7 5B(a)(10). Unlike Relator, the Commonwealth does not assert that H.I.G. itself caused the submission of false claims. Rather, the Complaint alleges that the H.I.G. Defendants, \"through their role overseeing and managing Defendant South Bay,\" agreed with South Bay to continue submitting false claims for services, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(1), and to continue failing to declare to the Commonwealth the false claims and receipt of overpayments, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(10). The H.I.G. Defendants move to dismiss this count under the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, which generally holds that parent and subsidiary corporations cannot, as a matter of law, conspire together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss on an FCA conspiracy claim, the complaint must plausibly allege that \"(1) the defendant conspired with one or more persons to get a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid by the United States; and (2) one or more conspirators performed any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Commonwealth alleges that H.I.G. Growth owns 71.1 percent of C.I.S.H., and that H.I.G. placed its managing director and two of its principals/employees on C.I.S.'s five-member Board, thereby controlling both C.I.S. and South Bay. It alleges that the H.I.G. Defendants -- private equity investors in South Bay, not competitors -- oversaw and managed C.I.S. and South Bay. As alleged, H.I.G. and C.I.S. are not independent centers of decisionmaking, and the formalistic legal distinctions among the multiple corporate entities are not dispositive. Even when all reasonable inferences are drawn in the Commonwealth's favor, the allegations in the Complaint do not support the contention that C.I.S., H.I.G., and South Bay are independent actors.

Specifically, the Commonwealth alleges: \"[T]he H.I.G. Defendants, as majority owners of the C.I.S. Defendants, received money to which they were not entitled, and which they have retained.\" Moreover, the Commonwealth alleges that H.I.G. knew about the failure to meet regulatory requirements governing supervision and licensing through communications by the whistleblower and the Tiger Teams to its agents on the Board of Directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The H.I.G.

While the MFCA should be liberally read, if \"beneficiary\" is construed too broadly, any person who incidentally benefitted from South Bay's improved financial status resulting from its\n   alleged submission of false claims could be a \"beneficiary\" -- say, an employee getting a higher salary or a shareholder whose stock increases in value. The Commonwealth cites no caselaw or legislative history to support such a broad reading, and the Court has found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even under an expansive definition, however, the Commonwealth's reverse-MFCA claim fails. For one, the Commonwealth has not adequately alleged an \"overpayment\" within the meaning of the MFCA. The statute defines \"overpayment\" as \"any funds that a person receives or retains ... to which the person,\n   <em>\n    after applicable reconciliation\n   </em>\n   , is not entitled.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5A (emphasis added). As discussed in the Court's memorandum on Relator's complaint, the Commonwealth has not adequately alleged that any such reconciliation occurred here. And, far from being established, the parties' entitlement to the disputed Medicaid payments is the subject of this very litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, the Commonwealth has not alleged that the purported overpayments from MassHealth to South Bay were transferred to H.I.G., or that H.I.G. was a third-party beneficiary that benefitted directly from the alleged overpayments. Finally, the \"beneficiary\" provision does not impose liability on \"a successor for wrongs committed previously.\"\n   <em>\n    Armenta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20832\">\n    47 Cal.Rptr.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839 n.6.

Mass. Aug. 29, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Commonwealth argues that its Complaint is replete with allegations specifying clinic-by-clinic claims that were systematically submitted to MassHealth for services provided in violation of the staffing and supervision regulations. For example, the Commonwealth alleges that in the Salem clinic, \"only a handful\" of the 80 individuals were independently licensed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Neither the regional director nor the clinical director were licensed. None of the supervisors were individually licensed. There was one licensed supervisor (a licensed independent clinical social worker), but she was not providing \"direct and continuous supervision\" to unlicensed clinicians. The majority of staff therapists were unlicensed and could not have been adequately licensed given the lack of qualified supervisors. According to the Commonwealth, because the clinic was in violation of the staffing and supervision regulations,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   claims to MassHealth were false and fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Scanlon argues that the Complaint does not meet Rule 9(b) requirements because MassHealth has information about services billed based on provider identification but does not have information about the specific clinicians who provided those services. Attached to the Complaint, though, is a claims summary chart, which includes information about the procedure codes and the amounts MassHealth and its reimbursement partners paid to South Bay for services totaling $123,109,849.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Complaint also references a table in Relator's second amended complaint listing specific examples of South Bay's claims for patients who received treatment from unlicensed and unsupervised clinicians. Scanlon complains that the \"Information as of Last Date billed\" field in this table does not identify the date of an allegedly false claim. The Court disagrees: these allegations of systemic regulatory violations, together with patient-specific bills, amply meet the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Next, Scanlon argues that he did not cause the government to make payments that it would not have otherwise made.

He points out that the Commonwealth has not alleged with particularity that South Bay submitted any false claims or certifications to the contractors which increased the capitation rates.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Zemplenyi v. Group Health Coop.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 09-603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20814261\">\n    2011 WL 814261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 3, 2011) (holding that alleged false claims for unnecessary medical procedures, under capitated system, did not violate FCA because the government was not spending additional money when surgery was performed). This argument is also addressed in the memorandum on Relator's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Scanlon's argument fails because the MFCA imposes liability on any person who causes a false claim to be presented to a government contractor. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(1). Although the contractors are paid a fixed rate by MassHealth, the claims for mental health care are paid\n   with government money. Under the MFCA, a person who makes false claims to a government contractor is liable if the money is to be spent to \"advance a program or interest of the commonwealth.\" Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 12, \u00a7 5A. Like the FCA, the MFCA does not require the government to prove actual or specific damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Grubbs v.

Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(10) should be dismissed because it has not been alleged that he was a beneficiary of the funds. The Commonwealth argues that because Scanlon owned all outstanding capital stock in South Bay, the Complaint plausibly states he was a third-party \"beneficiary\" of the overpayments made to South Bay for that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Assuming, without deciding, that Scanlon qualifies as a \"beneficiary\" within the scope of \u00a7 5B(a)(10), this claim suffers from most of the same defects as the reverse-FCA claim against the H.I.G. Defendants, discussed above. The Commonwealth again has failed to sufficiently explain or develop this claim as to Scanlon. Accordingly, Count 18 is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Recovery of Overpayment Regulations (Count 20)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Commonwealth's claims pursuant to 130 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 450.260(A) fail. That regulation permits MassHealth to recover \"the full amount of any moneys\" owed by a provider. A provider is liable for the prompt payment to any MassHealth agency of the full amount of any overpayments owed under applicable laws or regulations. 130 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 450.260(A). A provider is defined as \"an individual, group, facility, agency, institution, organization, or business that furnishes medical services and participates in MassHealth under a provider contract with the MassHealth agency.\" 130 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 450.101. There is no allegation that Scanlon individually furnished \"medical services\" -- defined as \"medical care or related goods and services, including behavioral health services and long-term services and supports (LTSS) provided to members, paid or payable by the MassHealth agency\" -- under a provider contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642790\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/180/#p188\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This claim is dismissed as to Scanlon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Causation and Knowledge under the MFCA (Count 22)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Sheehan argues that the Complaint does not contain sufficient allegations that he caused the submission of false claims pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(1). He argues that when he learned of the problems at South Bay, in June 2014, he took immediate steps to remedy them. Alternatively, in an argument of a different stripe, he contends the failure to take steps to stop the payment after he learned of the falsity from the Tiger Teams is insufficient to \"cause\" the presentment of false claims to the government under \u00a7 5B(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As alleged by the Complaint, Sheehan was both the CEO and a Board member of C.I.S., the parent company of South Bay. The Complaint alleges that he knew about the regulatory issues based on the due diligence report, statements of Relator, and the Tiger Team investigation as early\n   as May 2012. The Complaint also alleges that as the CEO of the company that owned South Bay, he knowingly rejected recommendations to have licensed supervision and to end the policy that caused others to submit false claims for the services of unqualified and unlicensed individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Sheehan, as CEO of C.I.S. and a member of the Boards of C.I.S. and South Bay, had the power, authority, and duty to stop the submission of false claims by the agents and employees of South Bay once he learned about material violations of MassHealth regulations. His alleged rejection of the recommendation left in place the policy which led to the submission of false claims. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 5B(a)(1). The motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    B. MFCA Conspiracy (Count 23)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Commonwealth alleges that Defendant Sheehan \"implicitly\" conspired with South Bay in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(3). Even with reasonable inferences drawn in the Commonwealth's favor, the Complaint does not adequately allege that Sheehan, the CEO of C.I.S., which wholly owned and controlled South Bay, was an independent center of decisionmaking. Therefore, this claim is barred by the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine for the reasons discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Reverse False Claims (Count 24)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Sheehan is liable for reverse false claims in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 5B(a)(10). It alleges that by April 2012, Sheehan, in his role as CEO of C.I.S., \"received money to which he was not entitled, and which he has retained.\" The Commonwealth argues that it has sufficiently stated a claim because it alleges Sheehan held a financial interest in South Bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As above, the Commonwealth has not adequately developed its reverse-FCA claim against Sheehan. In addition, Sheehan maintained only a 5.4 percent ownership stake in South Bay by way of his stake in C.I.S.H. This small of a stake makes it even less likely that Sheehan would qualify as a \"beneficiary\" under \u00a7 5B(a)(10). This count is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Mass Medicaid FCA (Count 25) and Recovery of Overpayment Regulations (Count 26)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Sheehan's motion to dismiss does not separately challenge these counts apart from the arguments already discussed. Accordingly, Count 25 is not dismissed for the reasons stated in Part III.A. of this opinion. Count 26 is dismissed for the reasons given in Part III.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Unjust Enrichment (Count 27)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Once again, the unjust enrichment claim may be pled against all defendants as an alternative theory of liability. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d). The motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The motions to dismiss (Dkt. Nos. 103, 106, and 109) are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   . The Court dismisses Counts 13, 14, and 15 against the H.I.G. Defendants; Counts 18 and 20 against Scanlon; and Counts 23, 24, and 26 against Sheehan.
