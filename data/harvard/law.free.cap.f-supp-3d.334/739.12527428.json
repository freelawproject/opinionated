BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This cause comes before the Court on plaintiff's complaint seeking injunctive relief and motion for temporary restraining order pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendant has responded to the motion for temporary restraining order and has filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held a hearing on July 13, 2018, at Raleigh, North Carolina at which counsel for the parties appeared and the Court heard argument. For the reasons that follow, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is an ear, nose, and throat medical practice with offices in Robeson, Richmond, and Wake Counties, North Carolina. The plaintiff practice primarily serves rural and poor patients who are Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Following an audit conducted by a contractor for Medicare, it was determined by defendant that plaintiff been overpaid by Medicare during the period of June 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016, for $1,707,223.52 for claims that were not reasonably medically necessary. This amount was based on a statistical extrapolation following the contractor's review of thirty-six of plaintiff's claims for Medicare reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant has begun to recoup the $1.7 million in overpayment by withholding payment to plaintiff on current Medicare claims. Plaintiff alleges that the stated reasons for the overpayment determination are fundamentally and provably false, and has appealed the finding of overpayment determination through the first two of four stages required by law. Plaintiff is currently awaiting the third stage of appeal before an administrative law judge (ALJ), and has been notified that there is an approximate 1200-day wait for ALJ review due to a backlog of cases. Plaintiff alleges that it has no adequate remedy at law and seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting defendant from recoupment of plaintiff's Medicare reimbursement payments prior to the completion of the administrative process. Plaintiff contends that the extraordinary backlog of Medicare appeals effectively denies plaintiff its right to appeal, and that mandamus relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is necessary to compel defendant to adhere to its own rules and regulations which require it to conduct an administrative hearing on plaintiff's appeal request within ninety-days. Plaintiff has alleged claims for violation of its procedural and substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, for preservation of status of rights under Section 705 of the Administrative Procedures Act, and for injunctive and mandamus relief as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court considers first defendant's motion to dismiss as it concerns the\n   Court's subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's complaint. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) authorizes dismissal of a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. When subject matter jurisdiction is challenged, the plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction to survive the motion.\n   <em>\n    Evans v. B.F.

The Medicare Act, or Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, provides for a federally subsidized health insurance program which is administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckler v.

Claims for reimbursement by Medicare providers are typically paid without substantive inquiry, but the payments remain subject to subsequent review by a third-party auditor, known as a Recovery Audit Contractor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cumberland Cty.

The third step is a hearing before an ALJ, and the review culminates with a decision by the Medicare Appeals Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(a) - (d) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405.940\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 405.960; 405 1000; 405.1100. The Medicare Act also provides timing deadlines for the review process, and requires,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the ALJ's decision be issued within ninety days of the provider's request for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(d)(1)(A).

Here, there is no final decision of the Secretary for this Court to review. Moreover, plaintiff's claim that it has been denied due process and its claim for injunctive and mandamus relief are procedural claims which are \"inextricably intertwined\" with its recoupment challenge, and therefore should be \"channeled into the administrative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Ringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/#p605\">\n    466 U.S. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/#p605\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, as defendant argues, plaintiff cannot establish that it is entitled to injunctive or mandamus relief. In\n   <em>\n    Cumberland County Hospital System v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   , a case involving a hospital system's attempt to use mandamus relief to compel the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to comply with the timing provisions of the Medicare administrative review process in a reimbursement challenge, the Fourth Circuit held in that \"[a] writ of mandamus, as requested by the Hospital System, would have courts interrupt the specified administrative process and cross the lines of authority created by statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176325\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/48/#p53\">\n    816 F.3d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Cumberland\n   </em>\n   court recognized that extraordinary backlogs have caused the administrative process to be in \"grave condition,\" but found that rehabilitation of that process is for the political branches and not the courts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176325\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/48/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176325\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/48/#p53\">\n    at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that Congress in the Medicare Act gave healthcare providers with the choice to either wait for an ALJ hearing past the ninety-day deadline or escalate the review process to the next level, the court determined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   While we agree that the delay in the administrative process for Medicare reimbursement is incontrovertibly grotesque, the Medicare Act does not guarantee a healthcare provider a hearing before an ALJ within 90 days, as the Hospital System claims.
