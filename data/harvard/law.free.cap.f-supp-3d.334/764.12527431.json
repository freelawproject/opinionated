On April 8, 2015, HPA wrote a letter to Western.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   HPA stated that PASI was terminated for default as \"a result of PASI's actions on 19 January 2015 when PASI allowed a breach in a containment area to occur and their failure to follow their Site Specific Lead Paint Removal Compliance Plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter expressed that \"Since the date of the breach basically all productive painting and blasting [has] stopped.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter stated that \"PASI's actions have caused\n   approximately a 3 month delay to the project and the costs associated with the delay are increasing on a day by day basis until painting and abrasive blasting operations recommence.

On April 28, 2015, HPA wrote another letter to Western.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, HPA stated that since HPA's February 25, 2015, demand on Western, Western \"ha[d] not provided [HPA] with a proposed method of completing PASI's remaining work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   HPA noted that, three weeks prior, HPA had proposed using ADS and M Natal and that, \"At that time HPA requested authorization from WSC to issue the subcontracts.

As of this date [Western] has failed to provide any type of response.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   HPA asserted that, to meet its obligations to NASA, HPA could \"no longer wait on a response from\" Western and that HPA \"must take immediate action to resume the work that ha[d] been delayed as a result of PASI's failure to properly perform.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   HPA informed Western that it would tender subcontracts to ADS and M Natal; that the \"cost of these two subcontracts will exceed the remaining amounts of PASI's contract balance by approximately $250,000\"; and that HPA intended to hold Western and PASI \"responsible\" for \"any and all\" costs \"associated with PASI's default\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   28. On April 29, 2015, Western responded by letter to HPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western stated that it disagreed with HPA's assessment because \"one of the surety's fundamental rights is the right to investigate the declaration of default by the obligee and the underlying contract at issue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western further stated: \"While we have been willing to cooperate and\n   consider HPA's proposals [with ADS and M Natal], as surety we are entitled to accept or reject suggested contracts or otherwise put to bid with other contractors for competitive pricing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western denied that it had \"done nothing\"; denied having copies of the ADS and M Natal proposals; said that it \"appear[ed] that HPA has elected to move forward under its own volition without the surety's agreement as to process objective\"; indicated that Western \"expect[ed] HPA to mitigate any and all damage during the prosecution of the work; and \"strictly reserve[d]\" its rights under the Bond, contract, and law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   29.

In sum, having carefully considered the law, the facts in the record, and the arguments and submissions of the parties, the Court finds that Western has failed to meet its burden of clearly showing irreparable injury. First, Western has failed to show that it is entitled to an injunction purely by virtue of its status as a surety. Rather, Western must demonstrate that it faces some risk that PASI will ultimately be unable to pay a judgment if liable, and Western has failed to do so. Second, the Court finds that PASI has unreasonably delayed seeking a preliminary injunction without adequate justification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   120.

Further, as in\n   <em>\n    Allied World\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that there are two pivotal issues that are more appropriately resolved at the stage of \"motions for summary judgment and a full development of the record.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    228\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, \"Loss\" is defined in the Indemnity Agreement to include \"any other cost incurred by the Surety in good faith as a result of having issued or procured the issuance of a Bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    229\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, there are two key issues. First, under\n   <em>\n    Great American Insurance Co. v. McElwee Bros, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (which this Court finds controlling), Indemnitors have the burden of proving bad faith on Western's part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    230\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Western has the burden of proving causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    231\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Court likely agrees that PASI has failed to prove bad faith at this stage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    232\n   </footnotemark>\n   PASI has raised considerable questions and uncertainty about the issue of whether the bulk of Western's losses were truly \"incurred ... as a result of having issued or procured the issuance of a Bond\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    233\n   </footnotemark>\n   and not, as PASI contends, the result of Western's own breach of its obligations under the Bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    234\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considering the fact that discovery has not even closed at this point,\n   <footnotemark>\n    235\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that issuing a preliminary injunction at this stage with an incomplete record would be ill-advised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   131. The Court notes a final reason for following\n   <em>\n    Allied World\n   </em>\n   over\n   <em>\n    Employers Mutual Casualty.\n   </em>\n   While the Court does not doubt a surety's entitlement to specific performance on the issue of collateralization under state law, the issue here is whether that state law trumps Rule 65's requirement for a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   132. In\n   <em>\n    Passmore v. Baylor Health Care System\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit explained: \"A federal court entertaining state law claims cannot apply a state law or rule if (1) the state law or rule 'direct[ly] colli[des]' with a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and (2) the Federal Rule 'represents a valid exercise of Congress' rulemaking authority.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    236\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no serious dispute as to the second issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    237\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   133. As to the first, \"[a] state law directly collides with a Federal Rule if it provides a different answer to the question in dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    238\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   134. \"To preclude the application of a state law ... the relevant Federal Rule need not be identical in purpose or scope. Rather, the inquiry is whether the scope of the Federal Rule is sufficiently broad ... to control the issue before the court, such that it answer[s] the same question' as the state law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    239\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   135. Here, the Court finds a direct collision between state and federal law. As reflected above, state law would entitle Western to specific performance without any showing of a substantial threat of irreparable injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   136. Conversely, as amply demonstrated above, Rule 65 requires such a showing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   137. Moreover, Rule 65 is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the Court and answer the same question as the state law claim: whether a plaintiff (here, a surety) is entitled to have defendants deposit with the Court the alleged losses plaintiff sustained before judgment to protect plaintiff from loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   138. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , the Court cannot enforce state law allowing specific performance absent proof of a substantial threat of irreparable harm, given Rule 65's requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   139. Nevertheless, the Court notes that, even if there were no direct collision, Western would still be required to prove a substantial threat of irreparable harm; under this scenario, Rule 65's general requirement for a clear showing of a substantial threat of irreparable harm without the injunction would apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   140. For all these reasons, the Court finds that Western has failed to make a clear showing of a substantial threat of irreparable injury so as to entitle it to a preliminary injunction. On this ground alone, Western's motion can be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Western's Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   141. Nevertheless, even putting the above findings aside, Western has also failed to meet its burden of showing entitlement to this extraordinary relief for unreasonably delaying in seeking a preliminary injunction, without adequate justification and to PASI's prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   142. \"The law is well-established that:\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   [D]elay in seeking a remedy is an important factor bearing on the need for a preliminary injunction. Absent a good explanation, a substantial period of delay militates against the issuance of a preliminary injunction by demonstrating that there is no apparent urgency to the request for injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    240\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   143. Wright and Miller similarly recognizes: \"A long delay by plaintiff after learning of the threatened harm also may be taken as an indication that the harm would not be serious enough to justify a preliminary injunction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    241\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, in a different section on laches and preliminary injunctions, the treatise states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   Unlike a defense based upon the statute of limitations, mere delay is not sufficient to bar injunctive relief on the ground of laches.... Delay coupled with knowledge and acquiescence in the acts complained of, as well as prejudice to defendant generally will be a sufficient basis for denying injunctive relief.... The defense of laches is equitable in nature and the court must look at all the factors or circumstances relevant to a given case when deciding whether relief should be barred. Thus, a lapse of time because of plaintiff's ignorance of his rights or his disability or in some situations, even neglect, when it is not attributable to a lack of diligence, should not bar the issuance of an injunction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    242\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   144. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Gonannies\n   </em>\n   , the Northern District of Texas denied a motion for a preliminary injunction because\n   the plaintiffs \"first learned of the alleged infringing conduct on March 1, 2006, and filed this action on April 7, 2006, they nonetheless did not file the present motion seeking injunctive relief until September 15, 2006, and only after settlement negotiations had soured.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    243\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concluded that \"Plaintiffs' undue delay would be sufficient to rebut any possible presumption of irreparable harm\" and cited several cases in support of its holding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    244\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   145. Conversely, in\n   <em>\n    Daily Instruments Corp. v. Heidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    245\n   </footnotemark>\n   a non-compete case, the Southern District of Texas found that, while the employer did not examine its former employee's laptop \"until nearly four months after [the employee's] resignation\" and was \"therefore slow in coming out of the gate[,] [s]ince then, ... [the employer] [had] shown diligence in prosecuting to enforce [the employment] agreements and to obtain relief from Defendants' complicity with him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    246\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, Defendants had \"resisted expedited discovery needed to prepare for the preliminary injunction hearing\" and, \"on the last business day before [the employer's] motion was to be heard, ... removed the case\" to federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    247\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, \"Defendants persisted in opposing accelerated discovery, which finally required judicial intervention to permit the case to go forward.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    248\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court found that it was the employer that was \"prejudiced by delay, not Defendants who continued to do business as they pleased and who resisted accelerated discovery that would expedite hearing on Plaintiff's motion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    249\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concluded that Plaintiff employer had \"a decent although not an ideal explanation for its delay in seeking a preliminary injunction, but Defendants have suffered no prejudice as a result thereof, and Plaintiff has shown an ongoing immediate threat to continue irreparable injury to Plaintiff if a preliminary injunction is not issued.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    250\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   146. Having carefully considered the law and facts, the Court finds that Western has unreasonably and without justification delayed seeking a preliminary injunction-both in its conduct before filing this\n   suit and its conduct since suit was filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   147. First, Western has unreasonably delayed in its pre-suit actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   148. HPA terminated Western for default on February 25, 2015, and stated that it \"intend[ed] to hold Western and PASI responsible for all costs associated with completion of the work as well as any and all damages HPA might sustain because of PASI's failure to properly perform its work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    251\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, HPA informed Western of the termination and made demand on Western to perform its obligations under the Performance Bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    252\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   149. Yet, it took until October 29, 2015, for Western to finally send a letter to HPA officially denying the performance bond claim for the first time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    253\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   150. While the Court recognizes Western's right to investigate, as PASI notes, this letter came eighty days from the issuance of the RTS Preliminary Report and two hundred, forty-six days after HPA's initial February 25, 2015, demand. Given the findings and recommendations of the RTS Preliminary Report,\n   <footnotemark>\n    254\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the totality of the circumstances,\n   <footnotemark>\n    255\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that Western's delay in denying the performance bond claim was unreasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   151. Moreover, while Western has submitted evidence of conduct occurring between this October 29, 2015, denial, and its first lawsuit against the Indemnitors on September 5, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    256\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that the record demonstrates unreasonable and unexplained gaps in major activity in the chronology. Specifically, Western has failed to point to major activity during the following periods:\n   <footnotemark>\n    257\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   a. PASI's November 18, 2015 Letter to Western\n   <footnotemark>\n    258\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the March 24, 2016, mediation between PASI,\n   PASI's insurer, Western, and HPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    259\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4 months);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   b. The May 27, 2016 HPA Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    260\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Western's December 12, 2016 request for Joinder in the HPA/PASI arbitration\n   <footnotemark>\n    261\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6.5 months); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   c. The January 24, 2017, email from Jim Carver to AAA\n   <footnotemark>\n    262\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the July 18, 2017 settlement offer from Western to HPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    263\n   </footnotemark>\n   (7 months).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   152. Thus, Western not only waited about two years from the October 2015 demand before filing suit, there appears to be roughly eighteen months during that time period in which there was no major activity on these claims. Further, Western has provided little explanation as to what Western was doing during these periods, other than a vague statement by Jortner at the hearing that Western was trying to settle the claims during one of these gaps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   153. Further, these delay periods far exceed the four-month delay found acceptable by\n   <em>\n    Daily Instruments Corp.\n   </em>\n   and are even beyond the periods in\n   <em>\n    Gonannies\n   </em>\n   and its authority which found the delay too excessive to justify the injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   154. Second, Western has delayed the proceedings in this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   155. Western originally filed its first suit on September 5, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    264\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   156. On October 4, 2017, Western sought leave to amend the notice of dismissal filed the preceding day so that it could refile \"after additional research and investigation are complete.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    265\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   157. While the need for further investigation can be a legitimate ground justifying delay, under the circumstances of this case, such a justification was unreasonable. Western made demand on the Indemnitors for the deposit of $2,500,000.00 in collateral on October 1, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    266\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds it unreasonable that Western would need further research and investigation over two years after filing the October 1, 2015, demand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   158. Further, on November 9, 2017, Western filed the instant action against PASI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    267\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western waited nearly a month, until December 7, 2017, to file the instant motion for preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    268\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   159. While Western moved for expedited consideration of its motion on\n   December 7, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    269\n   </footnotemark>\n   it failed to make an adequate showing before Judge Jackson, instead making the conclusory argument that it was entitled to expedited consideration on the same basis as its injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    270\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Jackson rejected the argument,\n   <footnotemark>\n    271\n   </footnotemark>\n   yet Western filed no motion to reconsider and provided no additional evidence or argument to correct the deficiencies found by Judge Jackson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   160. Instead, Western re-urged the same arguments to the undersigned judge at the January 10, 2018, status conference, which undersigned also rejected. Again, no motion to reconsider was filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   161. Even stronger still, on April 4, 2018, Western Surety filed its\n   <em>\n    Unopposed Motion to Continue\n   </em>\n   the preliminary injunction hearing asking for the hearing to be moved and for the Court to push all prehearing deadlines back ninety days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    272\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   162. This case is thus analogous to\n   <em>\n    Gonannies\n   </em>\n   , where the mover sought the injunction \"only after settlement negotiations had soured.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    273\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the Court finds that Western, after having filed the motion (untimely), backed off at the prospect of settlement. This strongly indicates a lack of irreparable injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   163. Further, this case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Daily Instruments Corp.\n   </em>\n   , where (1) the obligors (a) obstructed by a late removal to federal court and (b) \"persisted in opposing accelerated discovery\" to the point of \"requir[ing] judicial intervention to permit the case to go forward\"; and (2) the obligee demonstrated a threat of irreparable harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    274\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the delay was justified in\n   <em>\n    Daily Instruments Corp.\n   </em>\n   , PASI has engaged in no such obstruction, and, again Western has failed to show a substantial threat of irreparable harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   164. Lastly, looking at the Wright and Miller factors articulated above, the Court finds that (1) PASI has been prejudiced by all of the above delays, (2) Western cannot claim to be ignorant of its rights, and (3) Western voluntarily acquiesced in PASI's conduct and showed a serious lack of diligence. The second and third are abundantly clear from the above analysis. As to the first, PASI has submitted evidence from HPA demonstrating that Western's delay substantially increased PASI's exposure for the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    275\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   165. For all these reasons, the Court finds that Western's delay in seeking the preliminary injunction, combined with Western's lack of\n   reasonable explanation and PASI's prejudice, demonstrate that Western has not clearly shown a substantial threat that it will suffer irreparable harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   166. Western has failed to satisfy its burden of making a clear showing that it faces a substantial threat of irreparable injury. Western has not demonstrated that it faces a serious threat of being unable to collect a judgment against PASI. Further, Western has unreasonably and without adequate justification delayed seeking a preliminary injunction, to PASI's detriment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   167.
