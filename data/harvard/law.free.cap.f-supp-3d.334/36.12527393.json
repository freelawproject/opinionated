In particular, Mr. Sweigert, an alleged supporter of Bernie Sanders, claims that Defendants committed fraud and breach of fiduciary duty by, among other things, conducting a website-hacking conspiracy to promote Hillary Clinton's candidacy and to diminish the candidacy of Bernie Sanders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Defendants Haseeb Rana, the DNC, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, Theresa Grafenstine, and Huma Abedin each move to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3), this order applies to all Defendants, not just those who have responded, because no named Defendant bears a causal relation to Mr. Sweigert's alleged injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the 2016 Presidential election's Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton won the party's nomination over Bernie Sanders and other candidates. Mr. Sweigert, an alleged supporter of Bernie Sanders, claims that he contributed $30 to Bernie Sanders's Presidential campaign, donating through ActBlue, a fundraising non-profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 2. Mr. Sweigert alleges that Defendants,\n   all but Theresa Grafenstine (\"Ms. Grafenstine\"), orchestrated a hacking conspiracy designed to tip the Democratic primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, Mr. Sweigert alleges that Defendants, other than Ms. Grafenstine, defrauded donors to the DNC and to Bernie Sanders by \"engineer[ing] a sophisticated email phishing attack\" against Bernie Sanders supporters and \"concoct[ing] a false narrative that the Russian government had been responsible\" for the attack.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35. In particular, Plaintiff claims that Defendants undertook this attack by creating a URL similar to that of ActBlue, a fundraising non-profit, and designed to route funds intended for Bernie Sanders to bank accounts operated by Deborah Wasserman Schultz and/or Imran Awan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Mr. Sweigert theorizes that the DNC, in allegedly propagating a false narrative about the supposed hacking, intended that the statements would induce the DNC donor class to provide contributions, statements upon which DNC donors actually relied, alleges Mr. Sweigert, thus amounting to fraud.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, Mr. Sweigert claims that Defendants breached their alleged fiduciary duty to Mr. Sweigert and to all Democratic donors when certain Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) \"[h]acked key Congressional communications systems such as iConstituent and InterAmerica,\" thus creating a spy ring out of the U.S. House of representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) \"[u]sed an illegal email/dropbox combination in the [U.S.] House of Representatives ... to share information with representative[s] of foreign governments including Pakistan and the UAE for the purpose of economic espionage ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (c) \"[e]ngag[ed] in a pay to play scheme, moving privileged, private communication[s] from iConstituent Congressional servers located in the U.S. House of Representatives and DNC servers ... to Anthony Weiner's laptop ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (d) Handled iPhones and iPads intended only for Congressional use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (e) Conspired to create fake employees under the name \"PeopleSoft\" in the House of Representatives Human Resources system and sent payments from fake employee accounts and from the U.S. Congressional Federal Credit Union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (f) Took electronic devices such as thumb drives, hard drives, and laptops containing trade secrets and traded these devices to \"business entities\" in Pakistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on these allegations, Mr. Sweigert filed suit in this Court claiming that Defendants committed fraud and breached fiduciary duties owed to Plaintiff and to members of the putative classes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants Haseeb Rana, the DNC, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, Theresa Grafenstine, and Huma Abedin move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Defendants' motions are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) allows a defendant to move to\n   dismiss a complaint, or any portion thereof, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

That form of relief is not available -a proposition for which there is much precedent-because, as explained above, Mr. Sweigert's one legally cognizable injury-in-fact bares no connection to the DNC. Plaintiff's request for damages cannot redress his alleged loss because, as explained above, it is not alleged that Defendants caused this loss. Because Plaintiff has advanced only one legally cognizable injury in fact, and that purported injury cannot be plausibly traced to any of Defendants' actions and is therefore not redressable, Plaintiff lacks Article III standing to bring this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3), which provides that \"if the court determines at any time that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, [it] must dismiss the action,\" this order disposes of Plaintiff's Complaint against all Defendants, not merely those that have responded to the Complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). As explained in this section above, none of the Defendants that Plaintiff has named, including those served and those yet to be served, bear any causal connection to the $30 loss that Plaintiff purportedly incurred.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   .
