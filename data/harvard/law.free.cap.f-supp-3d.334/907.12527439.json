In June 2017, Schutt filed suit against Riddell in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of three of its helmet-related patents. Among other allegations, Schutt accused Riddell of manufacturing several helmets that infringed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C499%2C366%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,499,366,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for a \"Helmet with Shell Having Raised Central Channel\" (the '366 patent ). The Texas court granted Riddell's motion to transfer the case to this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Riddell's second amended answer includes a two-count counterclaim. In count 2, Riddell alleges that the '366 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Schutt during its prosecution of claim 14 of the patent. Schutt has moved to dismiss that counterclaim for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To understand the counterclaim, it is necessary to briefly recount the prosecution history of claim 14. Before it issued as claim 14 of the '366 patent, the disputed material was claim 16 of U.S. Patent Application No. 13/469,981 (the '981 application).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the language in the patent is far lengthier and more precise, it is enough to understand at the outset that claim 14 (n\u00e9e 16) describes a football helmet with a \"raised central channel\" on top, among other features. Schutt's first patent application, including this claim, was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) as anticipated by U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0278835 (\"Ide\"). The examiner determined that the Ide specification \"disclosed a football helmet that satisfied every limitation recited in original claim 16, including a top portion having a raised central channel with elongated vented openings on either side.\" Def.'s Br. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss, dkt. no. 71, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   So Schutt tried again. It filed an amendment that modified the claim \"to add a limitation requiring that 'a front portion of the central channel is at the front edge' \" of the football helmet's shell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C499%2C366%2C\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Counterclaim \u00b6 20). That is, the raised central channel would now remain raised all the way to the front of the helmet. Schutt believed that this addition sufficiently distinguished its claim from Ide because Ide's raised central channel tapered so that it\n   was flush with the helmet's shell before reaching the helmet's front edge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The PTO again rejected the application. The examiner concluded that the amended claim was rendered obvious by Ide combined with another patent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,732,424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Monica\"). Monica is another helmet patent, which includes \"a raised central portion [ ] that extends to the front edge of the shell.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the patent examiner's view, a person of ordinary skill in the art \"would have been motivated to combine Ide and Monica to obtain the helmet recited\" in the amended claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Schutt amended its claim once more to include a further limitation. This time, it added that the helmet's \"raised central channel defines a depression in the inner side of the shell with respect to the other portions of the inner side of the shell, the depression in the inner side of the shell within the raised central channel containing shock absorbing material.\" Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. In simpler terms, the raised central channel Schutt claimed now corresponded to a concave area on the inside of the helmet filled with padding. Schutt argued that neither Ide nor Monica taught this limitation. The examiner agreed and issued a notice of allowance for the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Riddell alleges that Schutt overcame this final hurdle by unlawful means. Specifically, it alleges that one of its products, the Riddell Revolution helmet, would have (in combination with Monica) rendered claim 14 obvious if it had been disclosed to the PTO examiner. Like Ide, the Revolution helmet includes a raised central channel. In fact, the two are so alike that, the parties agree, Ide \"generally depict[s]\" the Riddell Revolution helmet. Counterclaim \u00b6 51. But critically, Riddell alleges, the Revolution's raised central channel also \"defines a depression in the inner side of the shell,\" a feature not taught by Ide. Def.'s Br. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss, dkt. no. 71, at 5. Moreover, it alleges that the Revolution \"includes shock absorbing material (padding) that extends across the depression\" and that the padding occupies \"the same\"-or at least very similar-configuration as products that Schutt contends infringe claim 14.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In sum, the Revolution and claim 14 share (1) a raised central channel; (2) a depression defined by the underside of that channel; and (3) padding arranged in relation to the depression. Riddell concedes that the Revolution's padding \"extends across the depression\" and \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contained within the depression,\" whereas claim 14's padding is contained within the depression.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). But several of Riddell's products that it alleges have padding arrangements that are \"the same\" or similar to the Revolution's now stand accused by Schutt of infringing claim 14.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, in Riddell's view, Schutt's allegations indicate that the Revolution would have rendered claim 14 obvious in view of Monica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Riddell accuses four individuals of violating their duties of candor the PTO by failing to bring the Revolution to the patent examiner's attention. Kenneth Nimmons, Larry Maddux, and Ray Drake are named inventors on the '366 patent, and Robert Erb is Schutt's CEO and played an \"active, substantive role in the prosecution\" of claim 14.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C732%2C424\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Take two illustrative paragraphs from the counterclaim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   56. With knowledge of the Riddell Revolution helmet, the examiner would not have allowed claim 16 of the '981 application because,\n   <strong>\n    according to Schutt's infringement positions taken in this litigation\n   </strong>\n   , the Revolution helmet discloses the limitations added by [Schutt's second] amendment ... relating to the depression on the inner side of the shell containing shock absorbing material ....\n   <strong>\n    If Schutt believes that claim 14 of the '366 patent covers the configuration of the padding and depression on the inner side of the accused helmets\n   </strong>\n   , [the four named individuals] had a duty to inform the examiner during prosecution that the same language ... covered the same relative configuration in the prior art Riddell Revolution helmet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   57. With knowledge of the prior art Revolution helmet, the examiner would have rejected claim 16 of the '981 application as obvious over the Revolution helmet and Monica at least because those two pieces of prior art together disclose every limitation of\n   <strong>\n    that claim as now asserted by Schutt\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 56-57 (emphasis added). Riddell's argument boils down to a confused estoppel theory: because Schutt\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   claims an expansive reading of claim 14, its agents had a duty\n   <em>\n    several years ago\n   </em>\n   to disclose all prior art falling within that expansive reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But, beyond asking the Court to ignore the passage of time, Riddell's allegations fundamentally fail to address the most important actor to the \"how\" analysis: the patent examiner. When pleading how omitted prior art is material, a claimant must allege facts that lead to the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    the examiner\n   </em>\n   would have denied the application has she been aware of the omitted prior art reference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715257\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1276/#p1288\">\n    649 F.3d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]rior art is but-for material if\n   <em>\n    the PTO\n   </em>\n   would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art.\" (emphasis added) ). In other words, the examiner's perspective controls. And Schutt's alleged plan to assert an expansive view of claim 14 in later litigation simply is not, without more, probative of whether the examiner would have concluded that the Revolution helmet precluded claim 14 for obviousness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MadGrip Holdings, LLC v.

The allegations thus do not permit a reasonable inference that the Revolution helmet was but-for material to claim 14 from the examiner's perspective. Consistent with this reading, the Court overrules Riddell's argument that it \"is entitled to proceed with discovery\" unless Schutt \"comes forward with indisputable evidence that its thinking on [the scope of the claim] has evolved over time.\" Def.'s Br. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss, dkt. no. 71, at 9.

But this knowledge alone cannot support an allegation of deceptive intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Optium Corp. v.

Indeed, Riddell has failed to allege facts from which a reasonable factfinder could infer either that the named individuals knew the Revolution helmet was material or that they deliberately chose to withhold the information from the PTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Cases finding factual allegations sufficient to infer that a specific individual knew omitted information was material require far more than Riddell has alleged here. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Delano Farms\n   </em>\n   , a case about patents on grape varieties, the counterclaimant alleged that a specific individual who was involved in prosecuting the disputed patent \"had detailed knowledge that the [plaintiff] had gone out of its way to seek out information regarding widespread prior use of the patented varieties, had learned of multiple instances of such use, and had encouraged those in possession of the patented varieties to cease such use.\"\n   <em>\n    Delano Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828203\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1337/#p1350\">\n    655 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, it alleged that this same individual had discussed with others his understanding \"that public uses and sales of new varieties prior to seeking patent protection could jeopardize the Commission's patenting program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828203\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1337/#p1350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, in contrast, Riddell offers no facts from which to reasonably could infer that the named individuals were aware of the Revolution helmet's materiality at the time of claim 14's prosecution. It would be unreasonable, for instance, to infer that they knew it was material from their employer's positions taken in litigation several years after the claim's prosecution. The counterclaim insufficiently pleads the named individuals' knowledge of materiality as required under the controlling specific intent standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, even if knowledge of materiality were no obstacle, Riddell has alleged no facts from which one reasonably could infer that the four named individuals made deliberate decisions to withhold the information from the PTO. Beyond legal conclusions-e.g., that each named individual \"deliberately withheld\" the information- the only facts that Riddell alleges on this point are that each of the four named individuals \"stood to benefit\" from the issuance of the patent. Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 64, 70, 78, 84. But virtually everyone involved in a patent's prosecution stands to benefit in some way from its issuance-the inventor gains a property right, the lawyer improves her reputation and earns repeat clients. By this contention's logic, \"any individual may reasonably be suspected of fraud on behalf of his employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Test Solutions, Inc. v.
