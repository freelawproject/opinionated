Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around 4:30 a.m. on June 16, 2015, Ellison's neighbor, Adrian Wiggins, placed a 911 call requesting emergency medical services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to the 911 call recording, Wiggins had grown increasingly concerned about Ellison's mental condition. She informed 911 dispatch that Ellison was bipolar and having a \"manic breakdown.\"\n   <em>\n    911 Recording\n   </em>\n   [98] at 0:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wiggins requested an ambulance, explaining that she and Ellison's sister, Dawn Revere, had intended to take Ellison to the doctor later that morning when the office was open, but Ellison's mental state was deteriorating. She could wait no longer. In Wiggins's words, \"She's not going to make it until in the morning, she's incoherent ... nothing she's saying is making sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:02-08.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wiggins indicated to the dispatcher that she was concerned that Ellison was \"becoming combative\" and that Ellison needed to go to the hospital \"before this escalates into something, she needs to be medicated before this escalates into something.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:10-20. Ellison admits that she was having a manic episode that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ellison had a history of bipolar disorder, including a notable breakdown in 2004 that resulted in her involuntary commitment and treatment. This most recent incident began several days prior to the night Wiggins called 911. A few days before, she experienced bipolar symptoms following a stressful encounter at the county jail where she was detained while visiting an inmate. This initially caused her sister to become concerned about her mental state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the next few days, Ellison experienced racing thoughts and sleepless nights. Though she tried to control them using meditation and calming techniques, her symptoms worsened. And even though she had medication, her deteriorating condition indicated that either she was not taking it properly or it was not working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The night of the incident, Ellison reached out to her neighbors, visiting them at random intervals into the early hours of the morning. She asked some of her neighbors, including Wiggins, Rex Payne, and Roy Brown, to accompany her in her apartment. This happened through the course of the early morning, increasing Wiggins's concern for Ellison's mental state. Ellison's neighbors helped as best they could but had not seen Ellison break down to this degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officers Hobbs and Condit arrived first on the scene. They met Wiggins outside the apartment building's entrance. She reiterated much of the information about Ellison's condition that she had given to the dispatcher. She mentioned that Ellison was \"slowly spiraling\" downward; \"may or may not be combative\"; and that Ellison needed to go to the hospital. [110-2] \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Paramedic Gasaway and EMT Howard arrived shortly thereafter, and the officers gave them an overview of the situation. The four of them, with Wiggins, proceeded inside Ellison's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hobbs was in front and entered Ellison's apartment first, while the other three stood outside. Ellison greeted Hobbs with an excited hug, told him, \"I'm in charge,\" and said, \"I'm not crazy yet but I know where I'm headed because I broke down in 2004.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Ellison was speaking rapidly and fleeting from subject to subject-while waiving around a grill lighter-with little coherence. During their exchange, Hobbs asked Ellison if she wanted to go to the hospital, and she said yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the interaction with Hobbs unfolded, Gasaway attempted to obtain information about Ellison's medicine. But she grew agitated. She screamed, \"Stop!\" at Gasaway, and told Hobbs, \"I'm going to get combative, that's why you're here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. Intermingled with this Ellison\n   continued reassuring the group that she was in control, but also repeatedly told Hobbs to \"shut up\" as he continued the conversation with her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ellison continued her erratic talking, rambling on about numerous, unrelated topics. Hobbs continued trying to get Ellison to prepare to go to the hospital and to get her medicine, but her interest soured and she ignored his pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At this point, the parties dispute (primarily, the characterization of) what happened next, but the Court does not rely on their characterizations; instead, it relies on the body wearable cameras (\"bodycams\") worn by Hobbs and Condit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ellison had moved out into the hallway and stood talking among the group with unbroken rapidity. Hobbs was standing in the apartment entryway inside the doorframe. Growing agitated, Ellison confronted Hobbs, pointing at him. She then pushed past him while moving towards Payne, who was inside the apartment. As she moved past him, Hobbs grabbed her from over her shoulder and restrained her from behind by her arms. Ellison yelled louder and louder with continued incoherence while resisting Hobbs's grip. Together, the pair waddled into the hallway, all while Hobbs was asking Ellison to calm down and trying to explain to her why the officers were there. Ellison was wearing only a bathrobe at this time. Due to Hobbs's grasp on her arms and the sleeves of her robe, one of her breasts was briefly exposed, but was covered up after a few seconds. Then, Ellison abruptly calmed down, so Hobbs gently released her and continued trying to speak with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The facts continue from here undisputed. After more disconnected discussion with the group, Ellison retreated into her apartment and slammed the door with the officers and EMS outside. Wiggins exited the apartment, leaving the door slightly ajar. Payne followed Wiggins out shortly thereafter, explaining that Ellison was getting upset when he tried to get her to go willingly to the hospital. While in the hallway the group discussed the risks of what would happen if Wiggins was left to care for Ellison by herself, especially if Ellison's condition continued to worsen. They agreed that it was too risky to drive Ellison in a normal passenger vehicle when her behavior was unpredictable and manic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After a few minutes of everyone standing in the hallway, Ellison and Hobbs communicated through the ajar door. Ellison then invited him inside and said they needed to \"learn to trust each other.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobbs bodycam-1\n   </em>\n   [98] at 18:25. Gasaway followed, and after Hobbs explained that he was there to help, she allowed him in. She was still talking disconnectedly-constantly referring to her \"advanced directive\" as both a document and one of the people in the room-but showed Gasaway her medications and around her kitchen while asking Brown if he was packing her bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Around this time, Sergeant Ayers arrived on the scene. Officer Condit met her out front of the apartment and briefed her on the unfolding situation. He informed Sergeant Ayers that Ellison is bipolar, that things were likely \"escalating to a combative state,\"\n   <em>\n    Condit bodycam-1\n   </em>\n   [98] at 20:24-26, and that EMS had prepared soft restraints in anticipation that she should be taken into the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When Sergeant Ayers approached the apartment, Ellison greeted her with a warm welcome. Howard entered the apartment with Condit and Sergeant Ayers and joined the rest of the group. Ellison was still chatting endlessly about disparate topics, and when asked by Officer Hobbs whether she would go to the hospital she said, \"No.\"\n   <em>\n    Ayers bodycam\n   </em>\n   [98] at 2:24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ellison continued, breathlessly active, and began to give passwords for her electronic devices. As she moved around the apartment, talking, and bustling, Ayers asked Gasaway what was going on. He replied, \"We're gonna have to forcibly take her. That's all there is to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:46-48. Howard can be seen at this time preparing the soft restraints while Ellison walked around chatting about a variety of topics upon which she had become affixed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ellison then sat down on the couch. Even though there was little actual conversation taking place, Ellison asked that everyone be quiet so that she could have a moment. Yet she kept talking. She switched topics again, calling herself \"the Queen,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:18, and analogizing herself to a woman in labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ellison then hopped up from the couch as one of the Defendants attempted to collect some of her belongings. She continued talking, let out a \"Damn!\" and stated that she does not cuss unless she is manic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:47. She then admitted without missing a beat, \"I'm a sex addict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:55. She began discussing her boyfriend, at which point Sergeant Ayers attempted to speak with her. Ellison then screamed, \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\" emphatically.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:04. She continued explaining that she is a sex addict and about other intimate matters, then moved on to giving instructions for the care of her dog, Oscar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The disconnected discourse continued while Ellison moved back to the couch. While EMS began preparing the soft restraints, Sergeant Ayers can be heard stating to EMS, \"Do what you got to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:11. Howard and Gasaway approached Ellison and said, \"It's time for us to go\" and reached for her arms (she was holding a pad of paper in one hand).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:16. As they reached for her, Ellison yelled and began flailing against the soft restraints. Ellison continued yelling, \"Stop!\" She yelled for someone to call her dad and then told the EMS, \"I'm calm, I'm calm\" and asked them to \"take my pulse, take my pulse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:27-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ellison became extremely agitated again and continued to yell and scream. She then stated, \"I'm gonna punch somebody in a minute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:45. Ayers replied, \"No you're not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:47. Ellison admitted that she was talking out her present feelings so that they knew how she was feeling inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ellison stated that she understood that she might be under arrest, but the officers reassured her that she was not, that they were there to help and were going to take her to the hospital. She replied, \"Okay. Okay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:59-6:02. She began to calm down, stating that she wanted to be quiet, but then she suddenly resumed yelling and screaming again. During this time Howard and Gasaway were carefully applying the soft restraints while Officer Hobbs held Ellison's knees (she had been flailing and exposing herself from under her robe).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ellison released herself onto her back on the couch, and then Sergeant Ayers said, \"Let's get her out of here ASAP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:47. Gasaway and Howard guided her off the couch and walked her out of the apartment. She was generally compliant, though she still talked loudly and incoherently. She did, however, walk out under her own power. At the doorway there was a scuffle regarding which shoes Ellison wanted to wear, and she eventually found the ones she wanted. She also said that she needed to get dressed. After Gasaway stated that she already had the chance to do so, she instructed one of the neighbors to pack her bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After Ellison was in the hallway of the building, she began yelling and screaming again. Sergeant Ayers noted that Ellison needed to get out of there and to the\n   hospital because Ellison was \"up and down.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:01. Sergeant Ayers remarked that at least part of the reason she was being taken to the hospital was to help get her medicine straightened out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Gasaway and Howard walked Ellison out while she continued, intermittingly yelling and talking, discussing the possibility that she missed her medicine. They walked her outside to the ambulance. Outside, one of Ellison's friends, Ian Johnson, was waiting. Ellison referred to him as \"advanced directive\" and asked him to perform a number of tasks, including getting in the ambulance with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Howard and Gasaway helped Ellison climb into the ambulance. Once she got to the stretcher, she told them that she knew what to do and that she was \"gonna help\" get in because she knows how.\n   <em>\n    Condit bodycam-1\n   </em>\n   [98] at 28:56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ellison's conversation continued breathlessly and with disconnected thoughts. She stated that she needed to take her medicine at 8:00, but Officer Condit informed her that it was only 4:30 in the morning. Ellison replied that it would knock her out, and Officer Condit told her that all would be taken care of when she arrived at the hospital. Howard and Gasaway buckled Ellison into the stretcher and transported her to Piedmont Newnan Hospital. They assessed her vitals prior to transport. Her blood pressure was dangerously high, reading 205/119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Once at the hospital, EMS transferred Ellison's care to the hospital staff. She was seen at the emergency room by Dr. Gottfrid Karlsson. At the hospital, she continued her erratic behavior, including banging on the windows and doors attempting to leave. Dr. Karlsson determined that Ellison needed to be admitted involuntarily and executed a Form 1013 order for psychiatric evaluation. She was then transferred from Piedmont Newnan to Summit Ridge Hospital, from which she was later released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ellison now brings suit against Defendants for alleged violations of federal and state law arising from the June 16 incident. She brings the following claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of the U.S. Constitution: against the NPD Defendants for violating her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure (counts 1 and 5) and her Fourteenth Amendment right to due process (count 2 and 6); against the CCFD Defendants for violations of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures (counts 3 and 7) and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process (count 4 and 8); and against Sergeant Ayers alone for a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by failing to properly supervise Hobbs and Condit (count 9). She also seeks attorneys' fees (count 10) and alleges a number of state law claims (counts 11 through 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The NPD and CCFD Defendants have moved for summary judgment on all counts against them. Ellison cross-moves for partial summary judgment against the CCFD Defendants on counts 3 and 7 and against the NPD Defendants on counts 1 and 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court finds that the record supports the conclusion that, at this level of generality, the CCFD Defendants did indeed act within the scope of their discretionary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As a general matter, it is fairly obvious that the CCFD Defendants' job-related function includes restraining patients and transporting them to the hospital, even when the transport is alleged to be involuntary. Exhibit B to Gasaway's affidavit [100-14] is a copy of the CCFD's Standing Orders and Protocols (\"SOPs\"), which advises that \"all patients seeking 911 services be transported to the hospital for evaluation when medically necessary,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, and outlines the situations when such transport may be refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Under the SOP, \"Any patient ... may refuse transport of self ... if they demonstrate adequate medical decision making capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   An implication of this is that if a patient does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   demonstrate adequate medical decision making capacity, she may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   refuse transport service. And from this, it must be inferred that the medical personnel on scene (including the paramedic and EMT) have the authority to determine whether a patient has this capacity. Similarly, the SOP contemplates a justified use of physical restraints-so-called \"soft restraints\" like the type used here-in certain situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The SOPs govern ambulance personnel pursuant to Georgia statutes and regulations pertaining to ambulances and emergency medical services. Georgia law authorizes the Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") \"to adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for the protection of public health\" with respect to ambulance transport, conditions, and training. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 31-11-5(a). It further provides for ambulance service medical directors, or regional directors, in conformance with DPH regulations, to prescribe protocols for emergency services personnel, particularly those attached to ambulance services like Howard, an EMT, and Gasaway, a paramedic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 31-11-60.1(b), (c).

One of their consistent themes is that while they are guidelines for action, the \"judgment of the provider's [sic] on-scene remain sovereign.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This discretion vested in the on-scene provider is a central consideration in the Court's conclusion that the CCFD Defendants were performing a job-related function. The whole episode required tremendous discretion. The Court's conclusion furthers the purpose of qualified immunity, that is, that public officials performing their official duties in rapidly changing environments facing unascertainable risks are not held to too high a standard in the post-hoc reviews of a federal tribunal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foy v. Holston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347845\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/1528/#p1534\">\n    94 F.3d 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1534 (11th Cir. 1996) (\"When public officials do their jobs, it is a good thing. Qualified immunity is a real-world doctrine designed to allow local officials to act (without always erring on the side of caution) when action is required to discharge the duties of public office. For many public servants, a failure to act can have severe consequences for the citizenry.\" (citation omitted) ). Therefore, the Court concludes that the CCFD Defendants were performing a job-related function when they assessed, restrained, and transported Ellison to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Ellison asserts that the CCFD Defendants have failed to demonstrate that even if they were performing a job-related function, they did not do so through means available to them. She argues that the CCFD Defendants failed to comply with certain established protocols for the transport of mentally ill patients, under both Georgia law and the SOP. She argues that these rules specifically prescribe the means that EMS may use to transport mentally ill patients and that failure to follow these set procedures means that the Defendants were not acting through legitimate means because the procedures set limits on means by which they could perform their job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit rejected a similar contention in\n   <em>\n    C.C. ex rel.

A minor student sued a school principal for constitutional violations arising from alleged sexual harassment by one of her teachers (whom the defendant-principal supervised) based on his failure to intervene, report, or investigate the assault when it came to his attention.

The court held that the defendant-principal was entitled to qualified immunity \"even for ministerial actions,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705169\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/299/937/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705169\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/299/937/\">\n    at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , i.e., where his discretion to act had been curbed by a school policy, and \"even if [the principal] did not do all that was required of him.\" In other words, the federal qualified-immunity analysis does not rise or fall on whether a public official strictly complied with applicable procedures or protocols.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The situation here is similar. Even if the Court were to accept that the CCFD Defendants failed to comply with the SOPs, the Court finds that it was \"within the perimeter\" of their job description to use soft restraints and transport Ellison to the hospital based on their conclusion that she lacked adequate medical decision making capacity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705169\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/299/937/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705169\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/299/937/\">\n    at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted earlier, under the SOP the on-the-ground provider (here, the paramedic and EMT) are given discretion to make decisions about patient care.

However, the procedures for contacting medical control are either permissive or leave room for the provider on the scene to act without medical control, particularly where the on-scene providers have no question about what they need to do. And under these facts, the CCFD Defendants have made it clear that they had no question that they needed to transport Ellison to the hospital due to her condition. In the absence of uncertainty, contacting medical control was not-as Ellison contends-mandatory. Rather, the CCFD Defendants were exercising their sovereign, on-the-ground provider judgment, which is consistent with the standards required by the SOPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Ellison also asks the Court to hold that the CCFD Defendants were acting through unlawful means because they took her to the hospital without complying with Georgia's statutory procedures for involuntary mental examinations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 37-3-40\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Court finds two problems with this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   First, none of the cases Ellison cites is against emergency medical personnel or holds them liable for failure to comply with these provisions of Georgia law. Simply put, the Code requires certain procedures before a person can be transferred to a designated mental health receiving facility for a mental evaluation. These procedures include a physician's certification or a court order before a person may be involuntarily admitted. Georgia courts have required \"strict compliance\" with these procedures.\n   <em>\n    Boatright v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333406\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/327/785/\">\n    327 Ga.App. 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333406\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/327/785/\">\n    761 S.E.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (2014). The Code sections are, however, silent about what role, if any, emergency services plays in this procedural scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Georgia courts' interpretation of these provisions appears to contemplate some reasonable amount of time where a person may be detained against her will\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the initiation of the procedures.

The\n   <em>\n    Burch\n   </em>\n   plaintiff was confined for 152 days in the hospital without a hearing and treated with mind-altering drugs based on a voluntary treatment form he signed but claimed to have lacked adequate capacity to sign given his mental state at the time. Both of these plaintiffs were subject to\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   and/or\n   <em>\n    long-term\n   </em>\n   deprivations of their physical liberty without adequate process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Here, Ellison's asserted due process deprivation took place during the time between being placed in restraints and then taken to the hospital for examination. This was, at most, hours. Upon arrival at the hospital she received the requisite process due under the Georgia statutory scheme\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the doctor examined her, determined that she was in need of involuntary treatment, and executed a form\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   satisfying O.C.G.A. \u00a7 37-3-41. Thus, her deprivation in comparison to that in\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burch\n   </em>\n   is slight. Under the first prong in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , this weighs against a finding that procedural due process was violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   And when considering the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors, the government's interest is hefty when contrasted with the scale of Ellison's alleged deprivation. Both the State's police power and parens patriae interests are implicated. The former because it is necessary\n   for the State to keep citizens safe when a mentally ill person could possibly cause harm-even if unintentional-to others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 744 F.2d at 1458. The latter is implicated because of the State's interest in protecting the person from causing harm to herself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And when, as here, there is an emergency, the State's interest in a quick resolution justifies a temporary detention, so long as adequate post-deprivation remedies are made available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547234\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/797/\">\n    840 F.2d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In limited cases where the countervailing state interests are met, due process permits a period of involuntary commitment prior to a hearing as long as a hearing is held shortly after the initial detention.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   There is a further distinction between Ellison's cited cases and this case. The circumstances under which Ellison was escorted to the hospital do not render it practicable, as contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , for the CCFD Defendants to provide a pre-deprivation hearing-even an extremely informal one. If anything, the minimum process required under the circumstances was the medical providers' determination that she needed to be taken to a hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The situations involving first responders and the mentally ill are random and unpredictable. Examining its prior cases and Supreme Court precedent, the Eleventh Circuit noted that a pre-deprivation hearing is \"practicable when officials have both the ability to predict that a hearing is required\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the duty because of their state-clothed authority to provide a hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547234\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/797/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547234\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/797/\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In emergency situations like this one it is difficult for those public officials responding to 911 emergencies to predict that a hearing is necessary-much less actually provide one at all hours of the day and in the various reaches of their jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Because a pre-deprivation hearing in this instance would be impractical, the Court holds that Ellison was not entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing and that she had an adequate post-deprivation remedy in at least a few different forms. First, upon her arrival at the hospital she received an evaluation by a physician and form notifying her of her right to a habeas corpus proceeding under Georgia law, which also satisfies due process. She could also pursue state-tort-law causes of action against her alleged captors, which would in this instance satisfy due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becker v.

Like in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , the NPD Defendants arrived on scene with information that made it objectively reasonable for them to believe there was a probability that Ellison was a danger to herself or others. This was only confirmed by their personal experience upon meeting her, and the Court's review of the bodycam evidence shows that this continued throughout the officers' interactions with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In short, the bodycams demonstrate that the officers had probable cause and exigent circumstances justifying their warrantless presence in her home. Moreover, the scope of their presence was no broader than the exigencies called for at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"508832\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/1099/#p1102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   While outcomes do not drive its analysis, the Court considers that if the Court held that the Fourth Amendment was violated during this encounter with Ellison, its decision would be tantamount to second-guessing their on-scene decision to render aid. The decision would mean the officers were required to leave Ellison alone in her impaired state. \"It does not meet the needs of law enforcement or the demands of public safety to require officers to walk away from a situation like the one they encountered here.\"\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

The NPD Defendants Used Justifiable Means to Transport Ellison to the Hospital\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   First, the Court begins by reiterating that the NPD Defendants had at least\n   <em>\n    arguable\n   </em>\n   probable cause believe Ellison was a danger to herself or others and needed to be transported to the hospital. But Ellison challenges not the fact of her seizure, but how it was accomplished. She alleges that several of the incidents were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment because they violated her right to bodily privacy by exposing her naked or nearly naked body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has stated that it is clearly established that \"absent a legitimate reason, individuals maintain a right to bodily privacy, in particular the right not to have their genitals exposed to onlookers.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4247934\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/608/730/#p735\">\n    608 F. App'x 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (11th Cir. 2015). Without a legitimate reason, a Fourth Amendment seizure may be unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Whether an exposure is justified depends on the circumstances of the seizure during which the exposure occurs. This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles County v. Rettele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556194\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/609/\">\n    550 U.S. 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556194\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/609/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556194\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/609/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). There, the plaintiffs sued police officers who ordered them to get out of bed-where they were unclothed-during the officers' execution of a valid search warrant. The plaintiffs were in bed when the officers entered their bedroom. They were ordered to get out of bed and were not permitted to clothe until the officers confirmed that there were no\n   weapons on them or in their immediate vicinity (the officers knew that the objects of the warrant might have been armed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Supreme Court held that there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures due to officers' safety concerns and the short duration of the plaintiffs' exposure in light of the need to secure the scene. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Retelle\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment privacy interest is violated only when an exposure is \"longer than necessary to protect [the officers'] safety\" or effectuate some other legitimate purpose. 550 U.S. at 615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556194\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/609/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With this in mind, the Court analyzes each of the alleged infringements of bodily privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court rejects Ellison's argument that the Fourth Amendment was violated when Hobbs grabbed her in the hallway and her breasts were briefly exposed. After Ellison made an unanticipated movement towards him while everyone was gathered outside her apartment, Hobbs restrained her. He held her from behind for a little under a minute. While in his grasp, Ellison resisted, and in so doing her robe became loose, exposing her breast. One of the defendants quickly covered her, resulting in an exposure of no more than a few seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court holds that Hobbs was justified in this brief restraint because he had arguable probable cause to believe that Ellison was a danger to herself or others due to the general circumstances and her un-anticipated movement toward Hobbs that night. Ellison's exposure during this brief tussle was an accidental consequence of Hobbs's justified restraint. The exposure was also quickly remedied. As a result, this incident did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   For similar reasons, the Court holds that Ellison's exposure during the application of soft restraints by the CCFD Defendants and Hobbs was justified. The use and application of restraints, as the Court has held, were justified. The exposure during their application was due largely to Ellison's resistance in their application. Like the hallway incident, this brief restraint was justified as the officers attempted to subdue Ellison for transport to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Finally, Ellison's transport in only her bathrobe was justified. The bodycam evidence demonstrates that Ellison had the opportunity to get dressed on her own, but was in no mental state to execute such a plan. The Defendants were not required to force her to get dressed, nor are they required to wait an indefinite period before effecting her transport. They had probable cause to seize her and take her to the hospital as described above, and even though she was only in a bathrobe, she was largely covered. Thus, her exposure was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    2. No Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Court does not belabor the due process issue here. Its analysis regarding the CCFD Defendants applies equally to the NPD Defendants. No pre-deprivation hearing was required, Georgia provides adequate post-deprivation remedies, and Ellison failed to take advantage of the available post-deprivation remedies. Thus, the Court similarly holds that the NPD Defendants did not violate Ellison's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    3. No Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violation Based on Negligent Supervision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Ellison lastly argues that Sergeant Ayers is liable for her failure to\n   properly supervise her subordinates, Hobbs and Condit, in such a manner that caused her to be deprived of her constitutional rights. \"[S]upervisors are liable under [ section] 1983 'either when the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation or when there is a causal connection between actions of the supervising official and the alleged constitutional violation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Keating v.

And as noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Ellison's motions [89, 130], the CCFD Defendants' motion [96], and the NPD Defendants' motions [95, 122] for leave to file excess pages are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Also pending before the Court are Ellison's motion [133] for discovery and Howard and Gasaway's objections [134] to Ellison's sur-reply brief. The motions and objections are respectively denied and overruled because they are moot, in that they pertained to state law immunity, an issue over which the Court declines to exercise jurisdiction. For the same reason, the remaining counts (counts 11 through 16) in the amended complaint are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Court having disposed of all pending matters before it, the Clerk is directed to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 25th day of September, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Also before the Court are Ellison's motions [89, 130], the CCFD Defendants' motion [96], and the NPD Defendants' motions [95, 122] for leave to file excess pages. These motions are granted for good cause in light of the voluminous allegations and need for robust briefing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    The Court relies both on the parties' agreed-to statements of material facts as well as the NPD Defendants' body-wearable camera (\"bodycam\") footage and 911 recording from the night of the incident. Where the bodycam footage contradicts the parties' version of the facts (particularly Ellison's, who argues the existence of a number of disputes that are demonstrably contradicted by the video footage), the Court relies on the video evidence for its findings of fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Singletary v.

This is especially salient with respect to the Court's resolution of disputes in favor of the bodycam evidence for Ellison's contentions that she did not consent to the Defendants' presence in her home and that the Defendants lacked probable cause to believe she was a danger to herself and/or others.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    Ellison makes much of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 31-11-53(a)(1)'s provision that certified EMTs \"may ... [r]ender first-aid and resuscitation services as taught in the United States Department of Transportation [ (\"USDOT\") ] basic training courses for emergency medical technicians or an equivalent course approved by the department[.]\" Ellison contends that the USDOT guidelines, like the SOPs, limit the means by which the CCFD Defendants may perform their jobs. Therefore, Ellison argues, their failure to comply with them means they acted outside their discretion. The Court rejects this argument for several reasons. First, the language in \u00a7 31-11-53 is permissive, not mandatory-it employs the word \"may\" rather than \"must\" and allows the DPS to promulgate alternative training guidelines. The USDOT guidelines are, if anything, instructive rather than determinative in this inquiry. Moreover, the Court has already shown how the CCFD Defendants complied with an \"equivalent course.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p381\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 31-11-53(a)(1). Finally, as\n    <em>\n     Andrews\n    </em>\n    instructs, failure to comply with governing procedures does not\n    <em>\n     ipso facto\n    </em>\n    mean a public official acted outside his discretionary authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The Court assumes that a seizure occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    There is no serious dispute that Ellison has a liberty interest in being free from an involuntary detention that entitles her to some level of due process protection. This is true even for a detention in an emergency situation, particularly as a prelude to involuntary civil commitment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lynch v.

She argues that Georgia's psychiatric/mental-health privilege under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-12-1 bars their admission. This objection is overruled. This case is premised upon federal-question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1983, meaning that federal law provides the rule of decision.\n    <em>\n     Hancock v.

In fact, the case is even stronger here.

But the Court notes that the same facts and analysis would apply to those Defendants. They were present at the same time performing actions in concert with those of the NPD Defendants and had similar probable cause and exigent circumstances to be present in her apartment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     May\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142473\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1320/#p1327\">\n     846 F.3d at 1329\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    Ellison relies extensively on \"expert\" evidence about, for example, whether the NPD Defendants effected a lawful seizure, whether they complied with Georgia law, and whether their actions were otherwise reasonable.

The Court cannot allow expert evidence, even well-qualified and un-rebutted, to supplant its role as the arbiter of the law in this case.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burkhart v.
