As relevant to the pending motions, the Court denied the MCC's motion for summary judgment in part because the declaration submitted in support of the motion referred to a \"Report of Investigation\" (\"ROI\"), but its letter accompanying the release of records to Lamb made no mention of the ROI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n    at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also declined to grant Lamb leave to add a number of claims to his complaint on grounds of futility but did allow him to add a FOIA and Privacy Act claim against the State Department and to add a due process claim against the MCC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n    at 39-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lamb promptly filed a second amended complaint, which, among other things, added FOIA/Privacy Act claims against the State Department and added three claims against James R. Blades, an MCC official. Dkt. 50. But, a month later, Lamb voluntarily dismissed his due process claims against Blades. Dkt. 53. Moreover, although Lamb did not dismiss his Privacy Act claim against Blades, the Court previously held that Blades is not subject to suit under the Privacy Act.\n   <em>\n    Lamb I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n    228 F.Supp.3d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the only claims that remain are Lamb's FOIA and Privacy Act claims against the MCC and the State Department challenging the adequacy of the searches they conducted and their failure to release all responsive records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The MCC and State Department, having released additional records, now move for summary judgment, Dkt. 63, and Lamb cross-moves for summary judgment, Dkt. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unlike many FOIA/Privacy Act cases, the scope of Lamb's request is narrow-he seeks only the records \"relied upon in\" his background investigation, Dkt. 63 at 5 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 9)-and the agencies have withheld very little. The MCC says that it has released in full all of the records that it has located, and the State Department released thirteen documents in full, released one with only one redaction (a third party's social security number), and referred one document to the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense, in turn, released that document, which is 121-pages long, with redactions (names, signatures, phone numbers and personally identifiable information of third parties and Department of Defense employees) on only two pages. But, notwithstanding the minimal nature of the withholdings, the Court concludes that it needs some additional information before it can reach a final decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, the Information Programs and Services (\"IPS\") office-the State Department office charged with responding to FOIA and Privacy Act requests-screened Lamb's submission. Dkt. 63-3 at 2 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 2). Based on that review, it \"determined that the only [d]epartment component reasonably likely to contain responsive records was the Bureau of Diplomatic Security\" (\"DS\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 10), which, among other things, \"conducts personnel security investigations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Stein Decl. \u00b6 11). The DS records system is \"decentralized,\" and there is \"no single database, application, or file structure that can be searched that would cover all records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Stein Decl. \u00b6 12). Accordingly, the DS FOIA office screens incoming requests and \"determines which DS components are reasonably likely to have responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 13). Here, after reviewing Lamb's request, a \"Senior Reviewer\" determined that the only component likely to have responsive records was the \"Office of Personnel Security and Suitability\" (\"PSS\")-the arm of DS that oversees the \"personnel security program, including background investigations of applicants who have applied for security clearances or positions of public trust\" and, crucially, \"conducts background investigations on behalf of ... the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Stein Decl. \u00b6 13). PSS then conducted a search of its case management system using the names \"Lamb\" and \"Jerry G. Lamb,\" verified any results using Lamb's birthdate, and, using the results, identified and retrieved Lamb's paper Security Background File.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 14). The file contained fifteen responsive records, thirteen of which the State Department released in full, one of which it released with a small redaction, and one of which it forwarded to the Department of Defense for processing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Given the nature of the records at issue, which one would not expect to find scattered throughout the Department, this search was adequate. An \"agency fulfills its obligations under FOIA\" and the Privacy Act \"if it can demonstrate beyond material doubt\" that its search was sufficient.\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n    180 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When narrowing a search to particular components or files, \"an agency must not only 'explain in its [declaration] that no\n   other record system was likely to produce responsive documents'; it must also 'show, with reasonable detail,' that the agency's approach 'was reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.' \"\n   <em>\n    Aguiar v.

The Department did so here. As explained in the Stein declaration, the Department evaluated Lamb's request based on \"the description of the records requested,\" IPS's \"familiarity with the holdings of the Department's records systems,\" and the \"substantive and functional mandates of numerous Department offices and Foreign Service posts and missions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 8). Given Lamb's own characterization of the Department's connection to his records-that is, it assisted in conducting a background check on behalf of another agency, Dkt. 50 at 3 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 10)- the Department has provided the type of \"necessary details ... about the scope or methods of the searches conducted,\"\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife v.

Dkt. 65 at 9. Under both FOIA and the Privacy Act, however, the adequacy of a search is typically measured by \"the appropriateness of the methods used to carry [it] out,\" and not simply by \"the fruits of the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Although an agency's failure to locate a document that the evidence shows likely resided in the agency's files at the time of the search can raise questions about the adequacy of the search, a plaintiff's mere assertion that he believed that the agency would find the missing record, even if based on common sense, is not alone sufficient to \"demonstrate the inadequacy of a search.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. Criminal Div. of U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753132,3560823\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/381/\">\n    475 F.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (D.C. Cir. 2007). That is particularly so when the agency has offered detailed evidence that it searched for the relevant records in all of the locations where they were likely to be found. The Court, accordingly, concludes that the State Department's search was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    MCC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The history of the MCC's search is slightly more complicated. The Court denied the MCC's prior motion for summary judgment based on a \"potential inconsistency\" in the MCC's evidence, which \"at a minimum, warrant[ed] clarification.\"\n   <em>\n    Lamb I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n    228 F.Supp.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Court explained, the MCC previously attested that it located \"five ... documents that were responsive to plaintiff's request, including the\n   <em>\n    Report of Investigation.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Dkt. 17-1 at 2 (Walker-Watkins Decl. \u00b6 5) ). In its response to Lamb's request, moreover, the agency did, indeed, release five documents. The ROI, however, was not one of them. Given this inconsistency, the Court concluded that the \"proper recourse\" was to require a \"more exhaustive account\" of the MCC's search and \"in particular, to require that it provide a further declaration explaining whether the 'Report of Investigation' was produced and, if not, why not.\"\n   <em>\n    Lamb I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269123\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/28/#p36\">\n    228 F.Supp.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The MCC has now done so. Tamiko N. Walker-Watkins, the Assistant General Counsel and the Chief FOIA Officer at the MCC, has filed a supplemental declaration explaining that the agency \"discovered the inadvertent omission of the ROI from the packet\" that was initially delivered to\n   Lamb, and that it subsequently \"attached the ROI to the responsive records and mailed the complete packet to Mr. Lamb.\" Dkt. 63-1 at 4-5 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. \u00b6 14). To be sure, the Walker-Watkins supplemental declaration injects some additional confusion into the case. The declaration describes, for example, five responsive records, including the ROI, without attempting to reconcile this assertion with the MCC's initial release letter to Lamb, which identified five responsive records, not including the ROI.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63-1 at 3 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. \u00b6 10)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17-6 at 1. Ultimately, however, in yet another declaration, the MCC has now clarified that it released the five documents identified in the initial release letter and, subsequently, the ROI-for a total of six documents. Dkt. 67-1 at 1-2 (McCarthy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6). That same declaration also clarifies, moreover, that the \"Finger Print Results\" listed in the initial release letter is the same document as the \"OPM SAC case closing transmittal form,\" identified in the supplemental Walker-Watkins declaration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (McCarthy Decl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Given this history, it is not surprising that Lamb questions the adequacy of the MCC's search for records. The Court is convinced, however, that the MCC has now clarified the confusion. And, with that confusion behind it, the agency's description of its search-including its choice to search the Office of Domestic and International Security, which is the office \"responsible for processing and adjudicating suitability determinations and security clearances for the MCC employees,\" Dkt. 63-1 at 2 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. \u00b6 7)-demonstrates that the search it conducted was \"was reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the same reason he disputes the adequacy of the State Department's search, Lamb also argues that the MCC's search was inadequate. He once again questions why the MCC search did not yield \"records pertaining to his ... fingerprinting,\" and he adds a similar argument with respect to \"his MCC badging.\" Dkt. 72 at 4-5. The answer, however, remains the same. A FOIA/Privacy Act requester's expectation that an adequate search would find a particular record, which was not located, is generally not enough to defeat an agency's motion for summary judgment, at least absent evidence that the record was likely located in the agency's files at the time of the search or other reason to question the adequacy of the search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753132,3560823\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/381/\">\n    475 F.3d at 390-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, as discussed, the MCC attests that it did, in fact, locate and release his \"[f]inger [p]rint [r]esults.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67-1 at 2 (McCarthy Decl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lamb also argues that the MCC's release of only a single page of his determination letter \"suggests ... that only Plaintiff's personnel file was searched as opposed to an electronic search of what is apparently an electronically generated document.\" Dkt. 72 at 8. The supplemental Walter-Watkins declaration, however, says otherwise. Walter-Watkins avers, under the penalty of perjury, that the MCC's Department of International Security \"conducted an electronic ... search\" for responsive records using Lamb's name and social security number, Dkt. 63-1 at 2 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. \u00b6 7), in addition to a \"manual search\" of his personnel security file,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. \u00b6 10). Agency declarations, like this one, submitted in support of the adequacy of a search, must be \"accorded a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by 'purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of\n   other documents.' \"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that the MCC's search for responsive records was sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In the fourteen records the Department released, it withheld only a single piece of information: \"the Social Security number of a third party\" contained on a one-page form entitled \"Authorization to Conduct Criminal History Inquiry for Spouse or Cohabitant.\" Dkt. 63-3 at 10 (Stein Decl. \u00b6 25).

After reviewing that document, the Department of Defense determined that material contained on two pages-pages 114 and 115-required redaction under FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D). Dkt. 63-4 at 2 (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 6-7). The Department also declined to release these materials pursuant to the Privacy Act, concluding that they were compiled \"solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civil employment ...

In support of those withholdings, it offers the declaration of Roxanne Jensen, the Acting Branch Chief of the Information Release Branch of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (\"AFOSI\"). Dkt. 63-4 at 1 (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 1). According to Jensen, her office applied Exemptions 6 and 7(C) \"to protect from disclosure the names, signatures, phone numbers of ...

AFOSI government employees\" and to protect the \"personally identifiable information of third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 12). As she further explains, the Department of Defense was concerned that disclosure of identifying information about Air Force law enforcement personnel and other employees would raise the prospect of \"harassment\" and could interfere \"in the performance of their duties by persons who are currently of interest to law enforcement or [who] oppose the ... AFOSI mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 13). Disclosure of the identities of law enforcement personnel, in particular, would pose a risk of \"harassment and annoyance\" in the conduct of their official responsibilities and \"in their private lives,\" and could make them \"target[s] by\" those \"who may\" hold a \"[ ]grudge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 14). Similarly, according to Jensen, disclosure of the names and other personally identifiable information regarding the third parties \"could expose [them] to identity theft and may reasonably lead to unwanted contact from persons that might\n   seek to harm them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 15). In addition, those individuals have an \"interest in not being associated with law enforcement investigations,\" given \"the stigmatizing connotation carried by the mere mention of individuals in law enforcement files.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Jensen Decl. \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The government once again relies on both Exemption 6 and Exemption 7(C)-but, this time, the Court concludes that Exemption 7(C) provides ample support for withholding the information at issue, and thus does not reach Exemption 6. Exemptions 6 and 7(C) differ in significant respects. Thus, while Exemption 6 is available only if the disclosure \"would constitute a\n   <em>\n    clearly\n   </em>\n   unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) (emphasis added), \"[t]he adverb 'clearly' ... is not used in Exemption 7(C),\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Archives &amp; Records Admin. v.

Because Lamb has not offered any-let alone \"compelling\"-evidence of illegal activity, that categorical rule applies to the name and identifying information of the third party.

Although context matters, a declaration that \"simply asserts that [the] source[ ] received express assurances of confidentiality without providing any basis for the declarant's knowledge of this alleged fact,\" for example, might not suffice.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n    164 F.3d at 34-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the Court simply needs more information to make a determination. As a result, the Court will deny both Defendants' and Lamb's motions for summary judgment on this issue, but it will do so without prejudice to any party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the Court concludes that it also needs additional information to determine whether the Department of Defense-or the State Department-properly invoked Privacy Act Exemption (k)(5). That provision allows \"[t]he head of any agency\" to \"promulgate rules ... to exempt any system of records\" if that \"system of records\" consists of \"investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, ... Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence ....\" 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552a(k)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to this authority, the Department of the Air Force has issued a rule exempting a number of specific systems of records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Privacy Act Program; Implementation; Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Fed.%20Reg.%20954\">\n    69 Fed.

Two omissions, however, prevent the Court from deciding whether Privacy Act Exemption (k)(5), and the implementing regulation, apply here. First, the Jensen declaration does not indicate whether the understanding of confidentiality at issue arose by virtue of an \"express promise,\" as required by the exemption, or by implication. Second, the declaration does not identify the system of records at issue, and thus the Court cannot determine whether that system of records is subject to the implementing regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, the Court once again concludes that it lacks sufficient information to determine whether-or not-the cited exemption is available and, thus, once again, must deny both Defendants' and Lamb's motions for summary judgment without prejudice with respect to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    MCC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That leaves Lamb's claims against the MCC's \"withholdings.\" Lamb argues that, despite the MCC's representations to the contrary, he \"has not received [the] Finger Print results,\" the MCC's \"letter stating the reason for an unfavorable treatment,\" or \"the OPM SAC case closing transmittal form, adjudication grid, adjudication worksheet, [and] all records that supported the adjudication grid and ROI.\" Dkt. 65 at 18. In response, the MCC's declarant, Walker-Watkins, attests that the agency \"attached the ROI to the responsive records and mailed the\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   packet to Mr. Lamb via United States Postal Service (USPS) priority mail\" and that it \"received confirmation from the USPS that the packet was received by Mr. Lamb on March 15, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dkt. 63-1 at 4-5 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. \u00b6 14) (emphasis added). She attaches to her declaration, moreover, a Postal Service receipt, which-although undated-appears to bear Lamb's signature. Dkt. 63-2 at 8 (Walker-Watkins Supp. Decl. Ex. F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The dispute here is not about whether the MCC has lawfully \"withheld\" responsive records-at least as that term is commonly used. Rather, the question is simply whether the records were actually delivered to Lamb.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crooker v.

This issue, however, is easily resolved. Although the evidence supports the MCC's contention that it delivered the records, as required, out of an abundance of caution and to promote judicial economy, the Court will simply direct that the MCC mail Lamb another copy of the responsive records, including the ROI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 63, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part, without prejudice, and Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 65, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.
