Tillerson, Andrew P. Swiger, Jeffrey J. Woodbury, and David S. Rosenthal's Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Complaint (Doc. No. 46) and (2) Defendants ExxonMobil Corporation, Rex W. Tillerson, Andrew P. Swiger, Jeffrey J. Woodbury, and David S. Rosenthal's Motion to Strike the Declaration of Charlotte J. Wright, Ph.D., the Affirmation of John Oleske, and the Allegations of the Consolidated Complaint that Rely on Them (Doc. No. 48). The Court carefully considered the motions, the responses, the replies, the appendices, the relevant record, and the applicable law. Because it is inappropriate to consider expert opinions at the pleading stage of a case and the Court cannot consider conclusory allegations and unwarranted deductions, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part and DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to strike. Lead Plaintiff sufficiently pleaded the alleged material misstatements and loss causation and met the heightened scienter standard, and therefore the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss as to Defendants ExxonMobil Corporation, Rex W. Tillerson, Andrew P. Swiger, and David S. Rosenthal. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss as to the securities fraud Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim for Defendant Jeffrey J. Woodbury but\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss as to the Section 20(a) claim for Defendant Jeffrey J. Woodbury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lead Plaintiff Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters Pension Fund (\"Pension Fund\") filed this securities fraud case on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Defendant ExxonMobil Corporation's (\"ExxonMobil\") publicly traded common stock between March 31, 2014 and January 30, 2017, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Pension Fund bases their securities fraud claims on alleged material misrepresentations or omissions made during the Class Period by Defendants ExxonMobil, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Rex W. Tillerson (\"Tillerson\"), Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer Andrew P. Swiger (\"Swiger\"), Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary Jeffrey J. Woodbury (\"Woodbury\"), and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer David S. Rosenthal (\"Rosenthal\") (collectively \"ExxonMobil\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 31, 2014, the first day of the Class Period, ExxonMobil released its report \"Energy and Carbon-Managing the Risks\" (\"MTR Report\"), which addressed shareholder concerns regarding global energy demand and supply, climate change policy, and carbon asset risk. The MTR Report explained that ExxonMobil considers possible government policy changes on climate-related controls, such as restricting emissions, and the effect of these policy\n   changes on oil and gas exploration, development, production, transportation, and use of carbon-based fuels. The MTR Report stated that ExxonMobil takes these policies into consideration by factoring in a proxy cost of carbon when calculating any investment's or project's projected financial outlook. On March 31, 2014, ExxonMobil also released a report entitled \"Energy and Climate,\" which stated ExxonMobil applied a proxy cost of approximately $60 per ton in 2030 and $80 per ton in 2040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In mid-2014 oil and gas prices began to fall worldwide. Other oil and gas companies were forced to write off or abandon more than $200 billion worth of oil and gas reserves because the cost of production was higher than the profits. ExxonMobil did not write off or abandon assets but instead repeatedly reassured investors that ExxonMobil had superior investment processes and project management that allowed it to continue operating without writing down any assets. Pension Fund alleges these representations were materially misleading because ExxonMobil knew it could not survive the historic drop in oil and gas prices without writing down assets. Pension Fund alleges ExxonMobil made these misrepresentations so as to maintain its AAA credit rating and allow it to move forward without negative implications on its $12 billion public debt offering scheduled for March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2015,\n   <em>\n    The Guardian\n   </em>\n   , a British newspaper, reported that the NYAG's Office was investigating whether ExxonMobil misled the public about the dangers and business risks associated with climate change. Pension Fund alleges that by year-end 2015, ExxonMobil's Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operations were impaired, its Canadian Bitumen Operations no longer qualified as proved reserves, and its Kearl Operation operated at a loss for three months. ExxonMobil did not recognize any of these impairments or losses in its 2015 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), which Pension Fund alleges makes the 2015 Form 10-K materially misleading to investors. ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K was issued on February 22, 2016, a month before ExxonMobil successfully completed the $12 billion debt offering. On April 26, 2016, just over one month after the debt offering, ExxonMobil's credit rating was downgraded from AAA to AA+ credit rating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 28, 2016, ExxonMobil announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2016. ExxonMobil disclosed that nearly 20% of its proved oil and gas reserves might no longer satisfy the SEC's \"proved reserves\" definition. Proved reserves represent the amount of hydrocarbons in a particular reservoir that, with reasonable certainty, are economically feasible to recover at the current price. When an updated calculation demonstrates a reservoir no longer qualifies as proved reserves under the SEC's definition, the company must disclose this revision of the previously estimated proved reserves, a process often referred to as de-booking proved reserves. ExxonMobil stated that if the prices persisted as they had in 2016 for the remainder of the year, certain quantities of oil, such as the Kearl Operations, would not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Pension Fund alleges ExxonMobil's October 2016 disclosure was materially misleading because the de-booking of certain proved reserves was allegedly all but certain at the time of ExxonMobil's news release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 31, 2017, ExxonMobil announced its fourth quarter and full-year financial results for 2016. In the announcement, ExxonMobil stated it would be recording \"an impairment charge of $2 billion\n   largely related to dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountain region.\" (Doc. No. 36. at 9.) On February 22, 2017, ExxonMobil announced it de-booked the entire proved reserve base from the Kearl Operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 11, 2016, Plaintiff Pedro Ramirez Jr. initially filed this class action against ExxonMobil, alleging securities fraud claims under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\"), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). On May 3, 2017, the Court granted Pension Fund's motion for appointment as lead plaintiff. On July 26, 2017, Lead Plaintiff Pension Fund filed its Consolidated Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws (\"Amended Complaint\"). The voluminous Amended Complaint details the alleged material misstatements and alleged fraudulent actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In support of its allegations, Pension Fund attached the Declaration of Charlotte J. Wright, Ph.D., (\"Wright Declaration\") and the Affirmation of John Oleske (\"Oleske Affirmation\") as exhibits to its Amended Complaint. ExxonMobil moves the Court to strike the Wright Declaration and the Oleske Affirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because a number of Pension Fund's material misstatement and scienter allegations rely on information in the Wright Declaration and Oleske Affirmation, the Court will address ExxonMobil's motion to strike before considering its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Wright Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ExxonMobil argues that it is inappropriate to consider the Wright Declaration, which contains the opinions and conclusions of a purported expert, at the motion to dismiss stage because it would overly complicate this early stage with evidentiary issues. Pension Fund responds that the Wright Declaration is attached to the Amended Complaint simply to provide additional support and that the Fifth Circuit does not preclude a plaintiff from attaching expert declarations to its complaint. Alternatively, Pension Fund argues the Wright Declaration should not be struck in its entirety because the declaration includes nonconclusory, factual portions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Charlotte J. Wright (\"Dr. Wright\") is a purported expert in oil and gas accounting with numerous publications on oil and gas industry-related topics. In the Wright Declaration, Dr. Wright sets out her opinion on matters relating to ExxonMobil's operations. Dr. Wright concluded (1) ExxonMobil's Canadian Bitumen Operations operated at a loss for three months; (2) ExxonMobil should have disclosed sooner than it did that the Kearl Operation no longer qualified as proved reserves; (3) ExxonMobil failed to recognize the impairment of Rocky Mountain dry gas operations in 2015; and (4) ExxonMobil failed to incorporate the publicly disclosed proxy cost of carbon used in evaluating investment and business decisions. To reach some of her opinions, Dr. Wright relied on financial information available to the public about ExxonMobil's Canadian Bitumen Operations to extrapolate and calculate the \"break-even\" price of products and then determine that ExxonMobil allegedly violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Dr. Wright opined on what ExxonMobil should have considered a trigger event for conducting impairment tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has held that district courts have the discretion to refuse to consider expert opinions and conclusions reached in affidavits attached to complaints\n   alleging securities fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Financial Acquisition Partners LP v.

Pension Fund argues\n   <em>\n    Barrie v.

The Fifth Circuit has stated that \"\n   <em>\n    Barrie\n   </em>\n   does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   hold, however, that, in securities-fraud actions, district courts must consider experts' affidavits attached to complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81975\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/440/278/#p285\">\n    440 F.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court previously struck portions of an expert's affidavit that posited opinions but considered factual allegations included in the expert's affidavit, which the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fin.

The Wright Declaration includes non-opinion facts as well as calculations and opinions on ExxonMobil's operations' profitability, financial outlook, and impairment of assets. To consider the purported expert opinions set out in the Wright Declaration, the Court would have to consider complex evidentiary issues that are inappropriate at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackwell II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81975\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/440/278/#p285\">\n    440 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   286 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeMarco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087564\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/149/1212/#p1221\">\n    149 F.Supp.2d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Oleske Affirmation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Oleske Affirmation was written by John Oleske (\"Mr. Oleske\"), a Senior Enforcement Counsel to the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, for a case in which the New York Attorney General (\"NYAG\") was investigating ExxonMobil for alleged misrepresentations ExxonMobil made to investors and the public about the impact of climate change on ExxonMobil's business. The Oleske Affirmation states it was written \"in opposition to Exxon Mobil Corporation's\n   (\"Exxon\") motion to quash OAG's investigative subpoenas, and in support of OAG's cross-motion to compel Exxon's compliance with those subpoenas.\" (Doc. No. 36-1, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Both ExxonMobil and Pension Fund acknowledge in their briefs that there is no case law directly on point addressing whether at the motion to dismiss stage a court can properly consider an affirmation written by an attorney involved in a separate case. ExxonMobil moves to strike the Oleske Affirmation because it lacks relevant personal knowledge, which the Fifth Circuit requires in PSLRA cases in which a confidential witness's affidavit supports the complaint. Pension Fund responds the Court can properly consider the affirmation because at the motion to dismiss stage the court should consider any documents attached to the complaint and ExxonMobil has not established that the Oleske Affirmation is \"redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While courts generally consider \"the contents of the pleadings, including attachments thereto,\" there are some considerations courts must take into account.\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236663\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/496/#p498\">\n    224 F.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (5th Cir. 2000). \"[A] plaintiff must plead specific facts, not mere conclusory allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Tuchman v.

Similarly, a court cannot rely on such conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions, or legal conclusions in an affirmation attached to and in support of a complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253033\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/353/#p361\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although there is no case law directly on point, case law addressing confidential witnesses' affidavits attached to complaints is instructive here. In considering a confidential witness's affidavit at the motion to dismiss stage of a securities fraud case, courts are concerned with the reliability of the confidential witness's statements that allege defendants knowingly provided material misrepresentations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ABC Arbitrage Plaintiffs Grp. v.

In\n   <em>\n    ABC Arbitrage\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit adopted a multi-step analysis to determine whether the statements in the confidential witness's affidavit met the pleading standard of stating with particularity the circumstances constituting the fraud or mistake.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9430542\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/336/#p358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 353 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FED.

Mr. Oleske did not work for ExxonMobil, so any personal knowledge he has is knowledge of the investigation into ExxonMobil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Oleske Affirmation draws a number of conclusions based the NYAG's investigation and ExxonMobil documents attached as exhibits. One of the alleged material misrepresentations in this case is that ExxonMobil told the public it applied a proxy cost of carbon of $60 per ton of carbon dioxide to business investments but\n   actually applied a proxy cost of $40 per ton of carbon. Mr. Oleske's conclusion that \"[i]t appears that this discrepancy [in proxy costs] was known at Exxon's highest level\" is not based on personal knowledge but is instead based on an investigation in which Mr. Olekse was trying to prove ExxonMobil made this misrepresentation.

Material Misstatements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the motion to dismiss, ExxonMobil argues the Amended Complaint fails to allege a materially false or misleading statement or an actionable omission. ExxonMobil contends that: (1) the alleged material misrepresentations regarding ExxonMobil's use of different proxy costs fail to state a claim because ExxonMobil has never stated it assigns the same value to proxy costs of carbon and greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") proxy costs; (2) recognizing the impairment of ExxonMobil's Rocky Mountain dry gas assets in 2016 instead of in 2015 is simply a difference of opinion and does not amount to an untrue statement of material fact; (3) ExxonMobil's disclosures regarding its Kearl Operations proved reserves complied with SEC regulations; and (4) ExxonMobil had no duty to disclose its Canadian Bitumen Operations were allegedly operating at a loss for three months. Pension Fund responds that: (1) the Amended Complaint alleges particularized facts that ExxonMobil's publicly disclosed proxy costs differ from internally applied proxy costs; (2) the Amended Complaint alleges particularized facts establishing ExxonMobil's Rocky Mountain dry gas assets were impaired by the end of 2015; (3) based on an analysis of available financial information, ExxonMobil's Canadian Bitumen Operations were operating at a significant\n   loss for at least three months prior to ExxonMobil filing its 2015 From 10-K, violating GAAP and SEC regulations; and (4) the Amended Complaint alleges numerous particularized facts establishing ExxonMobil knew in 2016 that the Kearl Operation's bitumen reserves no longer qualified as proved reserves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A plaintiff bringing securities fraud claims must allege the defendant made a material misstatement of fact or omitted a material fact which made the statement materially misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1).

Pension Fund argues the Amended Complaint alleges sufficient facts showing ExxonMobil used a single proxy cost that differed in value in internal documents than the value disclosed to the public, materially misleading investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges ExxonMobil failed to disclose the actual proxy cost of carbon it used-and at times allegedly failed to use-when calculating capital expenditures and making business and investment decisions. Because ExxonMobil failed to disclose the internally applied proxy cost of carbon, ExxonMobil and the individual defendants allegedly made numerous material misstatements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Amended Complaint contends ExxonMobil stated publicly in its MTR Report and elsewhere that ExxonMobil applied a proxy cost of carbon of $60 per ton of carbon dioxide in 2030 and $80 per ton in 2040 in all business units. This proxy cost of carbon allegedly allows ExxonMobil to consider governmental policies associated with climate change that may result in higher production costs, fees, or restrictions. The Amended Complaint further contends that Defendants Tillerson and Woodbury made materially misleading statements at ExxonMobil's 2016 Annual Shareholders Meeting by stating ExxonMobil uses a proxy cost of carbon to make all of its investment decisions. While ExxonMobil's public statements show the 2030 proxy cost used was $60 per ton, the Amended Complaint alleges internal ExxonMobil documents indicate the actual proxy cost used was a proxy cost of $40 per ton of carbon dioxide in 2030. An April 2010 email with an ExxonMobil Corporate Strategic Planner appears to demonstrate that employees knew the publicly stated $60 proxy cost in 2030 was likely more realistic than the internally applied proxy cost of $40 per ton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Amended Complaint and the attached ExxonMobil documents sufficiently allege ExxonMobil stated a different proxy cost value in public statements than was actually applied in internal calculations. This disparity in proxy cost values sufficiently alleges material misrepresentations arising from statements made referencing these proxy costs. A reasonable investor would likely find it significant that ExxonMobil allegedly applied a lower proxy cost of carbon than it publicly disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ExxonMobil argues Pension Fund is confusing two separate proxy costs-proxy cost of carbon and GHG costs-as the same proxy cost, and therefore Pension Fund failed to allege a material misrepresentation. Whether the two differing proxy cost values represent two different costs or the same cost with different values applied internally than publicly purported to be applied is a factual dispute and cannot be determined at this motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9034958\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/249/#p258\">\n    397 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, ExxonMobil's argument that the GHG proxy cost is separate from the proxy cost of carbon does not persuade the Court that Pension Fund failed to allege material misrepresentation. Because ExxonMobil's public statements allegedly indicate to investors only one proxy cost value was used across all business units in making investment decisions, ExxonMobil's argument is not persuasive as investors may still have been materially misled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, the Court finds Pension Fund sufficiently alleged ExxonMobil made material misstatements regarding ExxonMobil's use of proxy costs in formulating business and investment plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   b) Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges ExxonMobil made a material misrepresentation by failing to recognize an impairment of its Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation in 2015. The Amended Complaint alleges a number of red flags arose in 2015 that indicated ExxonMobil's Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation was impaired, but ExxonMobil did not disclose an asset impairment of its Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation until January 31, 2017, and later confirmed the impairment in ExxonMobil's 2016 Form 10-K released on February 22, 2017. The 2016 Form 10-K filed with the SEC recognized an asset impairment charge of over $2 billion, most of which related to Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   ExxonMobil argues Pension Fund failed to allege misrepresentations regarding ExxonMobil's Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation because the Amended Complaint relies on a difference of opinion between Pension Fund and ExxonMobil as to the value of its assets. ExxonMobil contends asset valuation is merely an opinion, and this cannot be a material misstatement of fact unless the speaker did not believe the opinion he stated and that the opinion was objectively untrue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Indus.

Pension Fund responds that the Amended Complaint sets out impairment-related factors that establish ExxonMobil's Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation was impaired by year-end 2015. Pension Fund further argues the Amended Complaint alleges ExxonMobil's statements that it properly conducted impairment determinations according to GAAP were false because it failed to include its proxy cost of carbon in the impairment analysis. Finally, Pension Fund contends ExxonMobil made objectively false statements by repeatedly asserting it incorporated the proxy cost of carbon into all of ExxonMobil's business and investment decisions but actually failed to include proxy costs in its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   ExxonMobil argues asset valuation and impairment is an opinion, and, therefore, Pension Fund must meet the stringent standard for pleading a material misstatement based on a statement of opinion. When an alleged material misstatement is a statement of opinion, the speaker can be held liable when the speaker did not genuinely hold that opinion and the statement is false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587416\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1318/#p1327\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Amended Complaint alleges the material misstatements included an embedded statement of fact that was objectively false. ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K did not recognize any impairment of the Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation and that ExxonMobil complied with GAAP in making all impairment determinations, meaning it applied a proxy cost of carbon. Pension Fund alleges ExxonMobil failed to incorporate a proxy cost of carbon in its impairment analysis. By allegedly failing to include a proxy cost in its impairment determination, ExxonMobil's purported opinion that Rocky Mountain Dry Gas Operation was not impaired by year-end 2015 necessarily omitted \"particular facts going to the basis for the [defendant's] opinion\" making the opinion materially misleading.\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587416\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1318/#p1327\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   c) Canadian Bitumen Operations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges the Canadian Bitumen Operations operated at a loss for at least three months prior to ExxonMobil filing its 2015 Form 10-K with the SEC. However, the 2015 Form 10-K allegedly implied the Canadian Bitumen Operations were operating at a profit of over $5 per barrel. In its motion to dismiss, ExxonMobil argues the Amended Complaint failed to allege material misrepresentation regarding the Canadian Bitumen Operations because ExxonMobil had no duty to disclose the Canadian Bitumen Operations operated at a loss for three\n   months, operating at a loss did not render ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K misleading, and operating at a loss did not constitute a trend. Pension Fund responds that other circuits have found a duty to disclose in similar instances under Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K and argues operating at a loss for three months rendered the 2015 Form 10-K misleading because it was not readily apparent to investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Based on comparing ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K to ExxonMobil's subsidiary Imperial's required public filings with the Canadian Securities Administrators, Pension Fund alleges the Canadian Bitumen Operations operated at a loss for at least three months. Instead of disclosing in its 2015 Form 10-K that the Canadian Bitumen Operations were allegedly operating at a loss, ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K reported that the Canadian Bitumen Operations had generated an average profit of $5 per barrel. Because the Canadian Bitumen Operations represented approximately 31% of ExxonMobil's total liquids proved reserves and 18% of its combined worldwide proved reserves at year-end 2015, Pension Fund alleges it was materially misleading to imply the Canadian Bitumen Operations made a consistent profit of over $5 per barrel when it had allegedly operated at a loss for three months. Pension Fund contends this statement and the failure to disclose the Canadian Bitumen Operations were operating at a loss materially misled investors and violated GAAP and SEC Regulation S-K Item 303.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K requires a company to include in its SEC filings a discussion of \"any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20229.303\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(ii).

The Fifth Circuit has not addressed whether Item 303 creates an affirmative duty to disclose. Assuming without deciding that SEC Regulation S-K Item 303 creates an affirmative duty to disclose under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, the allegation that the Canadian Bitumen Operations operated at a loss for three months does not establish a trend for purposes of Item 303 disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kapps v.

Thus, Pension Fund failed to plead a material misstatement based on ExxonMobil's alleged failure to comply with Item 303.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   However, the Amended Complaint alleged ExxonMobil's failure to disclose the three-month loss also violated GAAP and was therefore materially misleading. It appears ExxonMobil failed to address this alleged GAAP violation in both its motion to dismiss and its reply, essentially conceding Pension Fund adequately pleaded material misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Pension Fund contends ExxonMobil made material misstatements by failing to inform or sufficiently warn investors of the high likelihood that the Kearl Operations would be de-booked by year-end 2016. ExxonMobil argues it properly warned investors in its 2015 Form 10-K. Even if the statement was materially misleading, ExxonMobil contends the forward-looking statement is protected under the safe harbor and \"bespeaks caution doctrine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges ExxonMobil knew at the time it released its 2015 Form 10-K and throughout 2016 that its Kearl Operations would not satisfy the SEC's definition of proved reserves by year-end 2016. Pension Fund contends ExxonMobil made material misstatements by failing to adequately disclose this knowledge in its 2015 Form 10-K and in its quarterly SEC filings throughout 2016. ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K warns:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   When crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in late 2015 and early 2016 for an extended period of time, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas, such as oil sands operations in Canada and natural gas operations in North America could temporarily not qualify as proved reserves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Complaint alleges ExxonMobil's \"tepid warnings mentioning the possibility of de-bookings\" was insufficient to address the likely de-booking of the Kearl Operations. (Doc. No. 36, at 140). Pension Fund also alleges that statements made throughout 2016 in ExxonMobil's Form 10-Qs filed with the SEC were materially misleading because they failed to inform investors that it was a virtual certainty, according to Pension Fund, that the Kearl Operations would be de-booked at year-end 2016. Pension Fund contends this failure violated GAAP provisions that require an oil and gas company to update proved reserve estimates at the earliest possible time when adverse events cause significant downward estimates in proved reserves. Finally, Pension Fund contends ExxonMobil's October 2016 statement was also materially misleading when it warned investors that approximately 3.6 billion barrels of bitumen in its Kearl Operations would not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016 if oil and gas prices remained low. Pension Fund alleges ExxonMobil knew that only a drastic rise in prices could prevent the Kearl Operations from being de-booked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   ExxonMobil argues its forward-looking statement regarding the likelihood of de-booking certain proved reserves is protected by the PSLRA safe harbor and the \"bespeaks caution\" doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubinstein v.

Considering ExxonMobil's statement in the context of the low bitumen prices and allegations that the Kearl Operations was operating at a loss in late 2015, a reasonable investor would have found it significant that the Kearl Operation, representing a significant portion of ExxonMobil's bitumen reserves, was allegedly very likely to be de-booked by year-end 2016.

Sept. 26, 2006) (Kinkeade, J.) (finding it reasonable to assume defendants had actual knowledge of material misstatements because they regularly received reports showing the statements were false). Thus, this allegation supports finding a strong inference of scienter as to Defendants ExxonMobil, Tillerson, and Swiger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   ii. Motive to Maintain Credit Rating\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Pension Fund pleaded ExxonMobil was particularly motivated to maintain its AAA credit rating in order to allegedly avoid a significantly negative impact that a drop in its credit rating would have on the March 2016 $12 billion public debt offering (\"Debt Offering\"). ExxonMobil argues a company's desire to maintain a good credit rating is universal and cannot support an inference of scienter as to all Defendants. Moreover, the market was already aware of ExxonMobil's weakened credit rating because it was placed on 'CreditWatch' with negative implications by S &amp; P a month before the debt offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   While \"[s]cienter in a particular case may not be footed solely on motives universal to corporate executives,\" the Fifth Circuit has recognized an exception when a company is particularly motivated to maintain or improve its credit rating to receive \"crucial\" funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indiana Elec. Workers' Pension Trust Fund IBEW v. Shaw Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129443\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/527/#p544\">\n    537 F.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 (5th Cir. 2008). Pension Fund alleges that at the time of the Debt Offering ExxonMobil was in dire financial need of an infusion of capital and that the Debt Offering was the \"largest single debt offering in Exxon's history.\" (Doc. No. 36, at 74-75). Just before the Debt Offering, ExxonMobil released its 2015 Form 10-K, allegedly showing it did not have sufficient cash flow to pay the shareholders' dividends. Pension Fund alleges paying the shareholder dividends was extremely important to ExxonMobil, quoting Defendant Tillerson as stating the dividends are \"part of why we are important to long-term shareholders.\" (Doc. No. 36, at 32). The Debt Offering, according to Pension Fund, would allow ExxonMobil to pay these important dividends. Because maintaining the AAA credit rating was uniquely important to ExxonMobil in its Debt Offering and thereby paying the high-priority dividends, Pension Fund has sufficiently alleged ExxonMobil's motive, supporting a strong inference of scienter as to all Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indiana Elec.

Oleske's Opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Pension Fund contends the Oleske Affirmation, attached as an exhibit to the Amended Complaint, supports an inference of scienter because Oleske, an attorney in the NYAG's office, states it is his opinion that the differing public and private proxy costs of carbon were known at the highest levels of ExxonMobil's executives. As discussed in Section I.B., it is inappropriate to consider Oleske's opinion because it is based on his own conclusions drawn from investigating a separate lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253033\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/353/#p361\">\n    365 F.3d at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court does not accept \"conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions, or legal conclusions.\"). Oleske's opinion that ExxonMobil's executives knew about the different\n   internal and public proxy costs cannot support an inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   iv. Individual Defendants Signed SEC Filings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Amended Complaint pleaded Defendants Tillerson, Swiger, and Rosenthal signed ExxonMobil's Form 10-Ks filed with the SEC throughout the Class Period and Defendant Rosenthal signed all but two of ExxonMobil's Form 10-Q quarterly reports filed with the SEC during the Class period. These Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs allegedly contained materially misleading information and violated GAAP based on their use of a lower proxy price than publicly disclosed and their failure to sufficiently warn investors of the high risk of impairment and de-booking of certain proved reserves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Pension Fund contends signing these documents provides further support of a strong inference of scienter for Defendants Tillerson, Swiger, and Rosenthal. ExxonMobil argues Pension Fund failed to establish Defendants Tillerson, Swiger, and Rosenthal had reason to know the financial statements in the Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs contained material misstatements or omissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

However, as discussed above, Defendants Tillerson and Swiger were members of the Management Committee, which allegedly received in-depth briefings and actively discussed business issues relating to climate change including the proxy costs of carbon. The Amended Complaint also alleges Defendant Rosenthal was directly involved in drafting the MTR Report, which Pension Fund alleges fraudulently stated the proxy cost used in making business and investment decisions. Thus, Pension Fund has sufficiently alleged Defendants Tillerson, Swiger, and Rosenthal had reason to know the financial statements in ExxonMobil's Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs were materially misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617702\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/546/#p555\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds Pension Fund pleaded facts supporting a strong inference of scienter by alleging Defendants Tillerson, Swiger, and Rosenthal signed ExxonMobil's Form 10-Ks and by Defendant Rosenthal signing all but two of the Form 10-Qs filed with the SEC during the Class Period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   v. Lack of Insider Trading\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   ExxonMobil also argues that the lack of allegations of insider trading and ExxonMobil's purchase of billions of dollars' worth of its own stock during the Class Period further undermines Pension Fund's scienter allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Izadjoo v.

Tex. 2017) (company's stock repurchase program rebutted scienter). Because the Court must consider all plausible explanations and inferences, the Court properly takes into account that the Amended Complaint does not allege any insider trading occurred. The Amended Complaint actually alleges ExxonMobil repurchased billions of dollars' worth of its stock. While a plaintiff is not required to allege insider trading to plead scienter, the lack of insider trading does weigh against a finding of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    551 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   b) Additional Scienter Allegations as to Individual Defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   i. Tillerson\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Amended Complaint contains numerous allegations to support Pension Fund's contention that Defendant Tillerson,\n   Chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer, had knowledge of ExxonMobil's alleged fraudulent activity. As discussed above, Defendant Tillerson was on the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, both of which allegedly received in-depth briefings on and actively engaged in discussions on ExxonMobil's financial position and risks of climate change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202739352\">\n    2006 WL 2739352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

Attached to the Amended Complaint are internal ExxonMobil emails that indicate ExxonMobil's management knew of the differing proxy costs and that Defendant Tillerson was aware of and \"happy with\" the different proxy costs. The Amended Complaint and attached emails allege particularized facts supporting a strong inference that ExxonMobil, through Defendant Tillerson, knowingly used a lower internal proxy cost than what ExxonMobil told the public and investors it used in making investment and business decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lormand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642025\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/228/#p252\">\n    565 F.3d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding emails attached as exhibits to the complaint provided support for a strong inference of defendants' wrongful state of mind.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Pension Fund further alleges an inference of scienter is supported by the NYAG's discovery that Defendant Tillerson had a second email account, Wayne.Tracker@ExxonMobil.com (\"Wayne Tracker account\"), on which ExxonMobil failed to place a litigation hold allegedly resulting in the loss or destruction of all emails on the Wayne Tracker account from at least 2008 through 2015. Pension Fund contends the Wayne Tracker account was used to discuss risk-management issues related to climate change. ExxonMobil argues the Wayne Tracker account and any failure to preserve its emails do not relate to the claims in this case. Other than the conclusions in the Oleske Affirmation that the Wayne Tracker account was used to discuss issues related to climate change, Pension Fund's allegations have no basis or support. Defendant Tillerson could have had many reasons for using a second email account unrelated to a fraudulent or nefarious purpose and unrelated to the securities fraud claims at issue here. Taking into account the plausible inferences opposing as well as supporting Pension Fund's argument that the Wayne Tracker email account supports an inference of scienter, the Wayne Tracker account and the loss of its emails are not indicative of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lormand,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642025\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/228/#p252\">\n    565 F.3d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Considering all of the above scienter allegations, Pension Fund has alleged a strong inference of scienter as to Defendant Tillerson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   ii. Swiger\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Amended Complaint contains multiple factual allegations upon which Pension Fund based its argument as to Defendant Swiger, the Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer. As discussed above, Defendant Swiger allegedly participated in discussions and received in-depth briefings on ExxonMobil's financial position and risks related to climate change as a member of the Management Committee, which contributes to scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202739352\">\n    2006 WL 2739352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Moreover, Defendant Swiger signed\n   the allegedly materially misleading 2015 Form 10-K, which also contributes to an inference of scienter as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

Woodbury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In its Amended Complaint, Pension Fund pleaded allegations that Defendant Woodbury, Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, demonstrated his knowledge of ExxonMobil's allegedly fraudulent actions in his discussions of relevant matters in analyst meetings and his desire to maintain the AAA credit rating discussed above. Pension Fund references multiple conferences calls, analyst meetings, and shareholder meetings throughout the Class Period in which Defendant Woodbury discussed ExxonMobil's financial standings, possible asset impairments, and the effect of climate change related risks and low oil and gas prices. Pension Fund contends these comments and discussions support an inference of scienter because allegedly ExxonMobil was applying a lower proxy cost and was aware of the high risk of asset impairment at the time Defendant Woodbury made his allegedly misleading statements. However, Pension Fund does not provide factual allegations demonstrating Defendant Woodbury made the misleading statements in the conference calls and meetings with scienter, as opposed to mere negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Owensv.

Pension Fund failed to plead any facts demonstrating Defendant Woodbury's knowledge of ExxonMobil's alleged fraudulent actions.

Rosenthal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Pension Fund contends it alleged sufficient facts to support a strong inference of scienter as to Defendant Rosenthal, ExxonMobil's Vice President Controller and Principal Accounting Officer during the Class Period. Pension Fund alleges Defendant Rosenthal was motivated to maintain ExxonMobil's AAA credit rating and signed the allegedly materially misleading 2015 Form 10-K and all but two of ExxonMobil's Form 10-Qs during the Class period. As discussed above, these allegations support an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129443\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/527/#p544\">\n    537 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   544 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

No. 36-1, at 148). Pension Fund contends \"the folks on the third floor\" are ExxonMobil executives, and ExxonMobil does not dispute this. Pension Fund alleges this email shows Defendant Rosenthal was intimately involved in and had detailed knowledge of the MTR Report. Therefore, Defendant Rosenthal allegedly knew the publicly reported proxy costs of $60 per ton of greenhouse gases by 2030 were misleading because ExxonMobil's internal budgeting applied a proxy costs of $40 per ton by 2030, and knew the effect different proxy costs had on impairment calculations. While ExxonMobil argues there may be a nonculpable reason Defendant Rosenthal asked for the footnote to be removed, the email's wording indicates the executives on the third floor found the impairment footnote to be significant. The email demonstrates Defendant Rosenthal had intimate knowledge of and control over the information going into the MTR Report, supporting a strong inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253033\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/353/#p361\">\n    365 F.3d at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Such specific facts tying a corporate officer to a statement would include ... particular factual allegations explaining the individual's involvement in the formulation of either the entire document, or that specific portion of the document, containing the statement.\") Thus, taking all the allegations regarding Defendant Rosenthal together, Pension Fund pleaded a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In Conclusion, the Amended Complaint sets out numerous particularized facts alleging all Defendants except Defendant Woodbury had actual awareness and knowledge of the alleged fraudulent activity and material misrepresentations. Because these allegations, taken together, support a strong inference of scienter as to each Defendant, Pension Fund sufficiently alleged scienter as to Defendants ExxonMobil, Tillerson, Swiger, and Rosenthal. However, Pension Fund failed to allege sufficient facts showing a strong inference of scienter as to Defendant Woodbury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Loss Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Exxon Mobil argues loss causation was not pleaded because Pension Fund failed to allege any actual corrective disclosures and a resulting drop in stock price. ExxonMobil contends press reports, government investigations, and disappointing financial results do not qualify as corrective disclosures. Pension Fund responds that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleged several partial disclosures resulting in ExxonMobil's stock price dropping, which meets the pleading standards required to overcome a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Pension Fund alleged ExxonMobil's common stock was artificially inflated throughout the Class Period, and the Amended Complaint details six incidents at which time information was released to the public.
