The Court has reviewed the entire file and record. The Court has made a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the issues that the objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation present, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that United States Magistrate Judge Barry S. Seltzer's Report and Recommendation is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTED\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The defining issue in the Report and Recommendation and Plaintiff's principal objection to the Magistrate's Report is whether the EZ-texting program at issue in this case qualifies as an automatic telephone dialing system as defined by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Communications Commission's orders. The Court agrees with the Report and Recommendation that\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p695\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695 (D.C. Cir. 2018) is binding on this Court and that its interpretation of the FCC's orders establishes the standard to determine the issue at hand. Under\n   <em>\n    ACA\n   </em>\n   , the appropriate standard to determine whether the EZ-texting program is an automatic telephone dialing system is whether the program (1) lacks the capacity to randomly or sequentially generate phone numbers, or alternatively, (2) lacks the ability to send messages without human intervention.\n   <em>\n    ACA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p695\">\n    885 F.3d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Swaney v.

Ala. May 22, 2018) (stating that in\n   <em>\n    ACA\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit invalidated portions of the FCC's 2015 order, but reaffirmed the FCC's 2003 determination that the \"defining characteristic of an [automatic telephone dialing system] is the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention\") (quoting 2003 FCC Order at 14092 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this case, it is undisputed that the Defendant's Manager, David Pentecost, signed into the Defendant's system and created a list of customer phone numbers, based on various criteria, such as the date of purchase, amount spent, and the customer's address. He then removed any landline phone numbers, incapable of receiving a text message, and uploaded an Excel spreadsheet onto the EZ-texting website. Pentecost then wrote the message, programmed the date and time of delivery, and the cell phones scheduled to receive the message. He then hit send. This Court agrees with the Report and Recommendation that this amount of human intervention is sufficient to negate the EZ-texting program as an automatic telephone dialing system within the applicable standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's main objection is that even though Pentecost created the list of numbers, drafted the text message, and programmed the timing of delivery, the EZ-texting program had that\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   and therefore, it comes under the purview of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act as an automatic telephone dialing system. Plaintiff asserts that the record evidence establishes the system's capacity, and, at the very least, creates an issue of fact as to whether the program had this capacity to generate numbers and send the messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The declaration of Jagannathan Thinkaran, the CEO of CallFire, the company that owns the EZ-texting program, confirms that the program can only be used to send messages to specific identified numbers that have been inputted into the system by the customer, which in this case Pentecost inputted. Thinkaran adds that the system does not have the ability to send messages automatically or to generate phone numbers. Plaintiff's objections focus on the testimony of its expert Randall Snyder, who testified that the Rand( ) function in Excel could be used to generate numbers, but Snyder also testified that he did not test out this function. (D.E. 100-1 at 10-12). In any event, the\n   <em>\n    ACA\n   </em>\n   decision states that the FCC could not expand the statutory definition of an automatic telephone dialing system to include \"dial[ing] from an externally supplied set of numbers\" such as Excel.\n   <em>\n    ACA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p695\">\n    885 F.3d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to adopt the expansive view of an automatic telephone dialing system espoused in the FCC's\n   2015 order ). The Court finds that Snyder's testimony is insufficient to create an issue of material fact and that Thinkaran's testimony, coupled with the undisputed evidence of Pentecost's actions in this case, establish that the EZ-program texting system is not an automatic telephone dialing system under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. It is also\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   <strong>\n    (D.E. 68, 70)\n   </strong>\n   is DENIED.

According to the Complaint, Hopele sent Ramos two text messages on October 19, 2017, advertising a weekend sale at the Galleria store without obtaining Ramos' prior express consent, in violation of the TCPA. Ramos alleges that Pandora is vicariously liable for the actions of Hopele on the ground that Hopele was acting as Pandora's agent or with apparent agency in sending the marketing texts. Finally, Ramos alleges that Defendants willfully and knowingly violated the TCPA. Ramos has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 70], as have Hopele [DE 62] and Pandora [DE 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ramos argues that the texting platform used by Hopele was, as a matter of law, an ATDS in violation of the TCPA and that Hopele acted as Pandora's agent, thereby\n   subjecting Hopele and Pandora to TCPA liability. Hopele argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the web-based texting platform it used does not meet the statutory definition of an ATDS and, additionally, that Ramos lacks standing under the TCPA because the receipt of a single text message did not cause an injury-in-fact. Finally, Pandora argues that its relationship with Hopele is that of franchisor/franchisee for which no vicarious liability attaches and that the texting platform utilized by Hopele was not an ATDS. Thus, the issues for the Court to determine on summary judgment are: (1) whether the texting platform used by Hopele was, as a matter of law, an ATDS; (2) whether Ramos has standing to bring an action under the TCPA; and (3) whether Hopele acted an agent of Pandora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pandora designs, manufactures, and sells its own brand of jewelry products. Pandora owns and operates approximately 100 locations in the United States and has over 80 franchisees with approximately 300 locations nationwide. Hopele is a franchisee of Pandora that operates a retail establishment selling Pandora jewelry at The Galleria in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 2014, Ramos made a purchase at Pandora Galleria and completed a warranty information card in which she provided her name, address, and cell phone number. The card did not contain a written consent to automated text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The text messages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When Plaintiff - and other customers- provided contact information to Hopele at The Galleria store, Hopele employees logged the customers' information into the point of sale system utilized by Pandora franchisees, known as KWI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hopele also stored contact information obtained from customers through its own store website and from Pandora credit card applications on the KWI system.

In all, Hopele conducted 9 text message campaigns, but Plaintiff's Complaint refers only to the October 19, 2017, campaign, when Ramos received a text notification from Hopele of an upcoming sale at Pandora Galleria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hopele's text campaigns were conducted by using a platform known as EZ-Texting, which is a web-based software application that is owned and controlled by a company known as CallFire.

[DE 63]. To send a text, Pentecost signed into the KWI system using his username and password.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   He then created a list of customer phone numbers based upon various criteria such as the customer's date of purchase, minimum amount spent, and South Florida address. After creating the list of customers to contact, he scrubbed the list of landline phone numbers (using another website known as\n   <em>\n    www.searchbug.com\n   </em>\n   and uploaded an Excel spreadsheet of the selected cell phone numbers into the EZ-Texting website. Pentecost then wrote the text message that he wished to send, selected a date and time in the future to send the text message, and clicked on the \"send\" button to give final confirmation of the message, the date and time of delivery, and the cell phone numbers scheduled to receive the text message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The franchise agreement.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Hopele is a franchisee of Pandora that entered into a franchise agreement to develop and operate a Pandora store at The Galleria Mall in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The agreement specifies that Hopele is an independent contractor and that neither party is the agent, legal representative, partner, subsidiary, joint venture, or employee of the other. Pursuant to the franchise agreement, Pandora authorized Hopele to use the Pandora trade name in advertising and marketing materials. Hopele was required to, and did, hire a manager who devoted full attention to the general management and the day-to-day operations of the store. The store's signage, layout, and fixtures were to be equipped according to Pandora's specifications. Hopele's inventory was prescribed by Pandora, and Pandora retained the right to set the minimum and maximum prices at which Hopele could sell the merchandise. Hopele was required by the franchise agreement to spend a certain percentage of its gross sales on local marketing, and to participate in, and contribute financially to, cooperative regional marketing campaigns. Hopele was required to participate in all promotional and marketing activities designated by Pandora and was required to get pre-approval for other advertising and promotional material that it wished to use.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Swaney v.

In that case, the plaintiff complained about receiving a welcome text message from a retailer after making a purchase at the retailer's store. Like a predictive dialer, the system itself determined when to send the message:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus, it is undisputed that once Defendant's customers provided their contact information to an in-store sales associate and this information is entered into the electronic cash register, their contact information is 'automatically uploaded' into the customer database, 'automatically uploaded' into the Mozeo database, and them Mozeo immediately thereafter automatically sen[ds] a \"welcome\" message to the telephone number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. Again, unlike the system that Hopele utilized in this case, there was no human involvement in inputting cell phone numbers, drafting the message, selecting recipients, choosing a date and time to send the message, or manually hitting a \"send\" button.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Keim v.
