Since then, he has filed a number of lawsuits against individuals involved in his criminal case, alleging that they engaged in various forms of misconduct. In support of this effort, Bernegger submitted a Freedom\n   of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, request to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (\"EOUSA\"), seeking electronic communications to or from three Assistant United States Attorneys (\"AUSAs\") or \"their legal secretaries\" between the dates of March 1, 2007 and August 15, 2016, containing any reference to him, his case, or any of a list of individuals involved in his case. Dkt. 1; Dkt. 11; Dkt. 22-2 at 2-4 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 6). When EOUSA failed to release the records he sought, Bernegger filed this suit to compel it to do so. Although EOUSA eventually released hundreds of responsive records in full or with redactions, Bernegger remains unsatisfied and asks the Court to compel EOUSA to release all of the records he sought in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The case is now before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and Bernegger's motion for discovery. For the reasons explained below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   in part EOUSA's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 22, will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Bernegger's motion for partial summary judgment, Dkt. 29, and will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Bernegger's motion for discovery, Dkt. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Miss. Mar. 9, 2015). After he was convicted, Bernegger filed multiple lawsuits seeking to expose the \"corrupt[ion],\" \"misconduct,\" \"fraud,\" and \"lies\" of nearly 20 people involved in his criminal case, including judges, judicial staff, state officials, and prosecutors.\n   <em>\n    In re Bernegger\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15CV182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208347587\">\n    2015 WL 8347587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-10 (N.D. Miss. Dec. 8, 2018). Bernegger's actions reached the point that, in 2015, a district court in the Northern District of Mississippi determined that it was necessary to \"impose a sanction designed to curb Mr. Bernegger's penchant for abusing judicial process by filing frivolous and malicious pleadings, motions, and communications with the court,\" and thus required that he submit any future cases he wishes to file to the Chief Judge for screening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 13, 2016, Bernegger submitted a FOIA and Privacy Act request to EOUSA, seeking \"all emails and/or other electronic communications of AUSA Robert J. Mims, AUSA Clyde McGee, AUSA David Sanders ... and of their legal secretaries\" that referred to him, his criminal case or case number, or a list of lawyers, court personnel, and others. Dkt. 22-3 at 27-28 (Stone Decl. Ex. B). He specified, moreover, that his request was intended to cover the period from March 1, 2007 through August 15, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (Stone Decl. Ex. B). Bernegger later expanded his request to include emails to or from a probation officer in the Northern District of Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (Stone Decl. Ex. C). On November 1, EOUSA sent Bernegger a letter acknowledging receipt of his request and informing him that his request, like all others, would be processed on a \"first in, first out\" basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (Stone Decl. Ex. D). On March 13, 2017, EOUSA sent Bernegger a second letter-this time informing him that \"[t]he FOIA point of contact for the [U.S. Attorney's Office for the] Northern District of Missouri\" had begun the process of searching for responsive records and \"estimate[d] [that] approximately 1,375 pages of potentially responsive records [had] been located.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (Stone Decl. Ex. E). The letter also asked that Bernegger agree to the estimated duplication fee associated with his request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 (Stone Decl. Ex. E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 29, 2017, Bernegger filed this suit to compel EOUSA to release all records responsive to his request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1. Between August 2017 and December 2017, EOUSA released to Bernegger 72 pages of records in full and 88 pages of records in part, withholding 130 pages of records in full. Dkt. 22-3 at 4 (Stone Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14-15). EOUSA also referred certain records to the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") to review, \"since the records originated with those agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Stone Decl. \u00b6 12). The IRS released all the records that were referred to it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50 (Stone Decl. Ex. J), while the FBI released 8 pages in full, 11 pages in part, and withheld in full 77 pages of records, Dkt. 22-5 at 2-3 (Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8). Bernegger does not challenge the FBI's decision to withhold any of these records in whole or in part, nor does he claim that the IRS has failed to release any responsive records. Dkt. 31 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   EOUSA has now moved for summary judgment, submitting that it has conducted an adequate search and that its withholdings and redactions were justified under FOIA and the Privacy Act. Dkt. 22. EOUSA supports its motion with the declarations of Princina Stone, an Attorney-Advisor with the FOIA staff of EOUSA, Dkt. 22-3 at 1 (Stone Decl. \u00b6 1); Brenda Gill, the FOIA Point of Contact for the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi during the time Bernegger submitted his FOIA request, Dkt. 22-4 at 1 (Gill Decl. \u00b6 1); and David Hardy, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the Records Management Division with the FBI, Dkt. 22-5 at 1 (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bernegger opposes EOUSA's motion on numerous grounds. He challenges the adequacy of EOUSA's search and all of its withholdings and redactions, arguing-among other things-that there is a discrepancy between the number of pages of records that it originally found and the number of pages it has subsequently accounted for; that EOUSA's declarations are not based on personal knowledge and are thus invalid; that it failed to conduct an adequate search and improperly invoked various FOIA exemptions; and that the government's \"bad faith\" precludes EOUSA from withholding any responsive records in whole or in part. Dkt. 31. Moreover, relying on the same arguments, Bernegger argues that he is entitled to the entry of \"partial summary judgment\" in his favor, Dkt. 29, or, in the alternative, to discovery, Dkt. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bernegger's principal contentions fall into four categories: First, he claims that EOUSA's own estimation of the number of pages of potentially responsive records shows that it has failed to release hundreds of pages of records. Second, he argues that neither of the declarations that EOUSA relies upon in its motion were based on personal knowledge, and thus neither can support the entry of summary judgment. Third, he contends that EOUSA's search for responsive records was inadequate in various respects. Fourth, he challenges EOUSA's reliance on the asserted FOIA exemptions and argues that the government's \"bad faith\" vitiates any defense to release of all of the records sought in his FOIA request. The Court will consider each set of arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Missing\" Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bernegger first argues that he is entitled to the release of 540 records that were not released, listed in EOUSA's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, or otherwise identified as exempt from disclosure. Dkt. 31 at 9-12. He apparently derives this number of \"missing\" records by starting with the assertion in EOUSA's March 13, 2017 letter, in which it asserted that the FOIA \"point of contact\" for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Mississippi \"estimate[d]\" that \"approximately 1,375 pages of potentially responsive records [had] been located.\" Dkt. 22-3 at 41 (Stone Decl. Ex. E). Bernegger then subtracted from 1,375 the number of pages of records that EOUSA eventually released, identified in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, or identified as duplicates, and arrived at the conclusion that 540 \"records\" are \"missing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31 at 9-10. The Court is unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To start, EOUSA's March 13, 2017 letter never states that the U.S. Attorney's Office had identified 1,375 responsive records. Rather, it merely \"estimate[d]\" that it had located 1,375 \"pages\"-not records-of \"potentially responsive\"-not responsive-materials. Dkt. 22-3 at 41 (Stone Decl. Ex. E). Brenda Gill, the FOIA contact for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Mississippi, explains in her supplemental declaration that she originally searched for \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   communications\" contained in Bernegger's file and that she based her \"estimate\" of \"potentially responsive\" materials,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Stone\n   Decl. Ex. E), on that overly expansive search. Dkt. 32-2 at 1-2 (Supp. Gill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-5) (emphasis added). The scope of her search, and the number of potentially responsive pages, was narrowed when \"it was [subsequently] determined that [Bernegger's] request\" did not include \"all communications\" in his file.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Supp. Gill Decl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Needless to say, an estimate does not create an entitlement to that number of pages of records. EOUSA was required to release or lawfully withhold only those records within the scope of Bernegger's request. The Court is convinced by the uncontroverted evidence that it did so and that the discrepancy between EOUSA's initial estimation and its ultimate response is not the product of bad faith and is not evidence that any of the requested records are \"missing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Adequacy of Declarations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Bernegger also argues that the declarations that EOUSA relies upon-one from Princina Stone, an Attorney-Advisor in on EOUSA's FOIA/Privacy Act staff, and one from Brenda Gill, the FOIA \"Point of Contact\" for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi-are \"invalid, null, and void\" because they \"fail[ ] the 'personal knowledge' requirement\" of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). Dkt. 31 at 12. As Bernegger correctly observes, Rule 56(c) provides that a declaration \"used to support\" a motion for summary judgment \"must be made on personal knowledge.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). From this noncontroversial premise, however, he incorrectly contends that the Stone and Gill declarations-and the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index that accompanies the Stone declaration-\"must be struck\" because both declarants merely attest that their declarations are \"true and correct\" to \"the best of [their] knowledge and belief,\" Dkt. 31 at 12-15, and because neither declares to \"have personal, or first hand, knowledge\" of all of the relevant information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bernegger misunderstands the personal knowledge requirements for FOIA declarations.

He further argues that EOUSA's motion is based on the \"blatantly false claim\" that \"Mr. Bernegger requested communications about his criminal case that were sent to and from three specific AUSA[ ]s and their legal assistants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (quoting Dkt. 22-1 at 18). This characterization of the scope of his request is incorrect, Bernegger argues, because his request was \"not limit[ed]\" to \"just his 'criminal case,' \" or to only communications between the \"AUSA[s] and their legal assistants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The evidence shows, however, that the U.S. Attorney's Office conducted a search for the records Bernegger sought and did not limit its search to records from \"his 'criminal case.' \" As Gill explains in her declaration, she searched for emails \"sent to or sent from AUSAs Mims, McGee, Sanders or their legal secretaries\" and that, at her request, AUSA Mims and McGee \"searched their computers for electronic communications.\" Dkt. 22-4 at 4-5 (Gill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   More generally, the Court is convinced that the government engaged in a thorough search for responsive records. Although the U.S. Attorney's Office had not retained electronically stored information (\"ESI\") for \"four former employees\" referenced in Bernegger's FOIA/Privacy Act request-one of the named AUSAs and three legal secretaries-it was \"able to obtain ESI ... from four other former legal secretaries,\" and it searched those files for responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (Gill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). In addition, Gill \"made inquiries of all current employees\"-including AUSAs Mims and McGee-\"who [had] access to records\" likely to contain material \"responsive to [Bernegger's] FOIA request,\" and she searched both electronic and \"hard-copy\" files for potentially responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Gill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). Among other things, she searched email records for \"the captioned names or number of plaintiff's criminal case\" and searched those emails for \"any that were sent to or sent from AUSAs Mims, McGee, Sanders, or their legal secretaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Gill Decl. \u00b6 15). In her supplemental declaration, moreover, Gill attests that office personnel working at her direction searched AUSA Mims and AUSA McGee's computers \"using the case numbers listed in\" Bernegger's FOIA request, as well as \"eight multiple variables of [those] numbers,\" and also searched for records containing the name \"Bernegger.\" Dkt. 32-2 at 2-3 (Supp. Gill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). It is also clear from the Gill declaration that the U.S. Attorney's Office did not narrow its search, as Bernegger contends, to emails between the specified AUSAs and their secretaries or to emails pertaining to Bernegger's criminal case. Rather, as requested, the office searched for any emails that referenced Bernegger's name\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the specified criminal case numbers, as well as emails sent to or received by the specified AUSAs and their legal secretaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Bernegger challenges the adequacy of the search on the ground that EOUSA has not \"disclosed\" \"the age of the computers\" that were searched, and it is\n   possible that the computers or hard drives were replaced in the time that passed between 2009 and the relevant searches. Dkt. 31 at 20. That may be true, but it does not call into question the adequacy of the search. Even if computers or hard drives were replaced, there is no reason to believe that the U.S. Attorney's Office kept the old computers or hard drives, and, indeed, Gill attested that she is \"not aware of any other locations ... where any other records that might be responsive to plaintiff's requests are likely to be located.\" Dkt. 22-4 at 6 (Gill Decl. \u00b6 21). Like all FOIA requesters, Bernegger is \"entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\"\n   <em>\n    Yeager v.

Cir. 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that EOUSA has conducted an adequate search for responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Exemptions Applied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   EOUSA declined to release all or portions of certain records pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the most part, Bernegger does not address the application of these exemptions to specific records but, rather, broadly asserts that \"[a]ll of the ... records located must be released in full ... [because] there was gross government misconduct\" in his criminal case. Dkt. 31 at 23. He then goes on for over twenty pages to detail accusations of misconduct that he claims took place during the prosecution of his criminal case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-40, 45-46. Buried in this discourse, however, Bernegger does raise a handful of more targeted contentions.

Second, the declarations on which EOUSA relies are \"null and void.\" Third, email communications are not maintained in \"criminal case files\" and therefore fall outside the exemption. For the reasons explained above, Bernegger's second argument is a nonstarter: the declarations submitted by EOUSA are not defective. Nor was EOUSA required to assert the exemption in its responsive pleading. No such a requirement exists in the FOIA context,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Pub.

Dkt. 31 at 18-19. The Court need not reach that question, however, because an email database, like that at issue here, does not constitute a \"system of records\" and, thus, is not subject to the Privacy Act's disclosure requirement in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    House v.
