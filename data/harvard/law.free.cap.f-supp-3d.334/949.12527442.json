Plaintiffs allege that they were harmed by ingesting paint containing WLC when they were children. Each plaintiff further alleges that he or she is unable to identify the manufacturer of the WLC that harmed him or her; in consequence, plaintiffs' substantive claims rely on Wisconsin's risk contribution theory of liability which relaxes the traditional causation standard and requires a plaintiff to prove only that defendants \"contributed to the risk of injury to the public, and, consequently, ... to the individual plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas ex rel.

In\n   <em>\n    Collins,\n   </em>\n   the seminal Wisconsin risk contribution case, the mother of the plaintiff had been prescribed the drug diethylstilbestrol (\"DES\") during her pregnancy in order to prevent miscarriage. Seventeen\n   years later, the plaintiff was diagnosed with vaginal cancer, thought to be caused by her\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   exposure to DES. The plaintiff filed suit against twelve drug companies that produced or marketed DES, but was \"unable to identify the precise producer or marketer of the DES taken by her mother due to the generic status of some DES, the number of producers or marketers, the lack of pertinent records, and the passage of time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    342 N.W.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Recognizing that the plaintiff could not satisfy the common law requirement that she prove legal causation between the defendant's conduct and her injury in order to recover on her negligence and strict liability claims, the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court crafted a novel method of recovery for the DES case which relaxed the plaintiff's burden of proof in establishing causation.

These fall into three general areas. First is the problem of proof faced by the plaintiff. The court noted that the passage of time, the lack of records and other factors created an \"insurmountable obstacle\" to the plaintiff's identification of the manufacturer of the product that actually caused her injury. Second, the court considered public policy matters, including the number of manufacturers of DES, the number of possible plaintiffs who had been exposed to DES, and the fungibility of DES itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    342 N.W.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    also see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    342 N.W.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is probable, given the sheer number of potential victims, that many more [DES] suits will arise. Thus it is quite clear that in this case we are not dealing with an isolated, unique set of circumstances which will never occur again.\"). These circumstances warranted the court's reliance on a modified version of market share theory to justify the likelihood that under risk contribution theory individual defendants would be held liable for injuries that their products did not actually cause. The nature of the product and the market was such that by producing and marketing DES, each manufacturer contributed to the risk to the public and by extension to the individual plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    342 N.W.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court considered the balance of equities between the plaintiff and defendant. The court noted that because the plaintiff was a child in utero when she was exposed to DES, the plaintiff was entirely innocent, while evidence in the record support a conclusion that defendants had acted culpably by producing and marketing DES without adequately researching the risks associated with DES.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    at 191-192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n    342 N.W.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also considered that the defendants were better positioned to absorb the costs of the injuries caused by DES than were the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674791\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/116/166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of these imbalances, the court found that the equities supported a shifting of the burden of proof to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In crafting risk contribution theory, the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court paid considerable attention to the practical mechanics of litigation, as especially evidenced in the court's discussion and ultimate rejection of the \"market share\" theory of recovery that had been adopted by the California Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sindell\n   </em>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Sindell,\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   \"once a plaintiff joins manufacturers of a substantial share of the DES produced and marketed in the relevant area and proves a prima facie case on every element except identification of the direct tortfeasor, the burden of proof shifts to the defendants to prove that they did not cause the plaintiff's injuries.

Further, the court observed that the \"waste of judicial resources which would be inherent in a \"second mini-trial to determine market share militates against its adoption by this court.\" To avoid these practical impediments, the court elected to permit a plaintiff to bring suit against just a single manufacturer, provided the plaintiff could allege and prove that the defendant produced the type of DES that caused the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   expressly allowed for the recognition of risk contribution theory in factually similar cases, and the\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   court made risk contribution theory available to the WLC plaintiff in that case on the basis of the same general factual considerations as\n   <em>\n    Collins.\n   </em>\n   Reviewing a grant of summary judgment to the defendants and thus reading the facts in the plaintiff's favor, the court determined that, \"due to the number of manufacturers, the loss of records and passage of time,\" the plaintiff could not identify the manufacturer of the WLC that harmed him and thus faced a problem of proof similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n    285 Wis.2d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n    701 N.W.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

From the early 1900s onwards, Sherwin-Williams' product labels listed lead or WLC pigments as an ingredient whenever it was present. In 1940, Sherwin-Williams added a product label warning, stating \"Keep away from fire. Use in a well-ventilated place. Observe cleanliness and sanitary precautions.\" In 1955, Sherwin-Williams and other paint manufacturers began voluntary participation in a national standard to limit the lead content of interior residential paints to 1% or less of the total weight of the contained solids. Also in 1955, Sherwin-Williams and other manufacturers placed a warning on other paints with lead exceeding the 1% by weight restriction. That warning said, in part: \"CONTAINS LEAD OR OTHER COMPOUNDS. HARMFUL IF EATEN. Do not apply on toys, furniture or interior surfaces which may be chewed by children.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Federal, state and local governments have warned of the risks of lead in the home since the 1970s. The plaintiffs' claimed exposure to WLC pigments occurred in 1993 and 2001-02. Parents and caregivers of each plaintiff have acknowledged that they were aware of the risk of lead exposure from paint at or before the time that the plaintiff was exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Internal Sherwin-Williams publications from the early 20\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    century discuss risks associated with the use of lead in paint. An article from the January, 1900 edition of the Sherwin-Williams publication\n    <em>\n     The Chameleon\n    </em>\n    stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    It is also familiarly known that white lead is a deadly cumulative neurotoxin, while zinc is innocuous. It is true, therefore, that any paint is poisonous in proportion to the percentage of lead contained in it. This noxious quality becomes serious in a paint which disintegrates and is blown about by the wind; but if a paint containing lead (such as the better class of combinations) is not subject to chalking, the danger is minimized.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    A July, 1904 article in the Sherwin-Williams publication\n    <em>\n     The SWP\n    </em>\n    described a European conference at which an expert stated that he \"condemn[ed] the addition of white lead to paints and all colors containing it, declaring them to be poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     American Cyanamid\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Cyanamid first manufactured WLC in June, 1971, when it purchased the assets of a WLC manufacturing operation in a transaction involving the MacGregor Lead Company and its parent Armstrong Chemcon, Inc. The only location where MacGregor manufactured WLC was in Chicago, Illinois. As of 1971, one of Cyanamid's business lines involved manufacturing additives used in making plastics and selling those additives to plastics manufacturers. Cyanamid asserts that its primary purpose in purchasing the Chicago lead processing facility was to manufacture lead stabilizers for sale to the plastics industry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Part of Cyanamid's June, 1971, asset transaction included a contract under which it agreed to sell WLC to Armstrong Chemcon, the maker of Scotch Laddie paint. The parties dispute whether Armstrong manufactured other residential paints besides Scotch Laddie. Cyanamid did not sell WLC to general customers. There are no documents evidencing any sales of WLC to Armstrong or its subsidiaries pursuant to the contract. Any sales pursuant to the contract would have happened in Chicago, between June 1971 and December 1972.

MacGregor Lead Company was formed in 1937 in Illinois. It manufactured WLC at a single plant in Chicago from 1938 to 1971, when it sold the plant to Cyanamid. MacGregor manufactured the Scotch Laddie line of paint using its own WLC. The parties dispute whether MacGregor also sold WLC to other manufacturers for use in paint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    MacGregor was a member of the Lead Industries Association. Publications and internal papers of the LIA indicate awareness, dating to at least 1959 and perhaps earlier, of the risk that children might ingest chips or peelings of deteriorated lead paint, leading to cumulative lead poisoning.

To establish the existence of a duty to warn in a negligence context, a plaintiff must show that the manufacturer \"(a) knows or has reason to know that the chattel is likely dangerous for the use for which it is supplied, and (b) has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition.\"\n    <em>\n     Strasser v.

Thus, plaintiffs claim here relies on showing that defendants \"had no reason to believe\" that plaintiffs or their caregivers would realize that the pigment on their walls was dangerous. This they cannot do: as plaintiffs acknowledge, Sherwin Williams and other paint manufacturers had issued product warnings since at least 1955, No. 07-CV-0303, ECF No. 797, \u00b6 10, while federal, state and local governments have warned of risks of lead in the homes since the 1970s,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 31. Defendants therefore had ample reason to believe that persons residing in homes with older paint would be aware of the toxicity of the lead compounds possibly in the paint, and of the various mechanisms by which that lead might be ingested. Deposition testimony of plaintiffs' witnesses supports this point, as parents or caregivers of each plaintiff testified that they knew, before each plaintiff's lead exposure, that children should not eat paint chips because of the risk of lead exposure. I therefore conclude that the defendants did not owe a duty to plaintiffs or their caregivers to warn them directly of the risks associated with WLC in residential paint. Plaintiffs are therefore foreclosed from pursuing negligence claims that rely on a duty to warn theory. Plaintiffs may, however, continue to pursue negligence claims based on the general duty of ordinary care.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    VI.\n    <strong>\n     PLAINTIFFS STRICT LIABILITY FAILURE TO WARN CLAIMS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    To survive Sherwin-Williams' and Armstrong's motions for summary judgment on their strict liability claims, plaintiffs must establish that issues of material fact exist regarding (1) whether each defendant had, at the time of sale, an obligation to warn of the hazards to children arising from ingesting WLC in residential paints, and (2) that the defendants' failure to so warn is a cause of plaintiffs' alleged lead exposure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Existence of Duty to Warn\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Wisconsin Supreme Court invokes the comments to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts to explain the circumstances that give rise to a duty to warn in a strict liability context.

As Sherwin-Williams acknowledges, an internal Sherwin-Williams publication dated January 1900 identified WLC as a \"deadly cumulative poison,\" noting that \"any paint is poisonous in proportion to the percentage of lead contained in it\" and further indicating that this \"noxious quality\" of the lead paint \"becomes serious in a paint which disintegrates and is blown about by the wind.\" Another internal publication dated 1904 notes a European expert's declaration that paints containing lead are \"poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Evidence of Sherwin-Williams knowledge of the danger is not sufficient for plaintiffs to survive summary judgment on the question of duty; plaintiffs must also have adduced evidence sufficient to raise a question of fact as to whether the hazards of WLC in paint were \"dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it.\" The \"ordinary consumer\" in question here must be understood as the ordinary consumer who purchased or used WLC or paint containing WLC during the years that Sherwin-Williams made WLC, i.e., 1910-1947. The parties agree that since Greek and Roman times, it has been common knowledge that lead is toxic if too much is ingested; thus if the only danger of WLC were that it is toxic when consumed directly, the manufacturer would be under no special duty to warn about the toxicity of lead so long as the purchaser knew that the product contained lead. However, the danger known to Sherwin-Williams was more extensive than mere toxicity. For example, Sherwin-Williams knew that the noxious quality of lead paint \"becomes serious in paint which disintegrates and is blown about by the wind.\" Would ordinary consumers purchasing paint containing WLC between 1910 and 1947 have contemplated the possibility that the paint would disintegrate and possibly\n    distribute lead elsewhere in their homes? Sherwin-Williams also knew that lead was a \"cumulative\" toxin. Would ordinary consumers have contemplated the possibility that small amounts of lead ingested over time would yield cumulative injuries?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Though the question is closer, I find that plaintiffs have also adduced evidence sufficient to create a triable question of fact whether ordinary consumers and users of paint during the period that Sherwin-Williams was manufacturing WLC would have contemplated the risk that deteriorating paint would cause children to be exposed to lead. In particular, evidence that during the relevant years lead industry executives affirmatively sought to suppress and rebut news stories and other efforts to inform the product about childhood lead poisoning caused by consumer products supports an inference that the public was not fully informed about lead poisoning and the mechanisms of exposure, and the therefore the extent of the risks known to Sherwin-Williams would not have been contemplated by consumers and users of paint at the time. See No. 07-CV-0303, ECF No. 798-7 at 50-58. Plaintiffs have also adduced evidence that, during the relevant years, Sherwin-Williams and others in the lead industry actively worked to promote a public perception that lead-based paint was safe and hygienic. See\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 29 (Lead Industry Association asserting that its promotional work and advertising \"helps to build up good will for out metal and in the long run will share in dispelling anxiety about its use\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 18 (Sherwin-Williams advertisements between 1922 and 1928 advocating use of lead-based paint on toys and interior surfaces);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 30 (book published by Lead Industry association informing readers that while lead poisoning could occur when lead gained \"entrance into the human system in measurable quantity either through inhalation of vapors and dusts or ingestion of lead compounds introduced into the mouth on the fingers,\" ingestion was \"by far the less important [danger] and is most often associated with children chewing on objects coated with paint containing lead\"; this book was published 5 years after Sherwin-Williams stopped producing WLC, but it is relevant to the state of public understanding of the mechanisms of lead exposure in the years preceding the book's publication.). Again, this evidence could support a factfinder's inference that the dangers known to Sherwin-Williams at the time the pigment left its control were beyond the contemplation of consumers and users of paint containing Sherwin-Williams WLC.

In support of this argument, MacGregor cites entirely to a portion of the expert report of its expert witness, Christine T. Wood, that I have already excluded as unreliable. No. 07-C-0303, ECF No. 1066. On the other hand, admissible documentary evidence and opinion testimony from plaintiffs' expert historian suggests that MacGregor leadership had knowledge at relevant times that WLC was toxic and, if allowed to deteriorate, might be ingested by children. No. 07-CV-0303, ECF No. 1024 at 28, \u00b6 5. On this summary judgment record, I must infer\n    that MacGregor had reason to anticipate the risk to children of WLC in deteriorating paint. I cannot grant summary judgment to Armstrong on these grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Duty to Warn of Component Supplier\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Cyanamid and Armstrong further argue that Wisconsin law does not impose a duty to warn on manufacturers of non-defective component parts. They argue that, to the extent that they supplied WLC to other companies for integration into paint, they are shielded from liability by the \"bulk supplier\" and \"sophisticated user\" doctrines. I have already addressed component supplier liability and the bulk supplier doctrine in an earlier decision on a motion for summary judgment brought by other defendants to this case, ruling that neither theory established that component parts-suppliers of WLC to the paint industry are exempt from the duty to warn as a matter of law. (No. 07-cv-0303, ECF No. 1058; No. 07-cv-0441, ECF No. 985; No. 10-cv-0075, ECF No. 921). However, I now recognize that that ruling was in error, and I will reverse course for the following reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Sellers of bulk materials to manufacturers of finished products often have no mechanism to reach the end user of the product with warnings. Though the Wisconsin Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue, courts in the state have recognized that bulk suppliers' duties to warn are limited by this practical reality. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Nigh v. Dow Chem. Co.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862681\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/634/1513/#p1517\">\n     634 F.Supp. 1513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1517 (W.D. Wis. 1986) (\"A manufacturer who cannot control the content of the warning passed to the ultimate supplier can hardly be guilty of failing to exercise ordinary care with respect to such warnings or of producing warnings that it did not give and could not improve.\"). Similarly, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals has ruled that a component manufacturer has no duty to warn end users when the manufacturer supplies a product to a sophisticated intermediary and the end users are individuals to whom the sophisticated intermediary owes a duty of communication.\n    <em>\n     Haase v.

Under\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff must prove that the WLC was defective (i.e., inadequately warned about) at the time it left the possession or control of the pigment manufacturer (i.e., when it was delivered to the paint manufacturer), and that that defect was a cause of the plaintiffs ultimate injuries. It makes little sense for the WLC manufacturer to owe a duty to warn the\n    <em>\n     consumer\n    </em>\n    at the moment that the pigment is delivered to the\n    <em>\n     paint manufacturer,\n    </em>\n    because the WLC manufacturer has no effective means of communicating that warning. And if the duty could be met by means of a\n    <em>\n     pro forma\n    </em>\n    warning to the already-knowledgeable paint manufacturer, a claim that a WLC manufacturer failed to give such a warning would almost inevitably fail on causation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Furthermore, recognizing that the bulk supplier/sophisticated user doctrines shield the pigment manufacturers from failure-to-warn liability to the extent that they\n    supplied WLC to third-party paint manufacturers does not subvert the Wisconsin Supreme Court's purpose in making WLC manufacturers subject to suit under the risk contribution theory. To the extent that certain WLC manufacturers used some or all of their WLC to manufacture their own paint products, those manufacturers might still be subject to ordinary negligence and to strict liability for failure to adequately warn consumers at the time that they released their paint into the market. To the extent that WLC manufacturers supplied their WLC to third-party paint manufacturers, those WLC manufacturers might still be liable for ordinary negligence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The parties agree that Cyanamid never made paint. No. 07-CV-0303, ECF No. 776, \u00b6 40. They further agree that the only paint manufacturer to which Cyanamid sold WLC was Armstrong/MacGregor which had been manufacturing paint for decades and was a knowledgeable player in the paint industry.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 70-71. I therefore conclude that the bulk supplier and sophisticated user doctrines shield Cyanamid from liability for failure to warn, and that Cyanamid is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' strict liability failure-to-warn claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Factual disputes remain as to whether MacGregor sold WLC to other companies for integration into paint. To the extent that it did so, Armstrong is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs failure-to-warn claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Further, I will partially reverse my earlier decision on Atlantic Richfield's motion (in which Sherwin-Williams joined) for summary judgment based on component suppliers' lack of legal duty to warn. Factual disputes remain regarding whether Atlantic Richfield's alleged predecessors manufactured paint. No. 07-C-0303, ECF No. 851, \u00b6 11. However, to the extent that Atlantic Richfield's alleged predecessors supplied WLC to third party paint manufacturers, Atlantic Richfield is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's failure to warn claims. Similarly, factual issues remain regarding the extent to which Sherwin-Williams supplied WLC to other paint manufacturers. No. 07-C-0303, ECF No. 797, \u00b6 3. To the limited extent to which Sherwin-Williams did so, it is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' failure to warn claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    I note that Cyanamid's briefs raise certain other issues regarding the adequacy of warnings and the \"substantial change\" element of the\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    strict liability claim. Because Cyanamid owed no duty to warn and is therefore not subject to strict liability, I will not address those issues.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Adequacy\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Armstrong argues that plaintiff has failed to prove that the warning labels on MacGregor's paint products containing WLC were \"inadequate,\" so as to render the WLC defective. Both labels contain the language \"HARMFUL IF EATEN\" and direct the user not to use the paint on surfaces that children might chew. Whether this warning adequately conveys the full extent of the risk known to Armstrong at the time that it issued these warnings so as to render the product not unreasonably dangerous is a question for the jury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tanner v.

Defendants\n    argue that, under Wisconsin products liability law, \"[a] plaintiff who has established both a duty and a failure to warn must also establish causation by showing that, if properly warned, he or she would have altered behavior and avoided injury.\" No 07-CV-0303, ECF No. 572 at 7, citing\n    <em>\n     Lemmermann\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026335\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/713/791/#p811\">\n     713 F.Supp.2d at 811\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Defendants therefore asserts that it is plaintiffs burden to show that, had Sherwin-Williams or MacGregor product labels warned of the alleged risks to children of ingesting WLC during the time that each company manufactured WLC, such a warning would have changed someone's conduct and prevented each plaintiff's lead exposure and alleged harm. Defendants also argues that plaintiffs cannot meet their burden of proof with respect to causation on the warnings claim because they have not provided expert testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    I begin my discussion of this point by clarifying the precise nature of the causal relationship that must be established between a WLC defendant's failure to warn and a plaintiff's subsequent injury in order to meet the standard for strict liability under\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    . The defendants want the standard to be a direct line between the individual defendant's conduct and the individual plaintiff's harm. However, that interpretation is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of risk contribution theory to enable a plaintiff to recover without identifying the specific manufacturer of the product that caused his or her harm. And, indeed, the\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    strict liability formulation requires no such individualized chain of causation. Rather, as relevant here,\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    requires the plaintiff to prove \"that the white lead carbonate was defective when it left the possession or control of the pigment manufacturers,\" and \"that the defect was a cause of the plaintiff's injuries or damages.\"\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     285 Wis.2d 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 162,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The outcome of the \"defect\" analysis is properly a conclusion about the condition of the product and not the conduct of the manufacturer; if a plaintiff prevails on the \"defect\" element on a failure to warn theory, then \"inadequately-warned-aboutness\" becomes, in a sense, a property of the product itself. The causation element of\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    then requires the plaintiff to show a causal connection between that defect (i.e., that property of the product) and the plaintiff's eventual harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    court's discussion of the concept of fungibility is salient here.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     285 Wis.2d 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 141-148,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As the court explained,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    \"Fungibility ... is not a term that is capable of being defined with categorical precision. Its character will depend on the context of the injury, its cause, and the particular obstacles encountered in linking the causation to the possibly negligent defendants. See\n    <em>\n     Hamilton\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     v. Accu-Tek\n    </em>\n    ], 32 F.Supp.2d [47] at 51 [ (E.D.N.Y. 1998) ] (\"It is the characteristic relevant to the matter at issue that determines whether a product is the same as and substitutable for another, and therefore whether the two are interchangeable...\").\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     285 Wis.2d 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 145,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court then discussed three overlapping meanings of fungibility as functional interchangeableness, physical indistinguishableness, and uniformity of risk. A product is fungible in the sense of uniformity of risk when \"as a result of sharing an identical or virtually identical chemical formula, each manufacturer's product pose[s] the same amount of risk as every other manufacturer's product,\" such that the products are \"identically defective, with none being more or less defective than the rest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 144,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Applying this analysis to WLC, the court concluded that on the summary judgment record in that case, all WLCs were identically defective because all contained lead.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 148,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This finding partially justified the court's relieving the plaintiff of the requirement to identify the individual manufacturer that caused harm. Failure to warn effectively adds another layer to the uniformity of risk presented by WLC. Inadequacy of warning constitutes a product defect over and above the presence of lead, and all manufacturers that supplied WLC for use in paint without adequate warning placed an identically defective product on the market. This reading is bolstered by the\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    court's use of the plural \"pigment manufacturers\" in the first element of the strict liability framework: \"... the white lead carbonate was defective when it left the control of the pigment manufacturers.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 162,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This choice, which contrasts with the use of the singular \"manufacturer\" in other elements of the claim, reflects the court's understanding that multiple manufacturers might have caused the identical defect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Therefore, to satisfy the causation element of the\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    strict liability framework on a failure-to-warn theory of defect, a plaintiff must prove to the satisfaction of the trier of fact that the presence of inadequately-warned-about WLC on the market during the existence of the residence where the plaintiff ingested WLC was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injury. Human behavior is implicated in the question of causation, in addition to the medical\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    and mechanical\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    issues already built into the risk contribution model of proof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    To prove such a tenuous connection to the satisfaction of a jury will be a tall order, but at this juncture I believe it is reasonable to permit plaintiffs to proceed on their failure to warn claims. Although plaintiffs still bear the ultimate burden of showing causation, a jury might find in their favor by making the permissible inference, e.g., that the persons responsible for selecting and applying paint in the plaintiffs' homes throughout the buildings' existence would have heeded warnings regarding the risk of childhood lead exposure if such warnings had been issued.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Michael's v.

Defendants' citations to\n    <em>\n     Lemmermann\n    </em>\n    to disallow such an inference is unpersuasive, as the plaintiff in that case had failed to adduce evidence that her exposure to the product in question was a cause of her injuries in a medical sense.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026335\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/713/791/#p811\">\n     713 F.Supp.2d 791\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 812 (2010).

Experts on behalf of the Plaintiffs and defendant DuPont\n    had previously conducted analyses identifying the elemental composition of each discernable layer of paint in the chips. Cyanamid and Armstrong's expert then calculated elemental ratios for the components of the actual paint in each layer, and compared that data to a formula for Scotch Laddie paint that had been published in Scotch Laddie advertisements in 1964 and 1971, and to a 1942 formula for Elliots paint.

Because these factual issues remain, I will not grant summary judgment to either Cyanamid or Armstrong on the chemical analysis defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    VIII.\n    <strong>\n     GEOGRAPHIC MARKET DEFENSE\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Cyanamid also requests summary judgment on the basis of the \"geographic market\" exculpatory defense framed in\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    : once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case under the risk contribution doctrine, the \"burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it did not produce or market white lead carbonate either during the relevant time period or in the geographic market where the house is located.\"\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     285 Wis.2d 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at \u00b6 163,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8982684\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/285/236/\">\n     701 N.W.2d 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Essentially, this defense gives the defendant an opportunity to disprove causation: if the defendant did not produce or market WLC in the geographic area where the plaintiff ultimately ingested lead, then the defendant could not have reasonably contributed to the plaintiff's alleged injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Certain of Cyanamid's arguments on the geographic market exculpation defense resemble the \"purposeful availment\" arguments that arise in the context of personal jurisdiction. Cyanamid insists that its \"only conduct regarding white lead carbonate occurred in Chicago and it did not purposefully direct any production or sales of that product to Wisconsin.\" (No. 07-cv-0303, ECF No. 554 at 29). This approach misses the mark: while many of the facts relevant to personal jurisdiction will also be relevant to the geographic market defense, the focus here is not on the intentional conduct of the defendant with respect to the geographic region but on the possibility of an actual causal relationship between the defendant's product and the plaintiff's harm.

Cyanamid states that it only sold WLC to the manufacturer of Scotch Laddie paint in Chicago, and that it does not know where the Scotch Laddie paint was subsequently sold.
