GERACI, JR., Chief Judge\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff brings this putative class action alleging that Defendant McCormick &amp; Company, Inc. deceptively marketed certain products as \"natural.\" The Complaint (ECF No. 1) asserts claims for unjust enrichment under New York Common Law and Maryland Common Law, violations of Maryland Commercial Code \u00a7 13-301 (\"MCC\"), and New York General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350 (\"GBL\"). Plaintiff seeks to represent a nationwide class of all United States residents or, alternatively, a statewide class of all New York residents who purchased certain McCormick products, for personal use and not resale, since October 27, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's claims or, in the alternative, to stay the action pending the Food and Drug Administration's (\"FDA\") rulemaking concerning the use of the term \"natural\" on food labeling and the United States Department of Agriculture's (\"USDA\") rulemaking concerning labeling of bioengineered foods. ECF No. 8. For the reasons stated below, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Defendant's Motion to Stay is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is a Maryland-based corporation that manufactures, markets, advertises, and sells various spice and seasoning products with the word \"natural\" on their front packaging. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 37. Plaintiff's Complaint lists 29 specific spice and seasoning products, which Plaintiff alleges were deceptively labeled as \"natural.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1 at 2-3. The Products' labels are attached to Plaintiff's Complaint as \"Exhibit A\" and show that 19 of the 29 Products are labeled \"with natural spices,\" 5 are labeled as \"natural,\" and 5 are labeled as \"all natural.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 32-42. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's use of the \"natural\" descriptor is an effort to increase sales and \"take advantage of\" the rapidly growing natural foods market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that, rather than being \"natural,\" the Products \"contain[ ] unnatural, synthetic, artificial, and/or genetically modified ingredients, including but not limited to, corn starch, white corn flour, and citric acid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Plaintiff alleges that these ingredients render the \"natural\" label \"untrue, misleading and likely to deceive reasonable consumers\" because \"the ingredients are, in fact, highly-processed, synthetic, and/or genetically modified.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 46. According to Plaintiff, \"[g]enetically modified crops do not occur in nature, and as such are not 'Natural.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. \"Monsanto, one of the largest producers of genetically modified crop seed ... defines Genetically Modified Organisms ('GMO') as 'any organism the genetics of which have been altered through the use of modern biotechnology to create a novel combination of genetic material.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the World Health Organization defines GMOs as \"organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur\n   naturally.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Plaintiff alleges that \"almost all corn in the United States is grown from seeds that have been genetically modified, and as such, almost all corn and corn-based ingredients in the United States are in fact unnatural.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that white corn flour and corn starch are derived from GMOs and genetically engineered seeds. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that citric acid is made through a synthetic process that \"utilizes GE sugar beets and GE maize.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she and the putative class members relied on Defendant's labeling misrepresentations, which were made \"[t]hrough a variety of advertising, including the front packaging of the Products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. The gravamen of the Complaint is that Plaintiff and the putative class members \"paid a price premium over and above the value of Defendant's products that did not claim to be 'Natural,' \" and were \"deprived the benefit of the bargain because the Products they purchased had less value than what was represented by Defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 67. Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and the putative class, requests various monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
