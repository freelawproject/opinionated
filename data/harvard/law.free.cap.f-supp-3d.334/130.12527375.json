On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings on two issues: (1) the DEA's denial of Aguiar's request for the GPS mapping software that was used to track his movements; and (2) the adequacy of the DEA's search for four administrative subpoenas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguiar v.

The Court denies the DEA's motion as to the adequacy of its search for administrative subpoenas and orders the DEA to pursue the possibility that the agent who signed the subpoenas has information regarding their current whereabouts.

He is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731730\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/251/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Between June 2013 and July 2014, Aguiar submitted multiple FOIA requests seeking information relating to the DEA's investigation of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Request for Administrative Subpoenas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Aguiar submitted his first FOIA request on June 6, 2013, seeking all DEA reports \"regarding any investigation and all surveillance performed or conducted from March 1, 2009 through July 30, 2009\" and all \"reports memorialized by the Drug Enforcement Administration Asset Forfeiture Department.\" (Decl. of Katherine L. Myrick, Apr. 7, 2015, ECF No. 30-3 (\"1st Myrick Decl.\"), Ex. A.) After some back-and-forth with the agency relating to the breadth of this initial request, in a letter dated August 1, 2013, Aguiar added a request for \"any administrative subpoena form issued by any DEA Agent operating out of the Burlington, Vermont Regional Office between the dates of: December 19, 2008 and October 19, 2009 pertaining to [Aguiar's criminal case].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The DEA searched its Investigative Reporting and Filing System (\"IRFS\"). This system \"contains\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.\" (1st Myrick Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) The DEA then searched another index to identify four \"investigative case files that mentioned plaintiff,\" two of which were relevant to the date range in Aguiar's FOIA requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) The DEA's Burlington Resident Office (\"Burlington Office\") was then \"tasked with conducting a search\" of those two files to identify \"all investigative reports, administrative subpoenas, asset forfeiture and seizure records, and GPS data and images.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) The Burlington Office staff identified 338 pages of responsive materials, none of which included the four requested administrative subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 58.) Among the documents identified were several administrative subpoenas, with dates ranging from January 9, 2009 to March 1, 2011, but the four administrative subpoenas Aguiar requested in his August 1 request were not located in the search. (\n   <em>\n    See Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, ECF Nos. 30-5, 30-6, 30-7, at 151-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a September 10, 2013 letter, the DEA notified Aguiar that in response to his June and July requests (its response did not expressly mention the August 1 request), it had located four files \"pertaining to\" Aguiar, \"processed\" the two files covering dates in the range of Aguiar's request, and identified 338 pages of responsive records, 106 pages of which were not subject in their entirety to FOIA exemptions and were therefore released to Aguiar with some redactions. (1st Myrick Decl. \u00b6 10 &amp; Exs. F, H.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Aguiar believed that other administrative subpoenas existed and should have been produced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. I.) He then filed an appeal with the Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\"), challenging the DEA's production as \"incomplete.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 27, 2014, the OIP notified Aguiar that it was affirming the DEA's action, concluding that the DEA had \"conducted an adequate reasonable search for [responsive] records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. K.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While Aguiar's appeal to the OIP was still pending, he submitted another request to the DEA for all administrative subpoenas issued between December 19, 2008, and March 28, 2011, as part of the DEA's investigation of him. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Ex. X.) After further correspondence with the agency, Aguiar submitted another FOIA request on April 28, 2014, for four specific administrative subpoenas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. One January 2009 DEA subpoena issued for my 617-549-2915 phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. One March 2009 DEA subpoena issued for my Experian credit report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. One April 2009 DEA subpoena issued for my Equifax credit report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. One April 2009 DEA subpoena issued for my Trans-Union credit report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. BB.) On July 28, 2014, Aguiar sent a letter inquiring as to the status of this request (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. EE), but he never received a formal response from the DEA or copies of the records he had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Request for GPS Tracking Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The other FOIA request at issue relates to the DEA's GPS surveillance of Aguiar. In August 2013, Aguiar submitted a request to the DEA for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [a] CD from DEA containing the DEA computer file of all tracking information collected via GPS devices attached to my vehicles with all images and proprietary software associated with that information from January 23, 2009 thru July 30, 2009, the very same file used by DEA to prepare exhibits for trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. L.). Aguiar explained that he sought this information in order \"to study and view the exact data and images DEA monitored while agents were tracking [his] vehicle(s)\" and noted that he recalled that a DEA agent had at trial \"prepared several images from his computer screen as he was tracking [Aguiar's] vehicle(s) on several different dates using DEA proprietary software that employs a Google mapping service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The DEA collects GPS tracking data by attaching to a vehicle a GPS transmitter, which \"connects to satellites to determine the precise location of the vehicle,\" then sends that information \"back to a computer where a DEA agent can see a vehicle icon moving on a map\" on his or her computer monitor. (Def.'s Reply to Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J., May 18, 2015, ECF No. 33 (\"Def.'s 1st Reply\") at 8 (describing this process of collecting GPS data).) The GPS transmitter\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   only sends data to the DEA computer when an agent 'pings' the transmitter. The pings can be requested, or scheduled for every ten minutes, or turned off until needed, to save battery power. When a ping happens, the computer system\n   records the time, date, longitude, latitude and a vehicle description. When queried the computer creates a table of the pings on a spreadsheet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Initially, the DEA told Aguiar that it had identified and received from its Boston office a potentially responsive CD containing GPS tracking information, but that \"to process the CD, DEA [would] require the services of an outside audio/video contractor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. O, at 2.) The DEA informed Aguiar that the estimated cost for this service, which Aguiar would have to pay in advance, would be $608.25 ($8.25 for the reproduction and $600 for the post-production editing/review). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Aguiar, who is incarcerated, was unable to pay that amount and requested a waiver or reduction of these costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. P, at 1.) After further correspondence and litigation about the fee, the DEA informed Aguiar that it had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   conducted a preliminary review of the CD in an effort to reduce the initial estimated fees. After review of the CD, we learned that the CD contained formatted spreadsheets of the tracking data related to the subject of request. Given that many federal prisons prohibit the receipt of CDs by inmates, as a courtesy, we printed (in hardcopy format) all of the spreadsheets (without redactions) that we propose to release to you at no cost to you (free of charge). Further, be advised that with regard to your request for \"\n   <em>\n    All images\n   </em>\n   ...\" no records were located related to any images.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. Z, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As described in its letter, the DEA provided to Aguiar 351 hardcopy pages of these spreadsheets showing GPS coordinates. After receiving the hardcopy spreadsheet pages, Aguiar notified the DEA that in his opinion its production did not fully respond to his request. (1st Myrick Decl., Ex. D.) He then appealed to OIP, arguing that the DEA should have provided him with a CD with the GPS data and the \"compatible software used by agents of the DEA to track [his] movements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. AA.) \"In the alternative,\" Aguiar asked for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   an unredacted version of each and every GPS ping report displaying: date, time, its corresponding geographical coordinates, altitude, speed, etc., including its corresponding satellite image plot on google maps at the lowest available altitude between 50-100 feet on the version of google maps in place at the time the GPS tracking of my vehicle(s) was performed by agents in 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. AA.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 30, 2014, the OIP closed the appeal without a decision due to this pending litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731730\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/251/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Aguiar initiated this litigation on January 13, 2014. (Compl., Jan. 13, 2014, ECF No. 1.) On August 15, 2014, he amended his complaint. (Am. Compl., Aug. 15, 2014, ECF No. 13.) In the Amended Complaint, Aguiar specifically sought the four administrative subpoenas, as well as \"each and every GPS ping report\" from the DEA's surveillance of him, \"with each and every GPS ping plotted on the version of Google maps in place [at the time of the surveillance].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The DEA moved for summary judgment, attaching as exhibits (1) a declaration of Katherine L. Myrick, Chief, Freedom of Information/Records Management Section for the DEA, (2) exhibits to that declaration comprising the correspondence between Aguiar and the DEA, and (3) a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Apr. 8, 2015, ECF No. 30 (\"Def.'s 1st MSJ\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1st Myrick Decl.) Aguiar filed an opposition. (Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 32 (\"Pl.'s 1st Opp'n\").) The DEA replied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 1st Reply.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court, finding that additional information was required to rule on the DEA's motion, ordered the DEA to supplement its declaration to demonstrate that an adequate search had been conducted for the four administrative subpoenas and to identify the \"software used by the DEA to create images from the GPS tracking data, the nature of the DEA's license to use that software,\" and any applicable FOIA exemptions. (Order, July 20, 2015, ECF No. 34.) In a supplemental declaration, Myrick stated that Aguiar's request for the four subpoenas \"was duplicative of his earlier requests\" and the \"previous searches would have uncovered\n   <em>\n    all subpoena\n   </em>\n   related information.\" (Supp. Decl. of Katherine L. Myrick, ECF No. 36-1 (\"2d Myrick Decl.\") \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As for the GPS software, the DEA informed the Court that the software used by DEA agents \"belongs to the vendor and the DEA has no authority to provide the software to other persons for their personal use.... The software remains under the control of the vendor and at no time does the Defendant exercise control of the software.\" (Notice of Compliance with Court Order, Sept. 9, 2015, ECF No. 36, at 4.) The Notice also explained that, \"[a]t the time of the Plaintiff's trial, the software provided by the vendor allowed the DEA agent to produce a 'screen shot' of what was visible on the computer monitor. Some of the screen shots contained a 'Google Maps' icon on the map image.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The GPS map images presented during Aguiar's trial were not systematically created or saved by the DEA as a function of using the mapping software. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.9\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court deferred ruling on the question of whether the GPS mapping software is an agency record subject to FOIA, and ordered the DEA to provide evidence, in the form of a sworn declaration, that supported the description provided in its legal briefing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, Sept. 30, 2015, ECF No. 39.) On all other questions, including whether the DEA had adequately searched for the administrative subpoenas and whether Aguiar was entitled to his alternative request of new map images, the Court granted summary judgment to the DEA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.9\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Aguiar I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196485\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/91/\">\n    139 F. Supp. 3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response, the DEA filed another supplemental declaration by Myrick, in which she stated that the DEA \"does contract for a service that allows for viewing the location of a GPS tracking devices [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] on a geodetic map computer image,\" but that after searching the relevant \"DEA field office, the GPS data associated with the surveillance of plaintiff was not located in the investigative case file or any computer in use at the DEA field office at the time of the search.\" (Supp. Decl. of Katherine L. Myrick, Nov. 10, 2015, ECF No. 43-1 (\"3d Myrick Decl.\") \u00b6 11). The declaration also stated that \"the field office that conducted the investigation and surveillance of plaintiff, and the DEA office responsible for the procurement of surveillance equipment and systems were contacted with regard to plaintiff's request,\" and, based on those inquiries, the DEA determined it \"was not in possession or control\" of the responsive software. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although this third declaration did not fully answer the\n   Court's questions about the nature of the software itself, the Court was satisfied that the additional information provided was sufficient for the Court to determine that the software was not in the DEA's possession or control and therefore not an agency record.\n   <em>\n    Aguiar v.

Specifically, the declarations suggested, without sufficient clarity, that the Burlington Office had conducted a manual, page-by-page search of physical documents in the two case files identified. The Court's decision states that \"if that is so, it would of course resolve the matter, and the agency can say so in a new declaration filed with the district court.

(4th Myrick Decl. \u00b6 5.) She further states that \"there is no system of records maintained by DEA that tracks and/or in which copies of administrative subpoenas are maintained. All copies of all administrative subpoenas issued by DEA during the course of a DEA investigation are maintained in the DEA investigative case file associated with the investigation,\" in paper copy form with no duplicates saved elsewhere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Administrative subpoenas \"are systematically included in investigative case files.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Although the record before this Court and before the Court of Appeals included statements from Myrick suggesting this information (1st Myrick Decl. \u00b6 48 (\"IRFS contains\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.\") ), the Court of Appeals found those previous declarations too \"sparse\" in their explanations of\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   searching those indices was reasonably likely to disclose all relevant information.\n   <em>\n    Aguiar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n    865 F.3d at 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Myrick's latest explanations provide the missing details. There is no DEA system that tracks all administrative subpoenas; rather, those subpoenas are stored as paper copies in the hard-copy case files. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4th Myrick Decl. \u00b6 6.) These were the files searched, via electronic index, for potentially\n   relevant files. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Two relevant files were identified based on Aguiar's identifying information and the date range he specified in his request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.) Burlington Office staff then manually searched those files. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Although the subpoenas, whose existence is not in dispute, were not found, the Court is persuaded that the search was diligent and reasonably likely to turn up any relevant records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Aguiar agrees that Myrick's most recent declaration \"remedies the two deficiencies identified by the Court of Appeals,\" but argues that the search was still inadequate because the DEA has not contacted Justin Couture, the DEA case agent who signed the subpoenas and testified about them at Aguiar's pre-trial hearing. (Amicus Mot. at 23.) Aguiar argues that \"there is a close nexus\" between Agent Couture and the subpoenas, and therefore the DEA should have \"inquire[d] of him as a source likely to turn up the information requested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena v.

Cir. 1999) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Aguiar made this argument previously, but the Court of Appeals dismissed it in a footnote because Aguiar had not previously suggested to the agency or to the Court that Agent Couture should have been contacted. As the Court of Appeals noted, an agency need only look to \"the four corners\" of a FOIA request for leads as to agency records.\n   <em>\n    Aguiar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n    865 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   740 n.1 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kowalczyk v.

Cir. 1996) ). Aguiar argues that he has now remedied this problem by writing to the DEA following the decision on appeal and asking the DEA to contact Agent Couture for information about the whereabouts of the subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amicus Mot. at 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Attach. to Notice to Court at 4.) The DEA characterizes the proposed inquiry as \"futile,\" because neither Agent Couture's signature on the subpoenas nor his testimony about them several years ago amounts to a guarantee that he would point the agency to the records' current whereabouts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The DEA must pursue a lead to missing documents if that lead is \"both clear and certain\" and cannot \"in good faith\" be ignored.\n   <em>\n    Kowalczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689414,7411246\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/386/\">\n    73 F.3d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice to the Court, Oct. 10, 2017, ECF No. 84 (notifying the Court that Aguiar made this request to the DEA following the issuance of the Circuit's opinion and including a copy of his letter).) The DEA asserts that such an inquiry would be \"futile.\" This assessment is insufficient. Success need not be guaranteed to warrant follow-up. The subpoenas' existence is uncontested, and the agency did not find them in the files where they should have been stored. It is not merely speculative, and indeed seems reasonable, to suppose that Agent Couture may recall that the subpoenas were stored in a different type\n   of file or some other location, and the DEA should make a good-faith effort to reach him to pursue this lead. The Court therefore orders the DEA to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Request for GPS Tracking Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In response to Aguiar's August 2013 FOIA request for \"all tracking information collected via GPS devices attached to [his] vehicles,\" and \"all ... proprietary software associated with that information,\" the DEA eventually provided a copy of spreadsheets listing latitude and longitude coordinates captured by GPS. Aguiar then renewed his request for a copy of the software itself or, in the alternative, for images of the coordinates plotted onto satellite maps. The DEA denied this request because the agency \"was not in possession or control of any system or software that was responsive to [Aguiar's] request.\" (3d Myrick Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On appeal, the D.C. Circuit found Myrick's third declaration insufficient because it relied on conclusory legal assertions rather than explaining \"as a matter of fact that the software was not found.\"\n   <em>\n    Aguiar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n    865 F.3d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the DEA failed to \"explain where the software is located, what arrangement it has with the software's creator, how it uses the software, and why those circumstances amount to something short of obtaining and controlling the software.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n    at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, this Court has been directed to assess the new information provided by the DEA and to determine whether material questions of fact remain as to the software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Now before the Court are new declarations in support of the DEA's renewed motion for summary judgment. The Roy Declaration explains that from 2004-2011 the DEA used a computer system \"that permitted a user to view the location of GPS tracking devices in real-time on a mapping display.\" (Roy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.) The software was installed on DEA-owned laptops, and \"end users,\" in this case DEA employees, would use the system to review real-time locations on a map. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The system \"did not allow for the manual entering of discrete longitude and latitude coordinates for display on a map.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition to these details about how the system worked, the DEA also provided, with its reply brief, a declaration from one of its attorneys and relevant portions of the license agreement governing its use of the software in question; the agreement incorporates federal regulations providing that copies of the software may not be distributed to the public. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Little Decl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   These documents provide the factual details that the Court of Appeals found lacking: the DEA has now explained \"where the software is located\" (it was downloaded to DEA machines during the years it was in use), the \"arrangement [the DEA] has with the software's creator\" (permission to use but not to distribute to the public), and \"how it use[d] the software\" (to view GPS locations on real-time map images).\n   <em>\n    Aguiar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n    865 F.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The documents and explanations also describe significant limitations on the DEA's use of the software, most notably that the contract prohibits its distribution. The Court is satisfied that the DEA did not\n   \"obtain\" and \"control\" the software because the limited terms of the license establish no \"intent\" to retain control over it, the agency was limited in its use of the software, and the software itself was downloaded to agency machines but was not \"integrated into the agency's record system.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Mot. to Supp. at 8.) In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff challenged under the Privacy Act inaccuracies in the presentence report that had been prepared by the U.S. Probation Office, claiming that the inaccuracies resulted in a loss of eligibility for parole and thus more time in prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288409,3715450\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1124/\">\n    148 F.3d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Reply Mot. to Supp. at 7 (noting that Aguiar raised similar arguments about the GPS evidence in his post-conviction claims in Vermont, to no avail).) Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that this is true, Aguiar's proposed claims still hinge on the \"adverse\" outcome of the alleged inaccuracies-his conviction and sentence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552a(g)(1)(C). The money damages Aguiar seeks are based entirely on his estimation of lost income due to his sentence. The inevitable conclusion is that the claims relating to the accuracy of the GPS data are in fact an attempt to use the Privacy Act to collaterally attack the conviction and sentence, and thus\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   governs. Counts Four and Five are not cognizable claims under the Privacy Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, Count Six alleges conspiracy \"to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and to create, disclose, and maintain inaccurate agency records\" and to conceal, withhold, and destroy Aguiar's agency records. (Proposed Supp. Compl. at 10.) The DEA argues that this claim adds nothing to Counts One through Five except a claim of conspiracy to violate the Privacy Act, and that no such cause of action exists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Mot. to Supp. at 10;\n   <em>\n    Falwell v. Exec. Office of the President\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494371\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/158/734/#p744\">\n    158 F.Supp.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (W.D. Va. 2001) (\"[S]overeign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.... Accordingly, there must be statutory authorization to sue a federal agency. Neither the Privacy Act nor FOIA provide a cause of action for conspiracy.\") (citations omitted).) Aguiar contends that Count Six does not raise a Privacy Act conspiracy claim but rather a claim of conspiracy to violate Aguiar's civil rights, but he cites no specific statutory or common-law cause of action, and the language of the claim accuses the defendants of conspiracy \"to violate the Privacy Act of 1974.\" The proposed supplemental complaint does not include sufficient allegations to connect these claims to a cognizable civil-rights claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The DEA further contends that any claims against the Contractor cannot survive because the Privacy Act imposes requirements only on agencies, and \"does not apply to government contractors.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Blyther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044266\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/964/61/#p71\">\n    964 F.Supp.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71 (D.D.C. 2013). Aguiar argues that a factual inquiry is necessary to determine whether the Contractor is an agency within the meaning of the Privacy Act, or an employee of the government. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Mot. to Supp. at 9.) The law, however, is clear on this question. \"The Privacy Act does not apply to government contractors.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro. Life Ins.

For this reason alone, the proposed claims against the Contractor may not proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part the DEA's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 87, and grants in part and denies in part Aguiar's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, ECF No. 88. The Court orders the DEA to make reasonable efforts within 25 days to contact Agent Couture regarding the whereabouts of the four requested administrative subpoenas and to file a declaration documenting the results of its contact with Agent Couture on or before October 22, 2018. The Court denies Aguiar's Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Complaint, ECF No. 75.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The record is clear that Aguiar, who is incarcerated, has no means to create the maps himself.

J., ECF No. 32, at 7 (\"[A]s to the argument to simply plot the DEA-provided GPS points on maps, Plaintiff has no access to the internet, topographical maps, nor access to a computer unless it has to do with a legal issue....\").)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Aguiar II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275658\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/730/\">\n     865 F.3d at 734\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court attributes to Aguiar arguments made by his amicus, who has graciously continued to represent him on the issues remanded by the Court of Appeals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Since 2011, the DEA has used a completely web-based interface for real-time GPS tracking, and when the agency changed systems, \"all end-user software and equipment\" associated with the old system was \"retired and disposed of.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 18.) By the time Aguiar submitted his original FOIA request in 2013, the DEA had switched to the new system and no longer maintained the software from the previous system.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The Court recognizes that if Aguiar had access to the Internet he could enter the GPS coordinates into a mapping program (such as Google maps) to create the images himself, but due to his incarceration he is unable to do this. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s 1st Opp'n at 7 (describing computer access limitations);\n    <em>\n     see also supra\n    </em>\n    note 1.) However, issues of access due to prison restrictions do not bear on an agency's obligations under FOIA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sample\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560370,3773910\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/1086/\">\n     466 F.3d at 1089\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Once BOP, in its role as FOIA respondent, has provided the records, its FOIA obligation is complete.

Aguiar moved to supplement his complaint August 21, 2017; the GPS data at issue was presented during his 2011 trial. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp'n to Mot. to Supp. at 9;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Reply Mot. to Supp. at 8 (Aguiar describing his attempts to \"investigate the discrepancy between agent notes and Aguiar's electronically stored GPS tracking file\").) Aguiar contends that his attorney did not show him the GPS evidence until late 2013; the record before the Court shows that he received the spreadsheets from the DEA in March 2014 in the FOIA request process. At least by then, Aguiar would have had all necessary information to mount these claims. The Court finds that Counts Four and Five are thus barred by the Privacy Act's statute of limitations, are therefore futile, and for this reason as well may not be added to this litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
