INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case illustrates the harm that may arise from even the most trivial traffic dispute, when the full weight of the justice system is brought to bear on that dispute. Plaintiffs Vashti and Eugene Sherrod and Defendant Diane Schulz were involved in a minor accident in the District of Columbia that devolved into an intense shouting match. Hours after the incident, Ms. Schulz reported to the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") that Mrs. Sherrod threatened her with a handgun. MPD Detective Phillip McHugh, another Defendant, was assigned to investigate Ms. Schulz's accusation. He obtained a video of the incident that allegedly proves Mrs. Sherrod's innocence, yet he used the power afforded to him by the criminal justice system to stop and search the Sherrods' car, search their home, and ultimately arrest Mrs. Sherrod.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When a grand jury refused to indict Mrs. Sherrod, the Sherrods brought this action against Ms. Schulz, Detective McHugh, and the District of Columbia (together with Detective McHugh, the \"District Defendants\") on multiple constitutional and common law grounds. The Defendants have moved for summary judgment, arguing that Detective McHugh is entitled to certain immunities and that the Sherrods have failed to introduce facts supporting their claims. Both sides have also moved to exclude certain testimony. As explained below, because the Sherrods have, in fact, introduced facts that would allow a reasonable jury to find in their favor on certain claims, the Court denies the District Defendants' motion for summary judgment in part and Ms. Schulz's motion for summary judgment in full. The Court also grants the parties' motions to exclude testimony about certain topics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Traffic Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early May 2015, the Sherrods and Ms. Schulz were involved in a traffic accident in front of a flower shop in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Statement Undisputed Material Facts (\"SUMF\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, ECF No. 68-2; Statement Material Facts Not In Dispute (\"Schulz's Statement\") \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF No. 66. The Sherrods are elderly, and Mr. Sherrod is legally blind. Schulz's Statement \u00b6 1. According to the Sherrods, when Ms. Schulz attempted to parallel park her truck she collided with the side mirror of their car. SUMF \u00b6 4; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 3. This act precipitated a lengthy squabble between the Sherrods and Ms. Schulz, during which both sides cursed, made threats, and allegedly used racial epithets. Schulz's Statement \u00b6 4. Before going their separate ways, the parties exchanged insurance information and Ms. Schulz recorded the vehicle identification number (\"VIN\") for the Sherrods' car. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Dep. Sapan Patel\n   (\"Patel Dep.\") 26:1-26:17, District Defendants Mem. P &amp; A. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (\"Defs. Mem.\") Ex. 7, ECF No. 68-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the accident's aftermath, Ms. Schulz took several steps that are key to this action. Shortly after the accident, Ms. Schulz called her insurance company to report it. Dep. Diane Schulz (\"Schulz Dep.\") 67:18-77:15, Defs. Mem. Ex. 4, ECF No. 68-6. Later that day Ms. Schulz called her son and discussed the dispute, initially telling him that the Sherrods threatened her with a gun, but later admitting that she was \"not sure if [she] really saw a gun.\" Dep. Luciano Carafano (\"Carafano Dep.\") 31:17-34:3, Pls. Opp'n Defs. Mem. &amp; Schulz Mem. (\"Pls. Opp'n.\") Ex. 2, ECF No. 76-5. Finally, several hours after the dispute and at her son's encouragement, Ms. Schulz called 911. SUMF \u00b6 33; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 9. She described her dispute with the Sherrods to the 911 operator, and she claimed that the \"little 80 year old lady\" threatened her with a gun and then \"got her gun out,\" with encouragement from Mr. Sherrod. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 34-37. This phone call triggered the investigation from which the Sherrods' claims arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Initial Investigatory Steps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MPD Officer Sapan Patel was dispatched to interview Ms. Schulz after her 911 call. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 38-41, 52-59; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 10. Ms. Schulz repeated to Officer Patel that Mrs. Sherrod \"attempted to intimidate me with some sort of gun or weapon.\" SUMF \u00b6 39. She was unable to give Officer Patel \"very specific details\" about the threat, but she claimed that Mrs. Sherrod pulled a \"big black gun\" from under her driver's seat. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 54-57. Officer Patel was able to identify the Sherrods as the primary suspects based on the VIN that Ms. Schulz recorded during the altercation. Patel Dep. 26:1-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dep. Phillip McHugh (\"McHugh Dep.\") 150:2-20, Pls. Opp'n Ex. 3, ECF No. 76-6 (stating that he \"ran the VIN number\" to obtain a picture of the Sherrods' car, which he showed to Ms. Schulz during their initial interview). Officer Patel initially classified Mrs. Sherrod's alleged act as a misdemeanor, but the act was subsequently reclassified as a violent crime, felony-assault with a dangerous weapon. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 62-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Detective McHugh was assigned to handle the investigation after Officer Patel conducted the initial interview. SUMF \u00b6 64; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 11. From the very beginning, Ms. Schulz's claim should have been viewed skeptically. Detective McHugh thought it was \"strange\" that Ms. Schulz had waited several hours before reporting the incident to the police. McHugh Dep. 83:2-15. Moreover, even Detective McHugh thought it normally would strain credulity for an elderly woman to be accused of such a violent confrontation with a gun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Detective McHugh to Susan Wittrock, June 24, 2015 (stating that \"the suspect is pushing 80 years old ... if it wasn't on video, not sure I would've believed it myself\"), Defs. Mem. Ex. 11, ECF No. 68-13. Detective McHugh began his investigation in earnest on May 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, on May 15, Detective McHugh interviewed Ms. Schulz. Dep. Diane Schulz (\"Schulz Dep.\") 93:9-95:5, Defs. Mem. Ex. 4, ECF No. 68-6; McHugh Dep. 87:5-8; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 11. Ms. Schulz repeated the same allegations to Detective McHugh that she had made to the 911 operator and Officer Patel-Mrs. Sherrod threatened Ms. Schulz with a gun, and then reached into the driver's seat area of her car, pulled out a black gun, and pointed it at Ms. Schulz. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 72-77. Again, Ms. Schulz could not identify the gun's specific make, but she did tell Detective McHugh that it was \"semi-automatic\" and similar to the gun owned by one of her\n   family members, who is a police officer. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The day after he interviewed Ms. Schulz, Detective McHugh emailed Ms. Schulz his police report classifying the incident as an assault with a dangerous weapon, including Ms. Schulz's accusation that Mrs. Sherrod \"brandished a large black handgun.\" Pls. Opp'n. Ex. 21, ECF No. 76-24. Ms. Schulz responded to Detective McHugh's email and clarified a minor detail in the report, but despite her apparent reservations she did not express that Mrs. Sherrod may not have wielded a gun. Pls. Opp'n Ex. 27, ECF No. 76-30. Notably, the record contains no evidence indicating that Ms. Schulz ever indicated to MPD-during her 911 call, her interview with Officer Patel, or her interview with Detective McHugh-that she was not sure whether Mrs. Sherrod had brandished a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After interviewing Ms. Schulz, despite his apparent skepticism and before interviewing Mrs. Sherrod and seeking evidence and witnesses at the flower shop, Detective McHugh issued a \"bulletin\" over the Washington Area Law Enforcement System (\"WALES\") and the National Crime Information System (\"NCIS\"). SUMF \u00b6 85; McHugh Dep. 125:17-22; Pls. Opp'n Ex. 19, ECF No. 76-22. The bulletin, captioned \"Felony Vehicle, ADW gun,\" notified all local law enforcement agencies that the Sherrods' car was involved in a possible assault with a deadly weapon and that it should be stopped so that Detective McHugh could question its occupants. McHugh Dep. 127:16-128:14; SUMF \u00b6 85; Defs. Mem. Ex. 10, ECF No. 68-12; Pls. Opp'n Ex. 19 &amp; Ex. 20, ECF No. 76-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, after interviewing Ms. Schulz and issuing the bulletin, Detective McHugh went to the flower shop to interview potential witnesses. SUMF \u00b6 81. The lone employee Detective McHugh interviewed heard the altercation between Ms. Schulz and the Sherrods but did not see it, so he could not corroborate Ms. Schulz's allegations. SUMF \u00b6 82. However, Detective McHugh obtained a video from the store's security camera (hereafter, the \"security video\") that captured the altercation, albeit without sound. SUMF \u00b6 83. The security video shows that another employee of the flower shop-Kenneth Wright-witnessed at least some of the altercation, but Detective McHugh did not interview Mr. Wright. McHugh Dep. 119:17-120:14; Decl. of Kenneth Wright \u00b6 4-6, ECF No. 76-16. Detective McHugh also showed the video to his supervisor, Lieutenant Richard Brady. SUMF \u00b6 84, 98; Decl. of Richard Brady \u00b6 5, ECF No. 68-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed below, the parties dispute the conclusions to be drawn from the security video, but they concede that the video is authentic and that it captures the altercation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Partial Consent Mot. Def. Diane Lee Schulz Summ. J. Dismissal (\"Schulz Mem.\"), ECF No. 66; Defs. Mem., ECF No. 68; Pls. Opp'n, ECF No. 76. The parties also agree that no gun is visible on the video. McHugh Dep. 157:19-20; Pls. Statement Mat. Facts Genuine Dispute (\"Pls. Statement\") \u00b6 97, ECF No. 76-1. Despite this admission Detective McHugh believes that the video corroborates Ms. Schulz's allegations. McHugh Dep. 158:7-160:2. The Sherrods, on the other hand, believe it exonerates them. Pls. Statement \u00b6 98. But, from this point forward in the investigation there is no dispute that all evidence developed was exculpatory of Mrs. Sherrod.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detective McHugh took several investigatory steps after viewing the security video, many of which prompted the Sherrods' claims. First, approximately one week after viewing the video, Mrs. Sherrod and Detective McHugh spoke over the telephone about the incident, and Mrs. Sherrod\n   told Detective McHugh that she did not own a gun and did not point a gun at Ms. Schulz. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 90, 93-94; McHugh Dep. 154:13-15 (agreeing that Mrs. Sherrod \"vehemently denied\" brandishing a gun at Ms. Schulz). The parties dispute whether Mrs. Sherrod independently brought up the possible existence of a gun, without Detective McHugh prompting her. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 91-95; Pls. Statement \u00b6 91. Next, Detective McHugh contacted the Prince George's County Police Department and the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and confirmed that the Sherrods had not registered a firearm with either agency. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; Defs. Mem. Ex. 11; McHugh Dep. 145:19-146:13. Then, Detective McHugh met with the Assistant United States Attorneys (\"AUSAs\") assigned to the case, showed them the security video, and recounted the statements of Ms. Schulz and Mrs. Sherrod. McHugh Dep. 158:2-160:7. The AUSAs apparently did not believe that the evidence presented was sufficient to arrest Mrs. Sherrod at this stage of the investigation, even before the investigation produced additional exculpatory facts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   160:3-7; Email from Detective McHugh to Susan Wittrock, June 24, 2015 (stating that \"the video isn't clear enough for the [AUSAs] to sign a warrant since we can't say definitively what is in suspect's hand\"), Defs. Mem. Ex. 11. At this point, Detective McHugh determined that the proper course of action was to continue the investigation and search the Sherrods' car and home. McHugh Dep. 158:11-19, 160:8-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Car Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 24, Detective McHugh's bulletin prompted two United States Capitol Police patrol cars to pull the Sherrods over as they drove near the Capitol. SUMF \u00b6 101; Pls. Statement \u00b6 103. After Mrs. Sherrod pulled her car to the curb, three police officers approached and two of them pointed shotguns at the Sherrods. Pls. Statement \u00b6 103. The Sherrods claim that the officers' actions terrified them to the point of tears.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Detective McHugh arrived on the scene ten to forty minutes later and obtained Mrs. Sherrod's consent to search the car. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 102-104; Pls. Statement \u00b6 102-104. The Sherrods assert that Detective McHugh told them he would impound their car if Mrs. Sherrod did not consent, an assertion that Detective McHugh denies. Pls. Statement \u00b6 104; McHugh Dep. 181:12-14. Detective McHugh searched the car for approximately one hour but did not find a gun or any other contraband. SUMF \u00b6 105; McHugh Dep. at 183:6-13; Vashti Sherrod Dep. 152:1-155:9, Pls. Opp'n Ex. 7, ECF No. 76-10. After the search Detective McHugh requested that Mrs. Sherrod accompany him to the police station for further questioning, but Mrs. Sherrod refused. Vashti Sherrod Dep. 155:15-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Home Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to the car search, Detective McHugh sought to search the Sherrods' home. Because the Sherrods live in Maryland, Detective McHugh coordinated the search with the Prince George's County Police Department. SUMF \u00b6 99. Detective McHugh supplied information on the case, including a description of the security video, to a Bowie, Maryland detective who used the information to complete a search warrant affidavit. SUMF \u00b6 100; Pls. Statement \u00b6 100. The affidavit stated in part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The [security] video corroborates the victim's series of events. The video shows Vashti Sherrod bend down at the driver's seat of her Mercedes and emerge with her right arm raised as if pointing something at the victim. Sherrod walks toward the victim, who then abruptly reenters her vehicle and leaves\n   the scene. The video quality is not clear enough to see what Sherrod has in her hand, but the victim described it as a black pistol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pls. Opp'n Ex. 23 at 3, ECF No. 76-26. A magistrate judge approved the warrant based on that information. Defs. Mem. Ex. 14, ECF No. 68-16. On Wednesday, July 7 at approximately 9:00 p.m., Detective McHugh and a team of Maryland police officers conducted a search of Plaintiffs' home. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6105-106; Decl. of David Edelstein (\"Edelstein Decl.\") \u00b6 5, Defs. Mem. Ex. 16, ECF No. 68-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to District Defendants, the team knocked on the front and back doors, announced themselves multiple times by shouting into the house, turned their police lights on, and attempted to call the Sherrods from both Detective McHugh's cell phone and the Prince George's County 911 call center. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 108-114. Detective McHugh saw someone-allegedly the Sherrods-look through an upstairs bedroom window at the police, and he could see that a television was on in that room. SUMF \u00b6 110; McHugh Dep. 207:15-18. Finally, after approximately thirty minutes, the officer in charge ordered the team to force entry into the Sherrods' home-to \"breach\" the front door. SUMF \u00b6 114; McHugh Dep. 210:7-211:21. Detective McHugh claims that he asked the Prince George's County officers to use less force than is normally used when serving a search warrant for a possible weapon. McHugh Dep. 208:20-209:5. Detective McHugh did not participate in the initial breach, and only entered the Sherrods' house after it had been secured by the team. SUMF \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to the Sherrods, on the night of the search they were startled by a ringing doorbell, pounding on their back door, and flashing lights visible through their windows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls. Statement \u00b6 16. The Sherrods thought that they might have been experiencing a home invasion, and they feared for their safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This fear was exacerbated by Mr. Sherrod's blindness; he could not see who was in his home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the police breached the door, they briefly handcuffed Mr. Sherrod and told Mrs. Sherrod to put her hands over her head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Detective McHugh told the Sherrods that they could not leave the home until he permitted them to, then he personally searched their home, allegedly ransacking their property in the process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Detective McHugh did not find any guns or ammunition in the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Despite not finding any evidence that the Sherrods owned or had access to a gun, on July 10 Detective McHugh secured an arrest warrant for Mrs. Sherrod. SUMF \u00b6 116; Pls. Statement \u00b6 116; McHugh Dep. 231:18-21; Defs. Mem. Ex. 17, ECF No. 68-19.

Ex. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 21, Mrs. Sherrod surrendered herself to MPD and was processed, handcuffed, jailed, and ultimately released that day on her personal recognizance pending a preliminary hearing before a District of Columbia Superior Court magistrate judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Resp. of Vashti Sherrod to the\n   Interrogs.

SUMF \u00b6 120; Pls. Statement \u00b6 123; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 12. She also revealed that she was bipolar and taking medication to treat that condition, factors that may have influenced her memory and mental state. SUMF \u00b6 121-22; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 2. The grand jury ultimately did not issue an indictment. SUMF \u00b6 124-125; Schulz's Statement \u00b6 14.

The Sherrods' claims arise from three distinct events: (1) the stop and search of the Sherrods' car; (2) the search of the Sherrods' home; and (3) Mrs. Sherrod's arrest.

The Court will first address the validity of the warrants to search the Sherrods' home and arrest Mrs. Sherrod, as those warrants are material to many of the Sherrods' constitutional claims and District Defendants' summary judgment\n   arguments. The Court will then address the constitutional claims, which are captured rather vaguely in Counts I, II, and III of the complaint.

To state a cognizable NIED claim under District of Columbia law, a plaintiff must show that (1) the plaintiff was in a zone of physical danger; (2) which was created by the defendant's negligence; (3) the plaintiff feared for her own safety, and (4) the plaintiff's emotional distress was serious and verifiable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

The Sherrods appear to claim that Detective McHugh was negligent in issuing the bulletin because he lacked \"good cause,\" Hayden Report at 7, but the Court's conclusion disposes of that theory. Accordingly, Detective McHugh cannot be liable for NIED resulting from the Capitol Police's actions taken while stopping the Sherrods' car, because the Sherrods have failed to show that Detective McHugh was negligent in prompting that stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Again, as discussed above, a reasonable jury may conclude that Detective McHugh knew or should have known that he lacked probable cause to search the Sherrods' home after viewing the security video, and that he at the very least negligently mischaracterized the security video in his affidavits in support of the search warrant. Pursuant to those negligently obtained warrants, officers breached the Sherrods' door with guns drawn, causing the Sherrods to fear a break-in.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregory v.

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 118-23, 163-70.

As discussed above in the Court's discussion of the Sherrods' malicious prosecution claim against Ms. Schulz, a reasonable jury may conclude that Ms. Schulz's allegedly false accusation was made with malice, warranting punitive damages. Furthermore, District Defendants made no argument in their briefs regarding this claim, and therefore cannot seek its dismissal.\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   , 413 F.3d at 20.

First, the Court grants District Defendants' motion for summary judgment on (1) the Sherrods' constitutional, negligence, and NIED claims arising from the initial stop of the Sherrods' car by the Capitol Police; (2) the Sherrods' excessive force claims arising from the actions of the Prince George's County police officers in entering the Sherrods' home; and (3) the Sherrods' constitutional malicious prosecution and NIED claims arising from Mrs. Sherrod's arrest.

Motion Regarding Shana Mell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The Court first considers the Sherrods' motion to exclude the trial testimony of Shana Mell. Ms. Mell is the MPD's \"policy writer,\" and she intends to testify about her \"[k]nowledge of IACP and the extent to which MPD relies on IACP's knowledge.\" Defs.' Suppl. Initial Disclosures at 1, Mell Mem. Ex. 1, ECF No. 56. The Sherrods argue that she should be foreclosed from testifying because District Defendants did not supplement their Federal\n   Rule 26(a) disclosures to identify her as a trial witness until October 17, 2017, over one month after the originally scheduled close of discovery. Mell Mem. at 3. District Defendants, however, argue that the timing of their identification of Ms. Mell was reasonable because Ms. Mell's testimony is intended to address Dr. Hayden's expert report, which was not produced until September 30, 2017. District Defs.' Mem. P. &amp; A. Opp'n Mell Mem. (\"Mell Opp'n\") at 5, ECF No. 63. The Court agrees that the severe sanction of excluding Ms. Mell's testimony is not warranted here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(i)\"a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties ... the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information-along with the subjects of that information-that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment.\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) allows a court to impose \"appropriate sanctions,\" including the exclusion at trial of any information not disclosed pursuant to Rule 26(a), unless the failure to disclose is harmless or if there was substantial justification for such failure. A Rule 37(c)(1) exclusion, however, is an \"extreme sanction\" that should be used sparingly.\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

The circumstances here do not justify such a sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   First, as District Defendants note, Mell Opp'n at 6, by the time they identified Ms. Mell as a trial witness the close of expert discovery had been extended to November 17, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order Granting ECF No. 53, Pls. Consent Mot. Am. Scheduling Order, Sept. 13, 2017. The Sherrods had one month to depose Ms. Mell before discovery would fully close, so her late identification was arguably harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Second, the Sherrods' contention that District Defendants knew that they would rely on Ms. Mell's testimony as early as May 8, 2017, when the Sherrods disclosed Dr. Klotz's report, relies on a faulty assumption about the contents of Dr. Hayden's report. Mell Mem. at 3. While Dr. Klotz's report relied heavily on IACP policies, the Sherrods have not shown that District Defendants knew that\n   <em>\n    Dr. Hayden's\n   </em>\n   report would similarly rely on IACP policies, rather than on a completely different set of sources. District Defendants only learned of Dr. Hayden's reliance on IACP policies when the Sherrods produced his report on September 30, 2017, at which point District Defendants identified Ms. Mell as the witness best suited to address the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Third, there are \"less drastic\" options available to cure any prejudice to the Sherrods from the late identification of Ms. Mell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

The Experts' Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The Court first considers whether the experts are sufficiently qualified to offer their testimony. Rule 702 requires that an expert be qualified to testify on the basis of \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[,]\" and thus the Rule encompasses \"not only experts in the strictest sense of the word, e.g., physicians,\n   physicists, and architects, but also the large group sometimes called 'skilled' witnesses, such as bankers or landowners testifying to land values.\" Fed.

The Court cannot conclusively determine, based on the papers submitted, that Mr. Hicks is not sufficiently qualified to discuss police investigation procedure under Rule 702. The Court is somewhat hindered in its analysis due to the Sherrods' strategic decision not to depose Mr. Hicks, during which they could have developed a more complete record of his qualifications. For now, the Court concludes that Mr. Hicks is qualified based on his practical experience and training.\n   <em>\n    Rothe Dev.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360898\" index=\"406\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/107/183/#p196\">\n    107 F.Supp.3d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Interpretation of the Security Video\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Court next addresses whether the experts may testify as to the proper interpretation of the security video. Both the Sherrods and District Defendants argue that the other side's expert either should not be allowed to interpret the video, Hicks Mem. at 15, or has improperly interpreted the video, Defs.

It is true that other courts have allowed experts to issue probable cause opinions. In\n   <em>\n    Huthnance\n   </em>\n   , for instance, another court in this District held that a police practices expert could testify that there was not sufficient evidence for a defendant officer to reasonably believe that there was probable cause for an arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   793 F.Supp.2d at 208.

In those cases, however, the experts drew their conclusions based on factual records that were relatively settled, while here the proper interpretation of the security video is hotly disputed and the experts' opinions regarding probable cause may unduly influence the jury's analysis of the video. Because it is improper for the experts to opine on what the security video shows, it is also improper for the experts to opine on what legal conclusions should be drawn from the video.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    4. District Defendants' Remaining Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses District Defendants' remaining arguments, all of which relate to Dr. Hayden's opinions regarding the investigatory steps Detective McHugh should have taken according to the standard of care. Defs. Mem. at 51-54, 56-57, 59-61. District Defendants clearly disagree with Dr. Hayden's opinions, but because the Sherrods have made \"the requisite threshold showing [of admissibility]; further disputes go to weight, not admissibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Rothe Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360898\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/107/183/#p196\">\n    107 F.Supp.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, Ms. Mell may testify at trial, but the Court will reopen discovery to allow the Sherrods to depose her, and District Defendants must bear the cost of that deposition. Second, both experts may testify, but not about (1) their interpretations of what the security video shows; and (2) their conclusions regarding whether the video gave Detective McHugh probable cause to search the Sherrods' car and home and to arrest Mrs. Sherrod. The experts should focus their testimony on whether the standard of care dictated that Detective McHugh should have taken certain investigatory steps, for instance interviewing Mr. Wright, showing Ms. Schulz the security video, re-interviewing Ms. Schulz after reviewing the security video, or running social media searches on Ms. Schulz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
