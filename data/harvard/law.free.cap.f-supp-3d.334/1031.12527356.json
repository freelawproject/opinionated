BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs Tesoro Refining &amp; Marketing Company LLC and Tesoro Socal Pipeline Company LLC (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") are limited liability companies who \"use subterranean pipelines to transport crude oil and products\" beneath property in Long Beach, California, \"within Golden Avenue, between Baker Street and West Wardlow Road\" (the \"Site\"). (Dkt. No. 58 (hereinafter, \"FAC\") \u00b6 1.) The Site is located adjacent to a former wastewater plant operated by Oil Operators Incorporated (the \"OOI Site\"). (FAC \u00b6 4.) Plaintiffs bring this action against multiple defendants who Plaintiffs claim each \"owned, operated, controlled, or used various subterranean pipelines that have run, in relevant part, under the Site.\" (FAC \u00b6 5.) Specifically, Defendants include: (1) County Sanitation District No. 3 of Los Angeles County, a municipal entity (\"LACSD\"); (2) Crimson; (3) Getty; (4) Union; (5) Doe No. 1, the successor-in-interest to General Exploration Company International (\"General Exploration\"); (6) Plains, who is the successor-in-interest to PPS Holding Company; (7) Ultramar Inc. (\"Ultramar\"), as parent company to Golden Eagle Oil Company (\"Golden Eagle\"); (8) Valero Energy Corporation (\"Valero\"), the successor-in-interest to Ultramar\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (9) NuStar GP, Inc. (\"NuStar\"), as successor-in-interest to a Valero subsidiary; (10) ENI, a successor-in-interest to Ultramar and Golden Eagle; (11) Sunset Oil Corporation; and, (12) Douglas Oil Company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 6-16.) Plaintiffs claim that each Defendant either owns, operates, or \"is legally responsible to indemnify the owner or operator\" of a pipeline at the Site or beneath Baker Street, Golden Avenue, or both. (FAC \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that LACSD owned or operated a vitrified clay sewer line of approximately thirty inches in diameter running beneath portions of the Site. (FAC \u00b6 20(a).) This sewer line was used to transport waste discharged from the OOI Site, as well as various other wastes from nearby facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs contend that Crimson owned or operated two pipelines designated for the transportation of crude oil, one of which eventually became inactive. (FAC \u00b6 20(b).) Getty owned or operated two eight-inch pipelines under Baker Street and a portion of the Site, one of which was subsequently abandoned. (FAC \u00b6 20(c).) Golden Eagle and its parent Ultramar, or successors ENI, Valero, or NuStar owned and operated a six-inch and an eight-inch pipeline near the Site, that were used to transport naphtha and other materials to the Golden Eagle refinery. (FAC \u00b6 20(d).) Plains owned and was responsible for a six-inch pipeline commonly referred to as Line 52 used to transmit refined gasoline and crude oil. (FAC \u00b6 20(e).) Union Oil owned and operated three separate lines running under Baker Street on or near the Site. (FAC \u00b6 20(f).) Finally, General Exploration owned or operated a four-inch pipeline that has been abandoned running under Baker Street near the Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FAC \u00b6 20(g).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs use the Site to distribute crude oil and petroleum products that they sell to their customers. (FAC \u00b6 28.) Plaintiffs acquired its interest at the Site on or about June 1, 2013, when it purchased pipelines from BP Pipelines (North American), Inc., Atlantic Richfield Company, and ARCO Terminal Services Corporation (collectively, \"BP\"). (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30.) On or about September 18, 2014, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (\"Regional Board\") issued Cleanup and Abatement Order No. R4-2013-0064 pursuant to California Water Code section 13304, which required BP to investigate and remediate contaminants in the subsurface of the Site. (FAC \u00b6 30.) This Order alleges that three pipelines formerly owned by BP and acquired by Plaintiffs in 2013, numbered 32, 34, and 252, are a \"gasoline source\" and are responsible for a discharge of benzene and other contaminants at the Site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs contend that these contaminants come from Defendants' Pipelines. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs have investigated and now claim that they have \"found a lack of sufficient credible evidence that [their] pipelines are a viable source responsible for the benzene at the Site.\" (FAC \u00b6 33.) In addition, Plaintiffs aver that Line 252 has never run beneath the relevant portions of Baker Street or Golden Avenue and, therefore, cannot be a cause of any contaminants at the Site. (FAC \u00b6 34.) According to Plaintiffs' investigation, they allege that the contamination at the Site is attributable to products that Defendants' Pipelines carried, including gasoline, naphtha, crude oil, diesel fuel, wastes, and industrial solvents. (FAC \u00b6 35.) Due to Defendants' conduct, Plaintiffs aver that they have had to incur numerous expenses investigating and remediating the Site's contamination despite the lack of credible evidence that Plaintiffs or their pipelines caused the contamination. (FAC \u00b6 40.) According to Plaintiffs, though the Regional Board was aware that Defendants' Pipelines were in the area, they have generally refused to investigate or hold any of the Defendants liable for their contribution to the contamination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FAC \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, on September 16, 2016, Plaintiffs initiated this action by filing a Complaint in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 1.) In February 2017, Defendants filed three Motions to Dismiss all or part of Plaintiffs' Complaint. (Dkt. Nos. 40, 45, 50.) Rather than oppose Defendants' Motions, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") on February 16, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC.) Plaintiffs' FAC alleges ten causes of action: (1) Cost Recovery pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21) (against LACSD only); (2) declaratory relief under CERCLA (against LACSD only); (3) contribution (against all Defendants except LACSD); (4) declaratory relief (against all Defendants except LACSD); (5) equitable indemnity (against all Defendants except\n   LACSD); (6) trespass (against all Defendants except LACSD); (7) private nuisance (against all Defendants except LACSD); (8) public nuisance (against all Defendants except LACSD); (9) nuisance\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (against all Defendants except LACSD); and, (10) violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200 (the \"UCL\") (against all Defendants except LACSD). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 49-103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 2, 2017, the Moving Defendants filed their 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 63), along with a Request for Judicial Notice, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64 (hereinafter, \"RJN\") ). The next day, they filed their amended Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Getty MTD.) On March 9, 2017, Plains filed its 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plains MTD.) On March 20, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Oppositions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 69, (hereinafter, \"Getty Opp'n\"), 70 (hereinafter, \"Plains Opp'n\").) On March 27, 2017, the Moving Defendants replied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. Nos. 71 (hereinafter, \"Getty Reply\"), 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As mentioned above, along with their 12(b)(6) Motion, Defendants filed a Request for Judicial Notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJN.) When deciding a motion to dismiss, a court typically does not look beyond the complaint in order to avoid converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mack v.

Notwithstanding this precept, when deciding a motion to dismiss, a court may properly consider: (1) material which is included as part of the complaint; (2) documents incorporated by reference into the complaint; and, (3) material subject to judicial notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plains MTD at 8-11.) In response, Plaintiffs contend that the Moving Defendants' Motion is premature, because Plaintiffs intend to add OOI as an additional defendant and to bring federal CERCLA claims, federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") claims, as well as the same state law claims against OOI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plains Opp'n at 16.) Thus, according to Plaintiffs, \"because the same common nucleus of operative facts will apply to both the federal and state law claims against OOI, the calculus for whether state law issues will predominate in this action will necessarily be altered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court finds that, in this case, the state law claims do not predominate over Plaintiffs' CERCLA claims.

In 1983, the Yolo County Health Department (\"YCHD\") discovered hazardous agricultural chemical residue in pits on property called the \"Frontier Site.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Over the next several years, the YCHD, the California Superior Court, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the State Department of Toxic Substances Control (the \"Department\") issued multiple cleanup orders, with which the property owners failed to comply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 1991, the Department filed suit against the owners of the Frontier Site, seeking (1) cost recovery under CERCLA, and, (2) injunctive relief under the California Hazardous Substances Account Act and California nuisance law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On appeal, the property owners argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Department's state law claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit disagreed, explaining that the district court \"had original and exclusive jurisdiction over the CERCLA claim\" and that \"[b]ecause the state claims arise out of the same set of operative facts as the CERCLA claim and involved the same contaminated property, the court also had the power to hear the state law claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Specifically, the court held that \"the state law claims [did] not predominate over the federal claims,\" even though state law provided some remedies that CERCLA did not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

Thus, though Plaintiffs bring state laws claims that have separate remedies, the Ninth Circuit has found that such claims do not necessarily substantially predominate over CERCLA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs' CERCLA and state law claims arise from the same event-the contamination of the Site. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plains MTD at 5.) While the Moving Defendants argue that the scope of the claims is different, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plains MTD at 8-9), the Court disagrees. All of Plaintiffs' claims seek the same principal relief-a finding of liability against various alleged tortfeasors for the contamination at the Site. Though Plaintiffs' CERCLA claims against LACSD may involve contamination arising from specific LACSD-owned pipelines that allegedly carried wastewater containing benzene and Plaintiffs' state law claims against the Moving Defendants involve additional pipelines and other potential contaminates, the scope of the claims is similar: whether Defendants' Pipelines have caused contamination at the Site and, therefore, are liable to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Moving Defendants note that Plaintiffs' nuisance claims require proof of whether Defendants' alleged conduct has \"resulted in adverse impacts to the adjacent community\"; that Plaintiffs' nuisance\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   claims requires proof that Defendants' Pipelines have violated various statutes or regulations; and, that Plaintiffs' UCL claim addresses whether Defendants have gained an unfair business advantage by avoiding the costs of environmental compliance. (Plains MTD at 8-9.) Nonetheless, the Court finds that these additional requirements do not indicate that Plaintiffs' state law claims\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   predominate over their CERCLA claims. As the court held in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , where Plaintiffs' claims share a common element of proof, the state law claims do not necessarily substantially predominate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510056\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/985/168/#p172\">\n    985 F.2d at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs' CERCLA claims require Plaintiffs to establish that LACSD owned and operated a vessel or facility, disposed hazardous substances, and that the release of those hazardous substances \"cause[d] the incurrence of response costs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Moreover, as addressed above, the Ninth Circuit has held that despite the availability of additional remedies under state law, state law claims do not necessarily substantially predominate over CERCLA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B &amp; R Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20F.3d%20634\">\n    29 F.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Thus, the Court finds that while Plaintiffs may be entitled to slightly more expansive remedies based on its state law claims, this factor alone does not require the Court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds there are two additional reasons supporting the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in this case. First, even if Plaintiffs' state law claims substantially predominated over their CERCLA claims, the Court \"would retain jurisdiction based on the 'values of economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20F.3d%20634\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Where, as here, Plaintiffs are seeking indemnity from various defendants based on one alleged injury, it would be inefficient and inconvenient to have two courts in different jurisdictions determine the scope of each defendant's\n   fault. And, as Plaintiffs note, because they are required to bring their CERCLA claims in federal court, if the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims, both this Court and the state court would be required to determine each Defendants' fault without all Defendants present to defend themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plains Opp'n at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, though still speculative at this stage, Plaintiffs indicate that they intend to join OOI as a Defendant in this action and to bring both federal and state law claims against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plains Opp'n at 21.) This representation also supports the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in this case. It would be judicially inefficient and burdensome to OOI to require Plaintiffs to bring their federal claims against OOI in this forum but to bring their state law claims based on the same conduct in a different forum. Further, once the Court is addressing Plaintiffs' state law claims as to OOI, it would be entirely duplicative to require a second court to determine the same state law claims based on the same injury against different Defendants. Therefore, in sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' state law claims do \"not so substantially predominate as to justify the judicial inefficiency that would result if this Court were to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Competitive Techs. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) The Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state viable contribution claim against them because the Plaintiffs and the Moving Defendants are not \"co-obligors\" who are jointly liable for the\n   Site's contamination. (Getty MTD at 5-6.) The Moving Defendants' raise three arguments. First, the Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege that Plaintiffs themselves are obligors under the Order because they \"allege that they are not responsible for contamination at the Site.\" (Getty MTD at 5-6.) Second, they argue that Plaintiffs are not obligors under the terms of the Order because the Regional Board ordered BP to cleanup and remediate the Site-not Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Getty MTD at 6.) Third, they argue that, regardless, the Moving Defendants are not obligors because they have never been required to participate in the cleanup or remediation of the Site. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Getty MTD at 6; Getty Reply at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court finds the Moving Defendants' third argument persuasive.

First, the Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that they have possession of the Site. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Getty MTD at 7-8.) Plaintiffs allege that they \"maintain[ ] easements, permits, rights of way, or franchise agreements to control, use, and operate the Site.\" (FAC \u00b6 28.) An easement holder has a possessory interest in the land over which the easement lies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v.

The Moving Defendants misconstrue a trespass claim's requirements. To constitute a trespass, \"[t]he interference need not take the form of a personal entry onto the property by the wrongdoer,\" but, instead, may include such forms of intrusion as \"ginning lint, cement dust, and even invisible particles of fluoride compounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Elton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4671326\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/50/1301/#p1306\">\n    50 Cal.

Plaintiffs aver that it is with their use and enjoyment of these possessory interests that the Moving Defendants' alleged trespass has interfered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 82.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded facts indicating that the Moving Defendants' alleged release of toxic or hazardous materials constitute trespass.

California Civil Code section 4379 defines a nuisance, in relevant part, as \"[a]nything which is injurious to health, including, but not limited to, the illegal sale of control substances, or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203479\">\n    Cal.

Thus, the Court assumes at this stage that Plaintiffs were transferred the ownership interest in the relevant pipelines and the cleanup duties associated with them prior to the Order's issuance.

But Plaintiffs' allege that they have the ability to \"control, use, and operate the Site.\" (FAC \u00b6 28.) Thus, it appears that Plaintiffs are alleging a broader interest in the Site than that understood by the Moving Defendants. At this stage, the Court assumes the truth of Plaintiff's allegations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Twombly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     550 U.S. at 589\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1955\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Whether conduct is sufficiently \"substantial\" and \"unreasonable\" are questions of fact that must \"be determined by the trier of fact in each case in the light of all the circumstances of that case.\"\n    <em>\n     San Diego Gas &amp; Elec.
