The motions are fully briefed. On July 17, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion. For the reasons discussed below, Gooding's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part, and Piper's preliminary injunction motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case involves a dispute over the ownership of a rare 1954 Ferrari (\"the Ferrari\"). Piper's father, James, purchased the Ferrari in 1962, had it restored in 1982, and won Most Elegant Sports car at the Pebble Beach Concours d'El\u00e9gance in August 1989. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.) Following the Concours d'El\u00e9gance, a potential buyer offered James $1.7 million for the Ferrari. (\u00b6 16.) He declined to sell it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also in 1989, James moved to Mexico and became romantically involved with Maria Socorro De Rodriguez La Pine (\"Socorro\"). (\u00b6 17.) On September 19, 1989, James died, purportedly from heart complications. (\u00b6\u00b6 18, 79-80.) Because James' body was immediately cremated, further investigation into his cause of death was impossible. At the time of James' death he still owned the Ferrari. (\u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Soon after James' death, Socorro advised Piper that she was taking steps to protect James' assets for distribution to the family. (\u00b6 20.) Socorro represented to Piper that James had hired an attorney to transfer title of his Ferraris, including the 1954 Ferrari, into a holding entity for the benefit of Piper and his siblings. (\u00b6 87.) Piper met with James' attorney and orally authorized the transfer of the Ferraris to the holding entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 88-89.) Piper, however, never received documentation confirming the transfer. (\u00b6\u00b6 89-90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unbeknownst to Piper, Socorro was suspected of murdering several prior love interests and dispossessing the decedents of their assets. (\u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Despite being unaware of this fact, Piper began to suspect that Socorro was involved in his father's death and confronted her. (\u00b6 90.) After being confronted by Piper, Socorro vanished. Piper was left with no information concerning the whereabouts of the Ferrari, as James and Socorro, the two people possessing that information, suddenly were gone. (\u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In fact, the Ferrari was being stored in an empty shop next to Francorchamps of America, Inc. (\"FAI\"), the same company that restored the Ferrari in 1982. (\u00b6\u00b6 102-04.) The Ferrari remained in FAI's empty shop until 1991, at which time Socorro sold the vehicle to Robert Butler. (\u00b6\u00b6 106-07.) Butler purchased the Ferrari for $300,000.00, less than twenty percent of the market value just two years prior. (\u00b6 107.) Rod Drew, the owner of FAI, was unaware of the allegations against Socorro until after she sold the Ferrari. (\u00b6 109.) In 1995, Butler listed the Ferrari for sale, mislabeling it a 1955. (\u00b6 117.) Butler then sold the Ferrari for $150,000.00 to Todd Morici. (\u00b6 118.) Morici, in turn, sold the Ferrari to Defendant Falcon Woods LLC (\"Falcon Woods\"). (\u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Piper intermittently searched for the Ferrari, including discussing with the FBI the possibility that his father was murdered and the vehicle stolen. (\u00b6 22.) It was not until December 2017 that Piper discovered information advertising the vehicle for sale at auction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gooding, on behalf of Falcon Woods, planned to auction the Ferrari in Scottsdale, Arizona on January 20, 2018, for an estimated price between $1.6 million and $2 million. (\u00b6\u00b6 140, 155.) Gooding's provenance for the Ferrari contained multiple errors, including that James sold the vehicle in 1991, two years after his death, and that he initially acquired it in 1982. (\u00b6\u00b6 141, 143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 18, 2018, Piper visited Gooding's auction, viewed the Ferrari, and confirmed that it was his father's. (\u00b6\u00b6 159-60.) That same day, Piper presented Gooding's in-house counsel with notice of his claim to the Ferrari. (\u00b6 161.) On January 19, 2018, Gooding placed a notice on the vehicle, informing potential purchasers that it was processing a new title. (\u00b6\u00b6 126, 162.) On January 20, 2018, the Ferrari was withdrawn from auction. (\u00b6 169.) On January 23, 2018, Piper filed his verified complaint and application for temporary restraining order application. (\u00b6 171.) Piper's complaint alleges seven claims, including: (1) conversion; (2) trespass to chattels; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) civil conspiracy; (5) violations of the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (6) violations of Arizona's RICO statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2314 ; and (7) replevin of the Ferrari.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gooding argues that each of Piper's tort claims (conversion, trespass to chattels, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy) fail because Falcon Woods has superior title as a result of Socorro conveying good title to the Ferrari. Gooding also argues that Piper's federal and state RICO claims should be dismissed for failure to properly allege a pattern of racketeering activity or the requisite level of continuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Tort Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Assuming, as Piper alleges, that Socorro wrongfully acquired the Ferrari, Gooding argues that Falcon Woods nonetheless has superior title for three independent reasons. (Doc. 70 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Gooding asserts that Socorro conveyed good title under California's innocent purchaser defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a general rule, \"[t]he possessor of stolen goods has void rather than voidable title, and therefore cannot convey good title ... regardless of how innocently the goods were acquired by him.\"\n   <em>\n    Suburban Motors, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

But under California's innocent purchaser defense,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    Cal. Com. Code \u00a7 2403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), an innocent purchaser for value, without actual or constructive notice that his vendor has secured the vehicle by a fraudulent purchase, may take good title.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The law distinguishes between a purchaser whose vendor obtained title by fraud and a purchaser whose vendor obtained title by theft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    Cal. Com. Code \u00a7 2403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ;\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.

Gooding argues that, at most, the allegations in the complaint support that Socorro procured the Ferrari by fraud rather than theft, that Butler was a good faith purchaser without notice, and that the innocent purchaser defense applies. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Piper has alleged sufficient facts that, if true, plausibly prevent application of the innocent purchaser defense. According to the complaint, Piper and his siblings, as the only heirs to James' estate, inherited the Ferrari through intestate succession. Absent from the complaint is any allegation that Piper was defrauded into selling Socorro the Ferrari or authorizing her to transfer ownership of it. Nevertheless,\n   Socorro sold the Ferrari. Accordingly, the Court finds that Piper has sufficiently alleged that Socorro obtained the Ferrari by theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Gooding argues that because Piper is not entitled \"to the benefit of the common law rule that a thief cannot pass title to stolen property\" because he failed to \"utilize provisions of law that would protect his interest\" in the Ferrari. (Doc. 70 at 11.) Gooding contends that Piper fails to allege that he filed a police report \"put[ting] the public on constructive notice of [his] purported rights[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) For support, Gooding cites California Civil Code \u00a7 3543, which provides that \"[w]here one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened, must be the sufferer.\" California, however, has refused to apply \u00a7 3543 to cases where criminal conduct, such as theft, is the proximate cause of the injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   a party is not bound in transactions of this character either to anticipate or take precaution against the commission of a crime by which another may be deceived; that is where it is through the instrumentality of a criminal act that the wrong is accomplished, it is the crime, and not the negligent act, which is the proximate cause of injury; and in such a case the maxim that where one of two innocent persons must suffer from the wrongful act of another, the loss must fall upon the one making the act possible, has no application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Nathe v. Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4473484\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/75/682/#p686\">\n    75 Cal.

Here, because Piper has sufficiently alleged that Socorro stole the Ferrari-whether by theft or fraud- \u00a7 3543 does not require dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lastly, Gooding contends that \"because [Piper] does not assert the existence of a proceeding under California Probate Code \u00a7 255 (the Slayer Statute) as of 1991 (when Butler acquired the Ferrari), Socorro's being the alleged murderer of James[ ] would have no effect on her ability to transfer title as an heir of Piper.\" (Doc. 70 at 13.) This argument fails because, according to the complaint, Socorro was not James' surviving spouse for purposes of probate because the two never legally married.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to these arguments, which are common to all of Piper's tort claims, Gooding raises additional defenses to each tort claim under the assumption that Socorro failed to transfer good title and that Piper is the rightful owner of the Ferrari. The Court discusses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Simonian v.

The Court disagrees. The\n   <em>\n    Simonian\n   </em>\n   court held that a defendant incurs no liability by acting as a \"mere conduit\" in transferring items if he derives no personal gain from the transfer and delivers the items pursuant to the bailment before \"notice of the rights of the real owner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20722\">\n    at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As alleged, Gooding stands to financially gain from its bailment agreement and was on notice of Piper's\n   ownership interest while still in possession of the vehicle.

The Court heard testimony that James purchased the Ferrari in 1962, owned it as of his death on September 19, 1989, and died without a will. Defendants' argument that plaintiff was not the owner turned on a Louisiana Certificate of Title (\"Louisiana Title\"), reflecting that V-Twelve, not James, owned the Ferrari as of September 12, 1989-a week prior to James' death (Doc. 74-1 at 8-9)-Piper cast significant doubt on the veracity of the Louisiana Title. A \"duplicate\" copy of the title, not the original, was offered in evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing. Because of the inaccuracies contained on the face of this title, a question exists as to the original's authenticity. For instance, the Louisiana Title wrongly states the year, color, and mileage of the Ferrari. Even if the title is admitted in to evidence at trial, it might be of little or no evidentiary value, because the inaccuracies and inconsistencies on its face suggest it is a forgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court also finds that Piper's presentation of evidence raises serious questions as to the applicability of the innocent purchaser defense. For instance, there is evidence that the original buyer, Butler, knew or should have known that the vehicle was stolen given that it was sold for a fraction of the market price for a Ferrari recently crowned most elegant sports car at the Concours de El\u00e9gance. Moreover, there is evidence that the vehicle's vendor, Socorro, obtained the Ferrari by theft and not fraudulent purchase. For instance, the Ferrari's Louisiana Title had\n   multiple errors indicative of a fabricated title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suburban Motors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2016\">\n    268 Cal.Rptr. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]here is no authority for [the] contention that section 2403 validates a second chain of title to an automobile spuriously created after it has been stolen.\"). The evidence also suggests that Socorro lacked authority to sell the Ferrari on behalf of the heirs or V-Twelve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to irreparable harm and balancing of the hardships, the Court finds that Piper has met his burden. Although some equivocal evidence and representations by Piper's counsel suggests that Piper might eventually sell the Ferrari, this point is not definitively established. To the extent that Piper intends to keep the vehicle because of its sentimental value, monetary damages are an inadequate remedy. In comparison, Falcon Woods represented at the hearing and in its papers that it plans to retain possession of the vehicle until, at the earliest, completion of this suit. (Doc. 72 at 35 \u00b6 11.) As such, issuance of a preliminary injunction merely requires Falcon Woods to do what it has stated it already intends. Finally, Piper has demonstrated that a genuine public interest supports the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Specifically, there is a \"public interest in preventing the transport and sale of stolen vehicles.\" (Doc. 74 at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Having considered each of the factors required for a preliminary injunction, the Court concludes that Piper has made an adequate showing as to all four prongs. Accordingly, his request for a preliminary injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Gooding's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 70) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   . Piper's RICO claims, Count V and VI, are dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Piper's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 74) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   1.

Defendants must not sell, promise, pledge, or otherwise lien or encumber the Ferrari.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Although not in the complaint, evidence was presented at the July 17, 2018 hearing that the name of this entity was V-Twelve, Ltd.

(Doc. 70 at 13.) The Court disagrees. Under California law, \"a sale by the thief\n    <em>\n     or any other person claiming under the thief\n    </em>\n    does not vest any title in the purchaser as against the owner, though the sale was made in the ordinary course of trade and the purchaser acted in good faith.\"\n    <em>\n     Suburban Motors\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2016\">\n     268 Cal.Rptr. at 19\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Because the Arizona and federal statutes are analogous, Arizona courts look to federal interpretations of the RICO statute for guidance.\n    <em>\n     Lifeflite Med.

Ariz. 2006). The Court will limit its analysis to Piper's conversion claim, both because the parties' briefs focus predominately on that claim and because the Court finds sufficiently serious questions go to the merits of it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
