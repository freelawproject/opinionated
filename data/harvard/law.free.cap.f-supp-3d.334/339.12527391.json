MICHAEL HARVEY, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The dispute in this diversity case arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred in the District of Columbia on September 18, 2016. A car driven by John Albert Summers, a resident of the District of Columbia, crossed over the center line on Minnesota Avenue, N.E., first striking another motor vehicle before impacting a car being driven by Plaintiff, a Maryland resident. Seeking compensation for injuries she alleges she sustained during the accident, Plaintiff filed this action claiming Summers' negligence caused the action. Believing that the $25,000 of liability coverage under Summers' automobile insurance policy would be insufficient to compensate her for her injuries, Plaintiff also brought suit under a contract theory against her own automobile insurer, CSAA General Insurance Company, pursuant to the underinsured motorist (UIM) provisions of her policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Last January, Summers admitted liability for the accident, and his insurer tendered the policy limits of his policy in exchange for the release of him and his wife\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from this action. Dkt. 22. Thus, the only remaining defendant is CSAA. A jury trial in this matter is scheduled to begin on September 25, 2018. As Summers' liability for the accident has been established, the only issue for the jury to determine is the nature and extent of Defendant's injuries caused by the collision, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently pending before the Court is CSAA's motion in limine seeking to exclude from trial any evidence or reference to (1) the UIM coverage limits of Plaintiff's policy with CSAA, or, for that matter, (2) CSAA's contractual relationship with Plaintiff. Dkt. 25 at 1. Plaintiff conceded at the pretrial conference that she will not seek to introduce or make reference to any coverage limits at trial-whether to the limits of her own UIM coverage or of Summers' automobile liability policy-but opposes Defendant's request that no mention be made at trial concerning her contract for UIM insurance that she purchased from CSAA. Dkt. 26 at 2; Dkt. 30 at 2 n.1. The issues are fully briefed\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and oral argument was held on the motion at the September 4, 2018 pretrial conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below and at the pretrial conference, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Arguably the relief sought in Defendant's motion does not require the application of state substantive law but only of federal \"procedural\" law, i.e., the Federal Rules of Evidence and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The distinction matters because of the \"broad command\" of\n   <em>\n    Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins\n   </em>\n   that when federal courts sit pursuant to their diversity jurisdiction they are \"to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanna v.

But neither party argues for the straightforward application of the Federal Rules of Evidence or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to resolve the contested issue in Defendant's motion, nor have they conducted the\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   analysis that would determine whether federal \"procedural\" law should apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burke v.

Cir. 2012) (\"The Supreme Court has evolved a set of tests to determine whether a law is substantive or procedural for\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   purposes.\"). In any event, the complexities of the\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   issue need not be addressed here because, as discussed further below, application of either state or federal law leads to the same result with respect to the issues raised in the motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As to which state's law to apply, the parties are in disagreement. When Summers was dismissed from this matter in January, Defendant CSAA and Plaintiff agreed that Maryland law applies in this case with respect to issues involving Plaintiff's UIM claim. Dkt. 22 at 2, n.1 (\"All parties hereto agree that since plaintiff was a Maryland insured who had in effect a Maryland policy of insurance at the time of the subject collision, that Maryland law applies to the underinsured procedures involved herein.\"). Seemingly retreating from that position, Defendant now seeks application of District of Columbia law to its motion in limine. Dkt. 25 at 2. Consistent with the parties' prior stipulation, Plaintiff seeks application of Maryland law. Dkt. 28 at 4-8; Dkt. 30 at 2-3. However, the parties' disagreement is largely academic. Under D.C.'s choice-of-law rules,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a court need not determine which of the competing jurisdiction's law to apply unless it first determines that a relevant conflict in fact exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v.

Dkt. 25 at 2. That is in fact what D.C. law requires. Where there is no D.C. common law on point, the courts of this jurisdiction are instructed to \"look to the law of Maryland for guidance\" because D.C. common law is based on Maryland common law.\n   <em>\n    Conesco Indus., Ltd. v.

Even if relevant, the Court finds that this evidence would be unduly prejudicial, misleading, and confusing to a jury ....\"). As these cases hold, the amount of insurance coverage has no bearing on the jury's consideration of issues of either liability or damages, and \"establishing the availability of a sum certain [of insurance coverage] is likely to distort a jury verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035458\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/182/\">\n    553 A.2d at 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, the first basis of Defendant's motion in limine will be granted, and the parties will be precluded from mentioning at trial any insurance coverage limits that may be related to this matter, including the limits associated with Plaintiff's UIM policy and with Summers' automobile insurance policy. For the same reason, and with the parties' consent, the parties will not be permitted to introduce into evidence the declaration page of the UIM insurance policy which reflects the coverage limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Relationship as Defendant's UIM Insured\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for the disputed issue raised in the motion in limine, it is important to clarify what Defendant is seeking and what it is not. It is not requesting to appear anonymously before the jury. Rather, it concedes that it may be identified at trial by its name, as the defendant, and as an insurance carrier that \"may be liable for the Plaintiff's damages if it is found that the Plaintiff was injured and that her damages were cause by the [automobile\n   accident at issue].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 25 at 3 n.10; Dkt. 27 at 2, n.4. Defendant objects, however, to any mention of its \"contractual relationship\" with Plaintiff or that the operative coverage is UIM insurance-a fact which Defendant believes is tantamount to conveying to the jury that it has a direct contractual relationship with Plaintiff given that UIM coverage is \"first-party\" insurance purchased by automobile owners to cover accidents with underinsured motorists. Dkt. 25 at 1; Dkt. 27 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its motion, Defendant confirms that it will not dispute at trial that Plaintiff had an operative CSAA automobile policy at the time of the accident that included UIM coverage, or that she has \"complied with the contractual prerequisites of the policy.\" Dkt. 25 at 2. Thus, the only issues relevant for the jury's consideration, according to Defendant, are causation and the amount of Plaintiff's damages, issues about which Defendant claims the parties' contractual relationship sheds no light. Dkt. 25 at 3; Dkt. 27 at 1. Defendant's motion is motivated by its belief that disclosure of its contractual relationship with Plaintiff at trial may focus the jury on its \"alleged[ ] refus[al] to pay a claim brought by its own insured\" rather than on the cause of Plaintiff's injuries if any, and the quantum of her damages. Dkt. 25 at 3; Dkt. 27 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant's motion is properly denied under federal, D.C., or Maryland law. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 411, \"[e]vidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible\n   <em>\n    to prove whether the person acted negligently\n   </em>\n   .\" Fed. R. Evid. 411 (emphasis added). Here, however, any potential recovery against Defendant arises from the parties' insurance contract, not from the underlying claim of negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiknadze v. Sonneman\n   </em>\n   , No. 1490, Sept.

App. April 12, 2016) (\"A UIM claim is brought by a plaintiff against his or her\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   first party insurer for a\n   <em>\n    breach of contract\n   </em>\n   claim.\"). Count II of the complaint-the only count directed at Defendant and the only remaining claim in this case following Summers' settlement-alleges that Summers' carried only minimal liability insurance. Dkt. 2 at 3-4. It then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   at the time of [the automobile accident at issue], ... [Plaintiff's] vehicle[,] was insured by co-defendant AAA insurance, underwritten by CSAA General Insurance Company .... That policy contained, among other things, a provision for Maryland underinsured coverages in the event that the passenger/operator of [Plaintiff's] vehicle sustained damages and losses in excess of an insurance policy which [may be] available to an allegedly responsible defendant to satisfy any judgment which may be rendered in favor of the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...

Thus, Plaintiff is proceeding against Defendant under a contract theory based on the same contract that Defendant seeks to suppress at trial. Try as Defendant may to stipulate away the parties' contractual relationship, it remains foundational to Plaintiff's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That the contract claim may boiled down at trial to whether Plaintiff has sustained a certain quantum of compensable injuries caused by the accident does not alter the fact that her claim is founded on-indeed, it could not exist but for-the UIM coverage that Defendant sold to her.

Jurors should not be left to speculate about why Defendant is being sued rather than Summers, or whether Defendant is Summers' insurance company, Plaintiff's, or someone else's.
