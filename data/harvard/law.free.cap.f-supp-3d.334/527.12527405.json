The United States deleted the following statements from Herrera's confession.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 HERRERA-Cruz stated that FERNANDEZ-Sanes made up the story that he lost his watch at Palomino and went [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] they were in route to retrieve it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 HERRERA-Cruz said that during transport from Palomino to FURA headquarters, FERNANDEZ-Sanes told him not to say anything to the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11773702\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/337/#p340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fern\u00e1ndez argues that these statements \"still 'point[ ] directly' to Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez.\" (Docket No. 86 at p. 4.) The United States, however, deleted these statements from Herrera's statement. The remaining statements do not implicate Fern\u00e1ndez to the extent that severance is appropriate. The United States notes that the conspiracy with which the defendants are charged purportedly involved other individuals not named in the indictment. Herrera's redacted confession neither states nor implies that the \"someone\" to whom Herrera refers is Fern\u00e1ndez.

This prejudice cannot be dispelled by cross-examination if the co-defendant does not take the stand. Limiting instructions to the jury may not in fact erase the prejudice.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n     391 U.S. 123\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1620\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n     20 L.Ed.2d 476\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1968).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court orders the United States to redact the following phrase from Herrera's statement: \"to look for the watch Rolex at the location.\" In a previous section of Herrera's confession, the United States deleted a sentence indicating that Herrera \"agreed to help him to find the Rolex of FERN\u00c1NDEZ-Sanes.\" (Docket No 91 at p. 3.) Fern\u00e1ndez stated to law enforcement officers that he lost his imitation Rolex watch at Palomino Island. (Docket No. 82, Ex. 2 at p. 2.) The redactions must be consistent and minimize reference to Fern\u00e1ndez. The Court modifies only the substance, not the grammar of the United States' proposed redactions. Accordingly, the United States may elicit at trial the following statement: HERRERA-Cruz informed that once arrived to the coast of Palomino Island, he jumped into the water. HERRERA-Cruz stated that once at the coast of Palomino went to relieve himself at the woods and returned to the vessel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Court orders the United States to substitute \"him\" for \"them\" to reflect that the statement refers only to Herrera. The United States may elicit the following statement: HERRERA-Cruz said that [SOMEONE] told him to look for some kilograms of cocaine at Palomino. HERRERA-Cruz stated that he couldn't find the bags, and then be observed the FURA vessel approaching [HIM].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
