TORRES, United States Magistrate Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on William Burrow's (\"Mr. Burrow\"), Oma Louise Burrow's (\"Mrs. Burrow\"), Suzanne M. Bedwell's (\"Mrs. Bedwell\"), and Ernest D. Bedwell's (\"Mr. Bedwell\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") motion to compel Forjas Taurus S.A. (\"Forjas Taurus\") and Braztech International, L.C. (\"Braztech\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") to produce documents previously withheld under a claim of privilege or, in the alternative, to produce to the Court the documents requested for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection. [D.E. 73]. Defendants responded to Plaintiffs' motion on May 24, 2018 [D.E. 74] to which Plaintiffs replied on May 31, 2018. [D.E. 76]. Therefore, Plaintiffs' motion is now ripe for disposition. After careful consideration of the motion, response, reply, relevant authority, and for the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs' motion to compel is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a products-liability case premised on specific revolvers that Forjas Taurus manufactured in Brazil and that Braztech imported into the United States. On February 5, 2014, Mrs. Burrow claims that she dropped her revolver on the ground and-despite the firearm being holstered with its safety latch engaged-it discharged a bullet into her leg. The Bedwells also experienced a drop-fire incident that resulted in a gunshot wound to their minor child. Therefore, Plaintiffs have brought this consolidated action on behalf of all owners of the defective firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion relates to an internal investigation that Defendants conducted after Plaintiffs' firearm expert inspected a revolver. The documents, reports, and other correspondence related to Defendants' investigation form the basis of Plaintiffs' motion. Specifically, Defendants refuse to produce documents related to their internal investigation on the basis that they are protected under the attorney-client privilege, the self-critical analysis privilege, and/or the work product doctrine. While Plaintiffs generally agree that Defendants' privilege logs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   meet the informational requirements for withholding documents, Plaintiffs conclude that Defendants' privilege objections are conclusory and that the items requested should be produced. We will discuss the parties' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      The Work Product Doctrine\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The first issue is whether Defendants may withhold items on the basis of\n   the work-product doctrine. \"The work product doctrine is distinct from and broader than the attorney-client privilege, and it protects materials prepared by the attorney, whether or not disclosed to the client, as well as materials prepared by agents for the attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Fojtasek v.

These documents include engineering reports, photographs, videos, technical drawings, and email correspondence. Defendants withheld these items because they were prepared in anticipation of litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' arguments are misplaced because, even when litigation may be forthcoming, work product protection is unavailable for documents \"that are prepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Adlman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11590705\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/1194/#p1202\">\n    134 F.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1202 (2d Cir. 1998) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 2024, at 346 (\"[E]ven\n   though litigation is already in prospect, there is no work-product immunity for documents prepared in the regular course of business rather than for purposes of the litigation\"). Plaintiffs believe that Defendant had a business purpose to investigate and test their revolvers' safety mechanisms in order to (1) improve the overall performance of the firearms, (2) protect future purchasers of firearms from potential harm, and (3) to avoid or minimize negative publicity in connection with drop-fires and other product failures. Because Defendants performed their investigations without the threat of litigation, Plaintiffs conclude that the records and reports generated therefrom were prepared in the ordinary course of business and may not be withheld under the work product doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Janicker by Janicker v. George Washington Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920592\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/94/648/#p649\">\n    94 F.R.D. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649 (D.D.C. 1982) (\"If in connection with an accident or an event, a business entity in the ordinary course of business conducts an investigation for its own purposes, the resulting investigative report is producible in civil pretrial discovery.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants' response is that Plaintiffs have no knowledge or evidence that any of the items requested were created in the ordinary course of business. Contrary to Plaintiffs' speculations, Defendants claim that the documents withheld were created because of Plaintiffs' threats of litigation and that they cannot lose their protection simply because the items may or may not serve an ancillary business purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Dustin Sroufe at \u00b6 10 (\"The purpose or function of this report and any others drafted after Mr. Bumann notified us of the Burrow dispute, and along with any notes, high-speed videos, and photographs was to assist in, and because of, the defense of this lawsuit. Said another way, we would not have prepared the reports except for the existence of the Burrow dispute and lawsuit.\"); Decl. of Juliano Bisotto at \u00b6 8 (\"These reports and other materials generated in the engineering analysis such as high-speed videography, photographs, notes, computer-aided design drawings, and other technical drawings were all made to assist the companies' lawyers in the U.S. in defense of the Burrow and later Bedwell lawsuits.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants also take issue with Plaintiffs' claim that the Court should invalidate the work product doctrine because of Plaintiffs' substantial need and undue hardship. Defendants argue, for example, that the relevancy of the discovery sought is not the standard to overcome the work product doctrine and that Plaintiffs must do more to compel the documents requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stern v. O'Quinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3910688\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/253/663/#p673\">\n    253 F.R.D. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (\"The findings of relevance ... do not end the Court's inquiry or dictate compulsion of Plaintiff's discovery requests.\"). Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have no evidence that they attempted to obtain the information from another source and that Plaintiffs could readily purchase revolvers on their own to test their allegations of a defect in the Rossi revolvers. Because Plaintiffs' motion contains nothing more than unsubstantiated and unsupported statements, Defendants conclude that Plaintiffs' motion to compel must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After a thorough review of the arguments presented and the relevant authorities, we find that the work-product doctrine cannot foreclose all of the items sought in Plaintiffs' motion. Defendants claim that their internal investigation occurred only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they received a December 28, 2015 letter from Plaintiffs notifying Defendants of a drop-fire incident involving a revolver. Defendants also suggest that they have no standard operating procedures for investigating firearm failures and that the only reason they engaged in\n   any testing of the revolvers was because of a threat of ligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If we accept Defendants' representations as true-that the documents in dispute were created solely because of a litigation threat-the documents may be compelled if Plaintiffs can show (1) that there is a substantial need for the materials in the preparation of their case, and (2) an inability, without an undue hardship, to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. This exception acts as a counterweight to the potentially broad reach of the work product doctrine and prevents it from being used as a tool to thwart good faith discovery efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of Fla. ex rel. Butterworth v. Industrial Chemicals, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7851858\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/145/585/#p588\">\n    145 F.R.D. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (N.D. Fla. 1991). Application of this exception requires a fact-based inquiry into the needs of the party seeking discovery as well as into the hardship that might be avoided by allowing discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before we determine whether the items sought are protected under the work-product doctrine, we must first clarify the difference between factual and opinion work product. The distinction is important because factual work product may sometimes be discoverable whereas opinion work product is almost always not. The Eleventh Circuit has held that the disclosure of factual work product may be compelled upon a requisite showing of substantial need and undue hardship whereas opinion work-product enjoys a nearly absolute immunity. To put it differently, opinion work product is only discoverable in \"very rare and extraordinary circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Admin.

That reasoning is premised on the determination of whether certain types of items-including investigative reports, technical data, photos, and videos-are so unique and essential to the facts of a case that they must be produced. Courts have often compelled the production of\n   <em>\n    photographs\n   </em>\n   and videos because other discovery devices cannot act as an adequate substitute for the unique content found therein.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zoller v.

The same reasoning applies to the facts of this case because-without the documents Plaintiffs seek-there is nothing in the record to suggest that Plaintiffs can acquire the same information or a substantial equivalent thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to whether Plaintiffs have established an undue hardship, Plaintiffs' argument is again well taken. While Plaintiffs retained a firearms expert to inspect the revolvers after their respective drop-fires, it would be difficult-not to mention wasteful-for Plaintiffs to attempt to replicate Defendants' complex investigation when the information sought is readily available. It would also be unnecessarily expensive for Plaintiffs to replicate Defendants' investigation because, while Plaintiffs retained an expert to inspect Plaintiffs' firearms, their lawsuit is not limited to their own guns. Rather, Plaintiffs seek to represent a class action of all owners of Rossi revolvers on\n   the basis that the safety mechanisms are defectively designed and/or manufactured and that Defendants were aware of these defects but failed to take remedial action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Since Defendants have already performed their extensive research using their unique testing protocols, there is no persuasive reason to withhold those items any longer. Plaintiffs lack the facilities, equipment, technology, staffing, and expertise to replicate Defendants' testing and analysis. Plaintiffs have little to no knowledge, when compared to Defendants, of what type of tests Defendants performed, how they were performed, or the results. Because Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial need and an undue hardship, we hold that Defendants' engineering reports, photos, videos, and other technical documents cannot be withheld on the basis of the work product doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      The Self-Critical Analysis Privilege\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The second issue is whether Defendants may withhold documents on the basis of the self-critical analysis privilege (the \"SCA Privilege\").

As the proponent of the privilege, Defendants must show, irrespective of whether one or more lawyers sent or received the communication, that the communication was confidential and that the primary purpose of the communication was to relay, request or transmit legal advice.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     U.S. ex rel.

Because the attorney-client privilege only applies to communications made in confidence, a communication loses its protection if made in the presence of third parties, or disseminated beyond the group of corporate employees \"who have a need to know in the scope of their corporate responsibilities.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Vioxx,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535490\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/501/789/#p811\">\n     501 F.Supp.2d at 796\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Plaintiff is correct that Defendants' prior privilege log contains conclusory descriptions of some of the withheld documents. But the day after Plaintiffs filed their motion to compel, Defendants (1) amended their privilege log to provide better descriptions of the privileged communications, and (2) removed several documents in favor of their production. As the privilege log stands now, there are numerous documents that may or may not be protected under the attorney-client privilege. Only an\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    inspection will be able to resolve the parties' dispute on whether the attorney-client privilege applies to the email communications, memos, and other forms of correspondence on Defendants' privilege log. Therefore, in abundance of caution and to safeguard one of the legal profession's oldest protections between a lawyer and client, Defendants shall produce to the Court all forms of correspondence on their privilege log for an\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    inspection. This will allow the Court to determine whether the materials fall within the confines of the attorney-client privilege.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    As to Defendants' engineering reports, photos, and videos, we are unconvinced that these items fall within the confines of the attorney-client privilege. Defendants suggest on their privilege log that the information cannot be disclosed because it was ultimately sent to their attorneys. But, as the proponent of the privilege, Defendants failed to carry their burden of establishing that it applies to these items. Defendants also failed to rebut Plaintiffs' argument that these items contain nothing more than mere technical information. Indeed, there is no suggestion that \"[t]hese test results and other technical information, taken by themselves, are clearly not privileged.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     Champion Int'l Corp. v.
