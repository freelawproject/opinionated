INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff George Webb Sweigert brings this putative class action against a host of individuals and entities purportedly associated with the Democratic National Party-including Haseeb Rana, the Democratic National Committee (\"the DNC\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   John Podesta, the Podesta Group, Kim Fritts, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, Huma Abedin, and Imran Awan\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -in connection with alleged actions taken by Defendants during the Democratic primaries to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-19. In particular, Mr. Sweigert, an alleged supporter of Bernie Sanders, asserts that Defendants committed fraud and breach of fiduciary duty by, among other things, executing an undisclosed funding agreement with a not-for-profit associated with the\n   Hillary Clinton campaign and by conducting a website-hacking conspiracy to promote Hillary Clinton's candidacy and to diminish the candidacy of Bernie Sanders.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42-43, 52. Defendants Haseeb Rana, the DNC, the Podesta Group, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, Huma Abedin, and Imran Awan each move to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(h)(3), this order applies to all Defendants, not just those who have responded, because no named Defendant bears a causal relation to Mr. Sweigert's alleged injury in fact. And the Court denies as moot four motions filed by Mr. Sweigert, one asking the Court to direct the United States Marshal to serve a Defendant who has now been served, a second requesting a hearing on one of the now-resolved motions to dismiss, a third requesting an order for substituted service on a Defendant, and a fourth seeking summary judgment on claims against one Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the 2016 Presidential election's Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton won the party's nomination over Bernie Sanders and other candidates. Mr. Sweigert, an alleged supporter of Bernie Sanders, claims that he contributed $30 to Bernie Sanders's Presidential campaign,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   donating through ActBlue, a fundraising non-profit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Mr. Sweigert alleges that Defendants orchestrated a hacking and covert funding conspiracy designed to tip the Democratic primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, Mr. Sweigert alleges that the DNC unlawfully favored Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries by signing a \"Joint Funding Agreement,\" or \"pay-to-play\" scheme, without donors' knowledge, amounting to fraud.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 60. According to Mr. Sweigert's complaint, \"[t]he DNC is the formal governing body for the United States Democratic party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Its role is to \"coordinat[e] strategy in support of Democratic Party candidates for local, state, and national\" elections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to the Presidential election, \"the DNC organizes the Democratic National Convention\" in order to \"nominate and confirm a candidate for President.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. At the time of the 2016 Democratic primaries, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, served as the DNC's chairperson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. In its charters and bylaws, Mr. Sweigert alleges, the DNC obliged itself to \"financial fidelity and impartiality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff claims that in August 2015, the DNC executed an agreement with Hillary for America, a not-for-profit affiliated with the Clinton campaign, wherein the DNC ceded \"financial control and substantial management oversight[,] including selection and approval of personnel[,] to Hillary For America.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Plaintiff alleges that the DNC never voluntarily disclosed\n   this alleged agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Consequently, Plaintiff claims, donors continued to contribute without knowing that Hillary for America had \"financial control and management right of refusal ... over the DNC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Aside from the alleged funding agreement, Plaintiff claims that some of the Defendants conspired to orchestrate and, in fact, orchestrated a number of hacking operations against the DNC.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 43-65. In particular, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Glen Simpson (who is the CEO of Fusion GPS) and Imran Awan conspired to hire professional hackers to penetrate the DNC's computer network.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 46. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Imran Awan \"engineered a sophisticated email phishing attack against Bernie Sanders supporters\" using a donation webpage that has a confusingly similar URL to that of the official donation site, and that Mr. Awan used the website to \"rout[e] donations intended for Progressive candidates to bank accounts controlled by [ ] Wasserman Schultz and/or Imran Awan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. Furthermore, according to Plaintiff, some of the Defendants hacked key congressional communications and constituent management systems, such as iConstituent and InterAmerica.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Specifically, Mr. Sweigert alleges that Defendants Deborah Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan, Abid Awan, Hina Alvi, Rao Abbas, Haseeb Rana, Jamal Awan, and Omar Awan were involved in the hacking and that they accessed private communications through DNC servers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff further alleges that using this private information, ARMZ Uranium Company, which Defendant Podesta Group created, sold nuclear fuel and weapons to foreign countries, including Saudi Arabia, to fund Hillary for America.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 59. According to Mr. Sweigert, in the process, Defendant Podesta Group acted as a foreign agent of the Saudi Arabian government but never disclosed this fact to the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. And Mr. Sweigert's complaint alleges that during the period from February 2016 to October 2016, the Podesta Group illegally transferred this information from iConstituent to Defendant Anthony Weiner's laptops.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that some Defendants were involved in an illicit scheme involving individuals or entities in Pakistan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. According to Mr. Sweigert, Defendant Imran Awan sent iPhones and iPads intended only for congressional use to Pakistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Sweigert further asserts that Defendants Imran Awan and Omar Awan created fake employee profiles in a U.S. House of Representatives Human Resources system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Defendants Imran Awan and Hina Alvi then allegedly sent payments from these fake employee profiles to individuals or entities in Pakistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Furthermore, Mr. Sweigert alleges that Defendants Imran Awan, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas participated in \"information bidding\" in Pakistan, trading or selling electronic devices that contained trade secrets belonging to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on these allegations, Mr. Sweigert filed suit in this Court claiming that Defendants committed fraud and breached fiduciary duties owed to Plaintiff and to members of the putative classes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants\n   Haseeb Rana, the DNC, the Podesta Group, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, and Huma Abedin move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Defendants' motions are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) allows a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint, or any portion thereof, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
