Dkt. 1 at 3, 15 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 66). In September 2015, Plaintiff was selected by Amtrak's Chief of Police, Polly Hanson (\"Chief Hanson\"), to spearhead efforts to plan Pope Francis's visit to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Compl. \u00b6 19). This assignment was \"a massive undertaking\" involving coordination between multiple security and law enforcement agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff avers that due to her work on the Papal visit, her \"administrative and operational responsibilities\" were reassigned to another officer at the \"direction of Chief Hanson and APD leadership.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (Compl. \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's role as an Inspector also entailed leading instructional programs for \"external law enforcement partners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 27). This included RailSafe, a two-day outreach program about \"the capabilities of the APD\" and how external law enforcement could \"assist with responding to incidents within [the] APD's jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (Compl. \u00b6 28). From 2014 onward, the RailSafe program was funded by grant money from the United States Security and Transportation Authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 30). Amtrak solicited bids from third-party vendors to implement the program, and ultimately awarded the contract-valued at over $1,000,000-to\n   a security consulting firm, ABS Consulting (\"ABS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the summer of 2015, Plaintiff \"became aware that ABS was involved in fraudulent, or potentially fraudulent activity[,] arising from its work associated with the RailSafe Program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (Compl. \u00b6 33). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that \"ABS was fraudulently submitting claims ... for the work that was actually performed by Amtrak personnel, all under the direction and supervision of Chief Hanson.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Compl. \u00b6 38). ABS allegedly used \"handouts and materials\" prepared by Amtrak staff \"without permission or consent,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (Compl. \u00b6 35), and took credit for presentations and logistical services that \"were led and conducted by Amtrak personnel, not ABS,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 36). Plaintiff further suspected that \"Chief Hanson was directly or indirectly involved, and/or economically benefitting from\" ABS's activity because of her \"close personal relationship\" with Kerry Thomas, the RailSafe project manager at ABS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 (Compl. \u00b6 33). In mid-October 2015, Plaintiff reported these concerns to Amtrak's Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\") and \"request[ed] that the OIG investigate ... Chief Hanson's potential involvement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Compl. \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, shortly thereafter, Chief Hanson subjected her to a series of adverse employment actions in retaliation for her report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-15 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that on or about October 21, 2015, Chief Hanson transferred her to an \"undesirable position of lesser status\"-\"Inspector/Inspection and Audits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45). She further alleges that due to the transfer, she was \"stripped of supervisory duties and administrative staff,\" \"assigned to menial tasks,\" and \"limited\" in her \"exposure to other ranking APD personnel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9-10 (Compl.

In that same conversation, Chief Hanson allegedly \"accused [Plaintiff] of causing problems within Amtrak, and further threatened that [Plaintiff] should resign from the APD or there would be negative consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff avers that on or before December 4, 2015, Chief Hanson gave her a negative performance review, stating that Plaintiff \"[d]id [n]ot [m]eet [c]ommitments\" for \"4 of the 9 Smart Goals set forth on [her] Performance Evaluation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (Compl. \u00b6 53). The review, however, did not account for Plaintiff's special assignment to the Papal visit or the reassignment of her operational duties during that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (Compl. \u00b6 57). Plaintiff alleges that \"Chief Hanson's negative ratings ... precluded [her] from receiving any promotion, salary increase[,] or monetary award at the end of the fiscal year,\" and \"derailed\" her career advancement at Amtrak.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (Compl. \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that on or about March 9, 2016, she was informed that Chief Hanson had filed an \"Internal Affairs Complaint\" against her, accusing her of making false statements \"in the self-evaluation section of her 2015 Performance Review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62). This complaint was later dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (Compl. \u00b6 68). Plaintiff nevertheless asserts that \"the mere filing of [the complaint] [had] negative consequences\" and \"impede[d] her future employment opportunities and advancement at Amtrak.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (Compl. \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result of these \"harassing, retaliatory, and deliberate actions,\" Plaintiff alleges\n   that she \"was constructively discharged by Amtrak on July 1, 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (Compl. \u00b6 66). She subsequently filed this suit, alleging a claim for retaliation in violation of the FCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), and seeking damages, attorney's fees, and other \"relief as provided by the False Claims Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 16, 18 (Compl. \u00b6 71, Prayer).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Plaintiff cannot state a claim for relief under the FCA against Amtrak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Text\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties agree that the plain language of the Reform Act expressly provides that Amtrak \"shall not be subject to title 31.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 24301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). They disagree, however, whether this exemption includes the FCA, which is codified in title 31. According to Plaintiff, \u00a7 24301(a)(3) is ambiguous because it \"collides with the literal command\" of the FCA, Dkt. 9 at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Montana v.

Plaintiff also argues that giving effect to the plain meaning of \u00a7 24301(a)(3)\"would yield an 'odd result' \" because it would \"require this Court to believe that Congress ... agree[d] to provide money from its Federal coffers [to Amtrak] without any recourse ... should a fraud be perpetrated.\" Dkt. 9 at 11, 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Engine Mfrs.

There are multiple safeguards. To begin, as Amtrak acknowledges, it is subject to the Inspector General Act of 1978. Dkt. 11 at 8 (citing 5 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 8G(a)(2) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp. v. Ass'n of Am.

That Act charges Amtrak with maintaining an OIG to \"prevent[ ] and detect[ ] fraud and abuse in ... [Amtrak's] programs and operations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 4(a)(3). Furthermore, Plaintiff-or any other individual-could have sought redress for the alleged fraud perpetrated by ABS under the FCA. As the D.C. Circuit made clear in\n   <em>\n    Totten I\n   </em>\n   , the Reform Act does not preclude a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action against ABS, a third-party contractor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940739,3698567\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/542/\">\n    286 F.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Federal Railroad Safety Act (\"FRSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , specifically addresses the type of retaliation alleged here. The FRSA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A railroad carrier ... may not discharge, demote, suspend, reprimand, or in any other way discriminate against an employee if such discrimination is due, in whole or in part, to the employee's lawful, good faith act done ... to provide information ... [to] a Federal, State, or local regulatory or law enforcement agency (including an office of the Inspector General under the Inspector General Act of 1978 ....)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). And the statute also provides a remedy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   An employee who alleges discharge, discipline, or other discrimination in violation of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section [delineating protected forms of whistleblowing], may seek relief in accordance with the provisions of this section,\n   with any petition or other request for relief under this section to be initiated by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20109(d)(1).

But, even beyond that, Plaintiff's argument is unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff contends-without specific citation-that the Reform Act's legislative history demonstrates that it \"was not intended to preclude a private individual's claim for retaliation under the FCA, but merely to free Amtrak from the restrictions of a mixed-corporation company.\" Dkt. 9 at 12. To be sure, the legislative history of the Reform Act does reflect that Congress intended to \"eliminat[e] [f]ederal micromanagement of Amtrak's operations,\" H.R. Rep. No. 105-251, at 13 (1997), and to allow the carrier to \"operate as much like a private business as possible,\" S. Rep. No. 105-85, at 1 (1997).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Totten I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940739,3698567\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/542/\">\n    286 F.3d at 549-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the legislative history of the particular provision at issue here, \u00a7 24301(a)(3), is far from illuminating. The House Report merely reflects that Congress intended to \"remove[ ] Amtrak from the Government Corporations Act.\" H.R. Rep. No. 105-251, at 34 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Totten I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940739,3698567\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/542/\">\n    286 F.3d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 24301(a)(3), however, \"plainly does more than\" that, \"and must be construed accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Totten I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940739,3698567\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/542/\">\n    286 F.3d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Amtrak argues that had Congress intended to subject it to the FCA, Congress could have amended the FCA after the D.C.

No. 111-10, at 10 (2009). This subsequent legislative action, however, does not rise to the level of a ratification of the interpretation of \u00a7 24301(a)(3) set forth in\n   <em>\n    Totten I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Ass'n of Reptile Keepers, Inc. v.

Nevertheless, given the plain language of the Reform Act and the absence of any compelling reason to discount that text or the D.C.
