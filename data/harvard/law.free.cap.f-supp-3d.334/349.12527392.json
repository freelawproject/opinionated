The kits allow patients on blood-thinning medication to monitor their blood's clotting time at home rather than traveling to a hospital or clinic. The eight Defendants all supply these kits to patients and get reimbursed through Medicare. However, Defendants only provide kits to patients who test two to four times per month. According to Relator, this business practice of requiring two to four monthly tests as a precondition to providing kits induces doctors to order medically unnecessary tests. Thus, Defendants run afoul of the FCA because they get reimbursed by Medicare for tests they know are not medically necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After hearing and careful consideration, the motions to dismiss by Roche Health Solutions, Inc. (\"Roche\") (Dkt. No. 57), U.S. Healthcare Supply, LLC (\"USHS\") (Dkt. No. 87), Patient Home Monitoring, Inc. (\"PHM\") (Dkt. No. 91), and mdINR, LLC (\"mdINR\") (Dkt.

The Court takes no action on the motion to dismiss filed by Tambra Investments, Inc. (\"Tambra\") (Dkt. No. 101), as the case against it has been stayed. Dkt. No. 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the First Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 17) (\"FAC\") and attached documents, with all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of Relator. Allegations focused on specific Defendants are discussed later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Relator, Warfarin, and Blood Testing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Relator James Allen is a 70-year-old former Marine who lives in western New York. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 32, 39. Since 2010, Allen has taken the blood-thinner warfarin to treat atrial fibrillation and depressed left ventricle function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 33, 73. Because warfarin affects the blood's ability to\n   clot, patients taking it must regularly monitor how long it takes for their blood to clot to ensure it remains within an acceptable range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 74-78. The correct range varies based on the condition being treated and each patient's reaction to specific doses of the drug. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 76-78. Therefore, testing is typically more frequent at the outset of a warfarin regimen. FAC \u00b6 78. Once a proper dosage is determined and the patient stabilizes, testing can be less frequent, often once a month. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 78, 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Historically, blood testing for warfarin patients was done via blood draw at an outpatient clinic. FAC \u00b6 85. In the 1980s, companies began to develop portable machines and accompanying supplies that allowed patients to do this testing at home. FAC \u00b6 86. In 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") began allowing those companies to seek Medicare reimbursements for at-home testing, but only for very narrow categories of patients. FAC \u00b6 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2008, after lobbying by a group that included Defendant Roche and a predecessor to Defendant Alere, CMS expanded its coverage for at-home testing. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 89-91. The new CMS determination permitted reimbursement for at-home testing for additional categories of patients and for up to one test per week. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93. In 2008, CMS paid a total of $5.5 million to all home-testing providers. FAC \u00b6 8. In 2015, CMS paid over $116 million for at-home testing to the named Defendants, who received over 90 percent CMS's payments for such testing that year. FAC \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Allen initially began his warfarin treatment in 2010, he tested at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility near his home in Buffalo, New York. FAC \u00b6 34. In 2013, Allen transferred his care to Dr. Brian Riegel at Buffalo Cardiology &amp; Pulmonary Associates (\"BCPA\"). FAC \u00b6 35. BCPA has a clinic dedicated to blood testing for warfarin patients, and this is where Allen would go for his tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39. The clinic uses an algorithm to determine the appropriate testing frequency for each patient. FAC \u00b6 36. Once a patient has received two consecutive in-range results, the patient is considered stable, and the algorithm directs testing once every four weeks. FAC \u00b6 38. Relator remained in this system until 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     General Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relator makes several general allegations against all eight Defendants. He alleges that once a patient's blood-clotting time has stabilized, testing more often than monthly is rarely necessary. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 80-83. But Defendants allegedly coerce patients and their doctors to agree to weekly testing (the maximum for which Medicare will reimburse) or to two tests per month without regard to whether those frequencies are medically necessary. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 109-16. They pressure doctors chiefly by removing less-frequent testing options from their pre-printed enrollment forms. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 118-21, 125-27. They also allegedly encourage the ordering of more tests than necessary through marketing material. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 128-29. For example, some marketing material references studies intended to lead patients and doctors to believe that more-frequent testing will lead to better health outcomes. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 130-31. Relator questions the validity and accuracy of these studies. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 130-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Allen also challenges the test-result reporting protocols of Alere, ACS, PHM, and mdINR. These companies' enrollment forms permit the prescribing physician to choose to receive reports (1) only monthly, or (2) only if the results are out-of-range. FAC \u00b6 251. According to Allen, any Medicare reimbursement for a test whose result is not communicated to the prescribing physician violates Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (\"HCPCS\") Billing Code G0249. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 252-53. Such reimbursements constitute payment for services not rendered. FAC \u00b6 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Allen filed his complaint under seal in June 2016.

First, under the presentment theory, the FCA \"penalizes those who present, or cause to be presented, 'false or fraudulent claim[s] for payment or approval' to the federal government.\"\n   <em>\n    Hagerty ex rel.

However, on its face, this allegation, if true, states a specific and plausible claim that Cardiolink uniformly fails to comply with NCD \u00a7 190.11, which requires home-testing patients to \"undergo a face-to-face educational program on anticoagulation management\" and \"demonstrate[ ] the correct use of the [home-testing] device prior to its use in the home.\" Relator has also provided aggregate data demonstrating that Cardiolink submitted Medicare claims worth tens of thousands of dollars for at-home blood-testing materials between 2012 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Relator has not alleged a specific example of a Cardiolink claim for reimbursement. However, that is not necessary under this theory, which approximates the scheme discussed in\n   <em>\n    Nargol\n   </em>\n   . There, it was alleged that more than half of the defendant's hip replacement implants did not comply with federal requirements and that doctors would have had no reason not to submit claims for reimbursement because the implants' defect was latent.\n   <em>\n    Nargol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275464\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/29/#p38\">\n    865 F.3d at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These allegations satisfy the relaxed Rule 9(b) standard, as applied by the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Nargol\n   </em>\n   and the cases discussed therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   These allegations also plausibly satisfy the materiality and scienter requirements, although Cardiolink has not challenged the former. Indeed, Cardiolink, in its papers, has not discussed or disputed the DVD allegation at all.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 124, 134. Accordingly, the Court will allow this theory to move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    2. ACS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In December 2014, Allen contacted ACS. FAC \u00b6 208. ACS's enrollment form states that \"Medicare recommends weekly testing,\" and the company sent Allen materials that reinforce this point. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 212, 215-17. However, this is allegedly untrue. FAC \u00b6 213. In subsequent communications, Allen asked the ACS representative whether Medicare would cover weekly tests even though his doctor told him he only needed monthly tests. FAC \u00b6 221. The representative replied, \"Yes, Medicare covers our services.\" FAC \u00b6 222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As with Cardiolink, the Court concludes that the flexible Rule 9(b) standard applies to Relator's theory regarding the statement on the ACS enrollment form, and that Relator has satisfied it. The form asserts that \"Medicare recommends weekly testing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 212; Dkt. No. 17-5 at 31. Yet, Relator has plausibly alleged that Medicare makes no such recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 213. This fits within the First Circuit's \"broad view of what may constitute a false or fraudulent statement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873391\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/72/#p85\">\n    678 F.3d at 85-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it is reasonable to infer that at least some doctors would rely on that statement in deciding whether to enroll a patient in ACS's service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nargol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275464\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/29/#p38\">\n    865 F.3d at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing allegation that \"the latency of the defect was such that doctors would have had no reason not to submit claims for reimbursement for noncompliant devices\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Relator has also plausibly alleged that while this form was in use, ACS billed Medicare for millions of dollars of blood-testing supplies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 208-09; Dkt. No. 17-1. Taken together, these allegations give rise to a \"strong inference\" that false claims were actually submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nargol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275464\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/29/#p38\">\n    865 F.3d at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Duxbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054721\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/13/#p30\">\n    579 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   29 ). That is, Relator has plausibly alleged that ACS submitted Medicare claims based upon a form that makes a false statement, and that false statement plausibly induced doctors to sign patients up for weekly testing that they did not otherwise need. While ACS argues strenuously that its form did not override the independent medical judgment of any physicians, the company does not actually address the allegedly false statement about Medicare recommending weekly testing, other than to state that this form is no longer in use and that ACS is no longer in business.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 86, 131, 145. Thus, Relator has plausibly stated a claim that ACS violated the FCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    3. PHM\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Allen contacted PHM in December 2014. FAC \u00b6 198. After receiving a brochure from the company, he sent a letter informing PHM that he was a \"stable\" patient who typically tested once or twice per month. FAC \u00b6 198. Allen asked whether the company would require him to get a new prescription for weekly testing. FAC \u00b6 198. A company representative responded that \"since Medicare covers 80% of the cost they require our patients to test weekly as a preventative.\" FAC \u00b6 199. The representative also wrote that \"weekly testing is a must\" for PHM's program. FAC \u00b6 199. Allen pointed out that Medicare allows up to one test per week, but does not require a minimum testing frequency. FAC \u00b6 201. The representative responded that Allen could not come on board as a monthly tester because PHM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   requires all of its patients to test weekly. FAC \u00b6 202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Through his own investigation of PHM, Allen discovered a 2010 PowerPoint presentation indicating that the company viewed at-home testing for warfarin patients as a growing market due to Medicare's expansion of coverage. FAC \u00b6 203. The presentation also describes a marketing plan in which the company would explain to cardiologists that they could add $250,000 in revenue by adding 1,000 new home-testing patients. FAC \u00b6 205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Having rejected Relator's theory of falsity based on the enrollment forms alone, the Court concludes that Relator fails to plausibly state an FCA claim against PHM. With respect to the representative's assertion to Allen that Medicare \"requires\" its patients to test weekly, Relator has not alleged that this statement was made to his treating physician. And because there are no allegations that PHM submitted a claim for materials provided to Relator, the complaint does not plausibly allege that this false statement caused the submission of a false claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The allegation regarding PHM's troubling marketing material also falls short of the mark. Absent a specific example showing that this promise of a new revenue stream actually induced a doctor to enroll a patient in weekly testing despite the lack of medical necessity, this theory fails under Rule 9(b). Thus, the FCA claims against PHM must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    4. USHS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Allen inquired about USHS's at-home testing program in January 2015. FAC \u00b6 189. He communicated that he had been testing once a month and asked whether USHS could \"cover\" that prescription. FAC \u00b6 191. A company representative replied that USHS \"typically\" does not cover monthly testers due to the high up-front cost of the at-home meter. FAC \u00b6 192. However, the representative told Allen that after a \"few months\" of weekly or biweekly testing, the company would \"respect\" a doctor's order for monthly testing. FAC \u00b6 192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In a subsequent exchange, USHS told Allen that the meter cost $700, so around five months of weekly testing would cover its cost. FAC \u00b6 194. The representative also told Allen that \"[i]f the [doctor] signs off on weekly testing and you test that way 4 weeks in a row and then your doctor sends in an order for monthly testing we won't dispute it[.] ... [T]here are loopholes and ways around things.\" FAC \u00b6 194. Allen spoke with Dr. Riegel, and, a few days later, told the representative that his doctor said four tests per month were not medically necessary, so that was out of the question. FAC \u00b6 196. The representative replied, \"[U]nless you get a new [c]ardiologist who is willing to sign off on it[,] there is nothing we can do.\" FAC \u00b6 197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Again, these allegations do not satisfy Rule 9(b). Without any allegation that the alleged \"loophole\" offer actually caused the submission of a false claim, the complaint fails under Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    5. mdINR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Allen contacted mdINR in January 2015, asking whether Medicare would cover the company's services given Dr. Riegel's recommendation that Allen test once or twice a month. FAC \u00b6 224. A company representative responded, \"We are weekly only testing, so you and your doctor must agree to weekly testing to use our service.\" FAC \u00b6 225. But a section of the company's website seems to contradict the weekly-only policy. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 228-29. It states that patients may test \"at the frequency prescribed by [their] doctor.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 228-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Nothing in these allegations would lead to liability under the FCA independent of\n   the theory that the Court rejected above. Accordingly, the claims against mdINR must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, the motions to dismiss by PHM, USHS, and mdINR are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   . The motion by Cardiolink is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   with respect to the DVD training theory, but is otherwise\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .

Roche\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    1. Facts Alleged\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In 2014, Allen moved to Canandaigua, New York, nearly 100 miles from the BCPA clinic. FAC \u00b6 39. Given the distance, Allen enrolled in an at-home testing program with Defendant Roche. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Allen performed his first Roche at-home test on March 2, 2014. FAC \u00b6 41. Because he was using a new system, Allen tested himself again on March 13 and April 3. FAC \u00b6 42. At that point, Allen had five consecutive in-range readings. FAC \u00b6 42. When he informed the clinic of the April 3 result, the BCPA algorithm advised that his next test should occur on May 1, 2014; this was consistent with Dr. Riegel's prior guidance to Allen that stable patients should test once a month. FAC \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On April 28, 2014, Roche mailed Allen a letter stating that he had missed his test for the week of April 14, 2014. FAC \u00b6 44. Allen called the company to ask about the letter. FAC \u00b6 174. A Roche representative told Allen about a \"marketing report\" that directed employees to inform home-testing customers that they would need to perform at least two tests per month in order to continue in Roche's program. FAC \u00b6 174. However, Allen uncovered several Roche documents, including a 2012 newsletter and sections of its website, acknowledging that some warfarin patients only require one test per month. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 177-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In the course of his investigation, Allen also discovered that when he was enrolled in the Roche program by Dr. Riegel, in May 2013, Dr. Riegel signed a form selecting the \"2-4 tests per month\" option. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 181. Allen complained to his doctor. FAC \u00b6 182. In response, Dr. Riegel and a colleague countersigned a prescription clarifying that Allen only required one test per month so long as his results remained stable. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 182-83. The doctor attached this new prescription to a Roche enrollment form in July 2014; instead of selecting from the form's monthly test-frequency options of \"4,\" \"3,\" \"2,\" and \"2-4,\" the doctor checked a box for \"Form attached\" and attached the prescription. FAC \u00b6 183-84. Shortly after, Roche changed its enrollment form to remove the \"Form attached\" option, leaving only the \"4,\" \"3,\" \"2,\" and \"2-4\" options. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 184-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In August 2014, Roche informed Allen via letter that it was dropping him from the at-home testing program. FAC \u00b6 186. The letter relied on the opinions of Allen's doctors, who only recommended one test per month. FAC \u00b6 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    2. Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The heart of Roche's argument for dismissal is that it kicked Relator out of its home-testing program as soon as Relator said he only needed to test once a month. Dkt. No. 58 at 2. Therefore, no false claims were submitted, and Relator has failed to plead his FCA theories with particularity as required under Rule 9(b). Dkt. No. 58 at 2-4. Relator counters that Roche's claim that it dismissed patients who required\n   less-frequent testing is a factual issue that cannot be resolved at a motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 127 at 22. He also incorporates the necessarily-false enrollment form argument described above. Dkt. No. 127 at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Relator's allegations provide no basis from which the Court could infer that Roche knew or recklessly disregarded the risk that Relator did not need weekly testing. Roche first became aware of that possibility when Dr. Riegel made contact in July 2014. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 182-84. The very next month, Roche removed Relator from its program. FAC \u00b6 186. This is exactly the opposite of what Allen would need to show to support his case against Roche. Rather than seek reimbursement for tests that the company knew or suspected to be medically unnecessary, the company suspended its service as soon as Dr. Riegel called into question the medical necessity of more-frequent testing. Accordingly, the Court allows Roche's motion to dismiss the FCA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alere\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    1. Facts Alleged\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Allen first inquired about Alere's at-home testing program through a letter dated January 7, 2015. FAC \u00b6 142. The letter informed Alere that Allen's doctor was recommending one test per month so long as his levels remained stable. FAC \u00b6 142. An Alere representative named Mary Wages responded via email two days later. FAC \u00b6 143. Wages told Allen that Alere requires at least two tests per month. FAC \u00b6 143. Allen responded by questioning this requirement in light of his stable readings. FAC \u00b6 144. Wages repeated the two-tests-per-month minimum. FAC \u00b6 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   When Allen again questioned the requirement, Wages responded with an allegedly false or misleading statement: \"All the studies indicate that patients who test more frequently have fewer adverse events.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 148-49. In all, Allen told Alere four times that his doctor believed testing more frequently than once a month would be unnecessary. FAC \u00b6 153. Yet, Alere enrolled Allen in its home-testing program. FAC \u00b6 156. Alere has submitted bills to CMS for Allen's tests at least every two weeks since March 11, 2015. FAC \u00b6 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Dr. Riegel submitted a physician order form to Alere on January 30, 2015 -- before Allen began testing with Alere. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 159-60. The form approves Allen for two blood tests per month. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 159-60. Dr. Riegel now avers that more than one test per month was medically unnecessary for Allen, and that he only signed the Alere order form so Allen could have access to the company's at-home testing service. Dkt. No. 17-2, \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Through his investigation into Alere, Allen uncovered an earlier version of the physician order form, dated 2011. FAC \u00b6 161. Unlike the form that Dr. Riegel signed, which was updated in 2013, the earlier version gave prescribing doctors a range of test-frequency options: \"Weekly,\" \"1-4 times/month,\" and \"Other.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 159, 161. Allen claims Alere changed its forms solely to maximize the amount of testing that patients performed, regardless of whether the tests were medically necessary, so that it could increase its Medicare revenue stream. FAC \u00b6 162. Allen also provides statistics suggesting that, from 2008 to 2015, the average number of monthly at-home tests billed to Medicare for Alere patients more than doubled, from around one per month to 2.36 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 171, 266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Allen also takes aim at Alere's marketing practices. For example, he claims a 2014 Alere-sponsored study was intended to mislead doctors and patients into testing more frequently than independent medical literature would recommend. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 163-71. It did this, in part, by selecting a data set that skewed too heavily toward patients on warfarin for a mechanical heart valve, as opposed to other conditions, which may have affected the necessary testing frequency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 166-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    2. Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Relator advances two main theories against Alere: one based on the allegedly false certification of medical necessity, and one based on Medicare billing codes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Medical Necessity Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Relator's theory based on a false certification of medical necessity is bolstered by specific information. Attached to the complaint are what appear to be three actual claims that Alere submitted for Medicare reimbursement based on blood tests for Allen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 17-12, 17-13, 17-15. Relator contends that the majority of these tests (i.e., any tests beyond one per month) were medically unnecessary based on Relator's in-range test results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17-14; Dkt. No. 127 at 43. These tests are coupled with allegations that Relator told Alere in writing that he only needed one test per month. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 142, 153. When reasonable inferences are drawn in Relator's favor, Alere was on notice that there was a substantial risk that Dr. Riegel's certification was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As discussed above, some courts have held that bundled tests can create FCA liability when the certifying entity is aware that one or more of the tests are medically unnecessary, or recklessly disregards such a risk.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Groat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274593\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/13/#p18\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 18-20, 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying those cases here, the Court concludes that when Alere removed the \"Other\" option from its enrollment form, FAC \u00b6\u00b6 159, 161, it left physicians with an unfortunate choice: order medically unnecessary tests, or deny patients the option of at-home testing. The modified form thus created a heightened risk that medically unnecessary tests would be ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Relator has also plausibly and specifically alleged that, with respect to his own enrollment in the program, Alere ignored facts that would put a reasonable person on notice that more than one test per month was medically unnecessary\n   <em>\n    for him\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523924\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/155/\">\n    296 F.Supp.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allegation that lab CEO was told \"test panels included many unnecessary tests\");\n   <em>\n    Berkeley Heartlab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270196\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/225/487/#p497\">\n    225 F.Supp.3d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allegation that defendants \"encouraged physicians to order tests that were medically unnecessary\");\n   <em>\n    Family Med.

FAC \u00b6 153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Alere argues that medical necessity is a determination for the physician, not the patient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20410.32\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Thus, when determining how many blood tests Relator required, Alere argues it was entitled to trust Dr. Riegel's word on the enrollment form over Relator's earlier assertions. While Alere is generally entitled to rely on the independent judgment of a medical provider,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523924\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/155/\">\n    296 F.Supp.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , here Alere had a specific basis to second-guess Dr. Riegel's certification about Relator's medical needs: Relator's own communications describing a different medical need. FAC \u00b6 153. When all reasonable inferences are drawn in Relator's favor, the FAC plausibly alleges scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, Alere argues that the public disclosure bar precludes Relator's claim. \"[T]he public disclosure bar forecloses a qui tam action 'if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action ... were publicly disclosed' in a list of enumerated sources.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

No. 96 at 18-19. Alere cites no authority to support the proposition that, generally speaking, a form posted on a company's website fits within the statutory sources that may trigger the public disclosure bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A). Further, as just articulated, Relator's theory of falsity entails much more than just the form. It involves Relator's personal interactions with the company, as well as his own medical needs. Alere does not argue that these details were publicly disclosed prior to Relator's complaint. As a result, the public disclosure bar does not apply here, and Alere's motion to dismiss must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Billing Code Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Allen also contends that Alere, on at least two occasions (October 16, 2016, and December 2, 2016), billed Medicare for tests that were not performed. The complaint alleges that on these dates, Alere submitted claims after Allen only performed three tests, rather than the four called for by HCPCS Billing Code G0249. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 254-62. According to Relator, if this practice occurs regularly across Alere's entire patient population, it could result in fraudulent claims of up to $12 million per year. FAC \u00b6 261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Alere initially responded, in part, that the fourth tests may only appear to be missing because they may not have returned \"numerical\" results. Dkt. No. 132 at 9. The Court permitted limited discovery to develop this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 146 at 75-76. From the information uncovered, it appears that Allen performed tests on September 5, 2016, and October 16, 2016, that returned the result \"Blood Sample Error\" rather than the typical numerical value. Dkt. No. 149-1 at 2. He then performed another test on the same day that returned a numerical value. Dkt. No. 149-1 at 2. Each of the \"Error\" tests was part of a batch of four tests that\n   Alere submitted to Medicare for reimbursement. Dkt. No. 149-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   However, Relator disputes this characterization of what the limited discovery revealed, and he argues that, in any event, it was improper to bill for these \"Error\" test results. Because this issue required further factual development beyond the four corners of the complaint, the Court must take heed of the rule that \"any consideration of documents not attached to the complaint, or not expressly incorporated therein, is forbidden, unless the proceeding is properly converted into one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\"\n   <em>\n    Watterson v.

No. 149 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   On this theory, the details may matter, particularly with respect to whether Relator has satisfied the \"demanding\" materiality standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Health Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p1996\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2003-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That analysis is likely to turn on precisely what information Alere actually sent to the government regarding the \"Error\" test results. Because the parties dispute that fact, the Court cannot dismiss the billing code theory at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   For the reasons given, Roche's motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   . Alere's motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   with respect to the theories just discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Test-Reporting Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Relator makes one other FCA allegation against Alere, ACS, PHM, and mdINR. He argues that these companies gave physicians the option of receiving their patients' test results only if they were out of range and/or on a monthly summary basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 207, 211, 227, 251. Relator contends that these test-reporting options conflict with HCPCS Billing Code G0249, and therefore result in the submission of false claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   This theory fails for two reasons. First, Relator has not plausibly or specifically alleged any instance in which a physician actually selected one of these reporting options. Second, Billing Code G0249 requires only \"reporting of test results to physician\" -- without specifying a frequency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Code G0249. Given this ambiguity in what the billing code requires, Relator has not plausibly alleged materiality under the \"demanding\" standard of\n   <em>\n    Universal Health Services\n   </em>\n   . That is, he has not plausibly alleged that a physician's choice of when to receive test result data (only monthly or only when the results fall out of range) actually did or likely would affect the government's decision to reimburse for the tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Health Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p1996\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2003-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the types of evidence that could and could not support finding of materiality). Accordingly, Relator's claims based on this theory cannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Common Law Counts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Collectively, Defendants assert that Allen's common law counts claiming payment under mistake of fact (Count IV) and unjust enrichment (Count V) must be dismissed for lack of standing. They point out that even if Allen's core FCA theories are true, he has suffered no harm by virtue of\n   the government paying fraudulent Medicare claims.
