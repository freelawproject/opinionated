Walker failed to conduct very basic inquiries during his investigation, and ignored undisputed facts. Walker received a call from a \"Sharon McDonald\" who told Walker \"if you explain to me what happened, I can tell you in return what happened.\" PF \u00b6 15. Yet he never attempted to trace her number or to ascertain the phone number(s) associated with the plaintiff. Walker also failed to show a photo array to Swift prior to seeking an arrest warrant and failed to otherwise verify whether the plaintiff was 5'3? and Jamaican. He sought the warrant despite the victims' failure to identify the plaintiff from a photo array and despite the fact that her license listed the plaintiff's height as 5'3?. He based his application for a warrant on someone who was not at the crime scene, and was not known to the officer to be credible. These undisputed facts establish that a reasonable police officer would understand that he lacked probable cause to seek the plaintiff's arrest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nuon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803372\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/323/#p330\">\n     768 F.Supp.2d at 334\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (officer's claim of qualified immunity denied at summary judgment stage where \"no objectively reasonable police officer confronted with [the defendant's] version of the facts could have believed that there was probable cause to arrest [the plaintiff] for disorderly conduct.\").\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     D.\n     <em>\n      Count III: Claim Against the City for Negligence\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </opinion>\n   <attorneys id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     E.\n     <em>\n      Count V: Claim Against Walker for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </attorneys>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%2049\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v.

Defendant Richard\n     Walker is a detective with the Boston Police Department. DF \u00b6 1. On or about May 22, 2012, Det. Walker responded to a report of an armed robbery at a store in Roslindale committed by four African-American women. DF \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; PF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. The store clerks told Det. Walker that the suspects fled the scene in a 1992 green Honda Civic, and provided him with the license plate number. DF \u00b6 4; PF \u00b6 3. Det. Walker went to the residence of the registered owner of the car, Fitzroy Swift, and spoke with a woman at the residence who identified herself as Swift's sister. PF \u00b6 6. She called Swift and handed the phone to Det. Walker. PF \u00b6 8. Swift told Walker that he had registered the car for a friend, Sharon McDonald, who lived in Brockton. DF \u00b6 5. Swift indicated that McDonald was Jamaican, 47 years old, 5'3?, and had several daughters. DF \u00b6 6; PF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Swift provided Det. Walker with a telephone number for McDonald, but did not provide a specific address for McDonald's residence in Brockton. DF \u00b6 7. Swift refused to provide Det. Walker with his location and refused to meet with him. PF \u00b6 9.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     Det. Walker called the number Swift provided and left a voicemail. DF \u00b6 8. Five minutes later, Walker received a call back from an individual with a Jamaican accent who identified herself as Sharon McDonald. DF \u00b6 10; PF \u00b6 15. She stated that she was not involved in the robbery and did not know anyone named \"Fitz,\" but later stated that \"if you explain to me what happened, I can tell you in return what happened.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Det. Walker asked her to come to the station, but she refused. PF \u00b6 16.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     Det. Walker searched the Registry of Motor Vehicles (\"RMV\") for individuals with a license named \"Sharon McDonald.\" PF \u00b6 13. Only one such individual, the plaintiff, was listed as residing in Brockton.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     The plaintiff's license photograph was five years old and her height was listed as 5'3?. PF \u00b6 18. Det. Walker assembled a photo array that included the plaintiff's driver's license picture and presented the array to two store clerks who witnessed the robbery. PF \u00b6 19. Neither clerk identified the plaintiff.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Det. Walker also ran a criminal background check on both the plaintiff and Swift. PF \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20. The plaintiff had no criminal record. PF \u00b6 20. Swift had an extensive criminal record with over 31 charges, including charges for armed robbery. PF \u00b6 17.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     Det. Walker obtained and reviewed surveillance video from the store which included footage from the time of the robbery. PF \u00b6 21; DF \u00b6 12. The surveillance picture was not very good, as the clarity \"wasn't definite.\" Pl. Ex. 3 at 123. In his Supplemental Incident Report, Det. Walker indicated that \"[o]ne of the suspects (the oldest) looks like Sharon Mcdonald [sic] as she appears in her Massachusetts Drivers License.\" PF \u00b6 26. Det. Walker sought an arrest warrant for the plaintiff for armed robbery but did not mention the failed photo arrays in his warrant application. DF \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Pl. Ex. 6. Det. Walker testified that his failure to mention the photo arrays was an oversight, as it is his normal practice to do so. PF \u00b6 32. An arrest warrant was issued for the plaintiff and the plaintiff was arrested by Brockton police. PF \u00b6 34; Pl. Ex. 4 at 2. At her arraignment, McDonald was unable to make the $5,000 cash bail set by the court, and she remained incarcerated for eight days until her bail was reduced to personal recognizance and she was released. Pl. Ex. 8 at 2-3.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     On or around July 9, 2012, Det. Walker met with Swift and presented him with a photo array that included the plaintiff's driver's license picture. PF \u00b6 40. Swift did not identify the plaintiff as the Sharon McDonald he knew.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     The next day, Det. Walker met with the plaintiff, who was in court with her attorney. DF \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; PF \u00b6 36; Pl. Ex. 4 at 2. He asked the plaintiff if she drove a green Honda Civic. PF \u00b6 38. She replied that she did not and had another vehicle registered in her name.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Walker also observed that the plaintiff did not have a Jamaican accent and was not 5'3?. Pl. Ex. 3 at 234. As a result of this meeting, Det. Walker determined that the plaintiff was not the Sharon McDonald involved in the armed robbery and requested that the District Attorney drop the charges against her. DF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; PF \u00b6 39. On July 23, 2012, the court allowed the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss on the grounds that she \"is not the proper subject of [the] criminal complaint\" and had been \"wrongfully charged[.]\" PF \u00b6 41.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     Additional factual details relevant to the court's analysis are described below where appropriate.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     <strong>\n      III.\n      <em>\n       ANALYSIS\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-23\">\n     <strong>\n      A.\n      <em>\n       Summary Judgment Standard of Review\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     Both McDonald and Det.

In the instant case, the undisputed facts compel the conclusion that Det. Walker did not have probable cause to arrest the plaintiff.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     As an initial matter, Det. Walker did not act on any information derived from a verified, credible source. The initial piece of information that led Det. Walker to the plaintiff came from a phone conversation with the purported owner of the car that was used in the armed robbery. The owner of the car had a long criminal history, which included armed robbery, and he refused to meet with Det. Walker. By contrast, the plaintiff had no criminal history at all. Yet, Det. Walker's initial identification of the plaintiff as a suspect was based entirely on this information from someone he didn't know, who refused to meet with him, and who, allegedly, was not even present at the crime scene. Furthermore, Swift's story that he registered the car for a friend for some unknown reason, and for whom he did not provide an address, is not an inherently credible story in and of itself. This random identification of someone with a common name did not constitute probable cause.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-39\">\n     Moreover, all of the credible facts which Det. Walker did have contradicted any conclusion that the plaintiff was the perpetrator of the armed robbery. For example, the victims of the crime did not identify the plaintiff from a photo array. Moreover, even assuming that Swift could be believed, he described someone who did not match the plaintiff's description on her license. The difference between a 5'3? woman and a 5'8? woman is a very significant difference.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-40\">\n     The surveillance tape which Det. Walker allegedly viewed before seeking the arrest warrant did not create probable cause. Det. Walker himself testified that the video was not a very good surveillance picture, and the clarity \"wasn't definite.\" Pl. Ex. 3 at 123. This court has reviewed the video in question, and the picture quality is so poor that it is hard to make out the individuals involved in the robbery, let alone specific physical features. In sum, considering the circumstances as a whole - the poor quality video, the suspect information from a seemingly unreliable source, and the facts which described someone other than the plaintiff - Det. Walker \"has not shown that the facts and circumstances 'were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.' \"\n     <em>\n      Daley v.

Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Det. Walker made any attempt to corroborate this information or otherwise establish Swift's credibility. Thus, there was no credible information on which to base the arrest warrant. Further, unlike the officer in\n     <em>\n      Parks\n     </em>\n     , Walker was faced with significant exculpatory evidence, as neither store clerk was able to identify the plaintiff in a photo array, and the plaintiff's driver's license did not match the description provided.

Since this court's ruling on Det. Walker's motion to dismiss, the development of the record has failed to establish the existence of additional facts indicating that Det. Walker engaged in threats, intimidation, or coercion. Because the majority of courts have held that a wrongful arrest, without more, is insufficient for a claim under the MCRA, and the plaintiff's allegations fall short of establishing threats, intimidation, or coercion beyond the arrest itself, Det. Walker's motion for summary judgment as to the MCRA claim will be ALLOWED.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-65\">\n     <strong>\n      IV.\n      <em>\n       CONCLUSION\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-66\">\n     For all the reasons detailed herein, Det. Walker's Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 65) is ALLOWED on Count V (IIED) and Count VI (MCRA), and DENIED on Count I ( Section 1983 ). McDonald's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Docket No. 69) is ALLOWED on Count I ( Section 1983 ) and DENIED on Count III (Negligence). Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Evidence of Surveillance Video (Docket No. 75) is DENIED as provided herein.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-69\">\n     On November 12, 2015, this court granted the City's motion to dismiss claims under Section 1983 (Count II), and the MCRA (Count VI), as well as claims for vicarious liability (Count IV), and for intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count V). (Docket No. 34). On the same day, this court allowed Det. Walker's motion to dismiss the claim against him for negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count V). (Docket No. 35).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-72\">\n     Unless otherwise indicated, the facts are derived from the following materials: (1) Det. Walker's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of his Motion for Summary Judgment (\"DF\") (Docket No. 67); (2) the exhibits attached to the Affidavits of William T. Hogan, III (Docket No. 68), Matthew T. Brown, Esq. (Docket No. 79), and Lisa M. Logerfo, Esq. (Docket No. 80) (\"Def. Ex. __\"); and (3) Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts in Support of her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Liability (\"PF\") (Docket No. 70) and the exhibits attached thereto (\"Pl. Ex. __\").\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-73\">\n     Because this court finds that the defendant did not have probable cause to arrest the plaintiff, it is unnecessary to address the plaintiff's alternative argument that Det. Walker acted with reckless disregard in failing to mention the photo arrays in his arrest warrant application.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-74\">\n     Because the MTCA issue was dispositive on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the negligence claim, this court does not reach the argument that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of an internal affairs (\"IAD\") report issued regarding Walker's conduct. The plaintiff contends that the report is conclusive on the issue of negligence while the defendants contend that the report is inadmissible. The court declines to resolve this issue at this time as it is unnecessary to the resolution of the pending motions for summary judgment.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     The MCRA, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 11H, provides in relevant part: \"Whenever any person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any other person or persons of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, the attorney general may bring a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the peaceable exercise or enjoyment of the right or rights secured.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 11I authorizes civil actions by any person who has suffered the interference or attempted interference of the rights described in \u00a7 11H.\n    </p>\n   </p>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
