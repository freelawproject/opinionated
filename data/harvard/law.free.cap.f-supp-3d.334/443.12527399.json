The VA denies any liability, and asserts that the termination of Ms. Bangura's employment, a year after she stopped reporting to work, was due to her failure to come to work or to follow the VA's leave policy. This matter is before the Court on \"Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\" (Docket No. 56) and on \"Plaintiff's Request for Entry of Summary Judgment in Her Favor.\" (Docket No. 68). In their motions, each of the parties contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For the reasons detailed herein, the Defendant's motion is ALLOWED, and the Plaintiff's Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Plaintiff's Employment with the VA\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff began working in 2007 as a Certified Nursing Aide for the VA in Bedford, Massachusetts. (PF \u00b6 5; DF \u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff is an African American woman of\n   Sierra Leone origin. (PF \u00b6 4). As a Certified Nursing Aide, Plaintiff worked the evening shift of 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. and Plaintiff's job performance generally met the VA's expectations, with some exceptions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31; DR \u00b6 82). While at the VA, Plaintiff's nurse manager and managing official was Barbara Mueller (\"Ms. Mueller\"), the nurse in charge was Ann Goulet (\"Ms. Goulet\"), and the director of nursing in 2014 and 2015 was Mary-Ann Petrillo (\"Ms. Petrillo\"). (DR \u00b6 6). Plaintiff suffers from severe arthritis, high blood pressure, and other health ailments that substantially limit her ability to perform major life activities. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 25, 73). Plaintiff took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act from August 14, 2013 to January 14, 2014. (PF \u00b6 8; DR \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Plaintiff's First Request for An Accommodation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late March 2014, after Plaintiff returned from leave, she applied for a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities. (DF \u00b6 8; PF \u00b6 9). Plaintiff submitted two medical letters to support her request. (Pl. Ex. D; Def. Ex. D). The first letter, from Dr. Wen Yee Lee, dated January 7, 2014, stated that Plaintiff \"may return to work, working no more than 40 hours/week with no restrictions, on 1/20/2014.\" (DF \u00b6 9). The second letter from Dr. Wen Yee Lee, dated April 3, 2014, stated that Plaintiff suffered from osteoarthritis of both knees and \"[s]he can not work more than 8 hours per day.\" (Pl. Ex. D). Plaintiff made the doctor's advice known to Defendant and, specifically, to Ms. Mueller, Ms. Goulet, and Ms. Petrillo. (PF \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In or about April 2014, the VA granted Plaintiff's accommodation, which went into effect on March 28, 2014. (DF \u00b6 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties dispute the level of enforcement of the reasonable accommodation. (PF \u00b6 13; DR \u00b6 13). Plaintiff asserts that her workplace became difficult because she was forced to work more than forty hours per week or eight hours per shift and had to stay to cover later shifts. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15; Pl. Ex. A at 2-3). She has offered no support for her claim of working additional hours other than her own, generalized, statement. Defendant contends that the VA did not schedule Plaintiff to work more than 40 hours per week after January 14, 2014 and no more than eight hours per shift after April 1, 2014. (DR \u00b6 13). The VA's assertion is supported by the Plaintiff's timecards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between May 28, 2014 and May 31, 2014, three of Plaintiff's white coworkers filled out separate \"Reports of Contact\" about an incident on their floor with Plaintiff on May 28, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. E). The reports provided that Plaintiff was disruptive, loud, upset the patients, and used her phone in the patient care area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DF \u00b6\u00b6 13-15). Plaintiff contends that all of these reports were false and that Ms. Mueller and Ms. Goulet convinced her coworkers to write these reports against her. (PR \u00b6\u00b6 13-16; PF \u00b6 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also contends\n   that some of these same white coworkers made fun of her accent, food, and disability. (PR \u00b6 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   All the coworkers have sworn under oath that they did not ridicule Plaintiff or write false reports against her. (DR \u00b6 97). Plaintiff contends that this behavior contributed to creating a hostile work environment, and that the events of May 2014, as well as the hours she worked, would be evidenced on surveillance tapes from cameras on the floor where she worked. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. (Docket No. 73) at 19 (\"defendants have suppressed the production of the recordings of the surveillance cameras because their conducts are discriminatory and allegations against plaintiff, and their explanations are tissues of lies, untrue and pretextual.\") ). However, the VA has attested to the fact that the surveillance cameras were not installed until several years after the events at issue. (DR Docket No. 79-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Plaintiff's Second Request for An Accommodation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the reports of the May 28, 2014 incident, nursing leadership recommended that Plaintiff change shifts and Ms. Mueller reassigned Plaintiff to work the day shift, starting on June 3, 2014 at 7:30 a.m. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). The parties dispute the purpose of the shift change. (DF \u00b6 18; PR \u00b6 18). Plaintiff contends the purpose was retaliatory and discriminatory because Plaintiff complained about bullying and because Ms. Mueller told Plaintiff that her white coworkers did not want to work with her. (PR \u00b6 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that the purpose of the shift change was to place the Plaintiff with more supervisors who could better evaluate and educate her, because there was not enough staff on the evening shift to correct employee behavior. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 3, 2014, Plaintiff did not arrive to work her first day shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). On June 5, 2014, Plaintiff requested that she be returned to the evening shift and reassigned to another floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; PF \u00b6 24). Plaintiff alleges that she informed the Defendant that \"it would be against her health conditions to work on the morning shifts.\" (PF \u00b6 30). To support her request, Plaintiff provided a letter from a physician's assistant, dated June 4, 2014, that stated, \"the structure during the evening could make her less fatigued and she would be more fully functional that [sic] working during day shift.\" (DF \u00b6 23; Pl. Ex. E). The VA did not grant Plaintiff's second accommodation request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). Plaintiff contends that the VA's denial of her request for accommodation was retaliatory and discriminatory. (PF \u00b6 51). Plaintiff also asserts that the Defendant threatened Plaintiff that she would be arrested if she came to work on the evening shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Defendant disputes Plaintiff's allegations and contends that the VA did not grant her request because the letter was not sufficient to support the change to the evening shift, and the shift change was intended to be temporary. (DR \u00b6\u00b6 51, 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff never returned to work after June 3, 2014. (DF \u00b6 26). The Plaintiff contends that she was constructively discharged as of June 8, 2014. (PF \u00b6 2; PR \u00b6 30). The Defendant contends that she never resigned, and was eventually terminated\n   on July 6, 2015, effective June 26, 2015, for failing to come to work or to request leave. (DF \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Plaintiff's EEO Complaints and Termination of Employment\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 11, 2014, Plaintiff met with the Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Manager at the VA, Deborah Outing (\"Ms. Outing\"), regarding her discrimination claims. (DF \u00b6 27). According to Ms. Outing, she advised Plaintiff that she would need to contact the ORM within forty-five days of the incident to start the EEO complaint procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). Ms. Outing was the appropriate contact for the settlement of non-EEO issues only. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). On June 24, 2014, Ms. Mueller called Plaintiff and told her \"she was a VA employee who was expected to report to work unless she was requesting leave.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). On June 25, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a complaint of discrimination to Ms. Outing at the EEO (the \"June 2014 Complaint\") and, according to Ms. Outing, she again explained to the Plaintiff the appropriate process for filing complaints with the ORM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 27, 2014, Plaintiff also submitted a request to transfer to another ward to Ms. Mueller, copying Ms. Petrillo and a union representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). On the same day, the VA deemed Plaintiff to be away without leave (\"AWOL\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a letter dated July 2, 2014, the VA notified Plaintiff of a proposal to suspend her for five days starting on August 18, 2014 for inappropriate conduct, patient abuse, using a cellphone in a patient area, and being AWOL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). As part of the proposal for suspension, the VA took into account a prior incident from 2013 with a charge nurse, Wayne Baptiste (\"Mr. Baptiste\"), who reported Plaintiff for raising her voice to a patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; Def. Ex. H at 5). He also reported that Plaintiff resisted attempts to \"re-educate her on communication techniques.\" (DF \u00b6 5). Plaintiff asserts that the incident was falsified and that Mr. Baptiste had taunted her. (PF \u00b6 95). As a result of this incident, the VA issued Plaintiff an Admonishment for her behavior. (DF \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 21, 2014, the Plaintiff having failed to return to work, the VA suspended her and notified her of her appeal rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). In November 2014, the VA sent a letter to Plaintiff proposing her termination because of her continued AWOL status and failure to follow leave procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 16, 2014, Plaintiff had informal counseling with the ORM about her complaints of discrimination based on denied reasonable accommodation, suspension, and hostile work environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). At that time she did not allege a\n   constructive discharge, just a suspension on August 18, 2014. (Def. Ex. L). On January 12, 2015, the ORM sent Plaintiff's counsel a letter acknowledging their informal meeting and informing Plaintiff of her option to file a formal complaint of discrimination with the ORM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DF \u00b6 37). On January 26, 2015, Plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint (the \"January 2015 Complaint\") with the ORM. (DR \u00b6 53; Def. Ex. M). She alleged discrimination, including \"suspension and constructive termination\" on August 18, 2014, and claimed that she had been denied reasonable accommodation on June 5, 2014, improperly suspended on August 18, 2014, and subjected to a hostile work environment between May 28, 2014 and May 31, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 9, 2015, the ORM provided Plaintiff, through her counsel, with a Notice of Partial Acceptance of certain claims alleged in the January 2015 Complaint. (DF \u00b6 39; Def. Ex. N). The ORM accepted part of Plaintiff's discrimination complaint under a hostile work environment claim pertaining to her allegations against her co-workers and her AWOL status between September 2, 2014 and October 17, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ORM dismissed her accommodation claim (denial of request to remain on an eight hour-evening shift) for failure to properly initiate contact with an EEO counselor within forty-five days of the incident, but agreed to consider the event as part of her overall hostile work environment claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ORM also noted that Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim was not properly raised with an EEO counselor and that the ORM \"will not be framing this matter as a constructive discharge claim.\" (DF \u00b6 39; Def. Ex. N at 1).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, the facts are derived from Defendant's Statement of Material Facts Under L.R. 56.1 (Docket No. 55) (\"DF\"); exhibits attached to the Declaration of Annapurna Balakrishna in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 46) (\"Def.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PR \u00b6 16). Defendant disputes this and contends that Plaintiff has not identified evidence to support this statement.

(DF \u00b6 2; PR \u00b6 2; PF \u00b6 94; DR \u00b6 94). The ORM decision noted that the EEO Manager at the VA (Ms. Outing) had verified that the Plaintiff had received training, and that it had included information about the EEO process and applicable time limits. (Def. Ex. Q at 2;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    Outling Decl. (Docket No. 53) at Ex. A; Def. Ex.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Mem. at 2-3). As noted above, however, there was no surveillance camera in the hallway at the time. (DR \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). The VA contends that it elected to issue the Admonishment instead of transferring the Plaintiff because it deemed that to be the appropriate response to the complaint about Plaintiff's behavior.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) On August 13, 2015, the Plaintiff requested leave to amend her Complaint, which was granted, to add additional claims that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on disability, race, national origin and reprisal. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DF \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; Def. Ex. P at 2-3). Upon completion of its investigation, the ORM issued a Final Agency Decision in February 2016. (Def. Ex. Q). The ORM found in favor of the VA on all claims, specifically finding no disparate treatment (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 11-12), no discrimination (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13-14) and that Plaintiff's hostile environment-harassment claim \"consists of only her dissatisfaction with job-related events\" that did \"not rise to the level of harassment as defined under federal EEO law.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 14).

Based on the January 2015 Complaint, the ORM described the Plaintiff's complaint of discrimination as raising a hostile work environment discrimination claim \"based on disability, race (Black), [and] national origin (African/Sierra Leone)[.]\" (Def. Ex. N at \u00b6 4). She did not raise independent claims of disability discrimination or racial and national origin discrimination. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DF \u00b6 38). Nevertheless, in light of the fact that Plaintiff's hostile work environment discrimination claim was sufficiently based on disability, race, and national origin, this Court will treat the direct claims as having been exhausted. \"[T]he scope of the investigation rule permits a district court to look beyond the four corners of the underlying administrative charge to consider collateral and alternative bases or acts that would have been uncovered in a reasonable investigation.\"\n    <em>\n     Thornton v.

In the instant case, Plaintiff argues that she exhausted her failure to accommodate claims because her June 2014 Complaint submitted to Ms. Outing sufficiently began the process to file an EEO discrimination complaint. (Pl. Mem. at 9-10). Then she argues that \"the EEO manager or counselor failed to act timely. Plaintiff therefore [should] not be made to bear the responsibility for the counselor's negligence, failure to act or failure to act in a timely manner.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9). However, the record is clear that Ms. Outing is not an EEO counselor but merely the internal contact at the VA for settlement of non-EEO issues. (DF \u00b6 4). Plaintiff did not speak with ORM until October 2014, and\n    did not file a complaint until January 2015. ORM dismissed her accommodation claims from her January 2015 Complaint for failure to comply with the statutory time limits. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39; Def. Ex. N at 2). This Court agrees that in failing to properly file within the mandatory time frame, Plaintiff did not exhaust her administrative remedies for her current accommodation claims (Counts I and IX). Moreover, Plaintiff's accommodation claims are \"beyond the bounds and parameters encompassed by [Plaintiff's January 2015] administrative charge.\"\n    <em>\n     Thornton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680886\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/27/#p32\">\n     587 F.3d at 32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PR \u00b6\u00b6 2, 28-29). However, Plaintiff does not put forth significantly probative evidence to carry her heavy burden of proving entitlement to equitable relief. As an initial matter, Ms. Outing's version of events is reflected in contemporaneous records. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Outing Decl. (Docket 53) at Ex. A (describing file); Balakrishna Decl. (Docket No. 46) at \u00b6 4; Def. Ex. B (attendance records) ). However, Plaintiff has no evidence to support her denial. Furthermore, as the ORM described in its Notice of Partial Acceptance of April 9, 2015, it was clearly not within Ms. Outing's authority to initiate an EEO complaint. (Def. Ex. N at 2-3). As ORM wrote to Plaintiff's counsel explaining its finding that the denial of accommodation request was untimely, and declining the request for tolling:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    Your client explained that she believed that her June 2014 contact with the facility EEO manager, Deborah Outing, constituted her initial contact to contact an EEO counselor. Ms. Outing provided documentation that the complainant contacted her on two occasions in June 2014 and that on both occasions Ms. Outing explained the process to file an EEO complaint, informed her that she could not process complaints and provided her the [ORM] brochure. Since the inception of ORM in 1997, ORM removed the responsibility for processing EEO complaints from individual facility EEO Program Managers, and centralized the responsebility under ORM. Because of this reorganization, the facility EEO Program Managers are not \"logically connected\" to the EEO complaint process; and, therefore, their only obligation is to properly advise a prospective complainant on how to exercise their EEO rights, including who to contact, which, within VA, is ORM. The agency further provided employee training records indicating that your client received training on the process and regulatory time lines with the ORM toll free phone number.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Plaintiff has not put forth any facts which would support a conclusion that Ms. Outing did not fulfill her job responsibilities (which had been in effect since 1997) and inform the Plaintiff of the need to file an appropriate complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The ORM agreed to consider Plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate as part of her hostile work environment claim. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3). This Court will do the same. Therefore, the Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by adherence to the notice period, and the Defendant will still have to address the merits of its decision not to allow the Plaintiff to move to the evening shift on another floor. Since the direct claims of failure to accommodate are not exhausted, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Counts I and IX is granted and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on those Counts is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     C.\n     <em>\n      Count III: Constructive Discharge\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In Count III of her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was constructively discharged from her employment. As she has made clear in her summary judgment record, she sets the date for such discharge at June 8, 2014. This claim is the crux of Plaintiff's case. If she was constructively discharged in June 2014, then her failure to appear at work for the next year prior to the VA's termination of her employment effective June 26, 2015 is excused. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Mem. at 8 (\"Plaintiff was forced to quit her job about June 8, 2018 [sic], because of the hostile work environment created by the defendants. The AWOLs and the other things thereafter, were pretextuals and further acts of harassments and intimidations by defendants against plaintiff.\") ). If, however, she was not constructively discharged at that time, the VA clearly had grounds to terminate her employment after she was absent from work for a year. For the reasons detailed herein, the VA is entitled to summary judgment on this constructive discharge claim. Not only did the Plaintiff fail to exhaust her administrative remedies as to this claim, but the claim fails on the merits as a matter of law based on the undisputed facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Failure to Exhaust\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    As an initial matter, the record is clear that any claim for constructive discharge in June 2014 was not exhausted. Even if this Court assumes the June 2014 Complaint was sufficient to start her complaint process, Plaintiff failed to mention a constructive discharge claim at that time. (Pl. Ex. A). In her informal counseling with ORM, Plaintiff only referred to a \"disciplinary action-suspension\" which she\n    dated as August 18, 2014. (Def. Ex. L). In her January 2015 Complaint, Plaintiff mentions constructive discharge for the first time, but again sets the date as August 18, 2014. (Def. Ex. M). ORM did not consider any constructive discharge claim as part of its investigation because the claim had not been properly raised with an EEO counselor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). Thus, it is clear that any claim of constructive discharge, and especially one that was based on events in June 2014, was not exhausted. Moreover, there is no basis for tolling since there are no facts proffered that would explain why the claim of constructive discharge was not mentioned even in the informal ORM process, and why the June date was never raised.

As detailed above, Plaintiff has failed to establish her constructive discharge claim.

First, Plaintiff contends she reported her coworkers' \"illegal conduct\" of making fun of her accent, food, and disability to management personnel and subsequently suffered an arbitrary shift change in retaliation. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 28-29). Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence that she reported the conduct at that time, but even if she did report it and this Court deemed that action protected activity (which is questionable), the VA provided a legitimate business reason for the shift change. The VA provides that it wanted to place Plaintiff with more supervisors that could better evaluate and educate her. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). This shifts the burden back to the Plaintiff to establish pretext.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Like in connection with other claims, Plaintiff's only \"evidence\" of pretext is a speculative assertion that the VA had surveillance cameras and that the Defendant refuses to hand over any recordings. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). However, Defendant responded to interrogatories under oath that there were no surveillance cameras at the relevant time. (DR \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). Thus, Plaintiff has not pointed to any probative evidence in the record to suggest pretext and that the adverse action was motivated by Defendant's retaliatory animus.\n    <em>\n     Calero-Cerezo v.

For the purpose of summary judgment, Defendant admits that a request for reasonable accommodation is protected activity, and that suspending and terminating Plaintiff as well as changing Plaintiff's shift would be\n    considered an adverse employment action. (DR \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 60). As pled, the Plaintiff alleges that there was a causal connection between her protected activity and her subsequent termination. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 30). It is unclear whether the referenced \"termination\" is the VA's action terminating Plaintiff's employment effective on June 26, 2015 or Plaintiff's alleged claim of constructive discharge on June 8, 2014. In either case, the VA is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Plaintiff has not put forth any evidence establishing that the VA's termination of Plaintiff's employment in 2015 was causally connected either to her complaints about her coworkers or to her denied request for a shift change in June 2014. As an initial matter, the time period is too long between the Plaintiff's conduct and the termination to imply causation. The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be 'very close[.]' \"\n    <em>\n     Clark Cty.

Here, the fact that a year passed between the allegedly protected conduct and the VA's termination of her employment in 2015 defeats Plaintiff's contention that the two are causally related.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Even assuming, however, that Plaintiff could make out a prima facie case that her protected conduct led to her constructive discharge on June 8, 2014, summary judgment for the Defendant would still be appropriate. The Plaintiff has presented no evidence to rebut Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the change in Plaintiff's schedule which purportedly led to her constructive discharge. As detailed above, the Plaintiff's letter did not mandate a night shift for health reasons, and the Plaintiff has not refuted Defendant's contention that the day shift offered more opportunities for supervision and education. (DR \u00b6 51; DF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 23-24).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In response, Plaintiff offers no evidence to rebut those reasons except for her allegations that the VA did not follow their policies in evaluating her request for accommodation and her assertion that the VA's \"explanations are tissues of lies, untrue and pretextual.\" (Pl. Mem. at 19). As discussed above, this Court does not agree that the VA's failure to follow its policies proves pretext. Additionally, \"[i]t is not enough for [Plaintiff] merely to impugn the veracity of the employer's justification; [she] must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive ....\"\n    <em>\n     Melendez v.

Plaintiff does not cite to facts or advance instances of conduct in support of her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that differ from her Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 84-85). Where, as here, the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress is \"wholly derivative from the alleged conduct giving rise to her Title VII\" and Rehabilitation Act claims, the tort claim has been preempted.\n    <em>\n     Roland v.

Ga. 2005). For this reason, this Court finds as a matter of law that Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act provide Plaintiff the sole remedy for her claims and Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Count VII is granted and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on that Count is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n     <em>\n      Count VIII: Violation of Good Faith and Fair Dealing in Employment And Contractual Relations\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In Count VIII of her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment and contractual relations due to defendants' \"discriminations, retaliations, infliction of emotional distress, hostile work environment and other unlawful conducts against plaintiff[.]\" (Compl. \u00b6 52). This Count fails for a number of reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    As an initial matter, \"without a contract, there is no covenant to be breached.\"\n    <em>\n     Mass.

Despite her denial, Defendant has established that the Plaintiff was appointed by a Standard Form 50 Notification of Personnel Action dated July 8, 2007. (DF \u00b6 1). Courts have consistently recognized that, as a general rule, \"federal employees derive their rights by appointment and not by contract[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Refaei v.

Cl. Oct. 25, 2016). Therefore, this claim must fail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Moreover, this claim is also preempted by federal law for the same reasons as the Plaintiff's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress - her claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith is based on the same conduct as forms her discrimination claims under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Finally, this claim must fail because this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this claim. \"The objection that a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction\n    may be raised by a party, or by a court on its own initiative, at any stage in the litigation, even after trial and the entry of judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Arbaugh v.

Under the Tucker Act, federal district courts have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims, over any \"civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded ... upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort ....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2). Thus, the Court of Federal Claims retains\n    <em>\n     exclusive\n    </em>\n    jurisdiction over all contract claims against the United States seeking more than $10,000. Plaintiff demands $300,000 in damages in every Count of her Complaint. This exceeds the $10,000 amount dictated under the Tucker Act and as a result, the Court of Federal Claims possesses exclusive jurisdiction over this claim. For this reason, Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to Count VIII and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on this Count is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    For the reasons detailed herein, \"Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\" (Docket No. 56) is ALLOWED and \"Plaintiff's Request for Entry of Summary Judgment in Her Favor\" (Docket No. 68) is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-108\">\n     Plaintiff argues that \"Defendants are estopped from further raising any issue concerning plaintiff's exhaustion of her administrative remedies because defendants had already admitted that plaintiff exhausted her administrative remedies,\" citing the Defendant's response to Request for Admission \u00b6 51.
