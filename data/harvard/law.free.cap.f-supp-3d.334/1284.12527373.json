Nos. 80 and 88] are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Statements about Defendant's iPhone passcodes and evidence found on his iPhones on February 17, 2016, after he provided his passcodes is suppressed. Other evidence, including evidence obtained as the result of the warrantless search of his car and non-passcode protected cell phones on February 17, 2016, and his post-arrest statements about his nickname, is admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this\n   <em>\n    12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of September, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   J. Clay Fuller, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This matter is before the undersigned on Defendant Sanchez's Motion To Suppress Evidence And Motion In Limine (Doc. 80) and Motion To Suppress Statements (Doc. 88).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons discussed below, it is\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's motions be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Sanchez and others are charged in a 12-count Indictment with drug-related offenses, including conspiracy. (Doc. 1). Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence seized by law enforcement officers without a warrant on February 17, 2016 (Doc. 80) and a motion to suppress any statements Defendant made following his February 17th arrest (Doc. 88). Defendant argued that the February 17th search violated his Fourth Amendment\n   rights because he did not consent to the search and there was no probable cause to support the search. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 80). He filed a supplemental brief in support of his motions on January 5, 2018 (Doc. 286) in which he argued that even though he was on parole at the time of the search, there was no arrest warrant or revocation petition to support the search, he \"had not waived his 4th amendment right as a condition of parole,\" and reasonable suspicion did not support the search (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). The Court conducted a hearing on Defendant's motions on January 26, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 291), and the transcript of that hearing was filed on February 13, 2018 (Doc. 294).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government filed a post-hearing brief on March 19, 2018 (Doc. 301), and Defendant filed his post-hearing brief on April 4, 2018 (Doc. 306).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the January 26, 2018 hearing, the Government submitted a brief in which it argued that the February 17, 2016 search of Defendant's car and cellphones were authorized by the parole search condition; even if reasonable suspicion were required to search, it existed; Defendant was lawfully under arrest when he provided iPhone passcodes and voluntarily provided them; and Defendant's disclosure of his nickname to GBI agents after he was arrested on the state arrest warrant was part of a routine booking procedure and therefore admissible, even though Defendant had asserted his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. (Doc. 301). Defendant then filed a reply brief (Doc. 306) in which he asserts that he did not lose the protection of the Fifth Amendment's rights against self-incrimination by virtue of his status as a parolee and therefore his Fifth Amendment rights were violated when he was required to provide his iPhone passcodes and then arrested for failing to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   306 at 7-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In an Order entered May 9, 2018 (Doc. 311), the undersigned found that Defendant's discussion of the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue was \"somewhat conclusory, not particularly well-developed, and made in his reply brief,\" and required the parties \"to submit additional briefing on whether the requirement that Defendant provide his iPhone passcodes violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and if so, what evidence, if any, should be suppressed as a result of that violation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Defendant then filed a brief (Doc. 316), and the Government responded (Doc. 322). With briefing on Defendant's motions complete, the undersigned now considers their merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In early 2016 FBI Special Agent Joe Thompson was the case agent on an investigation using wiretap surveillance with the primary target being Defendant Horace Mayfield. (Tr. 60-61). On January 16, 2016, agents heard Mayfield talking to a person about the price and quantity of methamphetamine Mayfield was going to pick up. (Tr. 61). Although the agents did not know at that time the identity of the person Mayfield was talking to, they knew the person's phone number. (Tr. 61-62). Thompson now believes that the person with whom Mayfield was speaking was Defendant Sanchez, but he and the other agents did not then know that person's\n   identity. (Tr. 62-63). The unidentified person told Mayfield that another person (later identified as Gustav Melendez) would call him and give him an address where Mayfield was going to pick up methamphetamine. (Tr. 62-63). Melendez called Mayfield and gave him an address for a Target store at 2400 North Druid Hills in Atlanta. (Tr. 63-64). Mayfield also asked Melendez, \"is this Cholo,\" and Melendez responded, \"no, this is 'G,' Cholo's cousin.\" (Tr. 73). Melendez also told Mayfield that he was in Cholo's BMW, that it was his now, and Mayfield asked if Cholo had been fired. (Tr. 73). Melendez told him \"no ... [Cholo] had just gotten too busy and that [Meledez] had taken over ... some of his business.\" (Tr. 73). Agents did not then know the identity of Cholo. (Tr. 73, 75). Agents then conducted surveillance at the Target store on January 16th, and Mayfield arrived in a BMW driven by a woman. (Tr. 64). Melendez, who was carrying a package close to his body, got into the car with Mayfield, but when Melendez exited the vehicle he was not carrying the package. (Tr. 64-65). Agents continued conducting surveillance on Melendez after January 16th and saw him in an Audi A6 which was registered to an address at 317 Ard Place in Atlanta. (Tr. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The next day, January 17th, Mayfield communicated with another individual\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   via text, and that person asked Mayfield if he had talked to \"Droop\" and asked Mayfield for Droop's number. (Tr. 74). Mayfield told the person he had spoken with Droop the day before and provided the same phone number as the phone number of the unidentified person Mayfield had initially spoken with the day before to discuss the price and quantity of the methamphetamine he was going to pick up. (Tr. 74). Agent Thompson now believes that number was Defendant Sanchez's, but the agents did not know that at the time, nor did they know the identity of \"Droop.\" (Tr. 74-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 30th the agents were following Mayfield, who traveled to the same Target store where he met Melendez on the 16th. (Tr. 66). Melendez once again entered Mayfield's vehicle and then left the location. (Tr. 66). Agents followed Melendez to nearby Druid Valley Apartments but were unable to determine to which specific apartment Melendez went. (Tr. 66). Agents later identified an apartment they believed Melendez was using and obtained a search warrant for that address, 1531 Druid Valley Drive, Apartment B, Atlanta, Georgia. (Tr. 67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 1a, 1b, 1c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   February 17, 2016 was designated as the \"takedown day\" for the wiretap investigation, i.e., the day when search warrants would be executed and targets arrested. (Tr. 68). On that day, Andrew Jerram was employed as a Community Supervision Officer with the Georgia Department of Community Supervision, which serves probation and parole officers across the state, and he is also assigned as a Task Force Officer with the FBI Safe Streets Gang Task Force. (Tr. 10-12). In 2015 the probation field supervision functions of the Department of Corrections were merged with the parole supervision functions of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to create the Department of Community Supervision, and former parole officers (now called Community Supervision Officers) such as Jerram retained the powers and authority of a parole officer to supervise parolees and probationers. (Tr. 10-12, 39-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Jerram performed perimeter security during the February 17th execution of the search warrant at 1531 Druid Valley Drive. (Tr. 12-13, 15-16, 67-68). He was accompanied by FBI Special Agents Larry Gera and Greg Donovan. (Tr. 13). No one was present in the apartment when agents made entry that day. (Tr. 68). The agents observed cash, a large quantity of methamphetamine, scales, containers with methamphetamine residue, an electronic money counter, firearms, and papers in the apartment. (Tr. 14-16, 69; Gov't Exs. 2a through 2g). One of the papers they discovered was a letter addressed to Melendez at 317 Ard Place in Atlanta, which appears to bear his signature. (Tr. 14-16, 70-71; Gov't Ex. 2g). Once Agent Thompson saw the letter with the Ard Place address, he decided to send some agents there to set up surveillance. (Tr. 72). Jerram, Donovan, and Agent Prince went to that address to watch it until other agents could go there to talk to the residents. (Tr. 14-15). They arrived at 10:49 a.m. (Tr. 41, 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While they were watching the Ard Place address, a single family residence, the agents observed a white Lexus sedan pull up and park on the street at 11:05 a.m. (Tr. 15-17, 41, 55). Defendant exited the vehicle and began talking to someone who had come out of the residence, later identified as Wilfredo Otero. (Tr. 17, 42-44). A couple of minutes later it appeared that the men were going to leave, so Agent Donovan said that the agents should talk to the men to find out who they are. (Tr. 17, 55). Jerram and Donovan exited their vehicles and approached the men, who were near the white sedan and the mailbox in the front yard of the house. (Tr. 18). Jerram was dressed in khaki cargo pants, wearing his soft armor carrier which houses his bulletproof vest and identified him as a DCS officer, his weapon holstered on his side, and his badge. (Tr. 18-19). Agent Donovan wore an olive drab armor carrier that identified him as an FBI agent and a holstered weapon. (Tr. 19). Neither agents drew their weapon. (Tr. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The agents told the men that Agent Donovan was with the FBI and Officer Jerram was with the Department of Community Supervision, they explained that they were doing an investigation, and they asked the men if they would talk with the agents, and the men agreed. (Tr. 20, 44-45). The agents spoke with the men in a conversational tone. (Tr. 20). Jerram asked them if they were on probation or parole, and Defendant said that he was on parole. (Tr. 21, 46). As a parole officer, Jerram knew that Defendant was required to abide by certain parole conditions, and he knew that he could access information about Defendant on his state-issued computer. (Tr. 21). Jerram asked him for his complete name and his Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) number, which he provided along with his parole officer's name. (Tr. 21). Defendant was not free to leave once he identified himself as a parolee. (Tr. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant's status as a parolee was reflected in standard documents which were the subject of testimony at the hearing. Once the Parole Board decides to parole an inmate, a Parole Certificate, which contains both specific and standard conditions of parole, is generated and maintained in a computer system. (Tr. 23-25). The inmate is required to sign the certificate in order to be released from prison. (Tr. 24). The inmate is then required to meet with a parole officer, who goes over the Parole Certificate again and has the parolee sign the form again. (Tr. 24-25). Defendant's Parole Certificate indicates that he was paroled in January 2015 with a parole expiration date of April 8, 2017, and his standard conditions include, among other conditions, \"I will truthfully answer all questions and follow all written and verbal\n   instructions from my parole officer or any other employee of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles\" and \"My parole officer or any other parole officer may, at any time, conduct a warrantless search of my person, papers, and place of residence, automobile, or any other property under my control.\" (Gov't Ex. 17). Defendant signed the certificate acknowledging those conditions and indicating that he understood them and agreed to comply with them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jerram knew that those conditions are standard for all parolees in Georgia and that they applied to Defendant as a parolee. (Tr. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Jerram made two observations that \"caught [his] attention.\" (Tr. 30). First, Defendant had not been out of prison very long but \"was driving a very, very new luxury style vehicle.\" (Tr. 30-31). In addition, Jerram observed \"multiple cellphones that were visible\" in the front passenger seat, \"including some that had small numbers taped to the back of them.\" (Tr. 31, 47). In Jerram's experience, having multiple phones indicates that the phones were \"burner\" or \"drop\" phones used by persons involved in drug trafficking to communicate with customers or suppliers. (Tr. 31-32). Those observations coupled with the fact that they were conducting a narcotics investigation led Jerram to believe that Defendant \"may be involved in narcotics trafficking.\" (Tr. 31). Jerram asked Defendant why he had so many phones, and he told Jerram that he worked at a Cricket Wireless store. (Tr. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Jerram reminded Defendant that he was a parole officer and told him he was going to do a parole search of his vehicle and asked if he had anything Jerram needed to know about for officer safety purposes. (Tr. 32). Defendant said he did not have anything and he did not raise any objections. (Tr. 32). Jerram searched the car at 11:15 a.m., which was roughly 8 minutes after he initially approached Defendant, and other than the phones, he did not find anything consistent with drug trafficking. (Tr. 32-33, 55). Defendant was not handcuffed or restrained at that point. (Tr. 50, 55). Jerram wanted to search Sanchez's phones \"for any digital evidence of parole violation,\" and he believed he could search them pursuant to Sanchez's parole conditions. (Tr. 33). He was able to access some of the phones, the Cricket phones, without passcodes, but two of the phones were iPhones and passcode-protected. (Tr. 33, 50). He asked Sanchez for the passcodes for the iPhones, but Defendant refused to provide them, stating, \"I'm not going to give you the passcode.\" (Tr. 33-34, 50). Jerram explained to him that \"failure to follow instructions from a parole officer could result in his arrest ... for a violation of parole,\" and Sanchez again stated, \"I'm not going to give you the passcode.\" (Tr. 34, 50, 56). Jerram then placed Defendant in handcuffs and requested a parole warrant for Defendant's arrest. (Tr. 34, 51, 56). Jerram stopped questioning Defendant at that point. (Tr. 52). Jerram contacted Field Operations Officer Alan Smith and \"let him know what was going on,\" including his observations that made him suspicious, his search of the car, and Defendant's refusal to provide the passwords for the phones. (Tr. 35-36). Smith then prepared a parole warrant, obtained a parole board member's signature on the warrant, and let Jerram know that it had been signed. (Tr. 35-36). Jerram received the parole warrant at 11:21; the process of obtaining it took \"two minutes at the most.\" (Tr. 36, 56). Jerram told Defendant that a parole warrant had been issued for his arrest based on his failure to follow instructions from a parole office and searched him to make sure he did not have any weapons, a handcuff key, or contraband around his waistband and did not find any. (Tr. 34, 36-37). The agents had\n   Defendant sit on the curb near his car. (Tr. 34). Jerram did not advise Defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights at any point during their encounter. (Tr. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At 11:45 a.m. Defendant said, \"I'll give you the passcode,\" and Jerram said, \"okay, what's the passcode.\" (Tr. 37, 57). Jerram had not told Defendant that if he provided the passcode Jerram would cancel the warrant. (Tr. 37). Defendant provided the passcodes and Jerram wrote them down and also entered them in the phones, which unlocked them. (Tr. 38). Jerram did a \"cursory review\" of recent text messages and images, \"the areas where criminal conversations most tend to be [on a] phone,\" and he saw an image file with instructions on how to set up a \"trap house,\" i.e., a place where drugs are distributed. (Tr. 38-39). That observation made Jerram \"believe that this is something that the case agent should probably get a federal search warrant so that they can do a complete extraction on the phone.\" (Tr. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Agent Thompson arrived at the scene, possibly around noon, and saw Defendant in handcuffs; he was told that Defendant had been taken into custody on a parole warrant. (Tr. 75). At some point Jerram showed him something on one of the iPhones, some texts relevant to drug activity and a phone number listed as Defendant's work number. (Tr. 76). That number, (404) 632-5012, was the same number as the number of the person Mayfield spoke with on January 16th about the price and quantity of methamphetamine and that Mayfield had identified as \"Droop's\" number in his January 17th text. (Tr. 76-77). Thompson also looked at his \"linesheets\" for the wiretap conversations and saw that that phone number was the number of the person Mayfield spoke with on January 16th. (Tr. 79). Thompson then called GBI Special Agent Clay Bridges to give him that information, and Bridges said that they would get a state arrest warrant for Defendant's arrest for the drug conspiracy they were investigating. (Tr. 79-80). Otero and Defendant were taken into GBI custody and transported to the GBI command center in Toccoa in Stephens County to be interviewed by the GBI. (Tr. 80, 89-93, 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   GBI Special Agent Jamie Abercrombie was assigned to the GBI command post on February 17, 2016 to assist with interviews and other operations. (Tr. 89-91). She also prepared and obtained arrest warrants from a Stephens County Superior Court Judge for Defendant and other individuals. (Tr. 91-92, 99-100; Gov't Ex. 7). After Defendant was transported to the command post, Agents Bridges and Abercrombie met with Defendant to interview him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 93). Agent Bridges asked Defendant identification questions to complete the top part of the waiver of rights form, and Abercrombie asked Defendant a couple of questions about identifying information that was needed to complete the Arrest Record form but that was not on the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   form, including his nickname, which he identified as \"Droopy.\" (Tr. 95-98, 102-03; Gov't Exs. 10, 11, 12). After Bridges finished reading Defendant his rights, Defendant exercised his right to remain silent and for an attorney, so an interview was not conducted. (Tr. 95, 97, 102; Gov't Exs. 11, 12). Abercrombie then asked Defendant additional biographical information to complete the Arrest Record form, which Defendant signed. (Tr. 96; Gov't Exs. 10, 12). Agent Abercrombie had been briefed on the wiretap investigation, but she had not participated in the investigation and she did not know Defendant or know of any nicknames he used or the significance of any nicknames he used. (Tr. 90-92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant was then transported to the Stephens County Jail. (Tr. 101, 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant contends that evidence seized as a result of the warrantless search of his vehicle and cellphones should be suppressed because it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that his statements about his iPhone passcodes, evidence found on his iPhones, and his post-arrest statements about his nickname should be suppressed because that evidence was obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

In that case, the Court noted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   There was no overt act or threat of force against Watson proved or claimed. There were no promises made to him and no indication of more subtle forms of coercion that might flaw his judgment. He had been arrested and was in custody, but his consent was given while on a public street, not in the confines of the police station. Moreover, the fact of custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate a coerced confession or consent to search. Similarly, under\n   <em>\n    Schneckloth\n   </em>\n   , the absence of proof that Watson knew he could withhold his consent, though it may be a factor in the overall judgment, is not to be given controlling significance. There is no indication that Watson was a newcomer to the law, mentally deficient, or unable in the face of custodial arrest to exercise a free choice. He was given Miranda warnings and was further cautioned that the results of the search of his car could be used against him. He persisted in his consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177768\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/411/\">\n    423 U.S. at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177768\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/411/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the circumstances surrounding Defendant giving Officer Jerram the passcodes undermines a finding that he did so voluntarily. He repeatedly refused to provide the passcodes, even after he was threatened with arrest if he continued to refuse, and he was then arrested and\n   placed in handcuffs based on his refusal. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   , Defendant was not advised of his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , even after Officer Jerram arrested him. Only minutes after being arrested he provided the passcodes. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   , it was Defendant's attempt to exercise his to remain silent that formed the basis for his arrest, thus indicating that he was \"unable in the face of a custodial arrest to exercise a free choice.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177768\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/411/\">\n    423 U.S. at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177768\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/411/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to the second inquiry described in\n   <em>\n    Delancy\n   </em>\n   , the Government has not proven that Defendant's purported \"consent,\" i.e., his providing the passcodes to Officer Jerram, was not \"the product of the underlying illegality\" as the Government contends.

He was placed in the \"classic penalty situation\" described in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , threatened with arrest if he did not provide the passcodes, and only provided them after he was arrested for failing to provide them.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 306 at 9-10; Doc. 316 at 10-11).
