(ECF No. 208).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 22, 2016, the City of San Diego (the \"City\") filed the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") against Defendants Monsanto Company, Solutia Inc., and Pharmacia Corporation (collectively, Monsanto). (ECF No. 93). The City brings a single cause of action against Monsanto for a continuing nuisance arising from alleged PCB contamination of the San Diego Bay (\"the Bay\") and the City's municipal stormwater system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City alleges that\n   \"Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer actual damages and injuries to property requiring abatement and other costs to be determined at trial\" as a result of Monsanto's creation of a public nuisance through its production and marketing of PCBs and improper disposal directions related to PCBs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. The City alleges that Monsanto is liable to the City for the creation of a public nuisance. The City seeks the following relief: (1) any and all compensatory damages according to proof; (2) punitive damages; (3) litigation costs and attorney's fees; (4) pre-judgment and post-judgment interest; and (5) \"any other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 22, 2017, this Court denied a motion to dismiss the City's SAC filed by Monsanto. (ECF No. 163). The Court concluded that the City adequately alleged a property interest in its municipal stormwater system which had been injuriously affected by the presence of PCBs produced by Monsanto and that the City alleged sufficient facts to state a non-representative public nuisance claim. The Court further denied a motion to stay or dismiss the suit under administrative exhaustion principles pending resolution of the City's test claims before the California Commission on State Mandates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 22, 2018, Monsanto filed the First Amended Answer and Counterclaims. (ECF No. 203). Monsanto denies liability for the alleged contamination of the Bay and injuries claimed by the City. Further, Monsanto alleges that the City is responsible for the contamination of the Bay because \"throughout the twentieth century to the present,\" the City has \"discharged, or caused to be discharged, a variety of pollutants into the Bay, including PCBs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21. Monsanto brings the following two causes of actions as counterclaims against the City: (1) unjust enrichment and (2) violations of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") and the City's NPDES\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Instead the City's own conduct vis-\u00e0-vis the Bay is marked by decades of neglect, mismanagement, and contamination, which has led to the conditions about which it complains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (ECF No. 203 at \u00b6 20). \"The City has, throughout the twentieth century to the present, discharged, or caused to be discharged, a variety of pollutants into the Bay, including PCBs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. \"Notable sources of the City's discharges include its: (1) storm water discharges; (2) inadequate maintenance of sites under its control; (3) failure to follow best management practices with regard to construction and demolition activities; and (4) use and disposal of PCB-containing products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"For many decades, the Bay served as the final destination point for city-wide industrial discharges, intentionally facilitated by the City for economic gain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The City operated a downtown landfill and incinerator that discharged industrial waste into the Bay prior to the early 1950s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. \"From 1943-1963, the City located its main sewage treatment plant along the Bay ...

Throughout the twentieth century and continuing to this day, the City's MS4 has discharged waste commonly found in urban runoff into the Bay subject to the conditions of NPDES Permits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. The City's storm water discharges into the Bay include a variety of pollutants, including PCBs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. \"[B]ecause the City fails to take reasonable measures to reduce the discharge of PCBs, the City's storm water continues to include PCBs at levels that are greater than the CWA allows.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. \"[D]uring the over fifty years in which the City controlled the San Diego Bay tidelands and chose its industrial tenants, in exchange for rental income, the City leased tideland properties to heavy industrial dischargers that used and disposed of PCBs and other contaminants, without ensuring adequate pollution controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The City has been specifically identified as a \"liable discharger of PCBs and other contaminants under California Water Code Section 13304\" in a Cleanup and Abatement Order (\"CAO\") issued by the State of California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. The City is a \"significant property owner\" and \"has failed to require even the most basic measures to prevent PCB discharges from its own construction, renovation, and demolition activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68, 70. \"[T]he City at all relevant times through today has purchased, used, and disposed of a variety of PCB-containing products ... in a manner that has resulted in discharges into the Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The City's past and ongoing discharges of PCBs and other pollutants have caused [Monsanto] to incur investigation costs related to conditions in the Bay caused by the City's discharges, and have also created significant contingent liability in the instant lawsuit, as well as the First Amended Complaint filed by the Port District. This contingent liability continually increases with every discharge of PCBs and other pollutants by the City-which continue to the present day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result of the City's discharges of PCBs and other pollutants, [Monsanto] ha[s] incurred, and will continue to incur, a variety of investigation costs in connection with the Bay. These costs include but are not limited to: (1) identification and analysis of historic and current sources of potential contamination for the Bay, including public records review, analysis of existing data, research on the conveyance and drainage systems, assessment of current and historic source control efforts at various Bay site locations, and investigatory costs to identify the volume and location of the PCBs discharged by the City; (2) analysis of the potential impacts on the Bay from Non-Monsanto Produced PCBs, and potential sources of those Non-Monsanto Produced PCBs; (3) review and analysis of sampling and investigation data from the Bay, and investigation of potential data gaps; (4) investigation and analysis of the contaminated sediments at certain locations in the Bay; (5) analysis of the potential\n   source control and other options to address conditions in the Bay; and (6) analysis of PCBs in the Bay to assist with identification of the sources of current and historic PCB contamination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. \"These efforts are ongoing and [Monsanto] will continue to incur investigation costs for the foreseeable future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The investigations and analyses ... are directed to assessing, evaluating, and monitoring releases of hazardous substances, including PCBs, in the Bay. These activities will generate information that is necessary to determine what, if any, source control measures are warranted, and help identify source control efforts that are tailored to the contamination, including efforts to address the City's non-compliance with the CWA and its NPDES Permits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Monsanto] ha[s] incurred investigation costs that would be necessary to address the City's discharges even in the absence of the present suit. Incurrence of these costs is a necessary predicate for addressing contamination in the Bay, since identifying sources of PCB discharges and the locations of the resulting PCB deposits are requisite first steps to addressing and remedying the City's PCB-laden storm water discharges in violation of the CWA and it NPDES Permits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   As a result of the City's conduct, [Monsanto] ha[s] also incurred costs in defending the City's and Port District's lawsuits. On its face, this lawsuit likely would never have been brought but for the City's discharges of PCBs, ownership and operation of PCB-contaminated facilities, and mismanagement of PCB sources within its jurisdiction. That is particularly true as the City seeks as damages increased regulatory costs and infrastructure improvements to reduce its discharges of PCBs in its storm water .... If the City were not discharging PCBs in violation of the CWA and its NPDES Permits in the first place, it would have no need to bring this lawsuit to recover the costs of reducing its own PCB discharges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. \"Even if the City's and Port District's lawsuits would have occurred without the City's own actions, inactions, and discharges, those PCB-laden discharges increase [Monsanto's] potential liability in this case and thus have reasonably caused [Monsanto] to expend additional costs as a result of this increased exposure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. \"[T]he City's management decisions with respect to PCB-containing products and discharges have increased [Monsanto's] litigation exposure, which has reasonably caused [Monsanto] to expend additional costs as a result of the increased exposure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"In 2008, the County of San Diego [ ], along with the City and 20 other municipalities within the County ('Claimants') filed a 'test claim' with the Commission [on State Mandates] that challenged certain provisions of the City's 2007 MS4 Permit and contended that those provisions constituted an unfunded State mandate for which the Claimants are entitled to reimbursement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.

The City contends that Monsanto fails to state a claim for unjust enrichment because unjust enrichment is not a standalone cause of action. Further, the City contends that any damages that may be awarded to the City in this action would not be unjust or inequitable because California law specifically provides for an appropriate apportionment of fault at the time any judgment is awarded. The City contends that Monsanto's argument that damages awarded in this case would unjustly enrich the City in light of the unfunded state mandate proceedings is an \"attempt[ ] to relitigate the same failed arguments\" previously raised by Monsanto. (ECF No. 208-1 at 18).
