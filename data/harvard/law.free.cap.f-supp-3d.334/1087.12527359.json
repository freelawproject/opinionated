For some wheels, USArim.com refers to the wheel as a \"replica\" Mercedes Benz wheel, but this is not always the case.

In 2015, Plaintiff's investigator purchased wheels from USArim.com. The wheels contain the Three-Point Star mark on the center cap. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 33-79, 33-80.)

Indeed, the only evidence produced by Defendants that the caps are genuine is a declaration by Mr. Moalemi stating such. (\"Moalemi Decl.,\" ECF No. 70-1, \u00b6 5.) There is no evidence to support this declaration, and the declaration is disproven by Plaintiff's evidence. Plaintiff produced a picture of a wheel purchased by its investigator from USARim.com. (ECF No. 33-80, at 2.) This wheel contains an end cap with the three-point star. Plaintiff also produced at oral argument an end cap that came attached to a wheel purchased by Plaintiff's investigator. Plaintiff states its investigator purchased wheels, including the 19-GMT wheel, from Defendants that included the end cap bearing the three-point star design. (MSJ 15.) Plaintiff also included a declaration by Sven-Eric Widmayer, Legal Counsel for Legal Global Litigation-Brand Protection at Daimler AG. (ECF No. 89-1.) Mr. Widmayer declares \"[t]he purchased 20-AMG wheels ... and the purchased 19-GMT wheels ... [from USARIM] are not genuine products manufactured or authorized by Daimler.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.a.) The wheels use the three-point star mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9.b., 9.c.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court has examined the two products produced at oral argument and determines the end cap from Defendants' wheels is clearly different from Plaintiff's end cap. The back of Plaintiff's end cap contains a part number. The back of Defendants' end cap contains a sticker with what appears to be Chinese characters printed on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   These clear differences, along with the evidence and declaration provided by Plaintiff, negate Mr. Moalemi's unsupported declaration that Defendants' end caps are genuine. Therefore, Defendants are not protected by the first sale doctrine.

Under the alter ego doctrine, \"where a corporation is used by an individual or individuals, or by another corporation, to perpetrate fraud, circumvent a statute, or accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, a court may disregard the corporate entity and treat the corporation's acts as if they were done by the persons actually controlling the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a party asserting the doctrine must show two requirements: \"(1) a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist; and (2) that an inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated as those of the corporation alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 899,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20594\">\n    88 Cal.Rptr.2d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It also states: \"We manufacture our wheels in several OEM approved factories through Asia.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 37.) OEM stands for \"original equipment manufacturer.\" Mr. Moalemi admitted he does not \"deal with the Mercedes-Benz-approved factory.\" (\"Moalemi Depo.,\" ECF No. 58-19, at 12.) He testified that the statements from the website mean his company \"go[es] through\" a company that \"do[es] wheels for\" Mercedes. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) But, there is no evidence that consumers looking at the website would read the statements in this way.

Plaintiff has alleged Defendants are using Plaintiff's mark to sell products online, and consumers would clearly see the wheels and the mark online when buying purchasing the products.
