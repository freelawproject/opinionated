DEVER III, Chief United States District Judge\n   On July 2, 2015, Western Plastics, Inc., (\"WP\" or \"plaintiff\") filed this action against DuBose Strapping, Inc., (\"DuBose\" or \"defendant\") alleging patent infringement [D.E. 1]. On September 8, 2017, DuBose moved for partial summary judgment [D.E. 49]. On October 9, 2017, WP moved for partial summary judgment on some of DuBose's defenses [D.E. 97]. As explained below, the court denies DuBose's motion for partial summary judgment, and grants in part and denies in part WP's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   WP owns United States Patent No. 8,080,304 (\"the '304 Patent\"). Compl. [D.E. 1] \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The '304 Patent, entitled \"Multi-Layer Wrap,\" covers \"a stretchable multi-layer metal coil wrap product\" that WP sells commercially as Panacea Wrap (\"Panacea\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8-11. In essence, Panacea consists of two thin plastic films that cling to each other with a mesh layer in between to restrict stretching and increase the durability of the wrap material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 52-1] 23; [D.E. 51] \u00b6 14; [D.E. 1-1]. Customers use the product to wrap large rolls of metal coil produced in the metal industry inpreparation for transportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12; [D.E. 51] \u00b6\u00b6 5-9. WP first sold Panacea during the first quarter of 2006. [D.E. 99] \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thomas Clarke is the President of WP and is the sole inventor listed on the '304 Patent. [D.E. 99] \u00b6 1. Clarke allegedly envisioned the idea for Panacea in 2005 following discussions with Globopro, [D.E. 99] \u00b6\u00b6 70-72, and he filed patent applications in Canada (on February 1, 2006) and the United States (on February 5, 2006).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 52-1] 10; [D.E. 51] \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. On December 20, 2011, the '304 Patent was granted. Compl. \u00b6 8. The United States Patent and Trademark Office considered thirty-six cited references and issued six Office Actions before granting the patent [D.E. 99] \u00b6\u00b6 27-28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 51] \u00b6\u00b6 79-147.

Jack Shirrell was the Vice President of Film Technology at Illinois Tool Works-Muller (\"ITW-Muller\") when the '909 Patent was granted on September 13, 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 99] \u00b6 5; [D.E. 100-20]. Jeff Kellermann was the President of the Metals Group of Illinois Tool Works Fleetwood-Signode (\"ITW-Fleetwood\"), and the Shirrell Patent lists Kellermann as a co-inventor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 99] \u00b6 4; [D.E. 100-20]. While working at ITW-Fleetwood, Kellermann was a customer of WP and purchased Panacea for resale [D.E. 99] \u00b6 17. In January 2003, Shirrell filed for the '909 Patent and developed a prototype wrap product at a WP facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 51\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-55; [D.E. 99] \u00b6\u00b6 41-44. The parties dispute whether Shirrell's prototype product was ever commercially developed or sold as a product called \"5G\" or \"5GF TamaNet.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 51] \u00b6\u00b6 55-60,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 99] \u00b6\u00b6 54-63. The parties also dispute whether the prototype is the same design as disclosed in the '909 Patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 127] 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kellermann is now DuBose's Chief Operating Officer. [D.E. 99] \u00b6 3. In 2014, Kellermann began exploring options for using the Shirrell prototype to create a product to compete with Panacea. [D.E. 51] \u00b6\u00b6 152-53. DuBose was aware of the '304 Patent and sought legal advice before introducing a competing product. [D.E. 51] \u00b6\u00b6 154-60. In 2015, DuBose introduced \"FlexStretch,\" a metal coil wrap comprised of \"bale netting laminated in between layers of stretch film.\" [D.E. 51] \u00b6 160;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 2, 2015, WP filed a complaint against DuBose alleging direct and induced patent infringement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) based on the sale of FlexStretch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 1, 4-7; [D.E. 66] (dismissing induced infringement claim). DuBose answered on August 24, 2015, and filed four counterclaims against WP for: (1) noninfringement, (2) patent invalidity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 03, (3) inequitable conduct rendering the patent unenforceable, and (4) patent invalidity for improper inventorship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 14];\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 66] (conceding infringement).

[D.E. 18]. After a series of motions to amend, the court filed an amended scheduling order. [D.E. 30]. Under the final scheduling order, expert reports were due on October 25, 2016 (if party had burden of proof on issue) or November 23, 2016 (if party did not have burden of proof on issue).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court set the close of discovery for May 9, 2017.

On the same day, the court ordered the parties to attend a settlement conference. [D.E. 43]. On July 11, 2017, the parties attended a settlement conference with Magistrate Judge Gates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 46, 47].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 8, 2017, DuBose moved for partial summary judgment, [D.E. 49], and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 50], a statement of material facts [D.E. 51], and an appendix to the statement of material facts [D.E. 52]. DuBose sought summary judgment on its claims that either WP's patent was unenforceable or invalid [D.E. 49] 1. Alternatively, DuBose sought partial summary judgment on WP's claim for recovery of lost profits and WP's claim that DuBose willfully infringed WP's patent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   DuBose also filed two motions in limine and supporting memoranda to exclude and limit testimony from Robert Stoll and Christopher Schulte [D.E. 55, 56, 57, 58].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 9, 2017, WP moved for partial summary judgment concerning various defenses of DuBose [D.E. 97], and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 98], a statement of material facts [D.E. 99], and an appendix to the statement of material facts [D.E. 100]. WP previously had filed motions in limine to exclude DuBose's expert witness Art MacCord [D.E. 61, 65] and to dismiss DuBose's invalidity claim [D.E. 60]. On September 10, 2017, WP also filed a motion entering a stipulation that DuBose had infringed WP's patent and dismissing WP's claim for induced infringement [D.E. 66].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 30, 2017, WP opposed DuBose's motion for summary judgment [D.E. 108] and filed a statement of material facts [D.E. 109, 115]. On the same day, DuBose opposed WP's motion for summary judgment [D.E. 110] and filed a statement of material facts [D.E. 111, 112]. Also on October 30, 2017, DuBose moved to strike, in part, the testimony of Dr. Robert Kimmel [D.E. 117] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 118].
