Due to his belief that the area was dangerous, Diaz radioed for help from Border Patrol Agent Chad Nelson, the closest agent in the area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.

Immediately after Diaz exited his patrol vehicle, Ya\u00f1ez crawled back though the hole in the primary border fence onto the Mexican side of the fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Murietta remained in the United States and started climbing a pole that leads up to a catwalk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Diaz ran to the top of the catwalk in order to cut Murietta off, while Nelson stayed on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.

Nelson chased Murietta and yelled at him in Spanish to stop and give him his hands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Murietta did not comply with Nelson's commands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Murietta eventually tripped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. Nelson caught up to Murietta, at which point they engaged in a physical struggle on the ground during which Murietta resisted Nelson's attempt to control him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. This struggle occurred within fifteen feet of the primary border fence.

Diaz yelled at Ya\u00f1ez in Spanish to get down off of the fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Ya\u00f1ez briefly disappeared behind the primary border fence then quickly reappeared and threw a nail-studded wooden table leg at Nelson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43. The table leg hit Nelson in the head, but delivered \"more of a glancing blow [than] an incapacitating one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44. Diaz witnessed Ya\u00f1ez throw the table leg and the table leg make contact with Nelson's head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Diaz then drew his firearm and yelled\n   at Ya\u00f1ez to get down off of the fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. Ya\u00f1ez's eyes lit up upon seeing the gun, and he retreated back down from the primary border fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nelson, meanwhile, continued struggling with Murietta and managed to get one handcuff on Murietta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Nelson was not able to handcuff Murietta's other hand due to Murietta's continued resistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Diaz approached the struggle and began hitting Murietta in an attempt to get Murietta under control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Diaz anticipated that Ya\u00f1ez might reappear on the primary border fence and continue to throw objects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. With Nelson still struggling with Murietta, Diaz walked slightly west in an attempt to surprise Ya\u00f1ez in the event he reappeared on the primary border fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. Diaz then observed Ya\u00f1ez look over top of the primary border fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. Ya\u00f1ez was visible from the chest up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ya\u00f1ez cocked his hand back as if to throw something at Nelson, at which point Diaz shot Ya\u00f1ez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After he was shot, Ya\u00f1ez's body fell back onto the south side of the primary border fence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. Ya\u00f1ez died from the gunshot wound. Supplemental Declaration of Vincent Di Maio, M.D., ECF No. 84-5, at 274. When Ya\u00f1ez was shot, Nino and her son were standing in Mexico where Ya\u00f1ez had left them. Nino Depo. at 11. Murietta was handcuffed and subdued shortly after Ya\u00f1ez was shot.

The evidence that the Court found supported that conclusion included Nino's statement that she and her son \"were always against the border fence at the time [they] witnessed the killing\" and an expert report stating that the relevant portion of the primary border fence is located approximately two feet into the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (citing ECF No. 48-1 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At her deposition, Nino stated that she and her son were actually standing in Mexico when Ya\u00f1ez was shot.
