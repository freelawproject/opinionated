[Dkt. # 1] \u00b6 18, has challenged a regulation issued by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Alex M. Azar, II. The regulation at issue implements Section\n   216 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\"PAMA\") by requiring certain laboratories to report pricing information to the agency for use in establishing Medicare rates. Plaintiff contends that the definition of the term \"applicable laboratory\" in the regulation violates PAMA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). In response, defendant asserts that in the statute, Congress expressly precluded judicial review of issues such as these, and the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the case. While the Court acknowledges that plaintiff's arguments on the merits raise important questions, it agrees with defendant that it cannot resolve this dispute, and it will dismiss this matter for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The federal Medicare program, established by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled.\n   <em>\n    Amgen, Inc. v.

So the statute required the Secretary to establish \"parameters for data collection.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395m-1(a)(12). The Secretary's determination about which laboratories would report their private payor payment is analogous to the determination about which time frame the Secretary would use in making the estimate in\n   <em>\n    Florida Health\n   </em>\n   : there was a universe of data the Secretary could use, and the Secretary identified the subset to be used in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, the decision of which laboratories must report data is \"indispensable\" and \"integral\" to, and \"inextricably intertwined\" with, the agency action's calculation of payment amounts based on that data and \"the establishment of payment amounts under\" Section 216.
