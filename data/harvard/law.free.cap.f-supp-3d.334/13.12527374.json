INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Four months before the 2016 presidential election, on June 27, 2016, former President Bill Clinton met with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch on board an airplane parked on the tarmac at a Phoenix airport. The meeting prompted speculation and attacks from critics as to whether the two had discussed the Department of Justice's investigation into Democratic nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") suit concerns records generated in the wake of the June 2016 meeting. Plaintiff American Center for Law and Justice submitted a FOIA request to the FBI seeking a variety of records related to the Clinton-Lynch meeting. What remains of this case is quite narrow. At issue are Defendant Department of Justice's redaction of two records under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) and Exemption 5, respectively. For the reasons that follow, the court concludes that the redactions are proper and enters judgment in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 15, 2016, Plaintiff American Center for Law and Justice submitted a FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), a component of Defendant Department of Justice. Compl., ECF No. 1, Ex. A, ECF No. 1-1. Plaintiff sought \"any and all records pertaining to Attorney General Loretta Lynch's meeting with former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016, which occurred on her airplane at the Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 9, 17. On October 21, 2016, the FBI answered Plaintiff's FOIA request, reporting that it had not located any responsive records. Compl., Ex. C, ECF No. 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 10, 2017, however, the FBI reopened Plaintiff's FOIA request and informed Plaintiff that it had found potentially responsive records. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 14 [hereinafter Def.'s Mot.], Decl. of David M. Hardy, ECF No. 14-2 [hereinafter Hardy Decl.], \u00b6 13. One month later, Plaintiff filed the action before the court, alleging that Defendant had improperly withheld records by failing to respond to Plaintiff's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. On November 30, 2017, Defendant produced 29 pages of responsive records to Plaintiff. Joint Status Report, ECF No. 12, at 1. While the FBI released some pages in full, it withheld information found on other pages pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Hardy Decl. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following Defendant's production, both parties moved for summary judgment. Defendant argued that the FBI had conducted an adequate search and that its withholdings were proper.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 1. In support of its motion, Defendant submitted a declaration from David M. Hardy, the Section Chief of the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section. Hardy Decl. \u00b6 1. Hardy described the FBI's searches for responsive records,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-21, and the FBI's justifications for its withholdings,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff challenged the adequacy of the agency's search and several of Defendant's withholdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 16 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mot.], at 5-14. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that the FBI improperly asserted Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to withhold FBI employees' names and contact information in two pages of released emails.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-12 (citing Def.'s Mot., Hardy Decl., Ex. H, ECF No. 14-2 [hereinafter Disclosures], at FBI-7, FBI-12). Additionally, Plaintiff argued that the FBI improperly asserted Exemption 5 to withhold talking points contained within released emails.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 12-14 (citing Disclosures at FBI-2-3, FBI-23-24). Defendant subsequently conducted additional searches and released 18 additional pages, prompting Plaintiff to drop its challenge to the adequacy of the search. Joint Status Report, ECF No. 21 [hereinafter JSR], at 1-2; Def.'s Reply in Further Supp. of Def.'s Mot. &amp; Opp'n to\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 22 [hereinafter Def.'s Reply], Third Decl. of David M. Hardy, ECF No. 22-2 [hereinafter Third Hardy Decl.], \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-5. Plaintiff also dropped one of its initial claims regarding a withholding made under Exemptions 6 and 7(C), and it did not challenge any of the FBI's new withholdings. Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross-Mot., ECF No. 24 [hereinafter Pl.'s Reply], at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   What remains of this dispute is quite limited. The parties' cross-motions concern only redactions of two disclosed records-one withholding under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) and one under Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Cir. 2011). Courts tasked with evaluating withholdings made pursuant to both statutory exemptions generally look first to the agency's justification under Exemption 7(C), because information properly withheld under Exemption 7(C) would also be covered by Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roth v.

This court will do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant's reliance on Exemption 7(C) can be disposed of quickly. \"To determine whether records are compiled for law enforcement purposes, [the D.C. Circuit] has long emphasized that the focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested files were compiled and whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be characterized as an enforcement proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Clemente v.

Here, Defendant's declarant has not established that the email in question-labeled FBI-12-was \"compiled for law enforcement purposes.\" Hardy broadly states that documents containing 7(C) withholdings \"were compiled in the course of the FBI's investigation of (1) a potential breach in law enforcement related security protocol concerning the security detail of the Attorney General; or (2) compiled in the course of an ongoing FBI sensitive law enforcement and national security investigation.\" Third Hardy Decl. \u00b6 17. But he does not make a specific statement as to why FBI-12 was created for such purposes. Nor are any of the law enforcement purposes Hardy describes obvious from the face of FBI-12. The email references a conference call; in context, it appears that\n   the purpose of that call is related to a media inquiry regarding the Clinton-Lynch meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosures at FBI-12-13. In short, Defendant has not carried its burden of making a connection between the email and an enforcement proceeding. Exemption 7(C) therefore does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court proceeds to analyze Defendant's withholdings under Exemption 6. To determine whether a withholding under Exemption 6 is proper, the court \"balance[s] the private interest involved (namely, the individual's right of privacy) against the public interest (namely ... to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny).\"\n   <em>\n    Horowitz v.

The talking points in this case can fairly be categorized as predecisional because they were \"drafted before and in preparation for communications with the press and public\" and are \"a critical aspect of the decision-making process.\" Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. The withheld material also qualifies as deliberative in that the talking points \"reflect the drafters' opinions and analyses on specific topics and focus on how to best ... respond to questions on these topics from the Defendant's perspective.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Thus, the withheld talking points are protected from disclosure under Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff's contention that these are \"final\" talking points, and therefore not predecisional, is unconvincing. As Judge Kelly succinctly explained in rejecting the same \"finality\" argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   This argument fails to appreciate the nature of talking points generally and the particular context surrounding the June 28 talking points.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Talking points are typically documents prepared by government employees for the consideration of government decision-makers. There may be some circumstances where \"talking points\" are intended by agency decisionmakers to be followed literally such that they, in and of themselves, represent the agency's decision about what to say. But the \"final\" version of talking points prepared by more junior staffers for a more senior official is rarely the final decision about what the senior official will say. Rather, a senior official ... may elect to use all, some, or none of the talking points prepared for her. Perhaps to the chagrin of their junior staffers, senior officials have a tendency to improvise. And even when senior officials do follow their talking points, they often do not recite the points word-for-word.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Am. Ctr. for Law &amp; Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204283561\">\n    2018 WL 4283561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (cleaned up). The talking points at issue here illustrate these realities. Melanie Newman, the Director of the Department of Justice's Office of Public Affairs, forwarded the talking points to colleagues at the FBI. One of them in turn shared the talking points with, among others, then Director James Comey and then Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosures at FBI-2. Thus, placed in context, these talking points are no more than \"advice from subordinates\" to senior officials, who may or may not rely upon them\n   if asked to comment to the press.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204283561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that sense, they qualify as predecisional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's segregation argument bears no fruit. As a general matter, \"[p]urely factual material usually cannot be withheld under Exemption 5 unless it reflects an 'exercise of discretion and judgment calls.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v.

Therefore, whether an agency's withholding under the privilege was justified \"does not turn on whether the material is purely factual in nature or whether it is already in the public domain, but rather, whether the selection or organization of facts is part of an agency's deliberative process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724300,10518583\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/1533/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After reviewing the withheld material\n   <em>\n    in camera, see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order, Sept. 7, 2018, the court finds that the factual information contained in the talking points cannot be segregated from the deliberative process of creating them.
