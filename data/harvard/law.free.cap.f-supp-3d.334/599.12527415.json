Kelly, Esq. and Sanford Heisler Sharp, LLP to dismiss the Third-Party Complaint of Anne C. Vladeck and Vladeck, Raskin &amp; Clark, P.C. (together, \"VRC\"). ECF Nos. 70, 74. Previously, plaintiff Alexander Prout brought an action against VRC for legal malpractice, in which Prout alleged that VRC negligently let the statutes of limitations lapse on Prout's claims against his former employer, Invesco Ltd., for non-willful violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") and for retaliation under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\"). ECF No. 32. By Order and Opinion dated June 10 (\"June 10 Order\"), ECF No. 44, this Court denied VRC's motion to dismiss Prout's malpractice claim, and by Memorandum Order dated July 29 (\"July 29 Order\"), ECF No. 67, this Court denied VRC's related motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   VRC now brings contribution claims against Kelly and Sanford Heisler. ECF No. 48. VRC alleges that Kelly acted as concurrent counsel to VRC with respect to Prout's non-willful FMLA claim, and that to the extent VRC was negligent in allowing the statute of limitations on this claim to lapse, Kelly was negligent as well. VRC alleges that Sanford Heisler acted as subsequent counsel with respect to Prout's still-viable claims for willful violation of the FMLA and retaliation under the Dodd-Frank Act, and that to the extent VRC was negligent in letting the statutes of limitations lapse on Prout's non-willful FMLA and SOX claims, Sanford Heisler was negligent in settling Prout's willful FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims, rather than litigating them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sanford Heisler and Kelly both move to dismiss the Third-Party Complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Kelly also moves to dismiss the Third-Party Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12(b)(2). For the reasons stated below, Kelly and Sanford Heisler's motions to dismiss are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Familiarity with all prior proceedings is here assumed. The pertinent factual allegations, drawn from the Third-Party Complaint and viewed in the light most favorable to VRC, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2014, Prout contacted VRC seeking legal representation to resolve a dispute with his then-employer, Invesco. Third-Party Complaint (\"Third-Party Comp.\") \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, ECF No. 48. Prout and VRC entered into an attorney-client relationship,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, and between May and November 2014, Prout sought to leave\n   Invesco and sought a severance package from Invesco,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. On November 4, 2014, Invesco terminated Prout's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the weeks following Prout's termination, VRC communicated with Prout and Invesco about two options that Invesco presented to Prout: voluntary resignation or termination for cause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. VRC advised Prout regarding potential claims he had against Invesco for violations of the FMLA, SOX, and Dodd-Frank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. VRC notified Prout that if he was going to pursue a whistleblower claim under SOX, he needed to file a complaint with the Department of Labor within 180 days of his termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Prout nevertheless advised VRC that he did not want to pursue a SOX claim at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. VRC was also prepared to proceed with an action against Invesco for alleged violations of the FMLA,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48, but Prout repeatedly delayed in authorizing VRC to bring the action, because Prout was focusing on civil and criminal proceedings arising out of his daughter's being the victim of a sexual assault at the St. Paul's School in New Hampshire,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2015, Prout advised VRC that he had retained counsel in his daughter's civil case against St Paul's,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61, and he requested that VRC \"coordinate\" with his other attorneys, including Kelly,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. VRC alleges that it entered into a \"joint representation agreement\" with Kelly during a March 2016 conference call, and that VRC and Kelly discussed Prout's pursuit of his claims against Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-76. The parties also discussed the relationship between Prout's Invesco claims and his daughter's case, as VRC was concerned that the job-related damages Prout sought in his daughter's case might overlap with those he would seek from Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78. In the following months, VRC, Prout, and Kelly had multiple calls in which they discussed Prout's settlement attempts with Invesco, and in which, it is alleged, \"Kelly provided legal services and/or legal advice to Prout concerning his anticipated claims against Invesco.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 24, 2016, Prout advised VRC that Morgan Stanley (Prout's then employer) was investigating whether Prout had taken proprietary documents and information from Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. A week later, Prout had a call with VRC and Kelly, during which VRC advised that if Prout brought an action against Invesco at that time, Invesco might assert counterclaims based on the behavior being investigated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103. VRC also advised that Morgan Stanley might learn Prout had been dishonest with them during their investigation and might terminate Prout for cause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104. Prout decided as a result of these concerns that he should defer commencement of his action against Invesco, even though it would mean letting the statute of limitations lapse on his non-willful FMLA claim.\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-06. Kelly stated that he was \"okay with the decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Later, in May 2017, VRC held a conference call with Prout and Kelly during which the parties discussed obstacles and timing relating to Prout's remaining claims against Invesco for willful violation of the FMLA and retaliation under Dodd-Frank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113-15. Kelly subsequently contacted Sanford Heisler to see whether the firm would represent Prout in his claims against Invesco, and Sanford Heisler agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-23. Prout subsequently ended VRC's representation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125, and he engaged Sanford Heisler,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127. Sanford Heisler then contacted Invesco on Prout's behalf and settled Prout's willful\n   FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims for $1.75M.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following his settlement with Invesco, Prout - through Sanford Heisler - accused VRC for the first time of mishandling his claims against Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 155-58. Sanford Heisler set forth the basis of Prout's malpractice claim and told VRC that it should settle because VRC's insurance carrier would cover the costs of doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157, 159. Sanford Heisler also threatened to sue VRC in order to tarnish VRC's reputation within the legal community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160. In setting forth the basis of Prout's malpractice claim, Sanford Heisler relied on Kelly as an independent witness to VRC's conduct, even though Kelly was in negotiations to join Sanford Heisler,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-63, and ultimately did join Sanford Heisler,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its Third-Party Complaint, VRC now seeks contribution from Kelly and Sanford Heisler.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 168-84, 185-208. VRC alleges that Kelly acted as its concurrent counsel with respect to Prout's claims against Invesco, and that to the extent VRC was negligent in allowing the statute of limitations to lapse on Prout's non-willful FMLA claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kelly was negligent as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169-83. In addition, VRC alleges that Sanford Heisler acted as its successor counsel, and that to the extent VRC was negligent in handling Prout's non-willful FMLA and SOX claims, Sanford Heisler was also negligent in settling Prout's willful FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 186-207. VRC alleges that Prout could have recovered more on his willful FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims than on his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims, and that Sanford Heisler is therefore the cause of any damages Prout incurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 200, 202, 204-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Analysis\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sanford Heisler and Kelly move to dismiss the Third-Party Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim.

Same Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There are multiple problems with VRC's contribution claim against Sanford Heisler. The first and most obvious is that VRC fails to allege that Sanford Heisler is \"subject to liability for damages for the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   ... injury\" as VRC. As Sanford Heisler correctly notes, \"Prout's injury as against [VRC] is premised upon the lost value of his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims,\" whereas \"the injury for which [VRC] seeks contribution from Sanford Heisler is [the] ... value of a greater recovery than was achieved for settling the remaining viable claims sounding in willful violation of the FMLA and retaliation in violation of Dodd-Frank.\" Memorandum of Law Submitted in Support of Third-Party Defendant Sanford Heisler Sharp, LLP's Motion to Dismiss the Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff's Third-Party Complaint Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), at 13 (\"Sanford Heisler MTD\"), ECF No. 72. Even assuming arguendo that Sanford Heisler\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   negligent in settling Prout's willful FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims, this negligence would have no bearing on its liability for Prout's loss of his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   VRC responds that Sanford Heisler misstates the nature of Prout's injury, because \"Prout has never parsed his claims against Invesco in [the] manner\" suggested by Sanford Heisler. Omnibus Memorandum of Law Submitted in Opposition to the Third-Party Defendants' Motions to Dismiss 11 (\"VRC Opp.\"), ECF No. 82. Instead, VRC argues, this \"Court previously characterized the 'lost' claims as 'bargaining detriments' that purportedly compelled Prout to settle his two remaining viable claims against Invesco and dragged down the\n   <em>\n    overall\n   </em>\n   value of the pre-suit settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (quoting June 10 Order 31-32). Given this Court's observation that \"Prout's remaining claims for a willful violation of the FMLA and for retaliation under Dodd-Frank are relevant ... to the issue of damages,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting July 29 Order 7), VRC argues, \"it necessarily follows that Sanford Heisler's handling ... of those claims is an appropriate basis for the Third-Party Plaintiffs' contribution claim against it,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   VRC misunderstands this Court's prior Orders and the law. As the Court made clear in its July 29 Order, VRC's liability turns not on whether its negligence caused Prout to settle his still-viable willful FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims, but \"only [on] whether [its] negligence caused Prout to suffer a loss relating to his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims.\" July 29 Order 7. By insisting that \"Prout's injury has to be viewed holistically, as the loss in value of his entire 'case' against Invesco,\" VRC Opp. 12, VRC misinterprets the Court's statement that Prout's injury depends on \"whether [he] would have been better off if he had pursued all four of his claims, rather than pursuing only two,\" July 29 Order 8-9. This statement does not mean that Prout's injury is \"the loss in value of his entire 'case.' \" It means that Prout's injury - which is the loss in value of his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims - can be\n   measured by comparing the value of his case with and without his time-barred claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   How to measure the value of Prout's case with and without his time-barred claims is of course an open factual question at this point in the litigation. In his Second Amended Complaint, Prout alleges that his case was worth $3 million plus attorneys' fees prior to the loss of his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims, and $1.75 million afterwards. ECF No. 32 \u00b6 120. VRC, by contrast, alleges that Prout's case was worth more than $1.75 million after he lost his non-willful FMLA and SOX claims, because Sanford Heisler should have litigated Prout's remaining claims instead of settling them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 199, 201;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   VRC Opp. 12-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if VRC proves that Sanford Heisler settled Prout's remaining claims for less than those claims were worth, however, VRC will not have proved that Sanford Heisler is liable for the loss of Prout's non-willful FMLA and SOX claims. Instead, it will have proved only that the value of Prout's lost claims is less than he alleges, because the value of his case without those claims is greater than he alleges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The case law is helpful in illustrating when two parties are, and are not, liable for the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   injury.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Schauer\n   </em>\n   , however, Prout's former counsel does not allege that Prout's subsequent counsel had the ability to remedy the former counsel's error. Whereas Gent may have been able to seek reinstatement\n   of Schauer's vacated alimony judgment - and may have been negligent for failing to do so - Sanford Heisler could not have done anything to make Prout's time-barred claims viable again. There is accordingly no \"basis for holding that the alleged negligence of both attorneys was responsible for the same injury.\" And there are no grounds for holding that VRC and Sanford Heisler are both liable \"for at least a portion of the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   damages claimed by\" Prout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although less analogous than\n   <em>\n    Schauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barry v.

Similarly, if VRC had alleged that Sanford Heisler was negligent in settling Prout's non-willful FMLA and SOX claims, then Sanford Heisler might have been liable for the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   injury as VRC (i.e., the loss of value on those claims). VRC cannot, however, seek contribution based on Sanford Heisler's alleged negligence in settling Prout's willful FMLA and Dodd-Frank claims, as any loss on those claims is a distinct injury from the injury allegedly caused by VRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

While the Court must \"accept[ ] all factual allegations in the complaint and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in [VRC's] favor,\"\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p98\">\n    493 F.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice,\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is implausible that Kelly represented Prout in his Invesco action, but that the only legal advice Kelly offered over five conference calls was a very brief statement of concurrence. Instead, the only reasonable inference is that VRC represented Prout in his Invesco action, Kelly represented Prout in his daughter's sexual assault case, and the parties participated in several conference calls to coordinate the two actions. The Third-Party Complaint supports nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Contribution to Plaintiff's Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, regardless of whether Prout's Invesco litigation was within the scope of Kelly's representation, or whether Kelly was negligent in saying he was \"okay with the decision\" made by VRC and Prout to defer Prout's litigation against Invesco, VRC has not plausibly alleged that any such negligence contributed to Prout's damages. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in VRC's favor, the Third-Party Complaint suggests that VRC, not Kelly, was retained to represent Prout in his dispute with Invesco, and that VRC, not Kelly, counseled Prout regarding the pros and cons of deferring litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 102. According to its own complaint, VRC advised Prout of the risks associated with bringing his non-willful FMLA claim within the statutes of limitations, and \"[f]ollowing this in-depth analysis presented by VRC, Prout decided that it would be better for him to defer commencement of his action against Invesco.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. VRC does not allege that Prout would have brought his claim within the statute of limitations if Kelly had not said he was \"okay with the decision\" to defer litigation, and the Court cannot reasonably draw such an inference from the pleadings. At bottom, the Third-Party Complaint provides no basis to infer that Kelly contributed to Prout's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, VRC has failed to state a claim for contribution against Sanford Heisler or Kelly. Furthermore, based on the pleadings and Kelly's uncontested affidavit, the Court finds that it lacks personal jurisdiction\n   over Kelly. For the foregoing reasons, the third-party defendants' motions to dismiss are granted, and the Third-Party Complaint is hereby dismissed with prejudice.
