Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government disputes that class counsel is entitled to a supplemental award pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The government argues that the 8% cap on an award of attorneys' fees and costs was not increased by the Addendum and therefore an additional award is not permitted pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. Def.'s Opp'n to Counsels' Second Fee Pet. (Def.'s Opp'n), ECF No. 912 at 6-8. The Court disagrees. The Addendum clearly contemplates that class counsel and Mrs. Keepseagle's counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   would be entitled to seek an award of attorneys' fees and costs, which would be made on motion to the Court, with an opportunity for the government\n   to oppose, and \"may be made from interest that has accrued from the total Compensation Fund.\" Addendum, ECF No. 824-2 at IV.C. Since the Addendum unambiguously provides that the award would be paid \"from interest that has accrued from the total Compensation Fund,\" this provision overrides the 8% award cap in the Settlement Agreement. To accept the government's argument would render this provision of the Addendum meaningless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beal Mort., Inc. v.

Def.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 912 at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Class counsel responds that: (1) the Court has already rejected the argument that the award was too high when it awarded to the cap; (2) as a factual matter, it was not overpaid for the projected costs; and (3) regarding the amount of unclaimed funds, the settlement amount was fully justified by the damages calculation of plaintiffs' expert, but a variety of factors lead to not all class members being able to, or choosing to, make their claims. Pls.' Reply, ECF No. 914 at 3-6. Class counsel also points out that the government does not contest the reasonableness of the rates or hours in their request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Class counsels' supplemental request is neither reasonable nor justified. There is no dispute that this supplemental request is for work and costs that were not contemplated in class counsels' 2011 award request. However, the reason class counsel needed to undertake this work and incur these costs, was because of the magnitude of unclaimed funds. Class counsel object to taking into consideration the magnitude of unclaimed funds because the damages calculation was \"fully justified.\" Pls.' Reply,\n   ECF No. 914 at 5. The Court disagrees that the magnitude of the unclaimed funds should not be considered. Although the damages calculation was fully justified, the fact is that class counsels' original award was based on a percentage of a compensation fund amount that exceeded successful claims by approximately half. The Court recognizes that the Supreme Court has held it to be a proper application of the common fund doctrine for an award of fees to be based on a percentage of the entire fund even if not all funds were disbursed to class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boeing Co. v.

However, the amount not disbursed in that case-$1.5 million out of a $3.2 million settlement fund-as compared to $380 million out of the $760 million settlement fund here renders this precedent entirely distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306907\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/472/#p473\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306907\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/472/#p473\">\n    at 474, 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306907\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/472/#p473\">\n    100 S.Ct. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court agrees with class counsel that its work on the Addendum benefitted the class: It resulted in additional payments to successful claimants and the creation of a Trust to benefit the members of the class. And class counsels' work resulted in this Court approving the Addendum and in that approval being upheld on appeal. However, the Court must still determine whether the supplemental award is reasonable. Here, the $60.8 million awarded exceeded class counsels' actual and projected lodestar fees and costs by approximately $34 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court recognizes persuasive authority approving supplemental fees where the prior award exceeded lodestar fees and costs,\n   <em>\n    Pray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%209757\">\n    1987 WL 9757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, but doing so here would not be reasonable. It is neither reasonable nor justified to award supplemental fees, even though the work was not anticipated, when the original award: (1) was a percentage of a settlement fund of this magnitude that exceeded the successful claims by half; and (2) exceeded actual and projected fees and costs by a multiplier of 2.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Class counsel also seek an award of $566,537.50 in fees and $6,987.56 in costs for OFW Law, which represented Mrs. Keepseagle in her efforts to modify the Settlement Agreement.

OFW Law was instrumental in negotiating the Addendum, which obtained $77 million in additional payments to class members, a supplemental service award of $100,000 to Mrs. Keepseagle, and created the Trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Marshall L.

OFW Law also represented Mrs. Keepseagle in her successful Motion to Modify the Settlement Agreement, in successfully opposing the appeal of this Court's approval of the Addendum to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and in successfully opposing petitions of certiorari to the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response to class counsels' request for this award, the government reiterates its argument that the Settlement Agreement does not authorize the payment, but makes no other objection.

The Addendum specifically provides that OFW Law would be able to \"seek an award of attorneys' fees and costs for work involved in establishing the Trust and Modifying the Agreement\" payable from the interest accrued from the compensation fund.

OFW Law claims 1,179.1 attorney, law clerk and paralegal hours that \"were actually expended, in the exercise of professional judgment, by the lawyers, paralegal staff, and clerks involved in the matter.\" Matz Decl., ECF No. 911-8 \u00b6 15.

B at 29-76. The Court has reviewed these records and, in view of its detailed knowledge of this matter, finds them to be adequately detailed, and the number of hours expended justified. OFW Law seeks a total of $566,537.50 in fees for work performed over two and a half years for the following number of billable hours: Attorney Dillard: 679.8 hours; Attorney Matz: 206.2 hours; Attorney Fried: 79.5 hours; Attorney Tsien: 43.2 hours; Attorney Durkin: 27.2 hours; Law Clerk Chapin: 88.5 hours; Law Clerk Ardalan: 30.3 hour; Attorney Weinreib: 6.5 hours; Paralegal Morgan: 17.9 hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, Ex. B at 29-76, Ex. C. Appropriately, the bulk of the billable hours are for a junior attorney with three to six years' experience, with the more senior attorneys generally providing a supervisory role.
