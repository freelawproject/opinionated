SIMON, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a products liability case where Barbara Kaiser claimed to have been substantially and permanently injured by a mesh product that was implanted in her vagina to treat her pelvic organ prolapse. The mesh product was designed and manufactured by defendants Johnson &amp; Johnson and Ethicon, Inc. After a two week trial, the jury agreed with Mrs. Kaiser and found in her favor on her failure to warn and design defect claims. The jury awarded\n   Mrs. Kaiser $10 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages. The jury found in the defendants' favor on the claim of loss of consortium brought by Anton Kaiser, Mrs. Kaiser's husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have filed a motion contesting the verdict, seeking judgment as a matter of law on both the failure to warn and design defect claims, or in the alternative a new trial, or in the alternative to that, a remittitur of the jury's damages award. [DE 416.] Because there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in favor of Mrs. Kaiser, I will deny defendants' motion for a judgment as matter of law and likewise deny defendants' motion for a new trial. Similarly, because I find the jury's compensatory damages award was neither monstrously excessive nor the product of passion or prejudice, I will deny Ethicon's request for a remittitur of the jury's compensatory damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury's punitive damage award, however, is another story. I find the punitive damages award excessive and unreasonable under controlling law. As such, I will grant defendants' motion for remittitur of the jury's $25 million punitive damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Ethicon and Johnson &amp; Johnson are corporations which, among other lines of business, design, market, and sell medical devices. Ethicon is a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. For ease of reference I will refer to both defendants as \"Ethicon.\" One of the devices sold by Ethicon was the Prolift Pelvic Floor Repair System. Prolift is a vaginal mesh which was implanted in Mrs. Kaiser's pelvis in January 2009 to treat her pelvic organ prolapse condition. Mrs. Kaiser subsequently experienced various issues including vaginal pain, pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, bladder spasms, and bowel issues. All of these problems associated with the mesh necessitated a second surgical procedure to have the mesh removed from Mrs. Kaiser's vagina, or at least as much of it as could be removed. There was evidence that once the mesh is implanted it becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to have it all removed; it grows into the tissue, hardens and causes substantial pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mrs. Kaiser alleged in her complaint that her injuries were the result of Prolift's defective design and that Ethicon did not adequately warn Mrs. Kaiser's surgeon (Dr. Bales) of the risks associated with Prolift. The case was originally filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, where a consolidated Multi-District Litigation related to Prolift and other vaginal mesh products is pending. [DE 1.] On March 28, 2017 the case was transferred here because all pretrial proceedings had concluded, and the case was ready for trial. [DE 160.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A jury trial began on February 26, 2018 and each side put on extensive evidence, including multiple witnesses, both fact and expert, both live and through videotaped deposition testimony. Trial concluded on March 8, 2018 and after several hours of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Mrs. Kaiser, awarding her $10 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages. [DE 405.] Ethicon timely filed the present motion seeking judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative a new trial, or in the alternative of that, a remittitur of the jury's damages awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is important to note at the outset the posture and standard applicable to defendants' motions. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 governs motions for judgments\n   as a matter of law. Defendants are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law only if I find \"that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find\" in favor of Mrs. Kaisser. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). In making this determination, I do not approach the case with new eyes, examining the evidence and the jury's verdict as though I am the fact finder receiving the evidence for the first time. Instead, I may only disregard the jury's verdict \"if no reasonable jury could have found in [Mrs. Kaiser's] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Erickson v. Wisc.

On the one hand, it is certainly true that defendants put forth evidence which supported their theory of the case: that Prolift was a safe product,\n   that all necessary warnings were fully disclosed to the necessary individuals, and that Mrs. Kaiser's injuries could not be traced to any harm caused by the vaginal mesh. But it is equally clear the jury did not believe or find defendants' evidence persuasive enough to render a verdict in their favor. On the contrary, the jury obviously believed Mrs. Kaiser and the witnesses who testified that Prolift was a defective product, that Ethicon knew of the risks associated with Prolift but chose not to disclose them to surgeons using the product, and that Mrs. Kaiser's injuries were the result of her having Prolift surgically implanted in her. Given the substantial evidence on both sides of the ledger, it was up to the jury to decide whose story was more believable. With these general thoughts in mind, I will now turn to the various motions brought by Ethicon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Judgment as a Matter of Law as to Failure to Warn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants' central argument concerning why Mrs. Kaiser's failure to warn claim must fail is one of causation. Ethicon argues that Kaiser failed to offer sufficient evidence at trial that Dr. Bales, the surgeon who implanted the Prolift device into her, was not adequately warned of risks related to Prolift. [DE 416 at 10-16.] It is the sufficiency of the warnings to Dr. Bales-not Mrs. Kaiser-that is at issue here. This is because under the so-called \"sophisticated or learned intermediary doctrine\" warnings for prescription drugs and medical devices \"need only be directed to doctors, not patients who are the ultimate users.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortho Pharm. Corp. v. Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1518795\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind-app/180/33/\">\n    180 Ind.App. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11071917\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/388/541/#p549\">\n    388 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 (1979). Typically, this is a question of fact for the jury to determine because \"the intermediary's alleged sophistication may be more or less reasonable given the product's nature, complexity and associated dangers, the likelihood that the intermediary will communicate warnings to the ultimate consumer, the dangers posed to the ultimate consumer by an inadequate or nonexistent warning, and the feasibility of requiring the manufacturer to directly warn the product's ultimate consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat. Gas Odorizing, Inc. v. Downs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890142\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/685/155/#p164\">\n    685 N.E.2d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In support of their argument, defendants rely primarily upon Dr. Bales's testimony. But Dr. Bales' testimony was in flux; he said different things at different times in his deposition. It's worth pointing out that Dr. Bales was not subpoenaed to testify at the trial despite the fact that he was within the subpoena power of the Court. I found this curious, but both parties chose instead to simply rely on his deposition testimony, a portion of which was read to the jury. It is true, as the defendants correctly note, that Dr. Bales's testimony was not entirely favorable to Mrs. Kaiser. For example, he testified that he did not read the Instructions for Use (\"IFU\") before every surgery. [DE 395, Ex. H, Bales Tr. at 116:19-118:1.] But Dr. Bales also testified that he read the IFU for Prolift multiple times, followed it when implanting Prolift, and that the IFU influenced his decision to implant Prolift in Mrs. Kaiser. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:05-19:21;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:23-20:09.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the issue of whether he would have done anything differently had he known at the time of Mrs. Kaiser's surgery what he later found out, Dr. Bales' testimony waxed and waned. On the one hand, when asked generally if he \"would have done anything differently with respect to Ms. Kaiser's ... surgery\" he responded, \"No, not looking back, I don't think I would have done anything differently.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84:9-1, 85:6-10.] On the other hand Dr. Bales specifically testified that once he realized that the complications from Prolift were happening a \"little too frequently\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   and the \"risks started to become a little more than you would like and the benefits are not abundantly clear,\" he started recommending against the continued use of vaginal mesh. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:15-52:6.] It was in this context that Dr. Bales provided the following critical piece of testimony: he concluded that it was \"fair to say that in hindsight, had I seen potential problems that occurred, I may not have started employing the Prolift.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:16-23.] This was the clinching testimony relating to causation that allowed the failure to warn claim to go to the jury. So while Dr. Bales said some things that were contradictory, it was ultimately for the jury to evaluate his testimony and decide what weight, if any, to put on any particular piece of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In sum, there was evidence showing that Dr. Bales read and reviewed the Prolift IFU many times prior to Mrs. Kaiser's surgery. There was also evidence that Dr. Bales was familiar with some of the risks associated with Prolift prior to Mrs. Kaiser's surgery, but not all of them. In that regard, the most damning testimony from Dr. Bales was his statement that if he knew at the time of Mrs. Kaiser's surgery what he later found out about the problems associated with Prolift, he would not have used the device. In other words, after learning more about the Prolift after implanting it in Mrs. Kaiser, he began to have doubts concerning the efficacy of the product compared to its risks. This was compelling testimony from an experienced surgeon that the jury was entitled to credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants likewise argue that Prolift's warnings were sufficient as a matter of law because risks associated with Prolift were fully disclosed in literature and commonly known to pelvic floor surgeons like Dr. Bales. [DE 416 at 11-12.] But Dr. Bales and Kaiser's expert Dr. Elliott testified to the contrary-that they were not aware of every risk claimed in January 2009 or that such risks were necessarily generally known amongst pelvic floor surgeons. [DE 395, Ex. H, Bales Tr. at 22:16-19; Trial Tr. 610:3-15 (testimony of Dr. Elliott).] The jury heard testimony from Dr. Elliott that the frequency, severity and permanence of certain complications were not disclosed within the IFU. [Trial Tr. at 398:4-399:6;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 388:7-390:19.] It was the role of the jury, as the fact finder, to determine whether the warning was adequate under the sophisticated intermediary doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Downs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890142\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/685/155/#p164\">\n    685 N.E.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whether a manufacturer has discharged its duty under the sophisticated intermediary doctrine is almost always a question for the trier of fact.\"). And the jury decided that the warning was inadequate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants further criticize the testimony of Mrs. Kaiser's experts, Dr. Elliott and Dr. Rozenzweig, for testifying that they expect all risks related to a medical device to be disclosed within the IFU. [DE 416 at 11.] Defendants argue that this testimony put forth an impermissibly high standard-higher than what is required under the law. But defendants' arguments suffer from a fatal flaw; plaintiffs' experts did not testify as to the legal standard applicable to a failure to warn or opine on the law. The jury instructions stated the correct legal standard, namely that a manufacturer need only disclose \"reasonable warnings about the dangers of the product when the seller, by exercising reasonable diligence, could have made those warnings available to the user or consumer.\" [Trial Tr. 1744:15-19.] There is no reason to believe that the jury disregarded those instructions in reaching its verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schandelmeier-Bartels v. Chicago Park Dist.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4096004\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/372/#p387\">\n    634 F.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"We assume that the jury followed the instructions as they were provided.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Ethicon failed to warn Dr. Bales of the necessary risks related to Prolift. The law does not require a plaintiff to offer unequivocal evidence at a trial or proof beyond a reasonable doubt, only sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could find in its favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). For the reasons I have just stated, Mrs. Kaiser met that standard here on the failure to warn claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Judgment as a Matter of Law as to Design Defect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the design defect claim, defendants raise four arguments as to why they are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law: First, that they were entitled to a state of the art presumption under Indiana law; second, that the evidence offered by Kaiser failed to establish that Prolift was in fact defective; third, that Kaiser failed to establish that her injuries were caused by Prolift; and fourth, for the first time before me, Ethicon raises a conflict preemption defense, arguing that the FDA's requirements that new or altered products receive some form of FDA clearance before they can be marketed conflicts with Mrs. Kaiser's state law claim. I am not persuaded by any of these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. State of the Art Presumption under Indiana Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Indiana Products Liability Act (IPLA) allows for a defendant to avail itself of a rebuttal presumption that its product was not defective if it was designed and manufactured \"in conformity with the generally recognized state of the art applicable to the safety of the product at the time the produce was designed, manufactured, packaged, and labeled.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-20-5-1\">\n    Ind.

[Trial Tr. 658:13-6:59:7.] Likewise, Dr. Johnson, who removed Mrs. Kaiser's vaginal mesh, testified that the Prolift mesh, along with scar tissue, was the likely cause of Kaiser's pelvic pain and pain associated with sexual intercourse. [DE 395, Ex. D, Dr. Johnson Tr. 48:8-49:25.] The jury was entitled to, and apparently did, believe these statements by plaintiffs' medical experts and witnesses.

First, defendants claim that a new trial is warranted because the jury's verdict was against the weight of evidence and because I refused to instruct the jury as to the state of the art presumption. As discussed above, neither of these arguments were persuasive as to Ethicon's motion for a judgment as a matter of law. Given that the applicable standards are nearly the same, I find them unpersuasive here as well for all of the same reasons.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756083\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/600/#p601\">\n    469 F.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (judgment as a matter of law may be granted only \"if no reasonable jury could have found\" in nonmoving party's favor)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5859326\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/531/#p534\">\n    447 F.3d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (new trial may be granted only when moving party has \"demonstrate[d] that no rational jury could have rendered a verdict against them\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Before continuing, however, I must make a further observation concerning Ethicon's motion for a new trial. In order to repackage these arguments in support of a new trial, Ethicon cites to a footnote within the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tibbs v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183987\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/31/\">\n    457 U.S. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183987\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/31/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183987\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/31/\">\n    72 L.Ed.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) for the proposition that I need not defer to the jury or view evidence in a light favorable to Kaiser. Instead, Ethicon states that I may substitute my views for those of the jury and \"may weigh the evidence and in so doing evaluate for [myself] the credibility of the witnesses\" in determining whether to grant a new trial. [DE 416 at 20.] This is an incorrect statement of law.\n   <em>\n    Tibbs\n   </em>\n   was a case concerning whether the Double Jeopardy clause prohibits a state from retrying a criminal defendant who has his conviction set aside by a state appellate court based upon \"the weight of the evidence.\" It does not speak to the standard on a motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59.

Exclusion of FDA-related Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At trial, Ethicon was precluded from introducing evidence relating to the FDA's premarket clearance process for medical devices, known as Section 510(k) review. They now say that was an error. But Ethicon's motion is simply a rehash of many of the same arguments I previously rejected. [DE 407.] And none of these arguments lead me to believe that my prior ruling was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Ethicon does raise one new argument, premised on a recent ruling from another court:\n   <em>\n    In re Bard IVC Filters Prods.

And that is especially so when the opinion concerns an entirely different product (inferior vena cava filters ), in a lawsuit under a different state's (Georgia) law. But I will nonetheless explain why I don't think the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Bard\n   </em>\n   is applicable to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bard\n   </em>\n   , the court allowed, over plaintiffs' objections, for Section 510(k) evidence to be admitted. The court found that compliance with the Section 510(k) process was relevant to whether the manufacturer acted reasonably under Georgia law and the risk-utility test that is used there. The court further found that \"any potential confusion can be cured, if necessary, by a limiting instruction regarding the nature of the 510(k) process.\"\n   <em>\n    Bard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523233\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/1045/\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Essentially, the ruling was based on Federal Rule of Evidence 403 and the balancing explicit in that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The decision to allow the admission of the Section 510(k) evidence was a judgment call. Indeed, in making that determination, the district court recognized the limited probative value Section 510(k) evidence has in a products liability case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523233\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/1045/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523233\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/1045/\">\n    at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The 510(k) process may not speak directly to the applicable standard of care under Georgia law, but it does have probative value in the determination of this action.\"). And it further cited other authority which likewise noted that the Section 510(k) process \"has minimal probative value\" in a products liability case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winebarger v.

[DE 407.] Defendants suggest my ruling had \"no factual basis\" because studies critical of Prolift (which triggered the FDA's post-clearance concerns resulting in Prolift being removed from the market) were not directly related to the Section 510(k) process. [DE 416 at 34-35.] But this framing of the issue ignores the additional basis for excluding the Section 510(k) evidence from trial under FRE 403 : it was more prejudicial to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   parties than probative to either. As explained, that evidence would not be probative of the key issue-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   safety. And allowing that evidence in, along with the rest of the FDA story, would likely have been even more harmful than beneficial to Ethicon. As I stated in my prior ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   If the evidence regarding Prolift's \u00a7 510(k) clearance had been admitted into evidence, almost assuredly, Prolift's whole FDA story would have been told to the jury, including evidence that after the Prolift device was marketed, it later received FDA scrutiny and was subsequently removed from the market after a series of exchanges with the FDA regarding its safety. This would require the introduction of additional evidence and testimony from regulatory experts and Ethicon employees. When balancing the probative value of the evidence against these dangers and the needless consumption of time, I find that excluding the evidence is appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [DE 407 at 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As noted, it would not have been sensible, nor fair to the plaintiffs, to allow Ethicon to parade in a bunch of witnesses to talk about the FDA's Section 510(k) process and argue to the jury that this evidence shows how safe its product was, only to exclude the very prejudicial testimony about how the FDA strongly questioned the safety of the Prolift after the fact. What would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander. I was not going to allow a one-sided presentation of Prolift's \"FDA story.\" So I decided that the best approach was to exclude the FDA evidence altogether. This approach allowed the jury to focus on the critical issues in the case-was the product defective in its design and warnings?-without being distracted by the FDA side-show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Lack of Curative Instruction after Plaintiffs' Closing Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The next asserted error is that I did not issue a curative instruction after plaintiffs' rebuttal argument in which counsel rhetorically asked \"Where is that industry standard?\" that would justify or support Ethicon's decision to market Prolift without having conducted clinical trials in women prior to putting the product on the market. [DE 416 at 36.] Ethicon says that this was a misleading reference because plaintiffs' counsel knew there was an industry standard set by the FDA but that evidence had been excluded (as noted in the above section). In essence, Ethicon claims that it was precluded from telling the jury \"the FDA didn't make us\" do such testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ethicon focuses on three specific statements made by plaintiffs' counsel during closing argument that Ethicon says caused great prejudice. They misleadingly suggest that all three were made during the \"rebuttal closing argument.\" [DE 416 at 28.] In fact, two of the three offending statement were made during initial closing argument. [Trial Tr. 1653.] Ethicon concedes as much in its reply brief but nonetheless\n   argues that \"[r]egardless of when made, once the statements were made the only recourse was to grant a mistrial or provide a curative instruction[.]\" [DE 422 at 13, n.5.] But the timing is important because there was no contemporaneous objection made to any of the statements, or attempt at a sidebar at the conclusion of plaintiffs' initial closing but prior to Ethicon's closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has placed a high hurdle for Ethicon to clear in order to secure a new trial based on statements made during closing arguments. That is because \"[c]losing arguments are the time in the trial process when counsel is given the opportunity to discuss more freely the weaknesses in his opponent's case and to highlight the strength of his own.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Instead, they waited until after all closing arguments concluded, including its own closing and plaintiffs' rebuttal had concluded. It was only then that they objected. And\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   they objected was a bit odd. No one from the defense team that was actually sitting at counsel's table lodged the objection. Instead, an attorney for Ethicon who was seated in the rear of the courtroom came rushing to the front of the courtroom with her arm in the air trying to get my attention. I was frankly taken aback by this. This occurred while I was in the process of telling the jury how I would go about reading the final instructions to them.\n   <em>\n    [See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 1737.] It seemed to me at the time that whatever the lawyer wanted to bring to my attention could wait and thus I instructed Ethicon's attorney to \"please sit down\" while I continued to address the jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11352526\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/638/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is true, as Ethicon argues, that there may be valid strategic reasons not to object at \"the very moment [opposing counsel] utters the comments at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Solis-Jordan\n   </em>\n   , No. 97 CR 814,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20410038\">\n    1999 WL 410038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D. Ill. June 2, 1999) (cited by Ethicon). I'm not sure I see those concerns in this case. It would have been very simple for counsel who was seated at counsel table to simply ask if they could approach the bench just after the offending comments were made during the closing arguments. Indeed, defense counsel had no issue objecting contemporaneously during plaintiffs' closing at other times. [Trial Tr. 1646:25-1647:6.] Had defense counsel objected here, I would have allowed them to approach, and I could have dealt with the issue on the spot during the argument if necessary. So there is no doubt Ethicon's counsel had ample opportunity to object before they actually did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   What's more, I think it was fair for me to expect that the Ethicon lawyer who would be lodging the objection would be the one who was actually doing the closing argument, not a lawyer seated in the back of the courtroom. Indeed, I made it clear to the parties prior to trial that I have a \"one lawyer rule\" that requires that objections be made by the lawyer responsible for that part of the trial whether it be the opening statements, the examination of witnesses or closing argument. That was especially important in this case where each side had at least a half-dozen lawyers assigned to it. It would have been a free\n   for all to allow any lawyer to object at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, had defendants' counsel objected contemporaneously, or after plaintiffs' initial closing but before their own closing, and sought a sidebar to discuss their concerns, it may have been possible to address in a targeted fashion then and there, or to instruct plaintiffs' counsel not to make similar statements during rebuttal. But that did not happen and instead, defendants waited, and thus the only possible instruction to give would have come long after the offending statements were made, likely long after the jury had forgotten all about them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Regardless, I am not convinced that any curative instruction would have been proper, let alone sufficiently necessary as to result in harm great enough to warrant a new trial in this case. I would have been required to explain to a jury, after the fact, the basis of my prior evidentiary rulings excluding Ethicon's proffered FDA-related evidence. This would likely only confuse the jury, for the same reasons that such FDA-related evidence was excluded in the first place. Furthermore, this would have only served to highlight plaintiffs' counsel's errant statements during the closing, no doubt to Ethicon's detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants are somewhat misleading in implying that all FDA-related evidence would have been in their favor. As noted above, if I had allowed evidence of the FDA's Section 510(k) substantial equivalence process to come in, I would likewise have had to include the entirety of the proffered FDA evidence, including evidence of the FDA's later safety focused concerns and defendants' decision to withdraw Prolift from the market in response to those concerns. While I cannot know if the admission of this FDA evidence would have altered the jury's verdict, it was and remains my ruling that the evidence was not sufficiently relevant to the claims in this lawsuit to be deemed admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, it is hard to imagine that the few fleeting comments by plaintiffs' counsel made a difference in a complicated trial spanning two weeks time. Simply put, Ethicon has not met its burden under the demanding standard at play here. The motion for a new trial based on improper argument during closing must therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Testimony of Dr. Meng Chen Regarding TVT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Prior to trial, Ethicon sought to exclude certain documents authored by Ethicon Associate Medical Director Dr. Meng Chen, but did not seek to bar her testimony in full. [DE 234 at 19-20 (motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude \"evidence or argument regarding post-sale company documents authored by Dr. Meng Chen\"); DE 279 (plaintiffs' motion to admit); DE 288 (defendants' opposition).] These documents related to \"TVT\", a vaginal mesh product sold by defendants prior to Prolift entering the market and which was made using the same polypropylene material as Prolift. At trial, Ethicon objected to deposition testimony from Dr. Chen because I limited defense counsel's cross-examination of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Elliott concerning TVT only to issues related to development of Prolift. [Trial Tr. 495:9-15 (\"THE COURT: ... I very specifically asked what the intention was as it relates to the TVT product, and the way it was pitched to me was: Well, it's very necessary to talk about the TVT in the development of a Prolift product, and that's what we're intending to talk about the TVT. This is getting beyond that.\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I allowed Dr. Chen's testimony in a limited fashion because I found testimony concerning complications with TVT, a separate but similar device, was relevant to\n   defendants' decisions to use polypropylene mesh material in Prolift as well. [Trial Tr. 1053:1-5 (\"THE COURT: I do think that polypropylene and how it is made and the fact that it is used in the Prolift is relevant to this case; that it sort of sets the framework for the development of the sling, kind of led to the development of the Prolift.\").] That is what Dr. Chen's testimony concerned. Ethicon offers nothing in the way of new argument on its belated objection to having Dr. Chen's testimony barred in full and I see no occasion to revisit my ruling or grant a new trial on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Failure to Warn and Causation Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ethicon submits that two specific jury instructions contained misstatements of law which prejudiced it by either misleading or confusing the jury. Specifically, Ethicon claims that it was prejudicial error to exclude its proposed qualifier \"not commonly known\" in Instruction 20 as to Mrs. Kaiser's failure to warn claim, and in rejecting its additional instruction as to general and specific medical causation. [DE 416 at 40-41.] \"To obtain a new trial based on incorrect jury instructions, [Ethicon] must establish that (1) the instructions did not accurately state the law, and (2) the error prejudiced [it] because the jury was likely to be misled or confused.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Without this additional qualifier to Instruction 20, Ethicon argues this resulted in an improper jury instruction which misleadingly suggested there was \"a duty to warn of all potential risks of Prolift.\" [DE 416 at 40.] Taken in isolation, that could possibly have been a colorable argument, but jury instructions cannot be read in isolation and instead should be considered \"as a whole\" to determine whether or not they contain misstatements of law which may have misled or confused the jury.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713750\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/722/#p733\">\n    733 F.3d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The substance of Ethicon's requested modification to Instruction 20 was already captured in Instruction 22, which explained that: \"A medical device is 'unreasonably dangerous' if it exposes a patient to a risk of physical harm beyond that contemplated by an ordinary user of the product who uses the product with ordinary knowledge about the product's characteristics. An ordinary user of the product in this case is the community of pelvic floor surgeons.\" [DE 402 at 23.] This instruction, coupled with Instruction 20, made clear to the jury that they were to consider the knowledge of the community of pelvic floor surgeons in determining whether or not Ethicon adequately warned this defined group of \"ordinary users\" as to Prolift's risks. There was thus no misstatement of law and no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Ethicon next challenges the jury instructions as to causation, claiming that my exclusion of two if its proposed jury instructions on this issue meant that the jury instructions contained misstatements of law which likely misled the jury. Instruction 25, the causation instruction, from the Indiana Model Instructions stated that \"A manufacturer's conduct is legally responsible for causing an injury if: (1) the injury would not have occurred without the conduct, and (2) the injury was a natural, probable, and foreseeable result of the conduct. This is called a \"responsible cause.\" There can be more than one responsible\n   cause for an injury.\" [DE 402 at 26.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Ethicon claims that this instruction fails to sufficiently capture specific causation. But this instruction makes clear that a plaintiff must prove that \"the injury would not have occurred without the conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    [Id.]\n   </em>\n   That\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   specific causation. Adding an additional requirement that \"a different warning would have changed the treating physician's treating decision,\" [DE 416 at 41], would have imposed an additional requirement that is not an element of causation under Indiana law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lapsley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501461\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/802/#p814\">\n    689 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   814 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

Second, Ethicon claims there should have been an additional causation instruction as to \"general causation\" and \"specific causation\" to capture that Mrs. Kaiser was required to show both that Prolift was capable of causing her injuries and that Prolift did actually cause her injuries. In essence, Ethicon argues that it would have preferred more parsed language on causation, but does not actually make any showing as to how Instruction 25 contained an incorrect statement of law. Greater detail-which presumably Ethicon hoped would result in a jury being less likely to find Prolift was the cause of Mrs. Kaiser's injuries-may have been Ethicon's preference, but it was not required under Indiana law and the jury was sufficiently instructed as to what a plaintiff's burden is on matters of causation in a product liability suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, Instruction 25 accurately stated Indiana law on causation and Ethicon's proposed additional parsing of this element would not have prevented juror confusion but instead likely heightened it by implying elements and requirements which were not strictly elements of Mrs. Kaiser's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

While an eight figure sum is a lot of money and larger than many other serious personal injury cases, it is not \"monstrously excessive\" compared to other vaginal mesh personal injury cases.

But there was also evidence that Ethicon was aware of the dangers and problems associated with Prolift but chose to launch it any way, and that after further problems continued to arise once on the market, Ethicon continued to market it as-is without disclosing these risks to surgeons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For example, there was testimony that nearly a year before Prolift's launch, there were concerns about mesh shrinkage.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Indeed, in an internal Ethicon email from October 2008, years after Prolift was launched and approximately three months before Mrs. Kaiser had her surgery, refers to this problematic mesh material as the \"best of a bad lot.\" [DE 395, Ex.

Under this law, punitive damages can be no more than five times the compensatory damages. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:15-5.14(b). Of course, the jury's $25 million award is within this cap, representing \"only\" 2.5 times the jury's compensatory damages award. But, as other courts applying New Jersey's punitive damages regime have noted, when considering multi-million dollar awards, \"the ratio alone is of little assistance\" because \"one naturally expects a much lower ratio when a substantial award of compensatory damages has been made[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Inter Med.

In that regard, when evaluating punitive damages awards, the Supreme Court has instructed me to consider three guideposts: \"(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

The jury further heard many details of Mrs. Kaiser's physical pain and suffering which were the result of defendant's conduct. Furthermore, the jury heard evidence regarding defendants' net worth (both are multi-billion dollar corporations), but also heard evidence regarding defendants' actual profits made off of Prolift in Indiana. The punitive damages in this case were only to address them as to Indiana (as opposed to nationwide or in other states given the many other pending lawsuits involving Prolift against defendants).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris USA v.

[Trial Tr. 1060:2.] This fact gives me pause and causes doubt as to the reasonableness of the punitive damage award in this case given that New Jersey law requires that \"[t]he profitability of the misconduct of the defendant\" to be an express consideration in determining the amount of punitive damages to award. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:15-5.12(c)(2). Thus while \"[a]n otherwise valid award of punitive damages will not be set aside unless 'manifestly outrageous' or 'clearly excessive,' \" I believe this is such a case.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

That is because \"an award of punitive\n   damages does not logically depend on the extent of the injury sustained by an individual plaintiff. Rather, 'the amount of such an award is determined from the perspective of the defendant.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861619\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/160/221/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861619\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/160/221/\">\n    at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Here, while the jury heard evidence and the parties stipulated to defendants' net worth being $70 billion, the award of $25 million represents over 166 times the amount of relevant profits earned by defendants which from the perspective of the defendant is clearly excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Having determined that a remittitur is warranted, I must now determine a number. Admittedly, this remains an inexact science but there remains guidance as to what the punitive damages award should be. Here, the jury's $10 million compensatory award is sizable and larger than many other Prolift vaginal mesh verdicts. And \"[w]hen compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p418\">\n    538 U.S. at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p418\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is a reasonable award, in line with both the Supreme Court's due process jurisprudence on punitive damages and the New Jersey Punitive Damages Act. And given that Ethicon's profits in Indiana were approximately $150,000, a $10 million award remains substantial, which serves New Jersey's Punitive Damages Act's goal of ensuring that \"the wrongdoing does not become a cost of business for the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarr v.
