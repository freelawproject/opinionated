The Court has carefully reviewed said Motions, the entire court file and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As the Court explained in its prior Order (DE 64), granting Defendants' Motion For Summary Judgment (DE 26), Plaintiff Troy Evans (hereinafter \"Plaintiff\") in the above-styled cause brought only one claim against Defendants D. Cefalu Management, Inc., and Christine Difiore Kirsch (hereinafter \"Defendants\") for failure to pay overtime compensation in accord with the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (hereinafter \"the FLSA\"). The Court granted summary judgment for Defendants because Plaintiff failed to contest by either a response to Defendants' Statement Of Undisputed Material Facts In Support Of Their Motion For Summary Judgment (DE 27), or even by any argument within his Response (DE 43) that Plaintiff was in fact paid all overtime compensation he was owed, regardless of whether Defendants were actually covered by the FLSA. Defendants maintained that they are not covered by the FLSA because they allege their income does not meet the statutory requirements. Plaintiff has at all times in the case contested that argument.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   DE 43. But, as Plaintiff did not contest Defendants' facts, supported by their own records, that overtime was paid, the Court did not find it necessary to resolve the coverage issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants now maintain that they should be awarded attorney's fees and costs.

Thus, the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Kreager v.

In a seminal case on the Court's authority to award sanctions pursuant to this inherent authority,\n   <em>\n    Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court affirmed this basis as an appropriate source of power for fee-shifting attorney's fees, even in situations in which, absent the extraordinary circumstance of bad faith, the 'American Rule' would apply.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p45\">\n    501 U.S. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p45\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p45\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).

The Court has already discussed the fact that it must find bad faith in order to award such sanctions. This is one of methods by which the Court exercises great caution, as required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging, Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9420889\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/1306/#p1320\">\n    293 F.3d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1320 (11th Cir. 2002) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Durrett v.

In addition to finding bad faith, the Court must afford the party against whom sanctions are considered due process, which means in this case, \"the lawyer facing sanctions must be provided with notice and 'an opportunity to respond, orally or in writing, to the invocation of such sanctions and to justify his actions.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1321 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mroz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6474264,7414878\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1567/\">\n    65 F.3d 1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1575-76 (11th Cir. 1995) ). As to this notice, it is acceptable that it comes from the court, from the party who seeks the sanctions, or from both.\n   <em>\n    In re Mroz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6474264,7414878\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1567/\">\n    65 F.3d at 1575-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff had notice from the Court when the Court stated in the Final Judgment (DE 65) that it would entertain a Motion For Attorney's fees, and then also from Defendants, obviously, in the instant Motion (DE 68). However, in an abundance of caution, the Court recognizes that the precise basis for any award of fees was not stated. The Court states here unequivocally that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   basis the Court is considering for awarding fees against Plaintiff's counsel\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   , and not Plaintiff, is the Court's inherent power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thus, the Court will give Plaintiff's counsel one final chance to offer an explanation, specifically, of why he continues to maintain that he had an argument for the fact that Plaintiff was not paid all of his overtime wages. The Court cautions Plaintiff's counsel that the Court expects this explanation to be contained entirely within, or at the very least, supported by, an affidavit from Plaintiff's counsel. The Court understands that there is some uncertainty as to whether Plaintiff can be reached, or even wishes to be reached, by Plaintiff's counsel. But, this is immaterial at this point. The above-styled cause has been resolved in Defendants' favor. The Court is merely giving Plaintiff's counsel an opportunity to proffer a full and thorough statement about his investigation of Plaintiff's claim and his reasons for believing it was supported by evidence, despite the fact that he failed to marshal this evidence against Defendants' Motion For Summary Judgment (DE 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By the instant Motion (DE 68), Defendants argue that this case is an instance of bad faith and that the Court should award fees based on its inherent authority, which they acknowledge is even more limited than Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants concede that they did not file a Rule 11 motion, but note that they did serve such a motion on Plaintiff before ultimately deciding against filing. Defendants assert that the case was frivolous and that this contention is established because Plaintiff has not provided evidence, at summary judgment, or at any\n   other time, that he was not paid all overtime owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's Response (DE 71) to Defendants' Motion (DE 68) is, frankly, baffling, and not helpful to the Court in determining whether Plaintiff's claim had any basis. Plaintiff's counsel explains that his failure to respond to Defendants arguments about Plaintiff not being owed overtime was \"inadvertent error.\" DE 71, p. 2. After the Court entered its Order (DE 64), granting summary judgment, Plaintiff's counsel explains that he attempted to contact Plaintiff in order to file a sworn statement along with a motion for reconsideration. Such a motion was never filed, as he admits. The Court previously remarked, in its Order (DE 64), that there was a discrepancy between Plaintiff's failure to controvert Defendants' facts and legal argument and a statement in the Parties' Joint Pretrial Stipulation (DE 54) that the hours Plaintiff worked and whether he was paid in accordance with the FLSA were issues which remained for proof at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 65, p. 2, n.2. The Court gathers from Plaintiff's Response (DE 71) that, despite Plaintiff's counsel's conduct in the above-styled cause, Plaintiff's counsel continues to believe that Plaintiff was, in fact, not paid his overtime under the FLSA. The appropriate time to present this evidence has long since passed. All of the evidence before the Court supports Defendants, as the Court noted when it granted summary judgment in their favor. DE 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But, while the Court wishes to make it abundantly clear that any explanation offered at this date will not affect the Final Judgment (DE 65) entered against Plaintiff, the Court must be fully appraised of Plaintiff's argument before deciding whether or not the above-styled cause was either brought in bad faith, or at any point continued to be litigated in bad faith. And, the Court would not wish in any way to be seen as not affording Plaintiff's counsel all possible due process to fully defend his own actions. The Court would observe that two aspects of the pleadings before the Court at this time have influenced this decision. First, the primary thrust of Plaintiff's Response (DE 71) is that Plaintiff's counsel failed due to inadvertence. Inadvertence alone is not bad faith, but the Court needs reasons to understand why the Court should accept this explanation. Second, repeatedly, in its Reply (DE 74), Defendants state that there is no direct evidence, but only circumstantial evidence of bad faith. Of course, circumstantial evidence may be sufficient. And, the Court will naturally take into account all possible evidence. But, in the absence of more direct evidence, Plaintiff's counsel is being given this last chance to explain his reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With respect to the instant Motion (DE 29), Defendants seek fees and costs, from Plaintiff, associated with the original setting of Plaintiff's deposition, to which Plaintiff failed to appear. The guiding light for the Court's analysis is always reasonableness, fully informed by its duty to exercise care and restraint in awarding fees, lest \"[u]ndue generosity encourage some members of the bar to seek out clients and encourage litigation over disputes that otherwise might not reach the courts.\" 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   : Civil 3d \u00a7 2675.1 (1998 &amp; West Supp. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To calculate a reasonable fee, the Court must utilize the \"lodestar\" method of multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by the reasonable hourly rate.\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

The Court is deemed an expert on the issue of hourly rates in this community and may properly consider \"its own knowledge and experience concerning reasonable and proper fees and may form an independent judgment either with or without the aid of witnesses as to value.\"\n   <em>\n    Loranger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512029\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/776/#p781\">\n    10 F.3d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549528\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/836/1292/#p1299\">\n    836 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1303 ).

Here, Defendants claim that Mr. Kleppin expended .3 of an hour of work on this matter, and the Court finds this to be reasonable. Thus, .3 of an hour, at a rate of $400 per hour, yields a total of $120. And, as to the costs for this deposition, which did not take place, Defendants have provided adequate documentation of the cost for the court reporter's attendance, $80, and this cost is additionally recoverable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
