(together with Barclays PLC, \"Barclays\" or the \"Company\"), Robert Diamond (\"Diamond\"), Antony Jenkins (\"Jenkins\"), Christopher Lucas, Tushar Morzaria, and William White (\"White,\" and collectively, \"Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 20.) By letters dated May 9, 2018, Defendants requested\n   permission to file motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 111, 113-114.) Plaintiffs opposed by letters dated May 11, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 108-110.) On July 17, 2018, the Court issued an Order denying Defendants' request to file motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"July 17 Order,\" Dkt. No. 120.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By letter dated July 31, 2018, Diamond and Jenkins (the \"CEO Defendants\") sought reconsideration of the July 17 Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"July 31 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 122.) The CEO Defendants argue that the July 17 Order improperly relied on arguments made by Plaintiffs in their letter motion opposing summary judgment, and that, in fact, there is no record evidence of Diamond or Jenkins's culpable participation or control personal liability. As a result, according to the CEO Defendants, the claims against Diamond and Jenkins under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Section 20(a)\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court then held a telephone conference during which it heard arguments from the parties, and advised Plaintiffs to submit concrete evidence substantiating their argument that genuine disputes of material fact exist with respect to the Section 20(a) claims against Diamond and Jenkins. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Minute Entry for 8/8/2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By letter dated August 14, 2018, Plaintiffs responded to the July 31 Letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"August 14 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 123.) Plaintiffs largely rely on the same arguments advanced in their letter motion opposing summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 109): they argue that Diamond and Jenkins have provided no basis for the \"extraordinary remedy\" of reconsideration, particularly given that the CEO Defendants have offered no new legal or factual evidence in support of their claims. Plaintiffs assert that Diamond and Jenkins were \"CEOs with ultimate authority over and involvement in the day-to-day management of Barclays' businesses.\" (Dkt. No. 123 at 8.) In support of their arguments, Plaintiffs submit (1) an email chain \"demonstrating that Defendant White's department, which operated LX, prepared a document on high frequency trading for Defendant Jenkins during the Class Period\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6); (2) two \"settlement agreements with both the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and the State of New York\" allegedly demonstrating that Barclays admitted to having \"engaged in unlawful conduct in violation of the federal securities laws\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8); and (3) Defendants' responses to Plaintiffs' requests for admission which purportedly \"confirm[ ] the accuracy of [Defendants'] admissions\" of unlawful conduct as outlined in the settlement agreements (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By letter dated August 21, 2018, the CEO Defendants replied to the August 14 Letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 124.) The CEO Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot \"meaningfully tie any of their arguments to actionable misstatements,\" and even if they could, those arguments fail because Plaintiffs \"cannot establish that Diamond or Jenkins controlled the statements or culpably participated in them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The CEO Defendants assert that Plaintiffs \"have attached no emails relating to Diamond and only a single email chain relating to Jenkins,\" in which Jenkins does not in fact participate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.2.) According to the CEO Defendants, the email chain does not demonstrate that Jenkins actually received the primer on high frequency trading that is referenced therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The CEO Defendants also note that the\n   two consent decrees between Barclays and regulators submitted by Plaintiffs do not mention Diamond and Jenkins, and that those consent decrees, in addition to Defendants' responses to Plaintiffs' requests for admission, are \"irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay, and cannot be used as evidence against Diamond and Jenkins, who did not review, admit or adopt any part of them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the motion of Diamond and Jenkins for reconsideration is GRANTED.

In ruling that genuine disputes of material fact existed as to the control person liability and culpable participation of Diamond and Jenkins, the Court credited Plaintiffs' arguments that the CEO Defendants each participated in the day-to-day management of Barclays, and therefore had access to information contradicting the misrepresentations at issue, but did nothing about it, thereby raising material disputes about the highly fact-intensive issue of the CEO Defendants' scienter. But, as discussed in further detail below, Plaintiffs have failed to submit concrete admissible evidence substantiating their arguments that a genuine dispute of material fact exists with respect to the culpable participation of Diamond and Jenkins. In fact, Plaintiffs have submitted no concrete evidence demonstrating the culpable participation of the CEO Defendants. Diamond and Jenkins have therefore made a \"showing of exceptional circumstances, whereby factual matters that were put before the Court on the underlying motion were misconstrued.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re SAIC, Inc. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12 Civ. 1353,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20407050\">\n    2014 WL 407050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2014) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The CEO Defendants' motion for reconsideration is therefore granted, and the Section 20(a) claims against Diamond and Jenkins are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs, in their letter motions opposing summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 109 &amp; 123), argue that genuine disputes of material fact prohibit summary judgment on the Section 20(a) claims against Diamond and Jenkins. In particular, Plaintiffs argue that as a result of their positions as CEOs of Barclays during the Class Period and signatories of Barclays' SEC Filings, Diamond and Jenkins had the power to direct the management and policies of Defendant William White, who oversaw LX and is liable for violations of the securities laws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 123 at 7.) Plaintiffs also cite, but did not submit to the Court, deposition testimony of Jenkins that purportedly demonstrates that, as CEOs during the Class Period, Diamond and Jenkins both \"exerted ultimate authority over every business segment within Barclays, including LX.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that culpable participation is an issue of intent not appropriately considered on a summary judgment motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Plaintiffs submit that Jenkins's deposition testimony establishes the CEO Defendants' \"participation in management and access to information contradicting the misrepresentations at issue,\" which suffices to raise an inference of their culpable participation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response to the Court's direction to Plaintiffs to submit concrete evidence substantiating their claims, Plaintiffs submitted to this Court only four documents -- none of which has any bearing on whether disputed issues of material fact prevent summary judgment on the Section 20 (a) claims against Diamond and Jenkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs' first submission is an email chain that purportedly demonstrates that White's department prepared a document on high frequency trading (\"HFT\") for Jenkins during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The CEO Defendants, however, correctly point out that Jenkins did not contribute to this email chain, nor is there any evidence\n   in the proffered email that Jenkins did in fact receive the \"HFT primer\" under discussion in the email. In fact, Jenkins testified that he did not recall receiving the primer referenced in the email chain, nor did he recall \"speaking about high frequency trading or LX at the industry conference for which the primer was prepared.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 124 at 4 n.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition to this email, Plaintiffs submit two consent decrees: one between Barclays Capital Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), and one between Barclays and the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York. Finally, Plaintiffs submit Defendants' Answers and Objections to Plaintiffs' Requests for Admission dated April 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But, as the CEO Defendants point out, Plaintiffs fail to explain how these consent decrees -- which Plaintiffs do not argue were signed by, or even mention, Diamond or Jenkins -- demonstrate the culpable participation of the CEO Defendants. Indeed, even Plaintiffs' own arguments evidence the fact that these consent decrees demonstrate only \"conduct which Barclays admitted to,\" not misconduct admitted by Diamond or Jenkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While it is true that applying the control person standard \"necessarily involves an individualized, fact-sensitive analysis,\"\n   <em>\n    Alstom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"904325\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/406/433/#p490\">\n    406 F.Supp.2d at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a \"defendant still can prevail on a control person issue by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the defendant was a culpable participant in the alleged fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

But Plaintiffs submit no particularized evidence raising an inference of Diamond or Jenkins's recklessness: that is, Plaintiffs offer no concrete admissible evidence to suggest that Diamond or Jenkins knew or should have known about the alleged fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At best, the deposition testimony of Jenkins demonstrates questions of material fact as to control, since the testimony speaks to the CEOs' involvement in the day-to-day management of Barclays and their purported \"ultimate authority\" over every business segment within the Company. But this evidence potentially relating to control does not connect Diamond or Jenkins to any of the alleged misstatements, let alone raise a reasonable inference of culpable participation by Diamond or Jenkins or an intent to defraud. Diamond and Jenkins's responsibility for public messages issued both internally and externally to Barclays, without a more tangible connection to the misstatements alleged in the Amended Complaint, does not demonstrate their culpable participation regarding those specific misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The courts in this and other circuits refuse to find scienter where the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate wilfulness or recklessness.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.
