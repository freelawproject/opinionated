SUMMARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioners are unauthorized aliens in various stages of the process of seeking to become Lawful Permanent Residents, and their spouses, who are United States citizens. Among other things, petitioners claim that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), is attempting to remove the alien petitioners from the United States in violation of regulations permitting them to apply for provisional waivers of their inadmissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   More specifically, petitioners claim that ICE's attempts to remove the aliens before they can pursue and receive a decision on their applications for provisional waivers violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In particular, they allege that \u00a7 212.7 gives the aliens a liberty interest in remaining with their families in the United States while they pursue their applications for provisional waivers with Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"CIS\"), another agency of DHS. They also allege that the Constitution provides the United States citizen petitioners with a liberty interest in living with their spouses in the United States while their provisional waiver applications are being decided. They\n   claim that ICE is unlawfully depriving them of those liberty interests by attempting to deport the alien petitioners based solely on their final orders of removal and without considering whether they should be allowed to pursue provisional waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioners also assert that ICE's actions are \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (A). Finally, petitioners alleged that ICE is unlawfully targeting them for deportation on the basis of their race in violation of their constitutional right to Equal Protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioners have moved for a preliminary injunction. They also seek certification to represent a class of similarly situated individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Respondents have moved to dismiss on multiple grounds. Respondents assert that three provisions of the REAL ID Act, which amended\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , deprive this court of jurisdiction over this case. With regard to the merits, respondents argue that petitioners fail to state any claim on which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the reasons explained in this Memorandum, the respondents' motion to dismiss is being denied. The court finds that it has jurisdiction concerning the petitioners' claims and that petitioners have stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. More specifically, contrary to respondents' contention,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) do not divest the court of jurisdiction in this case because there is not a means to have the issues presented decided by a court of appeals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) would strip this court of jurisdiction over petitioners' claims if allowed to operate. However, the Suspension Clause of the Constitution guarantees petitioners review of their claims in some federal court, and because those claims cannot be presented to a court of appeals, this court has jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, petitioners have stated a plausible claim that they are being deprived of their right to procedural due process. The court finds that ICE may only remove petitioners after considering the fact that they are pursuing those waivers and the policies codified in the provisional waiver regulations. The court is reserving judgment on the viability of petitioners' other claims regarding removal, including their APA and Equal Protection claims. The court has previously decided petitioners' claims concerning detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v. Cronen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    317 F.Supp.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2018), and now finds they are not moot. Petitioners' motions for a preliminary injunction and for class certification will be addressed in future proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Petitioners filed their Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on February 5, 2018. On April 10, 2018, the petitioners filed an Amended Complaint and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 13, 2018, the court ordered respondents not to remove any of the named alien petitioners from Massachusetts while this case is pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ICE has directed its officers to obey this Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Opp. to Mot. for Clarification (Docket No. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 23, 2018, respondents filed their Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, which petitioners opposed. On May 8, 2018, the court issued an oral decision regarding the petitioners' detention claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 8, 2018 Tr. (Docket. No. 73); May 8, 2018 Order (Docket No. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 11, 2018, the court issued a Memorandum amplifying that decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    317 F.Supp.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that Memorandum, the court explained that it had jurisdiction to consider claims by aliens that ICE violated the statute and regulations governing detention and removal, as well as the Due Process Clause, by detaining the aliens for more than three months without an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also held that ICE had failed to follow its regulations with respect to the two aliens whose detention was then at issue, Eduardo Junqueira and Lucimar De Souza.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    at 647-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the most appropriate remedy for ICE's violation of their rights to due process would be an exercise of its equitable authority to decide promptly itself whether each should be released.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    at 656-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, on May 8, 2018, after the court's oral ruling, ICE released Junqueira and De Souza. ICE subsequently released approximately 20 other aliens that it determined were being improperly detained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 20 and 21, 2018, the court held hearings on petitioners' claims concerning removal, as well as respondents' argument that their detention claims are now moot. On August 23, 2018, the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims in an oral decision, which this Memorandum memorializes and amplifies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III. THE PROVISIONAL WAIVER REGULATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the heart of petitioners' procedural due process claims are regulations that give CIS the discretion to permit certain aliens with final orders of removal or deportation to remain in the United States with their United States citizen spouses, and often their citizen children, while seeking a discretionary decision by CIS that, if granted, would make him or her a Lawful Permanent Resident after departing the United States briefly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ;\n   <em>\n    Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050244\">\n    81 Fed.

In 2013, DHS recognized that: this scheme caused a separation of United States citizen spouses, and often United States citizen children, from their husbands, their wives, and parents for a year or more; this created financial, emotional, and humanitarian hardships that the waiver process is intended to avoid; and that separating families that included at least one United States citizen was incompatible with promoting family unification, an important objective of the United States immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%20536\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, in 2013, DHS adopted regulations to\n   permit unlawful aliens who were immediate relatives of United States citizens to apply while in the United States for provisional waivers of the unlawful presence bars to readmission, and to leave only briefly before being readmitted and becoming Lawful Permanent Residents upon re-entering the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%20536\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 2016 these regulations were amended and expanded to make unlawful aliens with final orders of removal eligible for provisional waivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050244\">\n    81 Fed.

Calderon married Luis Gordillo, a United States citizen, in 2016, after they had lived together for 10 years. They have two children, ages two and four, who are United States citizens. ICE arrested Calderon at her I-130 interview on January 17, 2018.

In its explanation of the 2013 Rule, DHS stated that it did not intend the pending waiver application to prevent ICE from removing all aliens applying for unlawful presence waivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%20536\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, DHS evidently intended that in some circumstances ICE should be allowed to remove aliens who are applying for provisional waivers. However, a decision by ICE to remove an alien pursuing a provisional waiver solely because he or she has a final order of removal would, as a practical matter, eliminate that alien's right to apply for a provisional waiver and CIS's opportunity to decide the merits of the application before the alien must depart the United States and be separated from his or her family. The binding promises to United States citizens and their alien spouses in the provisional waiver regulations would be meaningless, and their purposes would be undermined, if ICE were not required to consider that an alien with a final order of removal is seeking a provisional waiver before requiring him or her to leave the United States. There is no reason to conclude that, having promulgated the provisional waiver regulations in 2013, and amended them in 2016 to make aliens with final orders of removal eligible for such waivers, the Secretary of DHS intended to allow ICE to ignore the regulations and their important purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In essence, this case is analogous to\n   <em>\n    Ceta v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079321\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/639/#p643\">\n    535 F.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (7th Cir. 2008). In\n   <em>\n    Ceta\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit held on direct review, not habeas review, that although it did not generally have jurisdiction to review an immigration judge's discretionary decision, such as the denial of a continuance, it \"retain[ed] jurisdiction ... if that denial operates to nullify some statutory right or leads inescapably to a substantive adverse decision on the merits of an immigration claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079321\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/639/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079321\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/639/#p643\">\n    at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). The Seventh Circuit found that \"[t]he [immigration judge]'s denial -- more specifically, the BIA's affirmation of that denial -- of Mr. Ceta's request for a continuance amounts,\" under the circumstances of that case, \"to a denial of his statutory right to apply for adjustment of status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079321\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/639/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Seventh Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    The BIA's ruling has the effect of a substantive ruling on [Mr. Ceta's] application to adjust his status\n   </em>\n   . Under the INA, in general, an administratively final order of removal, unless appealed, must be executed within a period of 90 days. Moreover, once an alien has been removed, he no longer may obtain adjustment of status based on marriage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(A), 1255(a)(2). Because of the denial of the continuance, therefore, Mr. Ceta's statutory right to apply for adjustment of status is trapped within a regulatory interstice: Section 1255 and the amended regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20245.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), afford him an opportunity to seek adjustment of status with the USCIS, but he will be deported by [ICE] before the USCIS is able to adjudicate that application. Indeed, under the new regulatory regime, unless these subagencies engage in some minimal coordination of their respective proceedings--for example, by the immigration courts favorably exercising discretion, in the appropriate case, to continue proceedings to allow the other subagency to act--the statutory opportunity to seek adjustment of status will prove to be a mere illusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20245.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20245.2\">\n    at 646-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This reasoning is equally applicable in the instant case in which the regulations create an entitlement to receive a decision concerning a provisional waiver in the United States. Therefore, the court\n   finds that ICE may not order the removal of an alien pursuing a provisional waiver solely because he or she is subject to a final order of removal. Rather, ICE must consider the reasons for the provisional waiver regime and the facts of the alien's particular case before deciding to order a removal that eliminates CIS's opportunity to decide the merits of the request, and the right of the alien to pursue, and potentially receive, a provisional waiver. Other courts addressing the provisional waiver process have reached similar conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villavicencio Calderon v.

In their Amended Complaint, petitioners allege with adequate specificity a \"pattern\" of arrests at the CIS offices, indicating that ICE has been \"systematically targeting\" for arrest, detention, and removal individuals who were applying for provisional waivers or launching that process at their I-130 interviews. This claim is plausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The respondents asserted for the first time at the August 20, 2018 hearing that even if\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   entitles aliens seeking an unlawful presence waiver to an exercise of discretion concerning their applications before they are deported, that entitlement only vests when they receive an approved I-212 waiver of the removal order-based bar and become eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver under \u00a7 212.7(e) (3) and (e)(4). The respondents did not present this argument in their several memoranda concerning the motions to dismiss or for preliminary injunction. As a result, the petitioners did not have fair notice and an opportunity to address it in their submissions.

The Kelly Memorandum states that DHS \"no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\" Kelly Memorandum at 2. This court's ruling on petitioners' motion to dismiss does not exempt all aliens with final orders of removal who are seeking provisional waivers from being removed.

In any event, Calderon was released only after she filed this case. Her release was part of a pattern of ICE releasing detainees who filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus, but continuing to detain other individuals without complying with \u00a7 241.4, even as ICE interprets it. Indeed, ICE has admitted that at least until May 2018, it frequently kept aliens in detention in violation of \u00a7 241.4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 8, 2018 Tr. at 15-18, 22-25, 35-36;\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    317 F.Supp.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After this court's May 8, 2018 Order, ICE discovered that it was detaining at least 30 aliens in violation of its regulations, as it interpreted them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525913\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/626/\">\n    at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Although ICE released both De Souza and Calderon, their claims regarding detention are not moot because there is a reasonable likelihood that in the future ICE will violate the process the court found is due to them. More specifically, there is a reasonable likelihood that ICE will detain the petitioners again and continue their detention without the notice and opportunity to be heard required by ICE's regulations and the Fifth Amendment.

Respondents have not satisfied this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In their April 3, 2018 status report, respondents stated that they may detain Calderon again to effectuate her removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 23. The respondents have not disclaimed an intention to detain De Souza again if her detention claims are dismissed. The court has been informed that the Boston ICE office has undertaken efforts, including internal auditing, training, and hiring new staff to ensure that detainees receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before being detained for more than three months. However, there is evidence that the Boston ICE office has continued to violate \u00a7 241.4 after the training occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 26, 2018 Memorandum and Order (Docket No. 106) at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Matias v.

This indicates that ICE staff might not be receiving or implementing the instructions of superiors. In addition, there is the potential for changes in the leadership of the ICE Boston Office that creates a risk that new management will be appointed and end the current efforts to improve ICE's detention and custody review practices. For example, this court adjourned these proceedings in May 2018 to provide then-Acting ICE Boston Office Director Thomas Brophy an opportunity to devote attention to making a transition to his designated acting successor, Todd Lyons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 23, 2018 Order (Docket No. 85) at 2. However, Lyons was only allowed to serve for four days before being replaced by Rebecca Adducci, who disclaimed representations made to the court by Lyons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Substituted Party (Docket No. 100); Declaration of Rebecca J. Adducci (Docket No. 100) \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In these circumstances, the respondents have not shown that it is \"absolutely clear\" that petitioners cannot \"reasonably expect\" ICE will not violate the Constitution and relevant regulations by detaining them again and causing them irreparable harm. The Supreme Court and courts of appeals have found that a detainee's release did not moot comparable claims brought by alien habeas petitioners where \"absent action by this court[,] the government could redetain [the petitioner], and deny him [due process], at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diouf v.
