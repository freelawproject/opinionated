The Program governs the temporary employment of non-immigrant foreign workers in non-agricultural businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are business entities who rely on the Program to obtain workers, as well as trade associations whose members rely on the Program to maintain their workforces. ECF 44 (Second Amended Complaint), \u00b6\u00b6 12-17. In particular, they are Outdoor Amusement Business Association, Inc.; Maryland State Showmen's Association, Inc.; The Small and Seasonal Business Legal Center; Lasting Impressions Landscape Contractors, Inc.; Three Seasons Landscape Contracting Services, Inc.; and New Castle Lawn &amp; Landscape, Inc. They have sued the following defendants,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-22: the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"); the United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), a component agency of DHS that operates service centers for adjudicating H-2B visas; the Department of Labor (\"DOL\"); the Employment &amp; Training Administration (\"ETA\"), a component agency of DOL that participates in promulgating legislative regulations to administer the H-2B program; and the Wage &amp; Hour Division (\"WHD\"), another component of DOL, which promulgates legislative regulations \"to enforce substantive requirements ... imposed by DOL on employers in the H-2B program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.

See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii)(A) and (D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   This interim final rule, which is virtually identical to the 2012 final rule that DOL developed following public notice and comment,\n   <em>\n    improves DOL's ability to determine whether it is appropriate to grant a temporary employment certification.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The Departments believe that these procedures and additional worker protections will lead to an improved temporary employment certification process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In other words, although the 2015 Interim Final Rule reiterates the temporary labor certification requirement, as set forth in the 2008 Labor-Certification Regulations, the 2015 Interim Final Rule's clear objective is to establish \"the process by which employers obtain a temporary labor certification from DOL for use in petitioning DHS to employ a nonimmigrant worker in H-2B status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24042 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24045 (\"DHS has therefore made DOL's approval of a temporary labor certification a condition precedent to the acceptance of the H-2B petition.... This interim final rule establishes the process by which employers obtain a temporary labor certification and the protections that apply to H-2B workers and corresponding workers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, plaintiffs point to \"the second line of the 2015 IFR,\" which says that the rules relate to \" '8 C.F.R. Part 214.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   80 Fed. Reg. at 24042; ECF 111-1 at 51. According to plaintiffs, \"This line means that the 2008 DHS Rule was 'directly affected' by the 2015 IFR.\" ECF 111-1 at 51. This misconstrues the requirement and purpose of the reopening doctrine, which only applies when an agency engages in\n   <em>\n    \"serious, substantive reconsideration\"\n   </em>\n   of an existing rule.\n   <em>\n    P &amp; V Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864657,3639958\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/1021/\">\n    516 F.3d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Mining Ass'n,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689761,11934068\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/1345/\">\n    70 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1352 ).

To be sure, the 2015 IFR states that it \"seek[s] public input on every aspect of this interim final rule.\" 80 Fed. Reg. at 24050. However, just as the mere invocation of a subsection of the C.F.R. does not trigger the reopening doctrine, neither does the agency's decision to welcome general comments on \"every aspect\" of an interim final rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep.

For one, plaintiffs could make a strong argument that the choice to consult with the Department of Transportation, which has no experience or expertise in assessing labor markets, is an arbitrary and capricious one. More important, that new consulting relationship would bear none of the hallmarks of Congressional acknowledgement and approval that are present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   I acknowledge the apparent rarity of finding rulemaking authority without explicit statutory authority. Plaintiffs assert in their supplemental briefing, ECF 124 at 3-4: \"The only individual that has ever determined that DOL should be a consultant is the Secretary of Homeland Security or her predecessors.\" But, that is not the whole story. As discussed, Congress has repeatedly and over a long period recognized DOL's role, and the validity of its rules, albeit not via statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Forestry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236316\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/653/#p658\">\n    745 F.3d at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants' Other Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Delegation Provision of the INA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Government maintains that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) gives DHS the power to delegate any of its responsibilities, including rulemaking, to anyone in the federal government, including the Secretary of Labor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 102-1 at 25, 46 n.22; ECF 113 at 37. The Government employs this argument largely to defend DHS's decision to seek temporary labor certifications from DOL, but reprises it to justify DOL's role in the 2015 Rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Although the scope of DHS's authority to delegate under \u00a7 1103(a)(6) is something of a gray area, I am not entirely convinced by defendants' argument. For one, the statutory language does not seem to support a delegation of this breadth. Section 1103(a)(6) provides: \"[The Secretary of Homeland Security] is authorized to confer or impose upon any\n   <em>\n    employee\n   </em>\n   of the United States ... any of the\n   <em>\n    powers,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    privileges, or duties\n   </em>\n   conferred or imposed by this chapter or regulations issued thereunder upon\n   <em>\n    officers or employees of the Service.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The language presents two potential obstacles to defendants' interpretation. First, is rulemaking authority one of the \"powers, privileges, or duties\" conferred on \"officers or employees of the Service?\" It would seem not. In the same statutory section, Congress has instructed that the Secretary of Homeland Security \"shall establish such regulations ... as he deems necessary for carrying out his authority....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Although the Secretary may subdelegate his responsibilities to subordinate agencies and officers, the power to issue regulations is conferred on him by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Second, given the general rule that only Congress can confer rulemaking authority, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there would appear to be a presumption against the theory that the head of one agency can in fact assign the power to issue binding rules to \"any employee\" of another agency. Under the Government's reading, could the Secretary of Homeland Security confer rulemaking authority on a health inspector for the Department of Agriculture, or on a private in the U.S. Army? Defendants have offered no limiting principle for their interpretation. On this basis, it is not clear that DHS validly delegated rulemaking authority to DOL, such that DOL could issue the 2015 Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   My conclusion is qualified, however, in the context of the 2015 Enforcement Rules. Section 1184(c)(14)(B) provides: \"The Secretary of Homeland Security may delegate to the Secretary of Labor, with the agreement of the Secretary of Labor, any of the authority given to the Secretary of Homeland Security under subparagraph (A)(i).\" Subparagraph (A)(i) authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to impose administrative remedies on employers who fail to meet any of the conditions of their H-2B petitions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1184(c)(14)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Pursuant to this section, DHS formally redelegated a portion of its enforcement authority to DOL in January of 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR003764-65 (\"Delegation of Authority to the Department of Labor under Section 214(c)(14)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\"). The Inter-Agency Agreement accompanying the delegation letter provided that \"DOL will issue regulations as needed for the implementation and operation of the enforcement authority....\" AR003768. Plaintiffs concede that DHS may delegate some of its enforcement power under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 92-1 at 50. However, they assert that the delegable authority does not include the power to make rules or regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Given that Congress clearly anticipated that DOL would be delegated some enforcement authority, it seems likely that Congress also anticipated that DOL might need to engage in limited rulemaking to support its enforcement efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Plaintiffs do not discuss the 2015 Enforcement Rules with any degree of particularity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 50-52. DOL has been delegated the power to \"impose administrative remedies\" on an employer, \"in addition to any other remedy authorized by law,\" once DOL \"finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, a substantial failure to meet any of the conditions of the petition to admit or otherwise provide status to\" an H-2B worker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201184\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(14). To the extent that the 2015 Enforcement Rules support that lawfully delegated power, those rules are permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Joint Rulemaking\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Defendants also maintain that, were the Court to conclude that DOL has no authority to issue rules, this defect could be somehow remedied by the \"joint issuance\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   of these rules with DHS. The Government asserts that \"there is nothing inherently impermissible about joint rulemaking.\" ECF 102-1 at 43. Indeed, there are many examples of joint rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jody Freeman &amp; Jim Rossi,\n   <em>\n    Agency Coordination in Shared Regulatory Space\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201131\">\n    125 Harv. L. Rev. 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1165-68 (2012) (collecting examples). However, as plaintiffs point out, agencies tend to use joint rulemaking \"where Congress has allocated each of them a role implementing one or a set of related statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201131\">\n    at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Defendants do not point to any examples of joint rulemaking where only one agency has rulemaking authority, and the other agency simply consents to be subject to those rules. Rather, they contend that \"neither the INA nor the APA prohibit the agencies' jointly issued rules, and plaintiffs cite no authority that mandates that joint rules may only be issued through express congressional authorization.\" ECF 102-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   To be sure, joint rulemaking is not prohibited, and it may even be advisable where agencies have overlapping jurisdiction. But, the Government has presented no authority to suggest that joint rulemaking carries any independent legal significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Defendants assert that \"the agencies' joint participation in 2015 eliminates any doubt that any part of the rules was issued without ample authority.\" ECF 102-1 at 44. As support for this proposition, defendants quote from their own rule: \"To ensure that there can be no question about the authority for and validity of the regulations in this area, DHS and DOL ... together are issuing this interim final rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting 80 Fed. Reg. at 24045 ). But wishing does not make it so. The concern with defendants' prior rules issued by DOL has never been skepticism that DOL and DHS shared the same goals; it was that DHS and DOL cannot lawfully achieve those goals in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Government also relies on the decisions of the Northern District of Florida and the Eleventh Circuit to support their theory that joint rulemaking solves prior problems of authority. They note that \"the same district court that twice issued an injunction against DOL's unilaterally issued H-2B rules ... has since concluded that the joint rules at issue in this case are a valid exercise of DHS's authority.\" ECF 102-1 at 44 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bayou III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346038\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/173/1271/#p1276\">\n    173 F. Supp. 3d at 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289-91 ). The district court in\n   <em>\n    Bayou III\n   </em>\n   , considering the 2015 Rules, did not expressly endorse defendants' joint rulemaking, but it did observe in a footnote that although \"DOL did not have unilateral authority to promulgate H-2B regulations.... [t]he 2015 Program Rule and Wage Rule were promulgated jointly by DHS and DOL in response.\"\n   <em>\n    Bayou III,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346038\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/173/1271/#p1276\">\n    173 F.Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1277 n.2.

To the extent that this ruling carries any weight, it supports the Government. However, given that the\n   <em>\n    BayouIII\n   </em>\n   Court declined to discuss the joint rulemaking in any detail, the case's persuasive value as to this point is minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On this question, the significance of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Bayou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558329\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1080/#p1085\">\n    713 F.3d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is thinner still. Defendants observe that the court rejected the proposition that DOL \"is empowered to engage in rulemaking, even without the DHS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558329\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1080/#p1085\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558329\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1080/#p1085\">\n    at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They reason that the inverse must also be true: \"where DOL issues rules jointly with, rather than 'without' DHS, such jointly promulgated rules are unquestionably fully consistent with the INA and APA.\" ECF 102-1 at 45. I am unable to discern anything in the Eleventh Circuit's decision that supports this inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In the alternative, defendants assert, in a footnote, that \"it is unnecessary for the Court to reach the question of DOL's rulemaking authority because the joint rules are a proper exercise of DHS's rulemaking\n   authority. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). In such a case, DOL's signature would be surplusage; it would not invalidate the rule.\" ECF 102-1 at 44 n.20.
