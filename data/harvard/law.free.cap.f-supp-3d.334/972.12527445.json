Defendants City of Burlington (the City) and Officer Jesse Hill (Hill) (collectively, Defendants) resist. The Court conducted a hearing on the Motion on August 1, 2018. Attorney Michael Giudicessi was present for Intervenors, attorney David O'Brien was present for Plaintiffs, and attorneys Martha Shaff and Brandon Lobberecht were present for Defendants. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 14, 2016, Plaintiffs Gabriel Steele (Gabriel), individually, as executor of the estate of his deceased wife Autumn Steele (Autumn) and as next of friend for his minor child, G.S.; Sean Schoff, as next of friend for his minor child, K.S.; and Gina Colbert (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this lawsuit against Defendants. This lawsuit stems from Autumn's tragic death on January 6, 2015, when she was struck by an errant bullet fired by Officer Hill in response to what Hill perceived as a threat from the Steeles' family dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs charged Defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violating their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs also sued under Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the Iowa Constitution and asserted various claims under Iowa tort law against Defendants. Several counts were dismissed by the Court in a prior order on Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Steele v. City of Burlington\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00105-JEG (S.D.

On January 12, 2018, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Consistent with their Protective Order, the parties' briefs and other documents relating to the cross-motions for summary judgment were filed under seal. On February 24, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion to unseal the summary judgment record. The parties' briefs filed in support of and in resistance to Plaintiffs' motion to unseal were filed under seal. On May 24, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment. On June\n   5, 2018, prior to the Court's ruling on the pending motions, counsel notified the Court that the case had settled. Thus, the Court did not ultimately decide the motions, and on June 6, 2018, all deadlines and pending motions before the Court were terminated. On August 7, 2018, counsel stipulated to the dismissal of all causes of action filed by Plaintiffs against Defendants, with prejudice, pursuant to the terms of their settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 12, 2018, Intervenors filed their motion to unseal all court filings in this case.

As the\n   <em>\n    IDT\n   </em>\n   court recognized, the modern federal trend is to treat materials like pleadings as judicial records \"\n   <em>\n    even when the case is pending before judgment, or resolved by settlement\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    IDT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546783\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/1220/#p1222\">\n    709 F.3d at 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).

The logic behind this principle is sound; if judgment by the Court was a precondition to judicial record status, numerous pleadings and other filings relating to merit-based motions would never be available for public scrutiny, leaving the general public in the dark about the core issues that drive a lawsuit. Moreover, the records did \"play a role in the adjudicative process\" with the Court's hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536140\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/283/#p290\">\n    707 F.3d at 290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, Defendants' central argument is that because Iowa law deems certain materials confidential-specifically, Officer Timothy Merryman and Hill's body camera videos, Hill's medical records, and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) investigative files-the Court must defer to Iowa law as a compelling reason for maintaining confidentiality. Defendants argue the City is subject to a significant likelihood of prejudice if disclosure is allowed, as the City is currently defending itself in an open records proceeding before the Iowa Public Information Board (IPIB), and a decision by this Court that there is a common-law right of access would supersede the IPIB's adjudicatory process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants fear that a\n   ruling by this Court that the documents are not confidential could subject Defendants to monetary penalties for non-compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Iowa Open Records Act) based on a finding of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   by the IPIB.

Defendants' primary argument is that the materials are confidential because Iowa law controls them. This argument is problematic in several respects. As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Part II.B.1, the documents filed in conjunction with the cross-motions for summary judgment are judicial records belonging to the Court.
