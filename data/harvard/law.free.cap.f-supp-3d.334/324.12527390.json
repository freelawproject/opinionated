The Court next addresses whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the jurisprudential requirements necessary to raise those claims in federal court. As explained below, while the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to bring the action, it grants DHS's motion to dismiss because Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Additionally, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion to file the sur-reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court first evaluates whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring their policy-or-practice claim. While DHS moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint on both jurisdictional grounds under Federal Rule 12(b)(1) and substantive grounds under Federal Rule 12(b)(6), DHS rests both of those arguments on Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, as discussed below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's. Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Def's. Mot. Dismiss (\"Def. Mem.\") at 3 (stating that because \"Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies,\" they \"have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\" and \"this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction\"), ECF No. 11.
