From plaintiffs' perspective, FOSTA offends the Constitution in a variety of ways: it is overbroad, vague, impermissibly targets speech based on viewpoint and content, pares back immunity from certain state law claims, erodes the scienter requirement, and wrongly criminalizes conduct that was lawful at the time committed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants, United States and Attorney General Jefferson B.

Woodhull's Motion for Preliminary Injunction cited its annual Sexual Freedom Summit, scheduled to take place in Virginia from August 2-5, as the primary basis for standing. That event has now taken place. The Summit, the Court is told, featured workshops on topics such as \"Sex and Disability: Shifting the Focus to Disabled Sex Workers\" and \"Capitalism is not Consensual: Sex Workers and the Shaky Foundations of Consent.\" Levy Decl. \u00b6 22. As part of the summit, Woodhull used social media, such as Facebook Live and Twitter, to reach individuals unable to attend in person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-26. Livestreamed events included titles such as \"Criminalization of Sex Work is a Human Rights Violation and a Labor Rights Concern,\" \"FOSTA! How Congress Broke the Internet,\" and \"Sexual Freedom in the Age of Trump.\" https://www.sexualfreedomsummit.org/.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Woodhull does not assert that, by livestreaming or promoting its workshops, or publishing biographies and contact information of sex workers, it intends to facilitate acts of prostitution by those sex workers. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74, 80-81. Nevertheless, Woodhull believes that federal, state, or local authorities could wield \"the broad, vague, and undefined prohibitions contained in FOSTA\" against it for having sponsored the Sexual Freedom Summit. Reply at 3. That is so because, under Woodhull's reading of the statute, FOSTA does not \"suggest discernable limits for what might constitute promotion or facilitation of prostitution or trafficking.\" Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Woodhull is particularly concerned with Section 2421A's use of the terms \"promoting\" and \"facilitating.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 7/19/2018 Hr'g 6:16-22 (stating that Woodhull \"provide[s] workshops for sex workers, again,\n   to provide safety information, to advocate on their behalf....

First, plaintiffs cite one case from the Northern District of Illinois and two Seventh Circuit opinions. They do so in support of the proposition that merely providing a platform for speech of someone who might commit illegal acts \"does not satisfy the ordinary understanding of culpable assistance to a wrongdoer.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Ill. 2009). That line of cases, however, only reaffirms the Government's position! That is so because those opinions reaffirm that, for platforms said to promote or facilitate particular illegal acts, the law imposes a heightened\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GTE Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049761\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/655/#p659\">\n    347 F.3d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the activity of the internet service provider \"does not satisfy the ordinary understanding of culpable assistance to a wrongdoer, which requires a\n   <em>\n    desire\n   </em>\n   to promote the wrongful venture's success\" (emphasis added) ). Indeed, Section 2421A contains just such a heightened\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement, demanding that the Government prove\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   - rather than knowledge, or even recklessness - to promote or facilitate. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421A(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Then, in a footnote, plaintiffs cite the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of \"promote\" as \"to advance or actively support,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. 2007), and Black's Law Dictionary's definition of \"to facilitate\" as \"to make the occurrence of (something) less difficult,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Prelim.

Instead, they strip \"promote\" and \"facilitate\" from the rest of Section 2421A(a), ignoring both the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement and the language \"prostitution of another person,\" which denotes specific unlawful acts. Plaintiffs' preferred method of statutory interpretation turns a blind eye to \"the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Veterans Legal Servs. Program v.

Cir. 2002) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Woodhull's construction of Section 2421A is flawed for additional reasons. First, Section 2421A mirrors an existing federal criminal law, the \"Travel Act,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The history of enforcement of the Travel Act gives a sense both of the meaning of the plain text of Section 2421A,\n   and of the likelihood of enforcement for specific conduct. The Travel Act bars the use of \"any facility in interstate or foreign commerce\" (such as the Internet) with the intent to \"promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishing, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity,\" including \"prostitution offenses in violation of the laws of the State in which they are committed or of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Woodhull does not present the Court with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   example of prosecution under the Travel Act that tracks its own theory of FOSTA's vast sweep. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's jury instruction, in a prosecution under the Travel Act, that \" 'to promote' or 'facilitate the promotion of' any illegal activity means to do an act that would cause the activity to be accomplished or to assist in the activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20F.3d%201158\">\n    95 F.3d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1996). This definition, with language like \"cause the activity to be accomplished,\" or \"assist in the activity,\" reflects the close causal connection required for prosecution under the Travel Act. Not surprisingly, recent prosecutions reflect the close connection between \"promoting\" and \"facilitating\" and the underlying, particular criminal act.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698709\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/10/#p12\">\n    500 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-19 (1st Cir. 2007) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ark. Aug. 5, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To be sure, plaintiffs attempt to distinguish Section 2421A from the Travel Act. They maintain that the Travel Act, unlike Section 2421A, proscribes specific acts of prostitution as defined in state law. Those state law violations are thus a predicate to a Travel Act offense. By contrast, plaintiffs say, FOSTA criminalizes \"anything that promotes or facilitates prostitution, and not a specific crime.\" 7/19/2018 Hr'g Tr. 16:10-13. This is particularly problematic because prostitution \"is an area where there has been significant advocacy, both by government entities and by private citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:14-16. As plaintiffs see it, that advocacy places them in FOSTA's crosshairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In pressing this argument, however, plaintiffs ignore key textual indications that make clear that FOSTA targets specific acts of illegal prostitution - not the abstract topic of prostitution or sex work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Stales v.

First, the text of Section 2421A criminalizes the conduct of owning, operating, or managing an interactive computer service with the intent to promote or facilitate \"the\n   <em>\n    prostitution of another person\n   </em>\n   .\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421A(a) (emphasis added). The reference to \"the prostitution of another person\" is plainly calculated to ensnare only specific unlawful acts with respect to a particular individual, not the broad subject-matter of prostitution. This reading of Section 2421A(a) is confirmed by Section 2421A(e), which states that the fact that prostitution is legal \"in the jurisdiction where the promotion or facilitation was targeted\" is an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12747\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/498/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2421A(e).
