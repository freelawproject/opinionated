App'x. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016) (\"the Department of Labor lawsuit\"), some of those plans and individual participants in the plans brought lawsuits against third parties to recover lost money. This is one such lawsuit. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant John Hancock Life Insurance Company of New York (\"John Hancock\"): (1) breached its fiduciary duties in violation of Section 1132(a)(2) and 1132(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)-(3) ; (2) violated Section 1962(c) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; and (3) conspired to violate RICO in violation of Section 1962(d) of RICO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending now are Defendant's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment. In its motion to dismiss, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' ERISA claims must be dismissed because it is not an ERISA fiduciary. It further argues that Plaintiffs' RICO claims must be dismissed for lack of standing and, alternatively, because the Complaint contains insufficient facts to support such claims. Plaintiffs, in turn, argue for summary judgment on their ERISA claims (but not their RICO claims). Plaintiffs and Defendant each attach various documents to their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion shall be granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiffs' Motion shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between 2002 and 2013, John Koresko and his affiliates operated a multiple employer welfare arrangement that purportedly allowed employers to purchase cash value life insurance policies and take a tax deduction for the premiums as a business expense. In fact, Koresko systematically converted and misused the assets, which were held in trusts, of the welfare benefit plans that participated in the arrangement. The arrangement is comprehensively explained in the Department of Labor lawsuit opinion referenced\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Given the familiarity of the parties with that lawsuit, the Court will not describe the full extent of the arrangement here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To take advantage of the arrangement, a prospective participating employer signed an adoption agreement which established the employer's own welfare benefit plan, adopted a prototype provided to them by Koresko\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , and agreed to the terms of a pre-existing trust. Life insurance policies were taken on the lives of plan participants although the Trustee was named as the owner and beneficiary. Those policies were owned by the Trusts for the benefit of the welfare benefit plans. The Trust functioned as a pass through vehicle, receiving insurance premiums paid by the employer and paying them to the insurance company for the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Koresko's defalcations were effected by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , unauthorized and improper loans taken out against the cash value accumulated in life insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs here were among those whose policy was stripped, in part, of its cash value by Koresko. Plaintiff Complete Medical Care Services of NY, PC, Health and Welfare Benefit Plan (\"the Plan\") is one of the employee benefit plans that participated in the arrangement. Plaintiff Complete Medical Care Services of NY, PC (\"CMCS\") is the sponsoring employer of the Plan. And Plaintiff Aric D. Hausknecht is a participant of the Plan whose life was insured pursuant to a policy issued by Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs became aware of the Koresko arrangement through a financial advisor and decided to participate. Pursuant to the Plan, an application for life insurance was submitted to insure the life of Hausknecht. The owner of the Policy was listed on the Application as the \"REAL VEBA Trust/ FBO\" the Plan, with the Trust providing a King of Prussia address \"c/o/ Penn-Mont Benefit Services, Inc.\" The Policy explicitly\n   provided that ownership could be changed by written request. Defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   then issued the Policy with a death benefit of $6 million. Over the next twelve years, CMCS contributed $865,000 to pay premiums on the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In spring 2002, the insurer received from Penn-Mont, the Plan Administrator, a letter of resignation from the Trustee of the REAL VEBA Trust and a Verification wherein Community Trust Company (\"CTC\") was appointed Trustee of the REAL VEBA. The Verification stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The trust empowers the trustee to exercise any and all rights associated with owning life insurance policies and the trustee can exercise these rights without the consent of the insured. These rights include but are not limited to ... borrowing against the policy ... and changing the beneficiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Verification also designated Jeanne Bonney as the \"Appointed Signator\" with authority to sign documents on behalf of the new Trustee, CTC. John Koresko's name was not included anywhere on the document. On November 24, 2005, the Defendant received a letter, on Penn-Mont letterhead, from Bonney as signatory for CTC, directing that the name of the owner and the beneficiary be changed from the REAL VEBA Trust to the \"Complete Medical Care Service of NY, P.C. Welfare Plan Trust.\" Pursuant to this directive and in accordance with the Verification, Defendant did as instructed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Complaint alleges that in October 2009, John Hancock loaned \"Koresko\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   \" $405,892.44, collateralized by the cash value that had accumulated in the Policy. Plaintiff seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   restitution of this amount as well as all profits that the Plan would have earned on the funds had John Hancock not made the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In analyzing a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must first, outline the elements of the claim, second, remove legal conclusions from the complaint, and third, look for and assume as true the well-pled factual allegations in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bistrian v.

Welfare Plan Trust\" in 2005. Specifically, the Policy itself allowed the owner to assign it and change the beneficiary designation. Here, the owner of the Policy was the Trustee, which held the Policy for the benefit of the welfare benefit plans. In accordance with the Trustee-owner's authority to assign the Policy and change the beneficiary, Defendant received a written request that it do so. Specifically, that request came from Jeanne Bonney, who the Trustee-owner had identified in its \"Verification\" as an \"Appointed Signator\" on its behalf. Bonney's request came on \"Penn-Mont Benefit Services, Inc.\" letterhead, which was the entity that functioned as the Plan Administrator.

The request itself came from an \"Appointed Signator\" of the Trustee-owner.

The Third Circuit found the defendant trustee exercised \"undirected authority or control\" because the plaintiff \"did not direct the placement of the several agreements in the ... vault without cross-referencing one to the other,\" and the plaintiff did not direct the distribution of the proceeds to the third-party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344252\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/214/#p221\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344252\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/214/#p221\">\n    at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under this analytical framework, Plaintiffs have adequately pled the second basis they offer for considering Defendant a fiduciary here: that Defendant, by providing a loan to John Koresko against the cash value of the Policy, exercised control over plan assets, to wit, the cash value of the Policy. Like the change in ownership, the Policy required Defendant to issue a loan to the owner of the Policy when requested to do so. However, the loan request here, based on the allegations in the Complaint and the documents annexed to the motion to dismiss, did not come from the owner. Instead, the loan request came from Koresko, who signed the application as \"Director-Trustee.\" Although Koresko\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   provided Defendant a document entitled \"Custodial Agreement,\" which purportedly designated John Koresko's law firm as CTC's agent and gave the firm possession of the policies, the Complaint plausibly states that the Custodial Agreement was invalid, but that Defendant nevertheless treated it as valid. Based on the Complaint and the documents, nothing CTC (the actual owner) did permitted Defendant to treat Koresko as the owner of the Policy, quite unlike CTC's representations about Jeanne Bonney. And, unlike a bank which merely lets an account holder withdraw funds, Defendant's actions, which treated Koresko as an owner of the Policy, are more analogous to a bank permitting a random person to withdraw funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344252\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/214/#p221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding defendant was in control of the funds when it erroneously distributed them to the wrong customer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs' Section 1132(a)(2) claim shall be dismissed to the extent it seeks to hold Defendant liable as a fiduciary premised on the theory that Defendant exercised authority or control by changing the owner and beneficiary of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A different legal standard applies to Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion on its ERISA claim.
