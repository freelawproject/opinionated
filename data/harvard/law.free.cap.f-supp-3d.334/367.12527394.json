(Docket No. 1). The petition is verbose, disorganized, rambling, and at times incoherent. Petitioner challenges his confinement at Worcester County Sheriff's Office for a number of reasons including objections about his right to counsel, motion practice in his state criminal proceedings, his own civil litigation, and the venue of his trial. Respondent, Sheriff Lewis Evangelidis, moves to dismiss on the grounds that Petitioner fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons stated below, Respondent's motion (Docket No. 9) is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss, based solely on the complaint, for the plaintiff's \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

Here, there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding in the Worcester Superior Court. Additionally, the proceeding implicates important state interests as Petitioner has been charged with numerous felonies including Secreting/Throwing/Launching/Placing Explosives in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws c. 268, \u00a7 102A.
