The amended complaint alleges a fraudulent \"virtual currency scheme\" in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (\"CEA\" or \"the Act\") and a CFTC implementing regulation banning fraud and/or manipulation in connection with the sale of a commodity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.1\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Defendants' principal argument is that CFTC fails to state a claim because My Big Coin (\"MBC\" or \"My Big Coin\"), the allegedly fraudulent virtual currency involved in the scheme, is not a \"commodity\" within the meaning of the Act. They also argue that the CEA provision and CFTC regulation are restricted to cases involving market manipulation and do not reach the fraud alleged here. Finally, they assert that plaintiff's amended complaint fails to support its allegations of misappropriation. The motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Therefore, to state a viable claim, plaintiff must adequately plead that My Big Coin is a commodity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Commodity\" is a defined term in the CEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1a(9). It includes a host of specifically enumerated agricultural products as well as \"all other goods and articles ... and all services rights and interests ... in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The full definition reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The term \"commodity\" means wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13-1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants contend that because \"contracts for future delivery\" are indisputably not \"dealt in\" My Big Coin, it cannot be a commodity under the CEA. They take the position that in order to satisfy the CEA's \"commodity\" definition, the specific item in question must itself underlie a futures contract. Plaintiff responds that \"a 'commodity' for purposes of [the CEA definition] is broader than any particular type or brand of that commodity.\" Docket # 70 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pointing to the existence of Bitcoin futures contracts, it argues that contracts for future delivery of virtual currencies are \"dealt in\" and that My Big Coin, as a virtual currency, is\n   therefore a commodity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The text of the statute supports plaintiff's argument. The Act defines \"commodity\" generally and categorically, \"not by type, grade, quality, brand, producer, manufacturer, or form.\" Docket # 70 at 11. For example, the Act classifies \"livestock\" as a commodity without enumerating which particular species are the subject of futures trading. Thus, as plaintiff urges, Congress' approach to defining \"commodity\" signals an intent that courts focus on categories-not specific items-when determining whether the \"dealt in\" requirement is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This broad approach also accords with Congress's goal of \"strengthening the federal regulation of the ... commodity futures trading industry,\"\n   <em>\n    House Report\n   </em>\n   at 1, since an expansive definition of \"commodity\" reasonably assures that the CEA's regulatory scheme and enforcement provisions will comprehensively protect and police the markets. That goal is particularly relevant here, given that the court is construing the term \"commodity\" not in a vacuum, but rather as it functions within the CEA's anti-fraud enforcement provision of Section 6(c)(1). As the Supreme Court has instructed in an analogous context, such statutes are to be \"construed 'not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate [their] remedial purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.
