Plaintiffs' first amended complaint alleged that a settlement agreement arising from a 2007 lawsuit brought by imprisoned Chinese activists against Yahoo established a charitable trust of which plaintiffs are beneficiaries and that defendants, all of whom are allegedly trustees, improperly depleted the trust's assets and unlawfully terminated the trust's humanitarian purpose. <em>See</em> <em>Depu v.

Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the settlement agreement did not establish a charitable trust and that plaintiffs lack standing to enforce any trust. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> This Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, holding that the settlement did not establish a trust and that even if it had, plaintiffs lack standing to enforce it. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\"> at 189, 191</extracted-citation>. Now, plaintiffs move the Court to set aside the judgment and for leave to file a second amended complaint that, they assert, will cure some of the first amended complaint's defects, allowing some of plaintiffs' claims to survive a motion under Rule 12(b)(6). For the reasons explained below, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the March 30, 2018 judgment and will deny plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><em><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-10\">The full facts and procedural history of this case are laid out in this Court's earlier memorandum opinion. <em>See</em> <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at 185-87</extracted-citation>. In short, as part of a settlement agreement to end a 2007 lawsuit filed by Chinese political activists (the \" <em>Wang</em> Settlement\"), Yahoo agreed to pay $17.3 million to the Laogai Research Foundation (\"LRF\"), a non-profit corporation founded by Harry Wu, to establish the Yahoo Human Rights Fund (\"YHRF\" or \"YHR Fund\"). <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\"> at 185</extracted-citation>. In 2017, plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a lawsuit alleging that the YHRF is a charitable trust established for plaintiffs' benefit and contending that defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> -all of whom are allegedly trustees-unlawfully breached and modified the purported trust under D.C. law. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">id.</extracted-citation></em> at 186-87 ; FAC \u00b6\u00b6 125-130, 135-41.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-11\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"318\" href=\"#p318\" id=\"p318\">*318</a>The Court granted defendants' subsequent motions to dismiss the trust-based claims under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1).

Second, the Court held that even if the <em>Wang</em> Settlement had somehow established a charitable trust, plaintiffs failed to allege plausibly that they had standing to enforce the trust, both under the principles of trust law and, as to six of seven plaintiffs, under Article III. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">id.</extracted-citation></em> at 189-91 &amp; n.9. Because the Court's order dismissing the FAC did not specify whether the complaint was dismissed with or without prejudice, the claims were dismissed <em>with</em> prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). <em>See</em> <em>Rollins v.

Plaintiffs now move to set aside the judgment and for leave to amend their trust claims in a proposed second amended complaint that they claim will survive. <em>See</em> Rule 59(e) Mot. to Alter J. from Dismissal With Prejudice to Dismissal Without Prejudice, Rule 15(a) Mot. for Leave to Amend, and Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Support Thereof (\"Pls.'

Here, plaintiffs' proposed SAC is futile because it fails to cure the trust claims' central deficiencies: that no charitable trust was established and that plaintiffs in any case have no standing to enforce any charitable trust.</p><p id=\"p-27\">To start, plaintiffs contend that \"new factual allegations\" and \"objective indicators\" provide an \"independent basis\" for finding that plaintiffs adequately alleged the creation of a charitable trust. Pls. Mot. to Amend at 5-8. Specifically, plaintiffs point to the transfer of funds to the LRF, that its purpose was to provide humanitarian assistance to imprisoned Chinese dissidents, that the funds were segregated for that purpose, and that Yahoo and others levied objections about the use of the funds. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554144,4079803\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/213/\">id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-28\">As an initial matter, beyond slight wording differences, the factual allegation that the <em>Wang</em> Settlement required transferring money to the LRF is not \"new.\" <em>See</em> <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"322\" href=\"#p322\" id=\"p322\">*322</a>FAC \u00b6\u00b6 36 &amp; n.3, 40 (alleging that \"[p]ayments establishing the Trust were made ... to the LRF\" and the \"purpose [of the trust was to] provid[e] humanitarian and legal aid to Chinese dissidents\"); Pls.'

And, except for substituting the words \"YHR Fund\" for \"Trust assets,\" none of plaintiffs' \"additional\" objective indicators of an intention to create a trust are new either. <em>Compare</em> SAC \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 107 (alleging as \"new\" facts evincing intent to establish a trust that \"[<strong>YHR Fund payments]</strong> [were] 'maintained separately from other [LRF] funds,' \" that a \"portion of the <strong>YHR Fund</strong> was transferred to the LHRO,\" that Yahoo's then-General Counsel Ronald Bell and others \"objected to LRF's use of <strong>YHR Fund</strong> assets,\" and that Yahoo's stated motive for payments to the <strong>YHR Fund</strong> was to \"mak[e] sure [Yahoo's] actions match [its] values,\" not to settle claims) (emphasis added), <em>with</em> FAC \u00b6\u00b6 36 n.3, 40-41, 52-54, 94-100 &amp; n.11 (alleging that \"<strong>Trust assets</strong> be maintained separately from LRF's funds,\" Yahoo \"orchestrated the transfer of some ... [<strong>Trust] assets</strong> \" into \"a newly created non-profit corporation, the [LHRO],\" General Counsel Bell and others \"repeatedly and directly warned\" that \"<strong>Trust assets</strong> were being unlawfully depleted by ... LRF,\" and that Yahoo's stated motive for spending \"<strong>Trust assets</strong> \" was to \"mak[e] sure [Yahoo's] actions match [its] values,\" not to settle claims) (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-29\">Even if the Court viewed the identical facts through the new lens of \"conduct\" as plaintiffs propose, however, it would not be sufficient, without more, to establish a trust. Critically, despite plaintiffs' considerable emphasis on Yahoo's conveyance of funds to the LRF for a <em>specific</em> humanitarian purpose, they fail adequately to allege any intention to create a <em>trust</em> as opposed to an intention to settle claims and confer a benefit on society.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But \"sometimes a person seeks to confer benefits on society by means other than through the use of a trust.\" <em>See</em> George G. Bogert et al., The Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 324 (3d ed. 2017).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, plaintiffs' proposed <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"323\" href=\"#p323\" id=\"p323\">*323</a>SAC remains futile for failure adequately to allege an intention to establish a charitable trust.</p><p id=\"p-30\">Even were the Court to assume that the proposed SAC sufficiently alleges a charitable trust, that would still not cure the FAC's independent deficiency-that plaintiffs lack standing to enforce any trust. As the Court has explained, given the \"impossibility of establishing a distinct justiciable interest on the part of a member of a large and constantly shifting benefited class,\" the general rule is that \"only a public officer ... has standing\" to enforce a charitable trust. <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F. Supp. 3d at </extracted-citation>189 (citing <em>Family Fed'n</em>, 129 A.3d at 244 ). And while courts have recognized two exceptions to that rule-finding standing when plaintiffs establish either a \"special interest\" in the putative trust or that they are \"members of a 'small and distinct' beneficiary class\"-the Court found that the FAC failed plausibly to allege that either exception applies here. <em>Id.</em> at 189-91 (emphasis added and citation omitted). Regarding the latter exception, the Court noted that the FAC's proposed class of beneficiaries, as defined by the <em>Wang</em> Settlement, \"(1) includes individuals persecuted for expressing their views 'online' through 'Yahoo <em>or another medium</em>'; (2) is 'primarily,' but not exclusively, limited to individuals in China; and (3) is not temporally limited at all.\" <em>Id.</em> at 190 (citations omitted). Such a beneficiary class is \"far more limitless and uncertain\" than any class courts have found sufficiently discrete, the Court held, and so not sufficiently small or sharply defined to establish charitable trust standing. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em></p><p id=\"p-31\">Plaintiffs argue that the proposed SAC cures that deficiency by \"includ[ing] plausible, non-conclusory allegations that the beneficiary class consists of between 800 and 1,200 individuals, which is indisputably small enough for charitable beneficiary standing.\" Pls.' Mot. to Amend at 14. Specifically, the proposed SAC alleges that the putative trust is intended only \"to benefit: (1) <em>Chinese</em> persons (2) who are imprisoned <em>in China</em> (3) for exercising their freedom of expression (4) online,\" and that plaintiffs' query of a database maintained by the U.S. Congressional-Executive Committee on China (\"CECC\") for Chinese prisoners yields a \"conservative estimate\" of 800 to 1,200 individuals meeting those criteria. <em>See</em> SAC \u00b6\u00b6 136-44 (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-32\">But the relevant expression of an intent to benefit a particular, defined, group remains the language in the <em>Wang</em> Settlement creating the YHRF, <em>see</em> SAC \u00b6 41, and plaintiffs cite nothing in that document to support their conclusory allegation that putative charitable beneficiaries are limited to the (slightly) narrower parameters they propose. Instead, as defendants point out, \"[p]laintiffs simply ignore the Court's finding that the proposed class, <em>as defined by the Wang Settlement language upon which [p]laintiffs rely</em>,\" is neither exclusively limited to Chinese individuals nor temporally limited. Laogai Opp'n at 5-6 (emphasis added); <em>see</em> Yahoo Opp'n at 9. Indeed, just as with the FAC, the proposed SAC does <em>not</em> allege that the intended beneficiaries are limited to Chinese dissidents imprisoned in China, as plaintiffs themselves acknowledge. <em>See</em> Pls.'

By contrast, the Court's finding that plaintiffs lack standing under charitable trust principles was, as plaintiffs acknowledge, on the <em>merits</em>, resting on the Court's finding that plaintiffs do not qualify for an exception to the general rule that only \"a public officer\" may enforce a charitable trust because they are merely possible members of an indistinct beneficiary class. <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at 189</extracted-citation> (citation omitted); <em>see also</em> Reply Mem. in Supp. of Pls.'

Nevertheless, because the Court can conceive of additional, \"consistent,\" allegations that could plausibly cure that deficiency-for instance, allegations that one or more plaintiffs have some hitherto undisclosed \"exceptionally close connection\" to the purported trust, <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at </extracted-citation>190 -the Court concludes that its finding that plaintiffs lack standing to enforce any charitable trust does not independently warrant dismissal with prejudice of the trust claims.</p><p id=\"p-46\">The Court would also find plaintiffs' new theory-which repackages identical facts to support a largely similar legal argument-meritless, but that is not the question the Court must answer in this context; instead, at least for purposes of plaintiffs' Rule 59(e) motion, the Court must determine whether any additional, consistent, factual allegations, even if not in the proposed SAC, could have cured the defect. <em>See</em> <em>Firestone</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637568,3691597\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/1205/\">76 F.3d at </extracted-citation>1209 ; <em>Belizan</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3452355,931877\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/579/\">434 F.3d at 584</extracted-citation>. Nevertheless, courts frequently have affirmed dismissals with prejudice under the <em>Firestone</em> standard on the ground that a proposed complaint <em>in fact</em> failed to allege curative and consistent facts. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Rollins v. Wackenhut Servs., Inc.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661293,5869349\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/122/\">703 F.3d 122</extracted-citation>, 131 (D.C.

Cir. 2007) (affirming dismissal of claim \"with prejudice\" when plaintiffs' amended complaint \"merely offered to reallege the allegations of the [FAC], the insufficiency of which is the law of the case\"). This Court similarly relies in part on specific failures of plaintiffs' proposed SAC to deny the Rule 59(e) motion, but defers a detailed analysis of those failures to the section denying, in the alternative, plaintiffs' Rule 15(a)(2) motion as futile. <em>See</em> <em>infra</em> Part II.</p><p id=\"p-47\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Court's observation in its prior opinion that \"Yahoo has never publicly or privately referred to the YHRF as a trust,\" <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at 188-89</extracted-citation>, suggests that the Court's dismissal of the trust claims \"rested ... on\" writings and conduct outside the <em>Wang</em> Settlement. Pls.' Reply at 4. But that is not so. The Court was careful to state that \"all of the claims that sound in trust will be dismissed\" because \"[u]ltimately, plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that <em>the</em> Wang <em>[S]ettlement created a charitable trust</em>.\" <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at 189</extracted-citation> (emphasis added). Moreover, the amended allegations must be consistent with plaintiffs' pleading, not with issues noted by the Court.</p><p id=\"p-48\">Plaintiffs cite authority for the proposition that a gift donated subject to a specific restriction \"creates a charitable trust\" entitling the donor \"to enforce th[at] restriction\" against the donee. <em>Family Fed'n for World Peace v. Hyun Jin Moon</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766288\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/234/\">129 A.3d 234</extracted-citation>, 247 n.20 (D.C. 2015) (first citing Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 28, cmt. a, and then citing <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766288\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/234/\">id.</extracted-citation> \u00a7 94, cmt. g(3) ). But that case does not change the Court's analysis. Unlike a donor offering a restricted gift, Yahoo contracted to pay LRF <em>in exchange</em> for settling its claims in the <em>Wang</em> litigation. Plaintiffs cite no authority (and the Court is aware of none) suggesting that contracted-for payments are analogous to a \"restricted gift\" for purposes of establishing a trust, especially considering the Court's finding that Yahoo \"plainly\" lacked any intention of doing so. <em>See</em> <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at 189</extracted-citation>. Moreover, even if the payments to the LRF and the creation of the YHRF were treated as restricted gifts creating a charitable trust, as plaintiffs suggest, only <em>Yahoo</em> would have a right to enforce that restriction as the donor, not plaintiffs as possible donees. <em>See</em> <em>Family Fed'n</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766288\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/234/\">129 A.3d at </extracted-citation>247 n.20 (noting that a \"restricted gift ... entitles the <em>settlor</em> to maintain a suit against the trustee-organization\" (emphasis added and citation omitted) ); <em>Depu</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">306 F.Supp.3d at 189-91</extracted-citation> (holding plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege any \"special interest\" sufficient to enforce any charitable trust).</p><p id=\"p-49\">Plaintiffs also attempt to relitigate the language used in the <em>Wang</em> Settlement, insisting that it <em>can</em> be construed to reflect an intention to establish a charitable trust. <em>See</em> Pls.'

But in doing so, plaintiffs offer no proposed amendment to the FAC and-reflecting the reality that no such amendment can cure the FAC's deficiency-instead use Rule 15(a)(2) effectively as a chance to appeal the Court's ruling, doubling-down on the same already-rejected arguments.</p><p id=\"p-50\"><em>See</em> <em>PPD Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</em>, Congressional-Executive Commission on China, https://www.cecc.gov/ppd-frequently-asked-questions-faqs (last visited Sep. 12, 2018) (\"Reliable up-to-date information about Chinese political prisoners is not easy to acquire.
