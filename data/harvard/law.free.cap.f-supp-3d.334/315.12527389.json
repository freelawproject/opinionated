Critically, despite plaintiffs' considerable emphasis on Yahoo's conveyance of funds to the LRF for a\n      <em>\n       specific\n      </em>\n      humanitarian purpose, they fail adequately to allege any intention to create a\n      <em>\n       trust\n      </em>\n      as opposed to an intention to settle claims and confer a benefit on society.\n      <footnotemark>\n       9\n      </footnotemark>\n      But \"sometimes a person seeks to confer benefits on society by means other than through the use of a trust.\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      George G.

As the Court has explained, given the \"impossibility of establishing a distinct justiciable interest on the part of a member of a large and constantly shifting benefited class,\" the general rule is that \"only a public officer ... has standing\" to enforce a charitable trust.\n      <em>\n       Depu\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524835\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/181/#p185\">\n       306 F.

And while courts have recognized two exceptions to that rule-finding standing when plaintiffs establish either a \"special interest\" in the putative trust or that they are \"members of a 'small and distinct' beneficiary class\"-the Court found that the FAC failed plausibly to allege that either exception applies here.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 189-91 (emphasis added and citation omitted). Regarding the latter exception, the Court noted that the FAC's proposed class of beneficiaries, as defined by the\n      <em>\n       Wang\n      </em>\n      Settlement, \"(1) includes individuals persecuted for expressing their views 'online' through 'Yahoo\n      <em>\n       or another medium\n      </em>\n      '; (2) is 'primarily,' but not exclusively, limited to individuals in China; and (3) is not temporally limited at all.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 190 (citations omitted). Such a beneficiary class is \"far more limitless and uncertain\" than any class courts have found sufficiently discrete, the Court held, and so not sufficiently small or sharply defined to establish charitable trust standing.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-31\">\n      Plaintiffs argue that the proposed SAC cures that deficiency by \"includ[ing] plausible, non-conclusory allegations that the beneficiary class consists of between 800 and 1,200 individuals, which is indisputably small enough for charitable beneficiary standing.\" Pls.' Mot. to Amend at 14. Specifically, the proposed SAC alleges that the putative trust is intended only \"to benefit: (1)\n      <em>\n       Chinese\n      </em>\n      persons (2) who are imprisoned\n      <em>\n       in China\n      </em>\n      (3) for exercising their freedom of expression (4) online,\" and that plaintiffs' query of a database maintained by the U.S. Congressional-Executive Committee on China (\"CECC\") for Chinese prisoners yields a \"conservative estimate\" of 800 to 1,200 individuals meeting those criteria.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      SAC \u00b6\u00b6 136-44 (emphasis added).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      But the relevant expression of an intent to benefit a particular, defined, group remains the language in the\n      <em>\n       Wang\n      </em>\n      Settlement creating the YHRF,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      SAC \u00b6 41, and plaintiffs cite nothing in that document to support their conclusory allegation that putative charitable beneficiaries are limited to the (slightly) narrower parameters they propose. Instead, as defendants point out, \"[p]laintiffs simply ignore the Court's finding that the proposed class,\n      <em>\n       as defined by the Wang Settlement language upon which [p]laintiffs rely\n      </em>\n      ,\" is neither exclusively limited to Chinese individuals nor temporally limited.
