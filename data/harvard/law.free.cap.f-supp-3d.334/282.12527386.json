BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Two parties to a construction bond each claim that the other breached the bond first and thus should be liable for costs and damages. Plaintiff Walsh Construction Company II, LLC (\"Walsh\") is a general contractor that was hired in 2015 to construct a hotel in the District of Columbia. Defendants United States Surety Company and U.S. Specialty Insurance Company (together, \"the Surety\") jointly issued a performance bond to one of Walsh's subcontractors, Mid-Atlantic Air, Inc. (\"MAA\"), which guaranteed completion of the subcontract work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The underlying controversy arose when Walsh declared MAA to be in default on the subcontract. Initially, the Surety financed the performance of MAA's subcontract work, but after investigating Walsh's declaration of default the Surety denied liability and stopped performing under the bond. Walsh then sued the Surety, and the Surety counterclaimed, alleging that Walsh had breached both the bond and the underlying subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Countercl. (\"Countercl.\") [ECF No. 12]. Walsh now moves to dismiss the counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh Constr. Co. II, LLC's Mem. in Supp. of Its Mot. to Dismiss Countercl. (\"Walsh's Mot.\") [ECF No. 14]. For the following reasons, Walsh's motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, a company called Adams Morgan Hotel Owner, LLC (the \"Owner\") hired Walsh to construct the Adams Morgan Historic Hotel in northwestern Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, MAA subcontracted with Walsh to perform heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and plumbing work on the hotel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [ECF No. 2] \u00b6 7. In addition to that work, the subcontract required MAA to perform \"any and all changes [to its] Work\" that Walsh might later order, for which MAA would be paid \"an amount equal to the direct cost of labor and materials actually and reasonably used ..., plus mark up for overhead and profit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 to Walsh's Mot. (\"Subcontract Agreement\") [ECF No. 14-3] \u00b6\u00b6 4.1-4.2. As a condition of the subcontract, MAA and the Surety executed a performance bond, which guaranteed MAA's performance of the subcontract and named Walsh as an obligee. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. MAA and the Surety also entered into a payment bond, which required the Surety to compensate MAA's subcontractors and suppliers in the event of MAA's default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MAA performed its obligations under the subcontract until April 6, 2017, when MAA notified Walsh in writing that it would not complete any further change-order or overtime work because of several unpaid change-order invoices totaling more than $2 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. B. to Countercl. [ECF No. 12].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two weeks later, on April 20, 2017, Walsh declared MAA to be in default of the subcontract and terminated the agreement, alleging that MAA had breached by failing to complete its work on time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4. to Compl. at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After declaring MAA to be in default, Walsh issued a demand to the Surety under the performance bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The Surety began investigating Walsh's claim of default, and the Surety later exercised its option to extend its deadline to respond to Walsh's claim by financing performance of the subcontract during the extension period. Countercl. \u00b6 44. The Surety financed performance from May 5, 2017 through July 28, 2017 (\"the financing period\") and retained a replacement subcontractor for MAA during that time. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 54. During this period, the Surety alleges that it spent more than $6.2 million on the project: over $4 million to finance the subcontract work itself, and an additional $2.2 million to compensate MAA's subcontractors and suppliers for work and materials tendered before Walsh's declaration of default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 93. On July 28, the Surety completed its investigation, denied liability under the bond, and ceased financing the subcontract work. Countercl. \u00b6 92;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. O to Countercl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the Surety's denial of liability, Walsh filed a complaint against the Surety seeking damages for its alleged breach of the performance bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Surety answered Walsh's complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. at 1-11, and filed a ten-count counterclaim,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-38. The Surety's counterclaim alleges that if MAA's work was delayed at all, such delays were attributable to design defects and Walsh's poor administration of the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-32; U.S. Surety Co.'s &amp; U.S. Specialty Ins. Co.'s Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (\"Surety's Opp'n\") [ECF No. 16] at 4. The Surety further alleges that Walsh failed to pay MAA on time, so any delays-as well as MAA's ultimate refusal to continue performing change orders and overtime work-were justified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 35. Additionally, the Surety claims that Walsh intentionally obstructed the Surety's investigation of Walsh's claim by failing timely and accurately to respond to requests for information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Surety's Opp'n at 6-7 (citing Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 55-61, 77), and by failing timely to provide its estimate of the subcontract balance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (citing Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 85-86, 88-89, 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Surety's counterclaim initially asserted ten counts, although the Surety later withdrew two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counts One and Four allege that the Surety is entitled to recover more than $4 million that the Surety allegedly spent on the project during the financing period pursuant to Paragraph 8 of the performance bond, which requires Walsh to reimburse the Surety for its \"losses, expenses[,] and reasonable attorney's fees\" in the event of an unjustified declaration of default.

Count One alleges that Walsh's declaration of default was unjustified because Walsh had already materially breached the subcontract by failing to pay MAA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97, and Count Four claims that even if MAA had delayed the project, Walsh was estopped from relying on those delays for its declaration of default because it had not objected to them before the preceding week,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119, 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Counts Six and Seven also allege that Walsh materially breached the subcontract. The Surety seeks to recover approximately $2.6 million that Walsh allegedly owes MAA under the subcontract, as well as the $2.2 million that the Surety claims it paid to MAA's subcontractors and suppliers following Walsh's declaration of default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-39, 140-152.

(\"Bond\") [ECF No. 2-2] \u00b6 8. That paragraph states: \"If it is determined that [Walsh's] declaration of [MAA's] default was not justified under the Subcontract, [Walsh] shall pay Surety an amount equal to Surety's losses, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees in performing under this Bond.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Paragraph 8.1 of the Subcontract Agreement sets forth the specific grounds on which Walsh could declare MAA to be in default, which include MAA's failure \"to supply enough properly skilled workers, proper materials, or maintain the Schedule of Work,\" to \"make prompt payment for ... its workers, subcontractors[,] or suppliers,\" or to heed \"Laws or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To state a claim for breach of contract\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   under District of Columbia law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a\n   pleading must allege that: \"(1) a valid contract existed between the parties; (2) the contract created an obligation or duty; (3) the other party breached that duty; and (4) the moving party was damaged as a result of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Supp. 3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 (D.D.C. 2017). Here, the parties do not dispute that the performance bond was a valid contract or that the sums spent by the Surety during the financing period were \"losses\" or \"expenses\" that the Surety was required to incur under the bond and that Walsh would therefore have to reimburse in the event of an unjustified declaration of default. At this stage of the proceedings, moreover, the Court assumes the truth of the Surety's allegations that its expenses during the financing period totaled more than $4 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 93. Hence, the Surety has adequately pleaded the first, second, and fourth elements of its breach-of-contract claims, and all that remains for the Surety to plead is that Walsh breached a duty to reimburse the Surety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Walsh first raises a threshold argument on the issue of breach that applies to both Count One and Count Four.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh's Mot. at 11. Walsh argues that any recovery under Paragraph 8 is barred by Paragraph 4(e) of the bond, which provides that if the Surety elects to extend its response deadline by financing the subcontract work for a period of time (as the Surety did here), Walsh \"shall have no obligation to reimburse Surety or otherwise pay for the work performed until Surety has committed to remedy the default ... and then only from funds earned under the Subcontract.\" Here, Walsh argues, the Surety never \"committed to remedy [MAA's] default\" because it ultimately denied Walsh's claim. Walsh's Mot. at 11. Thus, under Paragraph 4(e), Walsh need not \"reimburse Surety or otherwise pay for the work [it] performed\" during the financing period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264758\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/99/#p116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Bond \u00b6 4(e) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But this reasoning is flawed. Read in context, this sentence of Paragraph 4(e) simply specifies that Walsh need not reimburse the Surety for its expenditures until after the Surety's investigation is concluded; it does not bar the Surety from recovering those sums entirely if the Surety ultimately denies Walsh's claim. Indeed, Walsh's reading would render Paragraph 8 a nullity: Paragraph 8 applies only where Walsh's declaration of default is \"not justified,\" and Walsh does not explain why the Surety would ever \"commit[ ] to remedy\" a nonexistent default. Bond \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt Const. Group, Inc. v. Natl.

Cir. 2009) (\"In reading contract provisions we take the contract's entirety into account, seeking to give all its provisions effect.\"). The Court therefore concludes that the performance bond obligated Walsh to reimburse the Surety in any case where Walsh's declaration of default was unjustified, regardless of whether the Surety committed to remedy the alleged default. And because Walsh does not dispute that it never reimbursed the Surety for the expenses at issue here, whether Walsh breached that obligation depends only on whether its declaration of default was \"justified under the Subcontract.\" Bond \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count One: The Surety's Claim That Walsh Breached the Subcontract First by Failing to Pay MAA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Count One asserts that Walsh's declaration of MAA's default was unjustified\n   because Walsh's previous failure to pay MAA approximately $2.6 million for subcontract and change-order work had released MAA from its obligations under the subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 94-102; Surety's Opp'n at 14. In its motion to dismiss, Walsh does not challenge the sufficiency of the Surety's allegations that it failed to pay MAA; rather, it relies on the subcontract's \"pay-when-paid\" clause to argue that its duty to pay MAA never matured because it never received payment for MAA's invoices from the Owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh's Mot. at 12; Subcontract Agreement \u00b6 3.6 (stating, in relevant part, that \"if, and only if, Owner pays [Walsh], which is an express condition precedent to [Walsh's] duty to pay [MAA], Progress Payments shall be due to [MAA] no later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of payment from Owner\"). The Surety responds by alleging that Walsh wrongfully delayed in seeking payment from the Owner,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 35, and that these delays negated the Owner's payments as a condition precedent to Walsh's duty to pay MAA under the so-called \"prevention doctrine.\" Surety's Opp'n at 14-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The prevention doctrine provides that \"if a promisor is himself the cause of the failure of ... a condition upon which his own liability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.\"\n   <em>\n    Aronoff v.

Count One therefore survives Walsh's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count Four: The Surety's Alternative Claim that Walsh Breached the Subcontract Even if MAA's Delays Were Unjustified\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Count Four alleges that even if MAA were responsible for delaying the project, its delays still could not justify Walsh's declaration of default because Walsh did not object to them until a week before it issued its declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surety's Opp'n at 19-20; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 115-123. Walsh responds that this claim is barred by two contractual provisions: an anti-waiver clause in the subcontract and a provision of the performance bond whereby the Surety waived its right to object to any changes in the schedule of the subcontract work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh's Mot. at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Paragraph 2 of the performance bond states, in relevant part: \"The Surety agrees that no ... extension of time ... or other modification of the terms of ... the ... Subcontract [between Walsh and MAA] ..., or in the ... work to be performed [thereunder], ... or in the plans shall in any[ ] [way] affect its obligations [under] this Bond.\" Bond \u00b6 2. According to Walsh, this provision shows that the Surety \"waived any right to object to scheduling changes.\" Walsh's Mot. at 16. But as the Surety explains, Count Four does not allege \"that Walsh extended MAA's time to perform or otherwise changed any of the terms of MAA's Subcontract\"; indeed, according to the Surety, \"it does not appear that Walsh ever formally extended MAA's time of performance or otherwise modified its Subcontract as it relates to the time of completion.\" Surety's Opp'n at 20. Hence, because the Surety's counterclaim does not allege any modification of the subcontract-either as to the timing of the subcontract work or otherwise-Paragraph 2 of the performance bond is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, Walsh relies on Paragraph 13.2 of the subcontract, which states: \"The failure of either party hereto to insist, in any one or more instances, upon the performance of any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement, or exercise any right herein, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such term, covenant, condition, or right as respects further performance.\" Walsh's Mot. at 17 (citation omitted). According to Walsh, this provision means that Walsh could not have waived its right to insist on timely performance on April 20 even if, as the Surety alleges, it had not asserted that right prior to April 13. For its part, the Surety does not meaningfully dispute that Paragraph 13.2 \"permits Walsh to enforce a previously waived obligation as it relates to\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   performance.\" Surety's Opp'n at 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Expresstrak, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 02-1773,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202947555\">\n    2006 WL 2947555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D.D.C. Oct. 16, 2006) (\"Several jurisdictions have ... enforced anti-waiver provisions ....\"). But, the Surety argues, Paragraph 13.2 does not say that Walsh may \"waive MAA's\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   non-compliance with schedule deadlines[ ]\n   <em>\n    and then use that non-compliance as a basis for declaring a default\n   </em>\n   .\" Surety's Opp'n at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Surety's reading of Paragraph 13.2 is correct. Although Paragraph 13.2 plainly authorized Walsh to insist on future performances that it had not previously demanded, nothing in that provision speaks to whether or when Walsh may rely on past instances of nonperformance to terminate the subcontract. But it does not necessarily follow from this conclusion that Walsh's declaration of default was improper. Rather, a different provision of the subcontract governs when Walsh may declare MAA to be in default. Paragraph 8.1 states: \"If [Walsh] determines at its sole discretion that [MAA] has .... refused or failed to ... maintain the Schedule of Work ... [MAA] shall be in default of this [subcontract].\" Subcontract Agreement \u00b6 8.1. Then, if MAA \"fails within seventy-two (72) hours after receipt of written notice [of its default] ... to commence and continue satisfactory correction of such default ..., [MAA] shall have materially breached the [subcontract],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202947555\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202947555\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Walsh \"may ... terminate [the subcontract] or a[ny] portion thereof,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   So long as the Court assumes-as it must as to Count Four-that MAA delayed the project,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 116, the Surety has failed to plead that Walsh's declaration of default and subsequent termination of the subcontract were improper. Paragraph 8.1 expressly identifies MAA's failure to \"maintain the Schedule of Work\" as a ground for declaring MAA to be in default, Subcontract Agreement \u00b6 8.1, and Count Four does not allege that MAA made any attempt to cure its defective performance during the seventy-two-hour grace period following Walsh's declaration. Thus, pursuant to Paragraph 8.2 of the subcontract, Walsh's termination of the contract was proper. And although the Surety claims that Walsh was estopped from relying on MAA's delays because Walsh issued its declaration of default a mere seven days after it first raised those delays with MAA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 119-121, it cites no legal authority for this theory of estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence, the Court concludes\n   that the Surety has failed in Count Four plausibly to allege that Walsh's declaration of default was unjustified even if MAA had wrongfully delayed the project. Thus, Count Four has not adequately pleaded that Walsh breached a duty owed to the Surety under Paragraph 8, and Walsh's motion to dismiss Count Four will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Claims Alleging a Breach of the Subcontract on MAA's Behalf\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In Counts Six and Seven, the Surety seeks to recover the $2.6 million that Walsh allegedly owes MAA under the subcontract, as well as the $2.2 million that the Surety allegedly paid to MAA's subcontractors and suppliers under the payment bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These two counts both repeat the Surety's allegations that Walsh breached the subcontract by failing to pay MAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 131-34, 141-44. Because the Court has already concluded in its discussion of Count One that the Surety has plausibly alleged this breach, the only question remaining is whether Counts Six and Seven permit the Surety to recover on MAA's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained below, they do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count Six: Assignment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Count Six argues that MAA assigned to the Surety \"all claims, demands, and causes of action relating to the subcontract [and the payment bond]\" in an indemnity agreement. Countercl. \u00b6 137;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139 (\"The Surety, as assignee of MAA, is entitled to recover ... reimbursement for all amounts paid by the Surety in connection with the Subcontract[ ] ...

According to Walsh, this assignment violated Section 7.1 of the subcontract, which states that MAA \"shall not assign this Agreement or its proceeds or subcontract the whole or any part of [MAA's] Work without [Walsh's] prior approval.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh's Mot. at 20 (quoting Subcontract Agreement \u00b6 7.1). The Surety responds that Paragraph 7.1 only \"reserves to [Walsh] the right ... to decline the services of a party ... who may not appear qualified to satisfactorily perform the Subcontract Work\" and does not \"preclude an assignment of\n   <em>\n    a cause of action for\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    breach of the Subcontract\n   </em>\n   .\" Surety's Opp'n at 23.

As in\n   <em>\n    Handex\n   </em>\n   , it appears that the parties here intended the anti-assignment clause to prohibit MAA from assigning\n   <em>\n    funds\n   </em>\n   or subcontract\n   <em>\n    work\n   </em>\n   to another subcontractor or material supplier without Walsh's approval, not to prohibit an assignment of MAA's cause of action for breach of the subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontract Agreement \u00b6 7.1 (providing that MAA \"shall not assign this Agreement or its\n   <em>\n    proceeds\n   </em>\n   [ ]or subcontract the whole or any part of [MAA']s\n   <em>\n    Work\n   </em>\n   without [Walsh's] prior approval\" (emphasis added) ). And like the owner in\n   <em>\n    Handex\n   </em>\n   , Walsh is a sophisticated party in the industry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1, and therefore should have been \"keenly aware\" of the likelihood that MAA would assign its rights against Walsh to the Surety in a separate indemnity agreement. Hence, this Court concludes that the subcontract's anti-assignment clause does not invalidate MAA's assignment of its rights against Walsh to the Surety. Walsh's motion to dismiss Count Six will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

First, the Surety asserts that it is equitably subrogated to MAA's rights \"relating to Walsh's breaches of the Subcontract.\" Countercl. at 35. Walsh's motion does not address this contention,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Walsh's Mot. at 21-22, and at least one other court has held that where, as here, a contractor is a \"frequent player in the construction industry\" and hence should be \"cognizant of the fact that the surety relationship includes a conditional assignment of the [sub]contractor's rights to the surety,\" it would \"fl[y] in the face of equity\" to allow the contractor to pursue its claims against the surety while blocking the surety from asserting the subcontractor's claims against the contractor.\n   <em>\n    Handex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8444756\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/458/266/\">\n    458 F.Supp.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, although the Surety has not \"paid the debt of another\" in a literal sense-since the $2.6 million that Walsh allegedly owes MAA has not changed hands-the Surety is nonetheless subrogated to MAA's rights against Walsh for Walsh's alleged breaches of the subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8444756\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/458/266/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Subrogation is an equitable remedy.

Walsh responds that it \"had no duty to pay MAA's subcontractors,\" so the Surety did not pay \"the debt of [Walsh]\" when it made payments under that bond. Walsh's Mot. at 21. While it is true that the subcontract contemplated that MAA would be responsible for paying its own subcontractors and suppliers, the subcontract also contemplated that the\n   funds used to make those payments would be drawn from Walsh's payments to MAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontract Agreement \u00b6 3.9 (\"All payments received by [MAA] shall first be used to satisfy any indebtedness owed by [MAA] to persons or other entities furnishing labor or materials for use in performing or incorporation into [MAA's] Work.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.11 (authorizing Walsh to send MAA's payments to its subcontractors and suppliers directly if Walsh had reason to believe that MAA was not keeping up with its payments to those third parties). And the Surety alleges that when Walsh stopped making payments to MAA, it began paying MAA's subcontractors and suppliers on MAA's behalf.

Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 107-08. Walsh responds that it had no duty to cooperate in the investigation because the Surety was obligated to make \"an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the alleged default.\" Walsh's Mot. at 14-15. \"Additionally,\" Walsh argues, \"even if Walsh breached some unwritten duty to cooperate in the investigation, the Surety fails to assert how it has been damaged by that breach.\" Walsh's Reply to Surety's Opp'n (\"Walsh's Reply\") [ECF No. 17] at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Count Two will be dismissed because, as Walsh correctly points out, that count no longer seeks any relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (\"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a demand for the relief sought ....\"). Aside from attorney's fees and costs, Count Two initially sought only declaratory relief: specifically, a declaration that Walsh breached the performance bond. Countercl. at 28-29. In its opposition brief, however, the Surety \"consent[ed] to withdraw from Counts 1 through 5 any reference to the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\" explaining \"that the remaining portions of the Surety's Counterclaim not specifically seeking a declaratory order will be sufficient to resolve the parties' dispute.\" Surety's Opp'n at 10-11.

Countercl. \u00b6 161; Surety's Opp'n at 29. In a June 21, 2017 letter to Walsh, the Surety sought reasonable assurances that, if it were to accept liability under the bond and either complete the subcontract work itself or hire a replacement subcontractor, Walsh would \"pay the balance of the Subcontract Price to the Surety or its completion contractor,\" as the performance bond required. Countercl. \u00b6 85. The Surety had a reasonable apprehension that Walsh would refuse to do so, the letter explained, because Walsh had not yet provided its \"calculation of the balance of the Subcontract Price\" to the Surety and otherwise had failed to respond to the Surety's requests for information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Walsh points out that the Surety never exercised the option to complete the subcontract work, and that in any case Walsh did eventually report the balance of the subcontract price (which, in Walsh's view, was negative) on July 26, 2017.

While it is true that Walsh told the Surety that it \"[did] not anticipate releasing any funds to the [Surety],\" Ex. N to Countercl. at 2, that statement does not amount to an \"unequivocal and positive\" repudiation of the performance bond. Rather, it simply reflected Walsh's view that, as a result of MAA's alleged delays, MAA actually owed Walsh money under the subcontract, and not the other way around. Although the Surety may disagree with Walsh's calculation of the subcontract balance-or even allege, as it does elsewhere in its counterclaim, that the calculation was made in bad faith,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 164-the Surety's allegations do not plausibly suggest that Walsh unequivocally communicated an intention to repudiate the performance bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EastBanc, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8307374\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/940/996/#p1005\">\n    940 A.2d at 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Walsh responds that the Surety never triggered Walsh's obligation to pay the balance of the subcontract price by electing to complete the subcontract work under Paragraph 4 (as already discussed as to Counts One and Four), that Walsh had no duty to assist the Surety with its independent investigation (as already discussed as to Count Two), and that the Surety's claim of overstated damages and setoffs is meritless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh's Mot. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Window Specialists, Inc. v.

As to part (a), the Surety does not allege that Walsh withheld the balance of the subcontract price for any improper purpose. On the contrary, the documents attached to the Surety's own counterclaim suggest that Walsh withheld those funds based on a good-faith belief that Walsh was owed money on the subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. N to Countercl. (letter from Walsh to the Surety stating that Walsh was withholding payment based on \"damages and set-offs\" that rendered the contract balance negative). And although the Surety's contention that Walsh inflated its \"damages and setoffs\" could in theory support a good-faith-and-fair-dealing claim, the only fact alleged in support of this contention is that Walsh failed to provide the Surety with any supporting documentation concerning its alleged damages. Countercl. \u00b6 89. Even accepting this allegation as true, Walsh's mere failure to provide supporting documentation does not plausibly suggest that its estimation of the subcontract balance was intentionally inflated.

Although the Surety's counterclaim is littered with allegations that Walsh failed to respond to the Surety's requests for information during the financing period,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 53, the Surety does not explain how those delays led it to suffer \"damages ... in an amount estimated to exceed $4 million,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Moreover, even if Count Ten were liberally construed to allege that Walsh's delays prolonged the financing period and thereby increased the Surety's expenditures on the project,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 57 (alleging that \"Walsh's failure to cooperate with the Surety's informational requests delayed the Surety from concluding its investigation\"), those losses would seemingly be recoverable under the performance bond-regardless of whether Walsh's declaration of default was justified.

Here, the performance bond-an express contract-governs the parties' actions during the financing period regardless of whether Walsh's declaration of default was justified or unjustified.
