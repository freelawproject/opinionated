KELLY, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff IMAPizza, LLC (\"IMAPizza\") operates a chain of pizza restaurants under the name \"&amp;pizza.\" Defendants-a company called At Pizza Limited (\"At Pizza\") and its alleged owners, Bhasker Dhir and Rupert Lyle-plan to operate a similar pizza restaurant called \"@pizza.\" IMAPizza is understandably upset, and thinks that Defendants have improperly coopted the name and design of its restaurants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   But there's a catch: all of IMAPizza's restaurants are located in the Eastern United States, while Defendants' restaurant is located in Scotland. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss (ECF No. 18) on a variety of grounds, most of which reflect the same general argument: IMAPizza has improperly brought this lawsuit in an American court and (mostly) under American law, while it should have been brought in the United Kingdom under that country's laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As is explained below, the Court largely agrees with Defendants. To the extent that IMAPizza brings claims under federal law, it improperly seeks to apply our laws to conduct that occurred overseas. The one claim it brings under District of Columbia law (alleging that Defendants trespassed by entering &amp;pizza restaurants) is meritless. Those claims will be dismissed. The Court will also order the parties to brief whether the remaining claim (under United Kingdom law) should be dismissed under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finally, IMAPizza will also be required to submit an affidavit with sufficient facts to establish its citizenship for diversity purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   IMAPizza, from its headquarters in the District of Columbia (the \"District\"), operates a restaurant chain called &amp;pizza in the District and other locations in the Eastern United States. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"&amp;pizza is an anti-establishment establishment\" that prides itself on its \"creative pies and craft beverages, localized shop design, and the strength, unity and vibe of its living-wage-paid, ampersand-tattooed\" employees. Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   IMAPizza claims that its \"trademarked name\" is just one aspect of its \"unique commercial impression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. &amp;pizza has other distinctive features as well, such as \"an elongated oval skinny pizza design,\" \"elongated rectangular skinny boxes,\" \"slogans that include 'LOVE&amp;pizza' and 'YOU&amp;pizza,' \" a set of \"four core values,\" and employees that are referred to as its \"Tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. IMAPizza has also submitted copyright applications for the \"architectural and interior design plans\" of its restaurants, \"including the layout, and look and feel of its locations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lyle and Dhir reside in, and are citizens of, the United Kingdom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. According to IMAPizza, they are \"controlling owner[s] and director[s]\" of At Pizza, the corporate entity (organized under the laws of the United Kingdom) through which they operate the @pizza business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After \"tour[ing] a number of &amp;pizza locations in Washington, D.C.,\" Lyle allegedly \"[r]ealiz[ed] the uniqueness of &amp;pizza's restaurant chain\" and decided to copy it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. In October 2015, Lyle incorporated a private limited company called \"&amp; Pizza Limited\" under the laws of the United Kingdom. Wagner Decl. Ex. 1, at 3-9. In June 2016, he renamed the business At Pizza.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12. IMAPizza alleges that Dhir, at Lyle's direction, also \"took numerous trips to visit the Washington, D.C. locations of &amp;pizza\" to study the restaurants. Compl. \u00b6 17. During their visits, Lyle and Dhir allegedly \"entered into &amp;pizza's Washington, D.C. locations masquerading as customers, took extensive pictures (not identifying themselves as the competition), accessed all parts of the restaurant that they could to observe its design, and returned to Scotland, U.K. with this copyrighted information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. They also downloaded photographs of &amp;pizza restaurants from websites operating on servers located in the United States, including \"yelp.com\" (a restaurant review website) and \"flydulles.com\" (the website for the Dulles International Airport).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. IMAPizza claims that these downloads included \"at least three pictures for which [IMAPizza] owns the copyrights in the pictures themselves (in addition to the architectural and interior designs they depict).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For their part, Lyle and Dhir describe their travel to the United States somewhat differently in declarations they have submitted. Lyle admits that he was inspired by American restaurants like &amp;pizza to start his own pizza business, but claims that he came across the restaurant by happenstance during a family vacation in July 2015-which was the only time he visited an &amp;pizza restaurant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lyle Decl. \u00b6 5. He denies having instructed Dhir to visit the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. For his part, Dhir admits to having visited the United States once, in August 2017, as part of his research for the opening of @pizza. Dhir Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. He claims, however, that he visited many different restaurants in two different cities during the trip, and was not fixated on &amp;pizza.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. He also claims that he took pictures only for \"purely personal\" reasons, to \"look for new ideas\" for home-cooked meals with his family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   IMAPizza claims that Lyle and Dhir used the information they gathered to create \"copycat\" restaurants \"possessing the same look and feel\" as &amp;pizza. Compl. \u00b6 25. In designing @pizza, they \"copied &amp;pizza's architectural and interior designs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. They also copied other distinctive features of &amp;pizza, such as the oval shape of the pizza, &amp;pizza's slogans, and \"the promotion of its staff as 'the Squad' or 'the Pack' \" (similar to &amp;pizza's \"Tribe\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. And they chose a trademark, @pizza, that was extremely similar to &amp;pizza.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dhir and Lyle also allegedly used photographs of &amp;pizza (including the three photographs for which IMAPizza owns the copyrights) in a \"marketing deck circulated by @pizza to its business partners,\" effectively passing off &amp;pizza's unique designs as their own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-29. (Dhir and Lyle claim that they used this document, which they describe as a \"mood board,\" only \"during the recruitment of a General Manager\" and never for marketing purposes. Lyle Decl. \u00b6 11; Dhir Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.) When IMAPizza demanded that Defendants cease and desist from this conduct, they refused. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. In fact, they\n   responded that Lyle or Dhir \"would be personally escorting their general manager to Washington, D.C. so he or she could also carefully observe &amp;pizza's design, operation and marketing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. As of the filing of the complaint, Defendants planned to launch the first @pizza location in November 2017 in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IMAPizza alleges that these acts have caused an effect on U.S. commerce. It claims that a large number of U.S. tourists visit Edinburgh, Scotland, every year, and that they \"are likely to be confused as to an association or sponsorship between &amp;pizza and @pizza.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65(a). In addition, \"a substantial number of university students in Edinburgh come from U.S. states in which &amp;pizza is located\" and will experience similar confusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65(b). IMAPizza also alleges that a \"potential business partner of @pizza has contacted &amp;pizza to report the infringing use\" of &amp;pizza's trademark and \"frustration experienced as a result of the potential partner actually being confused into believing that @pizza was affiliated with the well-established &amp;pizza.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IMAPizza filed this case in November 2017. It brings five causes of action. The first, under the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , alleges that Defendants have infringed IMAPizza's copyrights in the architectural works and three photographs mentioned above. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-47. The second cause of action, for \"passing off\" under the common law of the United Kingdom, alleges that Defendants have improperly traded on the goodwill associated with IMAPizza's distinctive trademark and other features, thereby harming IMAPizza.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 48-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Among other things, they have moved to dismiss all claims except the trespass claim for lack of personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2). Defs.' Br. at 10-13. They have also moved to dismiss all claims except the \"passing off\" claim for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Defs.' Br. at 13-21. In addition, Defendants' reply raised, for the first time, the issue of dismissal under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . Defs.' Reply at 25. The Court granted IMAPizza leave to file a surreply to address this new ground for dismissal, along with two other issues that Defendants raised for the first time in their reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 (order); Pl.'s Surreply. Both parties have requested oral argument on the motion. Defs.' Br. at 22; Pl.'s Opp'n at 36.

The Court further concludes that it lacks an adequate record to dismiss IMAPizza's remaining claim (for \"passing off\" under the law of the United Kingdom) under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   .

Indeed, this entire case is predicated on the claim that IMAPizza is trying to attract the public to its restaurants through its branding, and that Defendants are interfering with those efforts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. IMAPizza does not dispute the basic fact that it allows the public into its restaurant as customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 13-15. Instead, it alleges in conclusory fashion that Defendants' entry onto the premises was \"without authorization.\" Compl. \u00b6 81. But this allegation lacks \"facial plausibility,\" because IMAPizza has provided no \"factual content\" to support it.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It does not allege, for example, that Defendants entered private areas of the restaurants, broke in after hours, or remained after being asked to leave. Instead, this allegation appears to rest on IMAPizza's unexpressed wish that potential competitors stay out of its restaurants. But as already explained, IMAPizza cannot invite the public in, and then rely on its unexpressed preferences to single out Defendants as trespassers after the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   IMAPizza repeatedly falls back on its theory that Defendants were \"posing\" or \"masquerading as customers\" (implicitly acknowledging that it let them in on that basis). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 82; Pl.'s Opp'n at 14. This theory rests on the flawed assumption that someone can be either a competitor or a customer, but not both. In fact, when Dhir patronized IMAPizza's restaurants, he was both a competitor\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a customer. As such, IMAPizza consented for him, like all its other customers, to enter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In a similar vein, IMAPizza suggests that Defendants' hidden purpose-to steal its intellectual property-vitiated its consent for them to enter.

That would not be fatal if it were commonly understood that restaurant patrons exceed the scope of their consent whenever they take pictures or bring their employees with them to lunch. \"Even when no restriction is specified[,] the reasonable interpretation of the consent may limit it to acts at a reasonable time and place, or those reasonable in other respects.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 892A cmt. g. IMAPizza has not, however, identified any case law suggesting that any such restrictions customarily apply in the restaurant context. In fact, that result would be inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Desnick\n   </em>\n   , which (without expressly addressing a scope-of-consent theory) declined to find a trespass based on the use of hidden cameras.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416127\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/44/1345/\">\n    44 F.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And common sense suggests that, if a restaurant has not forbidden customers to take pictures, customers who do are not liable for trespass (although that may give the staff a reason to ask them to leave).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Tying all this together, the Court concludes, as a matter of law, that if a restaurant has opened itself to the public, then its consent to enter reasonably extends to competitors as well-even if they harbor an ulterior motive of studying the restaurant for their own gain. In addition\n   to being a correct statement of law, this conclusion also reflects sound policy in a free economic system like ours. \"A competitor can and must shop his competition for pricing and examine his products for quality, components, and methods of manufacture.\"\n   <em>\n    E.I. duPont deNemours &amp; Co. v.
