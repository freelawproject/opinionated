(Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 12.) Doe, a resident of Tennessee, matriculated at Belmont and intended to graduate. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 11.) Upon enrolling at Belmont, Doe - like every other student - pledged to \"exemplify behavior which is consistent with the University's Code of Conduct.\" (Doc. Nos. 21-2 at 9.) Belmont's Student Handbook, the Bruin Guide, sets forth certain policies and processes under Belmont's Code of Conduct. At the outset of the Bruin Guide, Belmont specifies that \"[o]ccasionally, policies will change during the academic year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4.) The Bruin Guide specifies that students \"voluntarily enter into membership in the University community\" and, in doing so, assume certain obligations of performance and behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7.) However, students are cautioned that the Bruin Guide \"is not intended to create nor is it to be construed to constitute a contract between Belmont University and any one or all of its students.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Belmont's Relevant Student Conduct Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At Belmont, students \"have a right to be free from sexual misconduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 12.) The Bruin Guide sets forth a Sexual Misconduct Policy, including definitions of consent, coercion, non-consensual sexual contact, and non-consensual sexual intercourse. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 12-13.) The Bruin Guide\n   sets forth two \"accountability processes.\" One of these is for alleged violations of Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 12-18.) The other is a general accountability process for other violations of Belmont's Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 44-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process begins with initial review of a complaint and any appropriate interim measures (e.g., a temporary no-contact order). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 15.) It then moves to a formal investigatory process by notification to the respondent of the accusation of sexual misconduct and provision of a copy of the complainant's written statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 16.) Belmont's Title IX investigators, at least one of whom should be \"neutral,\" then interview the complainant and respondent, who may present evidence and suggest witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Prior to completing an investigation, the investigators are required to email final party and witness statements and evidence to the complainant and respondent for their review; the parties may comment within two days. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 17.) The Title IX Coordinator then reviews the complete investigatory file and makes a determination of responsibility based upon a preponderance of the evidence standard; there is no opportunity for a \"hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In consultation with other campus leaders, the Title IX Coordinator may also impose sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Sanctions may include, alone or in some combination, a verbal reprimand, a \"reflection essay,\" a fine, a permanent no-contact order, suspension, or expulsion. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Either party may appeal based on an asserted procedural error, new information, or a claim that no reasonable person could have arrived at a similar conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 18.) An appeal is promptly decided by an assigned \"appellate officer,\" but the Dean of Students reserves the right to determine the final outcome. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint Against Doe by Student S.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Doe and Student S. met in May 2016. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 12.) They were both on summer staff for Belmont and lived in the same dorm over the 2016 summer. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 13.) Doe and Student S. became close friends and went on outings with Doe's roommates or other mutual friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 16.) During that summer, Student S. was a bartender at a Nashville restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 18.) Student S. did not have a car and Doe, at Student S.'s request, gave her a ride home from work on a number of occasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) As the summer progressed, Doe and Student S.'s relationship became closer; often Student S. would remain in Doe's room late into the night. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 21.) Sometimes, they kissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 22.) But Doe allegedly declined to have a more sexual relationship based on his \"moral and Christian beliefs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 23.) In June 2016, Doe stopped spending time with Student S. \"because he believed they were incompatible spiritually.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2016, Student S. complained to Belmont about Doe's alleged sexual misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 25.) Student S. alleged that: (1) on an unspecified date, Doe kissed her and attempted to take her shorts off; (2) on June 3, 2016, Doe asked her to take her shorts off, which she did, and then attempted to have sexual intercourse with Student S.; and (3) on June 8, 2016, while Doe and Student S. were at Percy Warner Park in a hammock together kissing, Doe attempted to undress Student S. and she stopped him. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 34.) Doe alleged that, after these incidents, Student S. (1) spent time with him and (2) publicly commended him for \"upstanding character.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) Regardless, on October 6, 2016, Belmont's Deputy Title IX Coordinator found \"reasonable cause to exist\" and\n   recommended the matter proceed under Belmont's formal Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 11, 2016, Molly Zlock, J.D., Belmont's Assistant Dean of Students and Title IX Coordinator, issued a temporary no-contact order to Doe regarding Student S. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 28.) Belmont's Title IX Department then investigated Student S.'s complaint between October 11, 2016 and October 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) On October 28, 2016, Belmont gave Doe and Student S. investigatory results, which included Student S.'s formal written statement, and instructed them to comment within a two to three day time period. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Doe noticed that one of his suggested witnesses, Student T., had not been interviewed and, through counsel, brought this to the attention of Zlock. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 37.) On November 3, 2016, Belmont interviewed Student T. and information pertaining to his statement was added to the investigation file and provided to the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 13, 2016, Doe received the initial Title IX Determination Letter (\"Determination Letter\") from Belmont, signed by Zlock. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 39.) In the Determination Letter, Belmont concluded that Doe was \"not responsible for non-consensual sexual intercourse and non-consensual sexual contact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 40.) However, Belmont found Doe had been \"purposefully untruthful in th[e] investigation,\" and had \"repeatedly violated the university's visitation policy\" based on evidence gathered in the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13; Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 40.) The Determination Letter set forth the following punishment: (a) suspension for the spring 2017 semester (eligible to return summer 2017); (b) institutional \"probation\" continuing upon return to school; (c) loss of privilege to hold leadership positions in co-curricular activity; and (d) a permanent no-contact order barring Doe from having any interaction with Student S., at risk of further punishment. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 13-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As was his right, Doe appealed. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 41.) On December 28, 2016, Doe received a final determination letter stating that no errors had been found and the outcome would stand. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 42.) After denial of his appeal, Doe withdrew from Belmont and did not return from his suspension for the summer 2017 semester.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 71.) Belmont therefore terminated Doe from his student employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 171.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Belmont has moved to dismiss only state law Counts I, II, IV, IX, and X.

Doe claims that the relevant terms of the parties' contract are set forth in the Bruin Guide, and that Belmont breached these terms when it failed to provide Doe with a fair adjudicatory process in a number of ways. Belmont argues that it did not have a contractual relationship with Doe and, even if it did, Doe has not sufficiently alleged breach of that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In Tennessee, to allege a breach of contract a plaintiff must plead (1) the existence of an enforceable contract, (2) nonperformance amounting to a breach of the contract, and (3) damages caused by the breach.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

This allegation refers to three types of charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Notice Regarding Sexual Misconduct Charges and Provision of Student S.'s Formal Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Doe avers that he was neither properly notified of the commencement\n   of the formal Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process nor timely provided with a written copy of Student S.'s formal statement. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 80-81, 102.) Specifically, Doe alleges that, on October 11, 2016, Zlock notified Doe of the issuance of a temporary no-contact order concerning Student S., but gave \"no specific information regarding the reason for the order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 28.) Doe further alleges that Belmont did not provide Doe with Student S.'s \"formal\" statement at the outset of the investigation (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 31), but only did so on October 28, 2016 - after Doe participated in interviews, suggested witnesses, etc. - when Doe was provided with the full investigatory file \"after the investigation was finalized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 33.) Doe claims that this was when he \"first received information regarding the substance of the accusation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Essentially, Doe alleges that Belmont provided him with Student S.'s formal statement at the end of the Process rather than the beginning, contravening the process and compromising his ability to prepare an effective defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process in the Bruin Guide clearly sets forth that, at the beginning of an investigation, \"[t]he Title IX Coordinator will put all parties on notice of the commencement of a Formal Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process by email notification. In addition, the Respondent will be provided a copy of the written statement submitted by the Complainant.\" (Doc. No. 21-2 at 16.) It further provides that, as part of the investigation, the investigators \"should interview the parties regarding the Complainant's written statement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The proper focus in analyzing whether a private university provided fundamental fairness is whether the University adhered to its misconduct procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierre v.

Here, Doe has stated a colorable claim that Belmont breached its contractual relationship with him by not satisfying its relevant rules concerning notice of the alleged sexual misconduct violations and provision of the Complainant's formal statement, as set forth in the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process. Furthermore, by allegedly not providing Student S.'s statement to Doe until the final investigation results, Belmont also failed to put Doe in a position where he could intelligently discuss that statement when interviewed.\n   <em>\n    Compare with, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

(Doc. No. 1 at\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-49, 58.) The Bruin Guide states only that\n   <em>\n    complainants\n   </em>\n   in sexual misconduct investigations will not be held responsible for collateral violations arising from investigations (out of concern that doing otherwise would discourage reporting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This clearly implies that findings of such violations by respondents might arise and be punished. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 21-2 at 12 (\"[T]his special consideration will not excuse any violations by someone alleged to have violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy.\").) There is a preemption clause in the Bruin Guide's Sexual Misconduct Policy: \"The [Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process] alters the general accountability process found in the Bruin Guide.... When an incident involves multiple alleged violations, one of which is an alleged violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, this process will control for all violations.\" (Doc. No. 21-1 at 12.) Accordingly, when a student is investigated under Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process and any collateral violations are raised, the investigation may encompass all violations but the student is entitled to the same process and promises set forth in the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, Doe alleges that he was assured by Zlock that any visitation violations would not be considered during the investigation (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 47), but the Determination Letter reflects Zlock's conclusion that Doe \"repeatedly violated the university's visitation policy.\" (Doc. No. 21-1 at 13.) Once again, \"[t]he proper focus is ... [on] whether [Belmont] adhered to its misconduct procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261714\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/143/703/#p713\">\n    143 F.Supp.3d at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As above, Doe has stated a colorable claim that Belmont acted unreasonably under the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process and breached its notice obligations to Doe concerning these alleged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Notice Concerning Truthfulness Violations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Doe claims that he received no advance notice regarding charges of untruthfulness or warning that Belmont was considering punishing him for untruthfulness. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, 102-106.) Once again, the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process governs under the Bruin Guide's preemption clause. The Court thus looks again to the procedure that Belmont followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Initially, it is clear from the Determination Letter that the questions as to Doe's untruthfulness arose during and\n   <em>\n    throughout\n   </em>\n   the investigation, not\n   <em>\n    before.\n   </em>\n   Thus, at the outset of the investigation there was simply no notice of alleged untruthfulness to provide to Doe. Second, the pleadings before the Court show that, when questions about Doe's truthfulness did arise, Doe\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   made aware. Specifically, Doe had alleged that Student S. tampered with cell phone evidence that was illustrative of the physical nature of their relationship and contradictory of Doe's statements. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 11.) Belmont engaged in an expert analysis, and the parties submitted their cell phones and records from cell phone companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Doe has no plausible claim that he was unaware of the substance of the untruthfulness charges arising from the investigation by which he put his own truthfulness center stage. Nor has Doe explained how more timely knowledge of the adverse evidence could have aided in defense of the untruthfulness finding. To the contrary, it seems that Doe was intent on disputing the text messages no matter\n   what, leading to the\n   <em>\n    inevitable\n   </em>\n   consultation of the electronics experts and eventual conclusion that Doe had been deceptive. Based on the results of the expert investigation, Belmont concluded that Doe had made false statements that Student S.'s electronic messages were \"clearly doctored,\" contained \"glaring forgery,\" and were \"total lies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13.) Belmont concluded that Doe's statements had no reasonable basis, that Doe had been given the opportunity to be truthful, but that Doe had instead chosen to complicate the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) It was on these grounds that Belmont concluded that Doe had been \"purposely untruthful.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Last, there is an inherent expectation of cooperation and truthfulness in the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 21-1 at 17 (\"Witnesses are expected to cooperate with all university investigations.\").) It cannot have come as a \"surprise\" to Doe that he could be punished for being untruthful or deliberately complicating the investigation. Such an eventuality is neither fundamentally unfair nor outside of the objectively reasonable \"range of expectations\" of the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process. The Court concludes that Doe has not stated a colorable claim for breach of the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process concerning the \"untruthfulness\" for which he was punished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Right to Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Doe alleges that Belmont denied him a \"meaningful right to counsel.\" (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 97-101.) The Complaint states that \"[t]he notion of a student being able to defend himself competently in the immensely emotional situation Doe found himself is absurd. Doe was intimidated, as any innocent student accused of sexual assault would have been, and could not have been expected to prepare and deliver his version of the facts in a coherent and logical manner. Doe should not have been forced to go through the investigation process without counsel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process, the complainant and respondent are entitled to a \"support advisor\" of their choosing, who may be an attorney, and that person may attend meetings \"for support\" but may not speak or otherwise directly influence the proceedings. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 15.) However, there are no restrictions placed on the extent to which the support advisor may provide assistance outside the context of formal interviews (e.g., assisting Doe in preparing for an interview). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) So Doe was indeed able to have counsel present and to consult with counsel outside of the formal investigative setting. This is more counsel than even necessary, because \"it is well established that colleges and universities need not allow active representation [of students in disciplinary proceedings] by legal counsel ... in order to comply with notions of fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Coll. of Wooster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275058\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/875/#p891\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (dismissing breach of contract claim, where complaint alleged that \"[t]he notion of a young man being able to defend himself competently in this intensely emotional situation is absurd,\" because student handbook limited participation of counsel);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flaim v.

(Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 114-117.) However, the Complaint acknowledges that the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   provide for a hearing (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 114) in any circumstance, and thus the implied\n   <em>\n    contractual\n   </em>\n   relationship between Doe and Belmont does not provide for the opportunity for confrontation that Doe alleges he was denied. The Court recognizes that, in the context of a procedural due process claim against a public university, a different result would likely arise under recent precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Sept. 7, 2018) (holding that, if a public university has to choose between competing narratives to resolve a sexual misconduct case, the university must give the accused student or his agent an opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder);\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

However, that is not the case here. Belmont is a private university and the Bruin Guide expressly states that, \"[a]s a private institution ... [it] does not adhere to the standards of Constitutional Due Process.\" (Doc. No. 21-2 at 45.) This Court will not read\n   <em>\n    Baum\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   more broadly than the Court of Appeals has written them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is not grounds for Doe's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Appropriateness of Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Belmont failed to conduct an appropriate investigation (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 87-90). However, the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process contains no requirements on what means an investigator must utilize to conduct any interviews or evaluate evidence; instead it only requires that an investigation be conducted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 21-2 at 16 (noting that investigators may meet with individuals as reasonably necessary to collect information and will determine whether collected information is relevant).) Here, Doe clearly alleges that Belmont conducted an investigation. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 30.)

Indeed, in every investigation it is necessary to make credibility determinations, and there frequently will be a party displeased by one or more of those decisions. In the absence of specific provisions in the Bruin Guide, especially in a situation where Belmont conducted an investigation and interviewed numerous witnesses, Belmont's discretionary decisions as to the relative merit and credibility of those witnesses cannot, absent something more, equate to a breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Indeed, the Complaint frequently opines that because Doe was found \"not responsible,\" Student S. should have been disciplined for being \"untruthful\" and making \"false accusations.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, 135.) However, the issue of whether Student S. engaged in any misconduct is immaterial to whether Doe engaged in misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Wright St. Univ.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:16-cv-469,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203671240\">\n    2017 WL 3671240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (S.D. Oh. Aug. 24, 2017). Furthermore, the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process clearly does not provide for a right to punishment of a student's accuser upon a \"not responsible\" finding. (Doc. No. 21-2.) Indeed, it specifies the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   : \"If a person reports a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, the University will not pursue any other violations it learns of related to the incident. These violations may include, but are not limited to, violations of the ... Visitation Policy ... etc. This applies to the person making the report....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 12.) Accordingly, it would have been a\n   <em>\n    breach\n   </em>\n   of the terms of the process for Belmont to have punished Student S. for visitation violations or, arguably, for \"untruthfulness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Regardless, this allegation suffers from a fatally faulty premise because Belmont's investigation did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   conclude that Student S. - a party who made quite detailed allegations, had spontaneously \"broken down\" in a Title IX informational presentation on campus, had sought counseling, and had met with Belmont's Victim's Advocate - had made \"false\" accusations. The investigation merely examined, under the preponderance\n   of the evidence standard,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   whether it was not \"more likely than not\" that Doe \"intentionally touched or had sexual intercourse with Student S. absent consent on multiple occasions,\" and concluded only that Doe was \"not responsible\" for such conduct under Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 21-2 at 13 (Bruin Guide explaining that a complaint may not be proved even where the evidence is equally balanced).) Indeed, according to the Determination Letter, despite the outcome, Belmont found Student S. to have been \"credible,\" and concluded that she \"confide[d] in [ ] witnesses what she perceived occurred between the parties.\" (Doc. No. 21-1 at 12.) As stated in the Determination Letter, the evidence simply \"[fell] short.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, this is not a plausible basis for Doe's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Refrain from Proceeding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Belmont breached an obligation to \"refrain from proceeding if the charges lacked sufficient evidence.\" (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 93-96.) Doe's sole basis for this allegation is that Belmont should not have investigated him upon becoming aware that Student S. had made a positive social media post about Doe on June 23, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) However, the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process does not require any particular type of threshold evaluation. Specifically, a Belmont official need only determine if a student's complaint of sexual misconduct \"falls under the purview of the Sexual Misconduct Policy\" to recommend a formal investigation. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 15.) There is no requirement of a threshold factual evaluation of substantive evidence that will later be considered as part of the formal investigatory process (such as a potentially-contradictory social media post). Nonetheless, the Complaint appears to concede that Belmont performed at least some degree of threshold analysis when it issued the temporary no-contact order and found \"reasonable cause\" to proceed with a formal investigation. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 27.) And even if a greater threshold inquiry were required, simply because Doe identified a piece of evidence (i.e., the social media post) that arguably conflicted with other evidence advanced by Student S. at the outset does not mean Belmont's decision to proceed was incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

This is echoed at other points in the Complaint, where it is variously alleged that \"Belmont did not conduct any investigation into the allegations for which Doe was disciplined,\" (Doc.

That being said, it is clear\n   <em>\n    from face of the Complaint and the Determination Letter\n   </em>\n   that Belmont\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   conduct an investigation into the untruthfulness violation,\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   give specific details as to the subject of the untruthfulness, and\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   give specific evidence to support Belmont's conclusion as to untruthfulness. The Determination Letter\n   <em>\n    explicitly states\n   </em>\n   that the conclusion regarding Doe's lack of truthfulness concerned Doe's representations about the limited extent of his physical relationship with Student S. and his allegation that Student S. had doctored and forged text messages. The Determination Letter explains that Belmont sought and relied upon two technical experts in the investigation of the latter issue. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 12.) Specifically, the Determination Letter states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   It is clear from the evidence that was submitted, especially from the text messages, that the parties had a more physical relationship than [Doe] acknowledged. Upon discovery of [Student S.]'s evidence, [Doe] attempted to question the text messages' authenticity and argued that their fabrication created suspicion as to [Student S.]'s credibility. In fact, [Doe] argued that the messages were \"clearly doctored,\" contained \"glaring forgery,\" and were \"total lies.\" In his response to [the experts'] statement that found the text messages to be accurate, [Doe] attempted to downplay their significance as \"minimal consequence.\" It is unreasonable to believe that [Doe] had simply forgotten about the text message history he shared with [Student S.].

Given the extensive discussion in the Determination Letter, Doe's remarkable statement in his brief that he \"still does not know what he could possibly have lied about\" (Doc. No. 26 at 9) does not render insufficient the evidence developed during the investigation. For purposes of evaluating Doe's claim, Belmont's explanation is sufficient on its face.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Med.

That Doe has failed, in many instances, to sufficiently allege breaches of certain contractual provisions does not give rise to a promissory estoppel claim as an automatic result.

As discussed above, the Process specifies that the investigation may include collateral violations (subject to the same procedural terms set forth therein). The Complaint alleges that \"Doe was assured the visitation violation would not be considered or intermingled with the [sexual misconduct] charge by Zlock and yet Zlock specifically mentions visitation violations in her determination letter and bases her discipline on alleged visitation infractions.\" (Doc.

While arguments may eventually be made regarding whether this alleged promise \"added to\" or \"varied\" versus \"expanded\" the terms of the implied contractual relationship between Doe and Belmont, the Court is satisfied that, at least for now, a promissory estoppel claim based on this factual predicate should not be dismissed. Discovery is appropriate concerning whether (a) the promise actually occurred, (b) the promise verged on \"actual fraud,\" (c) Belmont obtained an unconscionable advantage in the investigation by its actions, or (d) Doe actually relied on this promise to his detriment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Shedd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9070507\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/118/695/#p700\">\n    118 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   700 ;\n   <em>\n    EnGenius Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11802969\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/971/12/#p19\">\n    971 S.W.2d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the Court will dismiss Count II except for a promissory estoppel claim based on the allegations in Paragraphs 47 and 131 of the Complaint to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Count IV - Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In Tennessee, the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") is synonymous with the tort of outrageous conduct.\n   <em>\n    Lyons v.

Second, the Complaint does not sufficiently allege what, if any \"benefit\" actually inured to Belmont from the (unknown) use of Doe's picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Third, the Complaint does not allege that Doe, a party in privity with Belmont as discussed herein, exhausted any remedies against Belmont pertaining to the use of his picture. This is important because the Bruin Guide specifically provides that Belmont\n   <em>\n    may use\n   </em>\n   pictures of students: \"From time to time, University personnel will photograph or videotape campus events for the instructional, documentary, promotional, public relations and/or advertising purposes of Belmont University. Belmont students included in such photographs or video agree that the photographs or video may be used for these purposes by Belmont University.\" (Doc. No. 21-2 at 42.) But the Bruin Guide further provides an opportunity for students to preclude the use of their photos: \"If a student objects to this provision, he or she should provide written notice of this objection to the Office of Communications, which can be reached at communication@belmont.edu or at 615.460.6650.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The Complaint does not allege that Doe ever contacted the Office of Communications by either of these specified means, or asked Belmont in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other way to cease using his picture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For these reasons, Count X will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Belmont's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc.

Belmont attached two documents to its Amended Answer: (1) Doe's initial Title IX Determination Letter dated December 13, 2016 (Doc. No. 21-1), and (2) the Belmont student handbook (\"Bruin Guide\") (Doc. No. 21-2). Doe does not contest the authenticity of these documents, and they have been expressly referenced in the Complaint and Answer. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc.

Doe was allowed to present additional information and was provided a copy of the investigative file and the Determination Letter, and he was allowed to submit comment - including comment or criticism of other witnesses' statements and evidence (and, indeed, Belmont pursued further investigation of the veracity of Student S.' text message evidence based on Doe's feedback). In this manner, although there was no hearing, Doe was not prevented from challenging Student S. (and he did). Doe has not pleaded any facts that establish that the procedure employed by Belmont led to an erroneous result.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Doe complains that Belmont initially overlooked one of his witnesses, Witness T. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 108.) However, when this was brought to Belmont's attention, it interviewed Witness T. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at \u00b6 109.) Doe alleges that Belmont \"failed to do so in a meaningful manner\" (\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    .), but, again, the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process does not contain criteria to define \"meaningful\" interviews. Rather, Belmont officials may meet with witnesses as reasonably necessary in their sole judgment. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 16.) The record before the Court reflects that Belmont did so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The Court also notes that Doe's allegation that Zlock, an attorney, has \"no training in law\" is fanciful.

No. 1 at \u00b6 87-92), and the contract claim therefore may not advance on such an unsupported basis.

The Court merely mentions these allegations here to confirm that they cannot serve a ground for Doe's breach of contract claim. First, the Complaint states that an allegation of cheating was raised against Doe \"during the time frame of the Title IX investigation,\" the allegation was improperly not referred to an Honor Council, and Doe was subsequently forced to undergo an investigation into that alleged violation. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 140.) Under the Bruin Guide's Personal Integrity Policy, a student is not promised an Honor Council determination, and that is only one potential means for investigating and resolving an allegation of academic dishonesty. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 21.) Second, Doe refers, without specific detail, to being more strictly punished than other students who \"were also present during housing violations.\" (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 142.) As discussed above, collateral violations were appropriately considered as part of Doe's investigation under the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process. Also as mentioned above, the punishments of\n    <em>\n     others\n    </em>\n    are immaterial to the treatment of\n    <em>\n     Doe\n    </em>\n    under the Sexual Misconduct Accountability Process, which governed here under the Bruin Guide's preemption clause; the Process does not impose any guarantee of equitable treatment from student to student. Finally, in the Bruin Guide, Belmont expressly reserves the right to delay, deny, or revoke any student's graduation due to a violation of the Code of Conduct. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 40.) Neither of these allegations supplies a plausible basis for Doe's breach of contract claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Buried in this cause of action in the Complaint is an additional claim that Zlock refused Doe \"assistance and accommodations\" and \"ignored\" Doe and his parents.

Although there is much \"confusion between these two concepts [,]\" a quantum meruit theory has not been put forth by Doe either in the Complaint or his brief. Instead, the Complaint explicitly alleged unjust enrichment and Doe did not argue in his brief that the proper claim in this case is for quantum meruit. Consequently, the Court considers only unjust enrichment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cole\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201391625\">\n     2018 WL 1391625\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (proceeding similarly) (citing\n    <em>\n     Patterson v.

(Doc. No. 26 at 14-15.) Again, the Complaint contains no allegations as to how and when Doe's photograph was used. Because Doe has not alleged when his photo was allegedly used, it is impossible to know if it was before or after Doe withdrew from Belmont. Setting that aside, the permission granted by the Bruin Guide does not have any temporal or situational limitations. The photograph was necessarily\n    <em>\n     taken\n    </em>\n    when Doe was on campus. If Doe's suggested reading of the Bruin Guide were the case, Belmont could never use photographs of students once they left campus (e.g., graduated) - an unalleged and unsupported result not dictated by the plain language of the Bruin Guide.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
