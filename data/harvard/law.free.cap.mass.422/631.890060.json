He also appeals from his conviction of larceny of a motor vehicle. There was no error, and there is no basis for granting relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">The circumstances of the crimes are not crucial to the issues argued on appeal, only one of which trial counsel preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">We summarize the basic facts. The jury would have been warranted in finding that on July 22, 1993, the defendant went to his estranged wife\u2019s Arlington home where he struck her numerous times on the face and head with a blunt object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>and stabbed her in her face. She died from multiple compound comminuted skull fractures. The defendant placed his wife\u2019s body in her motor vehicle and drove to an area near Logan Airport where he dug a grave and buried her. The defendant, who later, through an attorney, disclosed the location of his wife\u2019s body to the district attorney\u2019s office, did not dispute that he had killed her. He claimed that he lacked criminal responsibility for his actions. The defendant and the Commonwealth presented expert testimony on the issue of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">1. The defendant objected to the judge\u2019s use of the words \u201cmoral certainty\u201d and \u201cmoral evidence\u201d in giving an instruction on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that was substantially based on language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). The language used by the judge satisfied constitutional requirements, both Federal (see <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>114 S. Ct. 1239, 1245-1248 [1994]) and State (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 344-345 [1995]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 571-572 [1994], cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 753 [1995]). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">2. The defendant now objects to the absence of any jury instruction concerning the effect of his intoxication from alcohol on the question whether he killed the victim with extreme atrocity or cruelty. The defendant did not request such an instruction nor did he object at trial to the absence of such an instruction. We consider the issue pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is true that, if there is evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication, the jury should be told at least in general terms to consider it in determining whether the defendant acted with extreme atrocity or cruelty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 649 (1982). The weakness in the defendant\u2019s argument is that there was no evidence that he was under the influence of alcohol, or even had been drinking, when he killed his wife. Moreover, the judge did not foreclose consideration of intoxication, had there been evidence of it, because he told the jury that they should consider the defendant\u2019s mental condition, including any impairment, in determining whether the defendant committed the murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">3. There was no error in the judge\u2019s instruction on malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>to which the defendant did not object at trial. In any event, an asserted error in defining the third aspect of malice would not be grounds for reversal because the jury found deliberate premeditation to which the third aspect of malice has no application. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 441-442 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">4. We have considered the entire record and see no basis for granting relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
