L. c. 209C (1994 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint was amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to name the mother as a plaintiff in response to the defendant\u2019s claim that the child could not litigate on her own behalf but rather only through a next friend. The putative father (defendant) moved to dismiss the child\u2019s action on the ground that the action is barred by his previous action for declaratory relief brought in June, 1982, against the mother and by the settlement agreement that followed. The defendant also argued that the instant action is barred because the 1982 action for declaratory relief was not an adjudication which was rendered ineffective after the enactment of G. L. c. 209C. His motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">On November 30, 1990, a Probate Court judge ordered that the issues of paternity and support be bifurcated and that the parties proceed first on the issue of paternity. On October 10, 1991, a judgment of paternity was entered in favor of the child and, in a separate ruling, temporary child support and counsel fees were ordered. The defendant appeals from the judgment of paternity, alleging that the Probate Court judge erred in not barring the action and in admitting documentary and oral evidence of a genetic marker test. The defendant also argues that the court erred in awarding support and counsel fees to the child. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review of the judgment of paternity and we affirm. We deny the child\u2019s request for costs associated with this appeal. We allow the child\u2019s motion to strike volume VII of the record appendix. The order awarding child support and counsel fees is not properly before us and, therefore, we do not reach those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The child was born on February 22, 1982, to the mother, who was not then married and had not been married within 300 days prior to the child\u2019s birth. The mother asserts that the defendant, with whom she had a sexual relationship for approximately one decade, is the child\u2019s father. The defendant disputes this.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In June, 1982, the defendant sought a declaratory judgment against the mother that he was not the child\u2019s father. The child was not a party to that action nor was she represented by counsel. Neither a guardian nor next friend was appointed to safeguard the child\u2019s interests. That case was settled by an agreement for judgment signed by counsel for the defendant and counsel for the mother. The mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and the defendant also signed a settlement agreement under which the defendant was to pay the mother $25,000 in exchange for the mother\u2019s assent to a stipulation stating that the defendant was not the child\u2019s father. The agreement purported to be signed by the mother \u201cacting on her own behalf and on behalf of a daughter bom to her on February 22, 1982,\u201d and provided that neither party would bring any further action or claim arising out of the facts giving rise to the case being settled. The agreement specifically provided that it \u201cshall be binding upon the successors, representatives, heirs and assigns of both parties including, without limitation, the child.\u201d The child did not sign the agreement and the agreement did not provide that the money be used for child support. The stipulation was not signed by a judge of the Superior Court nor filed with the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On August 2, 1990, the child brought an action under G. L. c. 209C against the defendant. Genetic marker tests were performed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs expert, Dr. David H. Bing, opined that these tests showed the statistical probability of the defendant\u2019s paternity to be 99.8%.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The paternity tests performed would have excluded 98.63% of falsely accused men as the father. The trial judge also found a physical resemblance between the defendant and the child in facial bone structure and complexion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">I. <em>Res Judicata Effect of 1982 Superior Court Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">a. <em>Adjudication under G. L. c. 273 (1994 ed.). </em>General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 22 <em>(d), </em>provides: \u201cNo proceeding hereunder shall be barred by a prior finding or adjudication under any repealed sections of [c. 273] or by the fact that a child was bom prior to the effective date of this chapter.\u201d The parties dispute whether the 1982 action was an adjudication under a repealed section of c. 273. A Probate Court judge found that the subject matter of the prior proceeding was similar in nature to proceedings under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, and did not bar a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>proceeding under c. 209C. We agree. The defendant, as plaintiff in the 1982 action, relied on G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 846, \u00a7 5, in litigating his claim. The mother, as defendant, counterclaimed for \u201can adjudication under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, that [the defendant] is the father of [the child].\u201d It is clear that the parties, in signing the settlement agreement, were agreeing to a legal determination of the paternity of the child. We agree with the trial judge that, \u201c[i]f, instead of a settlement agreement, there had been an adjudication on the merits of the 1982 action in [the defendant\u2019s] favor on the question of paternity, there is no doubt that the prior adjudication would <em>not </em>have been a bar to [the child\u2019s] claim under G. L. c. 209C in the Probate Court\u201d (emphasis in original). See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Jarvenpaa, </em>404 Mass. 177, 182 (1989). That the stipulation as to paternity was entered by agreement of the parties rather than by the court is immaterial in determining whether it can be attacked collaterally. <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>337 Mass. 80, 81 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 22 <em>(d), </em>specifically erodes the common law policy on finality of judgments and allows readjudication of paternity where there has been a judgment in favor of the alleged father. See <em>Jarvenpaa, supra </em>at 182 (\u201cthe Legislature intended to permit readjudication of the question of paternity under G. L. c. 209C where, under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, proof of th\u00e9 alleged paternity of the defendant had not succeeded. Section 22 <em>(d) </em>makes irrelevant all questions concerning the application to this kind of case of common law principles of claim and issue preclusion based on findings and rulings in earlier litigation\u201d). We conclude that the 1982 Superior Court action is not a bar to the current proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">b. <em>Preclusive effect of 1983 judgment and agreement on the child. </em>Even if the 1982 action could operate as a bar to subsequent proceedings, it could not have preclusive effect on the child who was not a party to that action commenced by the defendant against the mother. As a nonparty, the child\u2019s rights could not have been prejudiced by the 1982 action. See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 8 (1994 ed.) (\u201cno declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The child cannot be bound by the mother\u2019s settlement of the mother\u2019s claims. We cannot conclude that the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>interests were fully protected by the mother.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The child has her own, independent, interests in determining the identity of her father. See <em>Jarvenpaa, supra </em>at 184. She has intangible interests independent of monetary support which cannot be equated completely with her mother\u2019s interests. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Spada </em>v. <em>Pauley, </em>149 Mich. App. 196, 205 n.6 (1986), quoting <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Geno (On remand), </em>134 Mich. App. 433, 435-436 (1984) (Cynar, J., dissenting) (\u201cAt some point, the law must recognize the fact that a child\u2019s interests in paternity litigation are much greater than the mother\u2019s interest in continued support. \u2018In addition to the right of the child to receive support many other present as well as future rights of the child are involved, depending on the facts and circumstances of a specific case\u2019 \u201d). The mother also has independent interests that may prevent her from fully protecting the child\u2019s sometimes competing concerns. See <em>Ruddock </em>v. <em>Ohls, </em>91 Cal. App. 3d 271, 278 (1979) (mother\u2019s emotional and financial needs may prevent her from acting in a proper representative capacity for her child).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The defendant argues that, even if the child were not in privity with her mother and thereby bound, she should be barred from proceeding in this action because her mother was acting as \u201cprocheine amie\u201d or \u201cnext friend\u201d on her behalf in the 1982 action and released her rights. The child disputes that the mother can bind the child when the mother was not legally the child\u2019s representative. See <em>Rudow </em>v. <em>Fogel, </em>376 Mass. 587, 589 (1978) (policy forbids assimilation of parent litigating on his own behalf with parent litigating as representative of child). The child cannot be bound by her mother\u2019s bare assertion that she was acting on behalf of the child without a formal recognition of her status as guardian or without the child\u2019s being joined as a party to the action. See <em>Jarvenpaa, supra </em>at 184-185 (\u201cThe minor plaintiff should not be foreclosed by the prior judgment from presenting his own case for support (and perhaps to establish other rights) against the defendant. The prior proceeding was not brought in the minor\u2019s name, nor could it have been\u201d); <em>Symonds </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>385 Mass. 540, 545 n.7 (1982) (\u201cAny determination that the husband is not the father of a child bom to his wife during marriage is, of course, not binding on the child who is not a party to the proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Other jurisdictions are in accord. See, e.g., <em>Ruddock </em>v. <em>Ohls, supra </em>at 284 (\u201cIn the absence of a full and fair adversary hearing resulting in a judgment on the merits on the issue of paternity a finding of nonpaternity is not binding on the child particularly if collusion is potentially involved or there is a stipulation or agreement by which the issue is decided with less than complete evidence before the <em>court\u201d); Kieler </em>v. <em>C.A.T., </em>616 N.E.2d 34, 38 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993) (children are not bound by judgment in paternity action to which they were not parties); <em>Arsenault </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>390 A.2d 1048, 1051 (Me. 1978) (under previous Maine bastardy statute minor child could not have been a party to prior action so as to be bound by the settlement agreement between his mother and putative father; child not in privity with mother in former action); <em>Spada </em>v. <em>Pauley, </em>149 Mich. App. 196, 199 n.1 (1986) (\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata additionally does not apply because plaintiff was not a party in his mother\u2019s paternity action\u201d); <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare of the City of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Koehler, </em>284 N.Y. 260, 267 (1940) (\u201cThe child is not a necessary party to the [paternity] proceedings nor is the husband of the mother. The order made in such a proceeding does not constitute an adjudication binding on them or persons claiming through or under them . . .\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>66 Ohio St: 2d 186, 190-191 (1981) (\u201cPrivity does not generally arise from the relationship between parent and child. . . . Although the mother\u2019s claim and the child\u2019s claim relate to the same subject matter, the claims are distinct. While the dismissal with prejudice barred the subsequent action of the mother, it in no way affected the child\u2019s separate action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Additionally, the child has unequivocally disaffirmed her mother\u2019s purported release in the settlement agreement by instigating the instant suit. \u201c[A] release is a type of contract which a minor may disaffirm.\u201d <em>DelSanto </em>v. <em>Bristol County Stadium, Inc., </em>273 F.2d 605, 607 (1st Cir. 1960). \u201cA minor, in order to avoid a contract, is not obliged to use any particular words or perform any specific acts. Any acts or words showing unequivocally a repudiation of the contract are sufficient to avoid it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>265 Mass. 163, 164-165 (1928). \u201cBearing in mind that a release of a future claim is in effect a covenant not to sue, it would be difficult to imagine a more direct repudiation of such an agreement than the institution of suit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Even if the mother had been properly acting on behalf of the child, the agreement was subject to disaffirmance by the child who effectively disaffirmed the agreement by filing the instant suit. There is no res judicata effect from the 1982 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">c. <em>Constitutionality of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 22 (d). </em>The defendant challenges the constitutionality of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 22 <em>(d), </em>under art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The constitutionality of c. 209C as it relates to adjudications previously brought under c. 273 has already been decided by this court. <em>Jarvenpaa, supra </em>at 184 (\u201cThe Legislature may not constitutionally enact a law that, in effect, vacates final judgments entered under G. L. c. 273 in paternity actions and authorizes the Commonwealth, if it wishes, to relitigate each paternity issue. We take a different view of the right of the minor plaintiff to proceed in this case. He is not bound by the determination made in the defendant\u2019s favor in the Commonwealth\u2019s G. L. c. 273 proceeding\u201d). The defendant misapprehends <em>Jarvenpaa </em>when he states <em>\u201cJarvenpaa </em>does not rest upon the precept that the Legislature cannot \u2018unbind\u2019 judgments binding upon the executive branch of government but upon the broader precept that it cannot unbind judgments generally.\u201d Article 30 is concerned with the separation of powers of the branches of government. It has no application where a private individual seeks to relitigate an issue already litigated by another private individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The defendant also claims that to allow this suit to proceed would be an unconstitutional impairment of contracts in violation of art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has enunciated a three-part test to determine whether State legislation that affects contracts is constitutional. The threshold inquiry is whether the State law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>contractual relationship. That threshold has not been crossed in this case. The defendant\u2019s contractual rights were only against the mother, not the child. There is no impairment of contract when a State law authorizes a party not bound by that contract to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">d. <em>Estoppel and loches. </em>The defendant argues that the mother is estopped from pursuing this action by virtue of the 1983 judgment and agreement. This argument fails because the mother is not pursuing this action, the child is. The judge held that \u201c[i]n equity I don\u2019t believe the child should be barred by her mother\u2019s actions.\u201d We agree. Because, as we have previously said, the mother was not legally a representative of the child, the child cannot be barred from pursuing her legal rights by her mother\u2019s representation that she was acting on the child\u2019s behalf. The child has done nothing to induce detrimental reliance on the part of the defendant. There is no estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defense of loches is equally inapplicable. Laches is an equitable defense. \u201cA judge may find as a fact that loches exists if there has been unjustified, unreasonable, and prejudicial delay in raising a claim.\u201d <em>Srebnick </em>v. <em>Lo-Law Transit Management, Inc., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 45, 49 (1990). The burden of proving loches rests with the defendant. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>C.T. Sherer Co., </em>291 Mass. 35, 59-60 (1935). The defendant in this case has not satisfied his burden of proving that the delay was unreasonable. The judge\u2019s ruling that \u201c[tjhis action by the child was brought in a reasonable time after the adoption of [c. 209C]\u201d was not clearly erroneous. The defendant offered no proof that the child knew or should have known of her new rights under G. L. c. <em>209C </em>or that she unreasonably delayed after having such knowledge. \u201c[S]o long as there is no knowledge of the wrong committed and no refusal to embrace opportunity to ascertain facts, there can be no loches.\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Finkelstone, </em>206 Mass. 28, 36 (1910). The defendant\u2019s claim of loches must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">II. <em>The Defendant\u2019s Claims of Trial Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">a. <em>Admission of exhibit 11. </em>The defendant objected to the admission in evidence of exhibit 11, a copy of a letter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>mother wrote to the defendant on November 23, 1989.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s objection was overruled and properly preserved. The child argues that when exhibits 8-10, other letters written by the mother to the defendant, were revisited on October 3, 1991, and struck from the record, the defendant, by not asking that exhibit 11 also be struck, waived any objection to its admission. We do not agree. Under Mass. R. Civ. P. 46, 365 Mass. 811 (1974), \u201cit is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court and his grounds therefor.\u201d This was done. The fact that exhibit 11 was mentioned again during later testimony does not affect the validity of defense counsel\u2019s objection. Therefore, we reach the substantive issue whether exhibit 11 should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">i. <em>Relevancy. </em>Evidence is relevant if it has a \u201crational tendency to prove an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chretien, </em>383 Mass. 123, 136 (1981). See also Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 401 (evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d). The trial judge is accorded substantial discretion in deciding whether evidence is relevant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>392 Mass. 604, 613 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">It is unclear from the record for what the purpose the letter was offered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was apparently offered either to show that the mother considered the defendant to be the child\u2019s father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>or to explain why the defendant commenced visits with the child in early 1990. As either, the letter is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">ii. <em>Hearsay. </em>Hearsay is an \u201cextrajudicial statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>377 Mass. 264, 269 n.4 (1979). See Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 801 (c). The letter is, thus, hearsay if it was offered in evidence to prove the truth of a matter asserted therein, namely that the defendant is the child\u2019s father. However, if it was offered to explain the defendant\u2019s visits with the child, it is not hearsay and it is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">If there is any basis for upholding the admissibility of the evidence, the reason on which the decision rests is immaterial and the lower court\u2019s ruling is sustained. <em>North Shore Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield, </em>322 Mass. 413, 416 (1948). We uphold the ruling of the lower court on a general objection if it is supportable on any ground. It is assumed that the ruling was based on the proper ground. <em>Palm </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>333 Mass. 461, 463 (1956). We assume that the judge overruled the objection because the evidence was properly admitted, not for its truth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>but to explain the defendant\u2019s visits with the child and that, therefore, the ruling was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We additionally conclude that, to the extent that the evidence may have been admitted in error, the error was not prejudicial. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 119 (1994 ed.) (\u201cNo error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence ... is ground for modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order unless the appeals court or the supreme judicial court deems that the error complained of has injuriously affected the substantial rights of the parties\u201d). See <em>DeJesus </em>v. <em>Yogel, </em>404 Mass. 44, 48 (1989) (\u201cthe substantial rights of a party are adversely affected when relevant evidence is erroneously excluded that, viewing the record in a commonsense way, could have made a material difference\u201d). The burden is on the proponent of the erroneously excluded evidence, or in this case on the proponent of the exclusion, to show that the trier of fact might have reached a different result if the ruling had been different. <em>Id. </em>at 48-49. That showing has not been made here. There is no evidence in the judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that he relied on the letter in determining that the act of intercourse occurred. On the contrary, the judge expressly relied on the mother\u2019s testimony which alone is sufficient to prove paternity. See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Sorrentino, </em>408 Mass. 340, 343 (1990). The letter is merely cumulative on this point. For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to any relief because of the admission of exhibit 11, the November 23, 1989, letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">b. <em>Admission of documentary and oral testimony of Dr. Bing. </em>General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 17 (1994 ed.), requires that the judge, on the motion of a party, order blood or genetic marker tests on the mother, child, and putative father <em>in </em>an action to establish paternity on \u201cproper showing\u201d by the requesting party. \u201cAn affidavit by the mother or the putative father alleging that sexual intercourse between the mother and the putative father occurred during the probable period of conception shall be sufficient to establish a proper showing.\u201d G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 17. Once the test is performed, \u201cthe report of the results of blood grouping or genetic marker tests, including a statistical probability of the putative father\u2019s paternity based upon such tests, shall be admissible in evidence without the need for laying a foundation or other proof of authenticity or accuracy . . . provided . . . that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>report shall not be considered as evidence of the occurrence of intercourse between the mother and the putative father; and provided, however, that such report shall not be admissible absent sufficient evidence of intercourse between the mother and the putative father during the period of probable conception.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The defendant disputes the sufficiency of the evidence of intercourse between the mother and himself during the period of probable conception. The judge ruled that the question of whether \u201cthere was intercourse between the parties on several dates in May and June, [1981,] is [judged] by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d The defendant asserts that this ruling was erroneous. He contends that \u201csufficient evidence\u201d as required by G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 17, refers back to the burden in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 7, to establish paternity by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This reading of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 17, is contrary to the well-established rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhere the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982). We decline to imply the clear and convincing standard into \u00a7 17 where it is not expressly required.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Evidence of intercourse between the defendant and the mother consisted of the mother\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge found the mother\u2019s \u201ctestimony in this regard to be credible ....</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The judge concluded on the facts] that the child bom to [the mother] on February 22, 1982, was conceived by her as the result of sexual intercourse with the Defendant in May or June of 1981.\u201d This is legally sufficient. <em>Sorrentino, supra </em>at 343 (\u201cThe mother of the child testified that approximately nine months before the child was bom she had sexual relations with the defendant and that she had no relations with anyone else around that time. That evidence was sufficient to establish clearly and convincingly, consistent with the plaintiffs burden of proof, that the defendant was the child\u2019s father\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">c. <em>Exclusion of evidence that in 1980 the mother was allegedly a prostitute. </em>Defense counsel\u2019s offer of evidence of the mother\u2019s alleged prostitution outside of the period of probable conception is both irrelevant and inflammatory. It was properly excluded under both the common law and G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 16 <em>(d) </em>(1994 ed.). See <em>Easdale </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>143 Mass. 126, 128 (1886) (\u201cIt is the general rule, that no act of sexual intercourse between the complainant and any other man than the respondent is admissible in evidence, unless it is so near in time as to afford some evidence that it resulted in begetting the child named in the complaint\u201d); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>118 Mass. 602, 605 (1875) (\u201cIn a proceeding of this nature [paternity], the character of the complainant for chastity is not put in issue, and such evidence is irrelevant\u201d); G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 16 <em>(d) </em>(\u201cIn an action to establish paternity, testimony relating to sexual access to the mother by an unidentified man at any time or by an identified man at any time other than the probable time of conception of the child is inadmissible in evidence unless offered by the mother\u201d). Evidence of the mother\u2019s alleged prostitution was properly excluded. Defense counsel\u2019s contention on appeal that such exclusion was error is frivolous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">d. <em>Correctness of the adjudication of paternity. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s decision to credit the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of the mother over his testimony was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d He further argues that the judge gave improper weight to the genetic marker evidence in light of cross-examination that established that some scientists question the reliability of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>397 Mass. 206 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We return to the familiar maxim: \u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 52 (a) (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814, 821-822 (1993) (Liacos, C.J., dissenting) (\u201cThe determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses, and not of this court. In such a situation, where subsidiary findings of fact have been made by the trial judge, they will be accepted by this court, and we do not substitute our judgment for his, absent clear error. . . . Questions of credibility are, of course, for the trial judge to resolve\u201d); <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977) (\u201cIn deciding whether a judge\u2019s subsidiary finding of fact is clearly erroneous, it must be emphasized that it is the trial judge who, by virtue of his firsthand view of the presentation of evidence, is in the best position to judge the weight and credibility of the evidence. . . . Thus, a finding of fact by the trial judge will not be deemed \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 unless the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. [Citations omitted.])\u201d We conclude that the record was sufficient to support the judge\u2019s findings of fact and rulings of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">iii. <em>Award of support and attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The defendant\u2019s claim of error as to the award of weekly support payments and counsel fees is premature. The order of which the defendant complains is a temporary order, not a final judgment; a hearing on th\u00e9 issues of support, custody, and visitation is pending in the Probate Court. The issue whether the child is barred from receiving support because of her mother\u2019s settle-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>merit is better addressed at that hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The issue of counsel fees also is to be addressed in further hearings in the Probate Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">iv. <em>Award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs of appeal. </em>The child has requested her attorney\u2019s fees and costs of appeal. \u201cAs a general rule in Massachusetts, a litigant must bear his own expenses except in so far as (1) a statute permits awards of costs ... or (2) a valid contract or stipulation provides for costs, or (3) rules concerning damages permit recovery of costs\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70 (1977). There is no valid contract or stipulation providing for attorney\u2019s fees and attorney\u2019s fees cannot be awarded under a rule concerning damages which permits such a recovery. Thus, the award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees for a paternity action is proper only if a statute expressly permits such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The child argues that G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45 (1994 ed.), provides authority for the award. Her reliance on c. 215, \u00a7 45, is misplaced. \u201cChapter 215, \u00a7 45, permits awards of costs in declaratory judgment actions in Probate Court only when such actions concern matters relating to wills and estates . . . .\u201d <em>Fuss, supra </em>at 71, citing <em>United Tool &amp; Indus. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Torrisi, </em>359 Mass. 197, 199 (1971). Because \u00a7 45 is limited to wills and estates there is no statutory authority for us to allow the child\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. The motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The child\u2019s claim that she should be allowed attorney\u2019s fees on appeal because a legitimate child would be entitled to appellate attorney\u2019s fees in a support case must fail because, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>discussed <em>supra, </em>the issue of child support is not properly before the court at this time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">The judgment of paternity is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-15\">General Laws c. 209C (1994 ed.), entitled \u201cChildren Born Out of Wedlock,\u201d was enacted in 1986 with the express purposes of providing rights to children bom out of wedlock equal to the rights enjoyed by children whose parents were married at the time of their birth.

It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a means for such children either to be acknowledged by their parents voluntarily or, on complaint by one or the other of their parents or such other person or agency as is authorized to file a complaint by section five, to have an adjudication of their paternity, to have an order for their support and to have a declaration relative to their custody or visitation rights ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Similar tests had been performed in connection with the 1982 litigation.

This evidence was excluded at trial. The defendant now claims that that exclusion was in error. The child has moved that the evidence, contained within Volume VII of the record appendix, be struck from the record. See <em>infra. </em>The child\u2019s motion is allowed. The defendant admits in his appellate brief that the exclusion was \u201calmost certainly harmless\u201d and the defendant\u2019s only support for his contention that the evidence should not have been admitted is inapposite. The defendant\u2019s argument on this point does not rise to the level of appellate advocacy required by this court. See Mass. R. A.
