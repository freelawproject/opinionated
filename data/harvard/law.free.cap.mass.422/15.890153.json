In 1993, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that the State law claims were preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 et seq. (1988). The Appeals Court reversed the Superior Court judgment, concluding that the preemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>question had to be decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in light of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Signal Technology Corp., </em>417 Mass. 154 (1994) <em>(Pace). Kelly </em>v. <em>Fort Dearborn Life Ins. Co., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 942, 943 (1994). We granted the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review. We agree with the Superior Court judge that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are preempted by Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">This case presents a different preemption issue from that addressed in the <em>Pace </em>opinion. The <em>Pace </em>case involved a claim that an employer had misrepresented the existence of insurance coverage to a person who, in fact, was not covered by the employer\u2019s ERISA plan. The Supreme Court had not addressed that precise preemption issue and authorities were divided on the question whether such State law misrepresentation claims were preempted. <em>Pace, supra </em>at 157-158. This court held that ERISA, which supersedes \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter <em>relate to any employee benefit plan </em>described in [ERISA]\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 [a]), did not preempt a claim that did not seek benefits under the plan and was based on an employer\u2019s misrepresentation regarding the existence of ERISA benefits (emphasis added). <em>Pace, supra </em>at 159-160. The division of authorities on the issue noted in our <em>Pace </em>opinion continues. Compare <em>Carlo </em>v. <em>Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 794 </em>(1st Cir. 1995) (rejecting reasoning of our <em>Pace </em>opinion and other \u201ccogent arguments against preemption in misrepresentation claims\u201d) with <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Nevada Bonding Corp., </em>53 F.3d 1023, 1028-1029 (9th Cir. 1995) (State law claims based on employer\u2019s misrepresentation of coverage availability not preempted by ERISA).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In the case now before us, the insurer\u2019s sales representative, in negotiating the coverage to be included in the ERISA plan, promised the plaintiff, who had a role in negotiating the coverage, that the insurer would underwrite preexisting conditions. Two weeks after the policy period commenced, the plaintiff became totally disabled. Benefits under the policy were not available to her. Her disability was caused by a preexisting condition that the policy excluded from coverage because the condition was not covered under the next prior policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The plaintiff, who was insured under her employer\u2019s ERISA plan, asserts a claim to disability benefits that unquestionably requires an interpretation of that plan. The claim unavoidably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>relates to the employer\u2019s ERISA plan and is thus preempted by Federal law. Congress intended that ERISA\u2019s preemption provision be broadly construed. <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 138 (1990). <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1987). \u201cA law \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 96-97 (1983). The claim here is that the ERISA plan should have, but did not, provide particular coverage as the insurer promised. Such a claim relates to the employer\u2019s ERISA plan, and State law claims in such a case are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The conclusion we reach is consistent with decisions elsewhere concerning alleged misrepresentations by insurers or plan administrators to employees about the scope of coverage under an ERISA plan. See, e.g., <em>Variety Children\u2019s Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Century Medical Health Plan, Inc., </em>57 F.3d 1040, 1042 (11th Cir. 1995) (State law claims of fraud and misrepresentation based on failure of covered plan to pay benefits preempted by ERISA); <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>General Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>967 F.2d 388, 390-391 (10th Cir. 1992) (insurer\u2019s alleged misrepresentation of eligibility for coverage under ERISA plan preempted); <em>Pohl </em>v. <em>National Benefits Consultants, Inc., </em>956 F.2d 126, 128 (7th Cir. 1992) (purpose of ERISA to protect financial integrity of plans by confining benefits to plans as written, and ruling out oral modifications, would be thwarted if participants could maintain State law actions based on oral representations of coverage); <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Equicor-Equitable HCA Corp., </em>944 F.2d 1272, 1275-1276 (6th Cir. 1991), cert. dismissed, 505 U.S. 1233 (1992) (State law claims, based on plan administrator\u2019s assurance that coverage was available for services, preempted by ERISA).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
