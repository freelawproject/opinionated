Volin and the Massachusetts Society of Independent Accountants, Inc. (MSIA), brought an action for declaratory relief challenging the authority of the defendant Board of Public Accountancy (board), under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D (1994 ed.), the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, to restrict certain advertising practices and professional activities of unlicensed accountants. On cross motions for summary judgment, Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (a) and (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), the Superior Court judge granted each motion in part, and issued the following declaratory judgment: \u201cVolin and members of the [MSIA] who are not licensed under the provisions of [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87B or 87B\u00bd,] may hold themselves out publicly as accountants and as providing accounting services. They may not use any advertising, letterhead, or work product which contains their affiliation with the National Society of Public Accountants or its initials NSPA. They may not describe their accounting services or modify or enhance their title as accountants with the words \u2018professional,\u2019 \u2018independent,\u2019 \u2018experienced,\u2019 or \u2018quality\u2019. They may not advertise aspirations to provide \u2018the very best\u2019 accounting services, or their ability to address \u2018all\u2019 financial/ accounting needs. They may, as accountants, issue financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>statements. They may not use language in financial statements or letters transmitting financial statements to the effect that they were prepared \u2018independently\u2019 or from \u2018information provided by management [or the client]\u2019 if submitting such financial statements as an accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The plaintiffs and the board both appealed. We allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Volin compiles financial statements and provides other business and accounting services. He is not licensed by the Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction as a public accountant or certified public accountant. On his business letterhead and in his advertising materials he refers to himself as an \u201caccountant,\u201d to his firm as \u201cexperienced accountants,\u201d and to his membership in the National Society of Public Accountants (NSPA) and other organizations. His advertising further asserts that he is a \u201cprofessional\u201d who provides \u201cquality accounting\u201d services, that he aspires to provide \u201cthe very best accounting . . . services available,\u201d and that he is \u201cone professional for all your financial needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Volin attaches to financial statements which he has prepared a transmittal letter on his business letterhead which states: \u201cThe accompanying financial statements and management reports of (name of client) for the quarter (year, etc.) ended (date) have been prepared independently by us for your use in accordance with our engagement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u201cWe have prepared and assembled the financial statements and management reports from information provided to us by management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Volin\u2019s name followed by the letters \u201cNSPA\u201d appears at the bottom of every page of the financial statements which he has prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">In early 1991, the board advised Volin that his advertisements and cover letters violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D (1994 ed.). The board requested that Volin enter into a consent agreement which would prohibit him from engaging in such practices in exchange for the board\u2019s promise to not initiate criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Volin declined to execute the consent agreement, and commenced this action for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The plaintiff MSIA is a corporation whose purpose is to promote and to protect the interests of its 151 members, approximately 83 per cent of whom practice accountancy but are not licensed to do so. Some or all the unlicensed members of the MSIA engage in business activities similar to those engaged in by Volin and advertise their services and hold themselves out in a similar manner. All the parties agreed that the court should declare the rights of MSIA members based on Volin\u2019s accounting practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">After commencement of this case, the board retained the services of The Becker Institute, Inc. (Becker), to conduct a survey of Massachusetts residents to determine whether the public believed that persons holding themselves out as \u201caccountants,\u201d or as offering \u201caccounting services,\u201d are required to be licensed by the Commonwealth. Becker surveyed 503 randomly selected Massachusetts adults over the age of eighteen years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The results of the poll indicated that fifty-eight per cent of those surveyed believed that persons who advertise as \u201caccountants\u201d were required to be licensed, while twenty-eight per cent did not believe that a license was required. The poll also indicated that fifty-nine per cent of those surveyed believed that a license was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>required to advertise \u201caccounting services,\u201d while thirty-one per cent did not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">2. <em>The board\u2019s appeal. </em>The board appeals from the judge\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs may hold themselves out publicly as accountants and as providing accounting services. The board contends that, regardless of context, use of the terms \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting services\u201d by unlicensed persons is statutorily prohibited. Relying on data from the Becker Report, the board asserts that the terms \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting services\u201d misleadingly suggest licensure and are therefore prohibited by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D <em>(h). </em>That provision bars unlicensed persons from using \u201cthe title or designation \u2018certified accountant\u2019, \u2018chartered accountant\u2019, \u2018enrolled accountant\u2019, \u2018licensed accountant\u2019, \u2018registered accountant\u2019, \u2018accredited accountant\u2019, or any other title or designation likely to be confused with the titles \u2018certified public accountant\u2019 or \u2018public accountant\u2019, or use any of the abbreviations \u2018CA\u2019, \u2018EA\u2019, \u2018LA\u2019, \u2018RA\u2019, \u2018AA\u2019, or similar abbreviations likely to be confused with the abbreviations \u2018CPA\u2019 or \u2018PA.\u2019 \u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D <em>(h). </em>The plaintiffs argue that use of the unadorned terms \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting services\u201d is not expressly forbidden, and that the board\u2019s interpretation is incorrect because it renders many of the statute\u2019s provisions superfluous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u201cThe words of a statute must be construed in association with the general statutory plan.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Wells Yachts South, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 661, 664 (1990). We do not \u201cinterpret a statute so as to render it or any portion of it meaningless.\u201d <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985). In G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 87D <em>(d)-(i), </em>the Legislature carefully restricted the professional titles, designations, and abbreviations used by unlicensed accountants. The board\u2019s claim that unlicensed persons may not rise the terms \u201caccountant\u201d or \u201caccounting services\u201d would reduce some of those provisions to mere surplusage. The general term \u201caccountant\u201d encompasses terms explicitly prohibited (\u201ccertified accountant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cchartered accountant,\u201d \u201cenrolled accountant\u201d). The general term \u201caccounting\u201d is similarly prohibited only \u201cin connection with . . . language . . . which implies that such person . . . holds ... a license or has special competence as an accountant.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D <em>(i). </em>The plaintiffs are correct that the board may not prohibit them from all use of the terms \u201caccount\u201d and \u201caccounting.\u201d The Legislature would have prohibited those terms without qualification if it intended to prohibit all use.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">This is not to say that the list of prohibited titles and usages contained in \u00a7 87D is exclusive. On the contraiy, \u00a7 87D <em>(h) </em>prohibits use of any term \u201clikely to be confused with the titles \u2018certified public accountant\u2019 or \u2018public accountant\u2019 [or] with the abbreviations \u2018CPA\u2019 or \u2018PA.\u2019 \u201d By its terms, however, the statute permits an unlicensed accountant to use the terms \u201caccountant,\u201d \u201cauditor,\u201d or \u201caccounting,\u201d standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">3. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. </em>The plaintiffs appeal from the judge\u2019s ruling that Volin may not in his advertisements and business correspondence use the term \u201cNSPA\u201d or mention his membership in that organization, or use the terms \u201caccountant\u201d or \u201caccounting\u201d in conjunction with other specified language. The plaintiffs also appeal from the judge\u2019s ruling that Volin\u2019s transmittal letters were \u201creports\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 87A and 87D. Finally, the plaintiffs appeal from the judge\u2019s ruling that \u00a7 87D is constitutional. We conclude that the judge\u2019s rulings were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Volin\u2019s advertisement of his membership in the National Society of Public Accountants and his use of the acronym NSPA are obvious violations of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D (/), which proscribes use of the \u201ctitle or designation, \u2018public accountant\u2019, or the abbreviation \u2018PA\u2019, or any other title, designation, words, letters, abbreviation, sign, card, or device tending to indicate that such person is a public accountant unless he holds a valid license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Other language in Volin\u2019s advertisements violates G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D (z), which forbids an unlicensed accountant from \u201cassuming] or us[ing] any title or designation that includes the words \u2018accountant\u2019, \u2018auditor\u2019, or \u2018accounting\u2019, in connection with any other language . . . which implies that such person or firm holds such a license or has special competence as an accountant or auditor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Specifically, Volin\u2019s advertisements describe him as an \u201cexperienced\u201d accountant who aspires \u201cto provide . . . the very best accounting . . . services available,\u201d as \u201cone professional for all your financial needs,\u201d as a provider of \u201cquality accounting . . . services,\u201d and as a registered representative of H.D. Vest, a national organization of accountants and tax professionals. These terms and statements clearly imply Volin\u2019s \u201cspecial competence as an accountant\u201d and therefore violate G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D (z).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 87D (a) (1994 ed.), prohibits unlicensed persons from issuing \u201ca report on financial statements of any other person, firm, organization or governmental unit.\u201d Section 87D <em>(b) </em>provides that the prohibition of \u00a7 87D <em>(a) </em>is applicable to a \u201creport using any form of language conventionally used by licensees with respect to a review of financial statements.\u201d A \u201creport\u201d in this context is defined as \u201can opinion, report or other form of language which states or implies assurance as to the reliability of any financial statements and which also includes or is accompanied by any statement or implication that the person or firm issuing it has special knowledge or competence in accounting or auditing. Such a statement or implication of special knowledge or competency may arise from use by the issuer of the report of names or titles indicating that he or it is an accountant or auditor, or from the language of the report itself. The term \u2018report\u2019 includes any form of language which ... is conventionally understood to imply a positive assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements referred to or special competence on the part of the person or firm issuing such language.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87A.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It is not contested that Volin prepares financial statements for others. The law does not prohibit him from providing that service. However, Volin transmits with those financial statements a cover letter which states that they were prepared \u201cindependently,\u201d \u201cfrom information provided to us by management,\u201d on letterhead which gives Volin the title of \u201caccountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The letter\u2019s statement that the accompanying financial statements were prepared \u201cindependently\u201d is an implicit assurance of reliability. The inference that they were prepared by an independent accountant implies special knowledge or competence of the issuer. Further, language of \u201cindepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>dence\u201d is conventionally used by licensees in an audit report, see 1 AICPA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Professional Standards AU \u00a7 508.08 (1995), and language disclaiming information contained in financial statements as the representations of management is conventionally used by licensees in a review of financial statements. 2 AICPA Professional Standards AR \u00a7 100.35 (1995). Therefore, in his transmittal letters, Volin violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D <em>(a), </em>by issuing a report, and G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D (b), by using language therein \u201cconventionally used by licensees with respect to a review of financial statements.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">4. <em>Free </em>speech.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D, thus interpreted, unconstitutionally infringes on their free speech rights as guaranteed by art. 16 and the First Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Volin\u2019s use of terms prohibited by \u00a7 87D relates solely to his economic interests, and so qualifies for only the limited protection afforded commercial speech. See, e.g., <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., </em>447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980). In circumstances involving potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>deception<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a State may regulate commercial speech if (1) it is doing so in order to protect a substantial governmental interest, (2) the statute directly advances that interest, and (3) the statute is no more restrictive than necessary to serve that interest. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edge Broadcasting Co., </em>509 U.S. 418, 424 (1993), quoting <em>Central Hudson, supra. </em>As to the third criterion, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201cour commercial speech cases require a fit between the restriction and the government interest that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable.\u201d <em>Edge Broadcasting Co., supra </em>at 429. Accord <em>Edenfield </em>v. <em>Fane, </em>507 U.S. 761, 767 (1993). We agree with the judge below that, as applied to Volin, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D, satisfies the <em>Central Hudson </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">The Commonwealth has a substantial interest in protecting the public from substandard accounting practices. Accord <em>Edenfield, supra </em>at 770 (\u201cWe have given consistent recognition to the State\u2019s important interests in maintaining standards of ethical conduct in the licensed professions\u201d). This interest is directly advanced through the maintenance of professional and ethical standards among those persons recognized by the public as licensed public accountants. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 87A\u00bd, and the regulations promulgated thereunder set out the high standards required by the Commonwealth. Those provisions would be ineffective to protect the public, however, if unlicensed individuals could easily mislead the public into thinking that they were licensed. That possibility is foreclosed by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87D. We agree with the board that \u00a7 87D directly advances the government\u2019s interest by guarding against the public\u2019s confusion of licensed and unlicensed accountants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We also conclude that there is a \u201creasonable fit\u201d between the government\u2019s interest and the restrictions of \u00a7 87D. See <em>Edge, supra </em>at 429. \u201cThe public\u2019s comparative lack of knowledge, the limited ability of the professions to police themselves, and the absence of any standardization in the \u2018product\u2019 renders advertising for professional services especially susceptible to abuses . . . .\u201d <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>(1982). Section 87D merely prevents public confusion regarding who has and has not fulfilled the requirements of licensure. It does not prevent unlicensed accountants from performing those services which the law permits; nor does it prevent them from advertising themselves as \u201caccountants\u201d who provide \u201caccounting services.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>California State Bd. of Accountancy, </em>2 Cal. 4th 999, 1021-1023 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 951 (1993) (holding unconstitutional a complete ban on unlicensed use of the terms \u201caccountant\u201d and \u201caccounting\u201d); <em>Comprehensive Accounting Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, </em>284 Md. 474, 489 (1979) (same). It does no more than require that information about accounting services appear in such form as is necessary to prevent it from being deceptive. Cf. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>440 U.S. 1, 16 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The declaratory judgment issued by the Superior Court judge is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The board is charged by statute with adopting and enforcing \u201crules of professional conduct directed to controlling the quality and probity of the practice of public accountancy by license holders, and dealing among other things with independence, integrity and objectivity; competence and techni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>cal standards; responsibilities to the public; and responsibilities to clients.\u201d G.

Cf. <em>In re R.M.J. </em>455 U.S. 191, 203 (1982) (distinguishing \u201cinherently\u201d from \u201cpotentially\u201d misleading advertisements).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">No alternative method of protecting the government\u2019s interest was pleaded by the plaintiffs in their complaint. The only alternative presented by the plaintiffs in their summary judgment briefs was their conclusory assertion that a \u201cbetter and far less restrictive remedy to any public misperception ... is for the board and its licensees to better [educate] the public.\u201d In their appellate brief, the plaintiffs repeat that assertion and make the additional conclusory assertion that \u201cthe potential for public misperception . . . could be easily overcome by requiring that non-licensees indicate that they are non-CPA or non-PA members of the [NSPA].\u201d We do not consider the latter assertion because it was not raised below. See <em>Jancey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Everett, </em>421 Mass. 482, 500 (1995); <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>420 Mass. 702, 703 n.2 (1995). Moreover, neither assertion rises to the level of adequate appellate argument. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See, e.g., <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576, 585 n.8 (1994); <em>Zora </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>415 Mass. 640, 642 n.3 (1993); <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Faulkner Hosp., </em>411 Mass. 701, 707 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
