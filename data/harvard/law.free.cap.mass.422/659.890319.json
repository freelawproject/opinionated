The plaintiff, Berkshire Mutual Insurance Co. (Berkshire), argues that the statute begins to run on the date of the accident or, in the alternative, on the date when the insured discovers that the tortfeasor is underinsured. The defendant, Bouldin G. Burbank, argues that the statute begins to run on the date the insurer violates the insurance contract. Berkshire commenced this action for declaratory judgment, and a Superior Court judge allowed Berkshire\u2019s motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>mary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Burbank appealed. The case was transferred here on our motion. We conclude that a judgment should be entered declaring that the statute of limitations period began to run at the time Berkshire refused to arbitrate Burbank\u2019s claim. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The relevant facts are not in dispute. On December 19, 1983, Richard P. Goddard, while crossing a public way in Plymouth, was struck by an automobile driven by Donna Delaney. Goddard died the next day as a result of his injuries. Burbank was appointed administrator of Goddard\u2019s estate. In May, 1986, Burbank settled with Delaney\u2019s insurer for $10,000, Delaney\u2019s policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">At the time of the accident, Goddard lived with his sister Janet, and was covered by the underinsured motorist provisions of Janet\u2019s policy with Berkshire. The policy provided that the amount of damages incurred by the injured person would be determined by agreement between the insurer and the injured person, or, if agreement could not be reached, by arbitration. The policy\u2019s underinsured motorist benefit limit was $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">After Goddard\u2019s death, Berkshire and Burbank discussed Goddard\u2019s estate\u2019s underinsured motorist claim, but did not reach an agreement as to damages. In August, 1993, Burbank requested that Berkshire submit to arbitration. Berkshire refused, and commenced this action seeking the court\u2019s declaratory judgment that the estate\u2019s claim was barred by the six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\"><em>Statute of limitations. </em>The basis of an insurer\u2019s obligation to pay underinsured motorist benefits \u201cis not its actions resulting in personal injury but, rather, its contractual promise to indemnify against such injury.\u201d <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>411 Mass. 629, 638 (1992). Hence, \u201can action on an uninsured motorist policy is an action in contract for indemnification,\u201d and the applicable limitations period is the six-year period prescribed by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2 (1994 ed.). <em>Id. </em>at 636. That section provides that \u201c[ajctions of contract . . . shall ... be commenced only within six years next after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>cause of action accrues.\u201d The question here is when a cause of action for underinsured motorist benefits accrues and the six-year period begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The general rule is that a contract action accrues at the time the contract is breached. See <em>Boston Tow Boat Co. </em>v. <em>Medford Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>232 Mass. 38, 41 (1919); <em>Campanella &amp; Cardi Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>351 Mass. 184, 185 (1966); <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 527 (1994). Prior to the time when the contract is violated there is no justiciable controversy, and it would be illogical to let the statute of limitations for bringing an action begin to run before the action can be brought. That violation occurred when Berkshire, in 1993, refused to submit to arbitration. Hence, Burbank\u2019s underinsured motorist claim was not barred by the six-year contract limitation period. See G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The policy at issue provides, under the heading \u201cBodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured or Underinsured Auto\u201d that \u201c[t]he determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of a responsible auto will be by agreement between us and the injured person. The amount of damages, if any, will be determined in the same way. Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be reached.\u201d Our construction of this provision is \u201cguided by the settled rule of interpretation\u201d that contract terms are \u201cto be interpreted ... in the light of the pertinent facts within [the parties\u2019] knowledge and in such manner as to give effect to the main end designed to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>322 Mass. 149, 152 (1947), quoting <em>Dittemore </em>v. <em>Dickey, </em>249 Mass. 95, 104 (1924). Accord <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Cameron &amp; Colby Co., </em>397 Mass. 320, 321-322 (1986); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 202 (1) (1979) (\u201cif the principal purpose of the parties is ascertainable it is given great weight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The main purpose of the policy\u2019s arbitration provision was to provide \u201cbinding advance consent to arbitrate at the election of either party any dispute which the parties were unable to settle\u201d by agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Glenn Acres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cliffwood Corp., </em>353 Mass. 150, 154 (1967). Hence, Burbank could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>compelled payment by legal redress until he had first sought arbitration. See <em>id. </em>at 154 (where agreement to arbitrate is stated in general terms, clause \u201cshould be construed as broadly as the parties obviously intended\u201d); <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Northborough, </em>416 Mass. 252, 256 (1993) (\u201c[ujnless there is positive assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute ... an order to arbitrate should not be denied\u201d); <em>Rae F. Gill, P.C. </em>v. <em>DiGiovanni, </em>34 Mass. App. 498, 502 (1993) (defendant\u2019s interpretation of arbitration clause as non-compulsory \u201crenders it meaningless\u201d). See also A.L. Corbin, 3A Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 747 (1952). It follows that Burbank\u2019s cause of action accrued under G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 2, when Berkshire refused to submit to arbitration. It was at that point that the six-year limitations period began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Our conclusion that (absent a contrary statute or contract provision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) the statute of limitations for commencing an action for underinsured or uninsured motorist benefits begins to run when the insurer violates the insurance contract comports with the majority of other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Spear </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>2 Cal. 4th 1035, 1044 (1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>(cause of action accrues when one party refuses to arbitrate).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Treatises have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., J.A. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, 8D Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 5135.35 (\u201cA cause of action to enforce an agreement to arbitrate does not arise until such time as arbitration is refused\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are two minority views in other jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tians which, for the reasons discussed, we reject.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Berkshire relies on <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Co., </em>30 Conn. App. 803, 807-809 (1993), aff'd, 228 Conn. 436 (1994), a case factually similar to this one and involving a similar arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 804. In <em>Wynn, </em>as in this case, the relevant limitations period was six years and the insured settled with the tortfeasor more than six years before requesting the insurer to submit to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The <em>Wynn </em>court stated that \u201c[t]he true test [for determining when an action accrues] is to establish the time when the plaintiff first could have successfully maintained an action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 808. The court then stated that the insured\u2019s cause of action accrued, at the latest, when she settled with the tortfeasor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Implicit in that conclusion is the premise that the insured in <em>Wynn </em>could have successfully maintained an action against her insurer before the insurer had in any way violated the insurance contract. Burbank, however, could not have maintained an action prior to Berkshire\u2019s refusal to arbitrate. <em>Wynn, </em>therefore, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We also reject Berkshire\u2019s claim that our decision gives the insured undue power \u201cby merely delaying demand, to let a claim go stale and yet keep it enforceable.\u201d Corbin, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 643. An insurer can avoid delay by itself compelling arbitration. Moreover, an insurer may deny underinsured motorist coverage if it proves that it was prejudiced by late notice. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co., </em>419 Mass. 138, 141 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of an order declaring that the statute of limitations period began to run at the time Berkshire refused to arbitrate Burbank\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The judge failed, however, to \u201cmake [a] binding declaration[] of right, duty, status [or] other legal relation.\u201d G.
