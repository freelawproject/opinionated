(Purity). The plaintiffs brought common law claims for negligence, assault and battery, false imprisonment, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium. The plaintiffs also brought statutory claims under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C (1994 ed.), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1994 ed.) (civil rights act), the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, (1994 ed.) (equal rights act), and the Consumer Protection Act, G. L. c. 93A (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">In an initial decision, the trial judge granted summary judgment to the defendants on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims except for the false imprisonment claim and the loss of consortium claims accompanying it. The judge ruled that the common law claims were barred by the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24 (1994 ed.). She also decided that all the statutory claims, with the exception of the claim under G. L. c. 93 A, were barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Massachusetts antidiscrimination law, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9 (1994 ed). See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 586 (1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a second decision, the judge granted summary judgment to the defendants on the false imprisonment claim on the rationale that Purity was not vicariously liable for the actions of its employee. The plaintiffs appealed from these judgments. We granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review and now affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The summary judgment record demonstrates the following (see <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Essex Agric. &amp; Technical Inst., </em>418 Mass. 159, 162 [1994]): Jane Doe was working at one of Purity\u2019s stores on the night of November 18, 1990, when another employee, designated by the parties as the assistant store manager, visited the store.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The assistant store manager, who was not scheduled to work, sent home every employee but Doe. While Doe and the assistant store manager were working in the manager\u2019s office, the assistant store manager sexually assaulted and raped Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Prior to this incident, Purity had disciplined the assistant store manager several times for sexual harassment. Moreover, several Purity employees had complained of the assistant store manager\u2019s inappropriate conduct. Purity subsequently terminated the assistant store manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">1. <em>Workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. </em>The judge\u2019s decision that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligence, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress were barred by the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">First, it is clear that physical and emotional injuries resulting from rape and other forms of sexual assault are compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation act. Except for certain exceptions not applicable here, intentional torts are covered by the workers\u2019 compensation act, even when they are committed by coemployees. <em>Anzalone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>403 Mass. 119, 124 (1988). Therefore, injuries resulting from physical assaults by one employee on another are compensable. <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102, 106-107 (1949). The workers\u2019 compensation act allows employees to recover for emotional injuries which are shown to have arisen out of and in the course of employment. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 548-550 (1980) <em>(Foley I). See Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14 (1979). Finally, as we conclude today in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., ante </em>551 (1996), the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act also precludes an action against an employer for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of sexual harassment in the workplace. Under these principles, it follows that the injuries resulting from a rape or other sexual assault are \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d within the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation act and any tort claims seeking to recover against the employer for these injuries are barred by the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24 (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The plaintiffs ask us to create an exception to this general rule, on the ground that sexual assault is not a \u201cnormal risk\u201d of employment. See Korn, The Fungible Woman and Other Myths of Sexual Harassment, 67 Tul. L. Rev. 1363, 1384-1389 (1993). The plaintiffs misconstrue the focus of our inquiry. In determining whether the workers\u2019 compensation act bars common law claims, we look at the nature of the claims, not the source of the injuries. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. 82, 93 (1987) <em>(Foley II). </em>\u201c[The injury] need not arise out of the nature of the employment. An injury arises out of the employment if it arises out of the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment; in other words, out of the employment looked at in any of its aspects.\u201d <em>Caswell\"s Case, 305 </em>Mass. 500, 502 (1940). See <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 334 (1944). Here, the assistant store manager is alleged to have raped an employee during work hours on the employer\u2019s premises. The plaintiffs do not allege that the two individuals were connected in any way except through their employment. The injuries arose out of the employment within the meaning of the statute. Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 common law claims based on them are barred when it is only on this premise that Purity can plausibly be made a defendant here at all. See <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc., </em>57 F.3d 21, 29 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The plaintiffs also argue that public policy requires an exception from workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity for cases of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. In so arguing, the plaintiffs ignore the fact that the Legislature has provided employees with a separate remedy for sexual harassment in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, as we note today in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra, </em>and <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Low</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>inger, post </em>570 (1996). It is undisputed, however, that the plaintiffs in this case did not meet the procedural prerequisites for such a claim. We decline to fashion a common law exception to the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act where the Legislature has already created a statutory one.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We note that courts in other jurisdictions have also concluded that workers\u2019 compensation statutes bar recovery in tort for sexual assault and rape. See, e.g., <em>Tolbert </em>v. <em>Martin Marietta Corp., </em>759 P.2d 17 (Colo. 1988); <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Combined Ins. Co., </em>542 A.2d 363 (Me. 1988). The cases cited by the plaintiffs for the contrary proposition are inapposite. <em>Copithorne </em>v. <em>Framingham Union Hosp., </em>401 Mass. 860 (1988), involves the rape of a hospital employee by a visiting staff physician, while the physician was treating the employee for a back problem at her home. The court allowed the plaintiff employee to proceed against the hospital on a negligence theory. <em>Id </em>at 865. First, it is not clear that the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity defense was raised. Second, the plaintiff was not suing in her capacity as employee, but in her capacity as a patient. Third, the action did not arise out of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, and so the workers\u2019 compensation act did not apply. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (1994 ed.). See also <em>Choroszy </em>v. <em>Wentworth Inst. of Technology, </em>915 F. Supp. 446, 452 (D. Mass. 1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">2. <em>General Laws c. 151B exclusivity. </em>For the reasons set forth in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra, </em>we agree with the judge that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the civil rights act, equal rights act, and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, were barred by the exclusivity provision of G. L. c. 151B. See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., supra </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>3. <em>False imprisonment. </em>The judge correctly held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for false imprisonment (and accompanying loss of consortium claims) is not barred by the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act. See <em>Foley II, supra </em>at 93; <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 492 (1916). The defendants urge us to affirm the judge\u2019s conclusion that the employer is not liable because rape and sexual assault were not within the scope of the assistant store manager\u2019s employment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u201cAn employer may be held vicariously liable for the intentional tort of an agent if the tortious act or acts were committed within the scope of employment.\u201d <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. 393, 404 (1990). \u201c[C]onduct of an agent is within the scope of employment if it is of the kind he is employed to perform . . .; if it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits . . .; and if it is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer ...\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Wang Lab., Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986). Cf. <em>Kansallis Fin. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Fern, </em>421 Mass. 659, 664, 669 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Here, the assistant store manager\u2019s conduct, as alleged, was not motivated by a purpose to serve the employer. We agree with the judge: \u201c[Tjhere is no evidence that the defendants authorized or directed the [assistant store manager\u2019s] conduct or that his action was the kind of action that Purity Supreme employed him to perform.\u201d In a somewhat different context, this court concluded that an employee who sexually harassed a coemployee was not \u201cfurthering the interests of the employer.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 690 (1987). Similarly, rape and sexual assault of an employee do not serve the interests of the employer. Consequently, the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that would show that the assistant store manager was acting within the scope of employment. Therefore, the judge was correct in granting summary judgment for the defendants on the false imprisonment count.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>We therefore affirm the granting of summary judgment on all counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\">The judge also ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under G. L. c. 93A (19.94 ed.) failed as a matter of law. See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 15 (1983). See note 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the National Employment Lawyers Association, Massachusetts Chapter, and the Employment Law Center, on behalf of the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Since the assistant store manager is not a party to this action, the plaintiffs\u2019 common law claims against him are unaffected by the decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The cases that the plaintiffs and an amicus cite from other jurisdictions are not persuasive. In <em>Cremen </em>v. <em>Harrah\u2019s Marina Hotel Casino, </em>680 F. Supp. 150 (D.N.J. 1988), for example, the court concluded that an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim arising from a sexual assault was not barred by workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity under New Jersey law. In so finding, the court relied on an explicit exception for intentional acts of coemployees. Cf. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 550 (1980) (no exception for intentional infliction of emotional distress). Other cases involve the same or similar exceptions to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity which have been rejected in Massachusetts. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon, Co., ante </em>551, 561-562 n.15 (1996), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We also affirm the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 15 (1983) (employment disputes not cognizable under c. 93A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
