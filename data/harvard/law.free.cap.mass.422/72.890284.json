The defendant appealed from his convictions asserting, inter alla, that the judge\u2019s refusal to allow defense counsel access to the complaining witness\u2019s Department of Mental Retardation (DMR) records was error. We affirmed the convictions, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>413 Mass. 193 (1992), but, applying <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867 (1991),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> retroactively, remanded the case to the Superior Court to al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>low defense counsel to review the contested records and documents. The defendant moved for a new trial on the basis of information contained in the records. His motion for a new trial was denied by the same Superior Court judge who presided over the trial. The defendant now appeals from that denial, contending that the information contained within the DMR records warrants a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We remand this matter to the trial judge for an evidentiary hearing, after the defendant has had time to investigate the new material.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The relevant facts may be briefly summarized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaining witness, whom we shall call Sarah, in lieu of her real name, was a moderately retarded twenty-one year old woman at the time of the alleged crimes. She lived with her mother in Newton and attended Newton public schools. She was in her final year of a special needs program at Newton South High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Sarah was regularly transported home from school by a van owned and operated by a private company, Park Transportation. The defendant, known as \u201cTed,\u201d drove this van at least three times a week. Sarah was the last passenger to be dropped off in the afternoon and usually arrived home at approximately 4 p.m. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial, the alleged criminal events took place on a number of occasions when Sarah was a front-seat passenger in the van and, on one occasion, in Sarah\u2019s home when no one else was home. At trial, there was conflicting testimony presented whether Sarah ever sat in the front seat of the van and whether she ever returned home to an empty house. The defendant argued at trial that, because of her mental impairment, Sarah\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. A defense witness testified that Sarah told \u201csome really weird stories\u201d about meeting Wonder Woman and Superman and that Sarah \u201cwas serious; she really believed it happened.\u201d The prosecution presented fresh complaint testimony of four witnesses, testimony from Sarah\u2019s mother, and testimony from Sarah. This court concluded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra </em>at 198, that \u201c[t]he case turned on the credibility of Sarah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Prior to trial, the defendant moved that the court order the Department of Mental Health (DMH) (the motion was subsequently amended to refer to the DMR) to provide defense counsel with all its records concerning Sarah, including records of psychiatric or psychological evaluations or examinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge ordered that DMR records from 1985 until March 30, 1988, the date of the order, be delivered to the court for an \u201cin camera inspection by a Judge of the Superior Court.\u201d Three pages of records were delivered pursuant to that order. The judge reviewed these records and ruled that they were \u201cprivileged and/or confidential\u201d and did not contain admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The relevant records were resubpoenaed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after this court\u2019s decision in <em>Figueroa, supra </em>at 203, in which we held that \u201cwhere one of the charges is indecent assault and battery on a mentally retarded person, defense counsel must be entitled to review the records concerning the complaining witness\u2019s condition of retardation, to possibly cast doubt on the charge itself. Moreover, where the complaining witness is suffering from mental impairment, defense counsel must also be allowed to search the records for evidence of how that impairment might affect her capacity to perceive, remember and articulate the alleged events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">After reviewing these records, the defendant moved for a new trial, asserting that the records \u201cwould have lent crucial support to counsel\u2019s efforts to cast doubt on [Sarah\u2019s] credibility.\u201d The defendant principally relies on the following entry in a DMR record dated March 10, 1987, and entitled \u201cProgress Notes\u201d as support for his motion for a new trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u201cRoberta Lewonis relayed a phone call from [Sarah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mother] regarding suspected sexual abuse/inappropriate touching in her cab (school). I contacted Valerie Ardi of Newton Special Ed Dept who was aware of the complaint. She put me in touch with Valerie North . . . who is in charge of transportation. The following is the information that she related:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201c\u2014 [Sarah\u2019s mother] 1st contacted office in early January to relate [Sarah\u2019s] reluctance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201c\u2014 Valerie contacted driver, Paul, who agreed she ([Sarah]) appeared reluctant + volatile but gave no hint of anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201c\u2014 [Sarah\u2019s mother] said [Sarah] may have fantasized</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201c\u2014 [Sarah\u2019s mother] recontacted Valerie in late January relating suspicions regarding another driver, Ted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">\u201c\u2014 Ted was removed pending investigation (he has been very reliable driver)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">\u201c\u2014 Park Trans, manager interviewed (1) Ted - felt there was nothing suspicious, (2) interviewed [Sarah\u2019s] teacher (Tony P.) and kids - nothing conclusive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">\u201c\u2014 Ted is being monitored</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">\u201c\u2014 legal dept has formal notification</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">\u201c(My opinion: it is always difficult to discern the truth in these situations. Since so many people (incl. teacher + kids) were interviewed with no validation of incident (s), and the driver is being monitored, I think the situation is being handled appropriately).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">\u201cEleanor Sullivan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">\u201cMR Coordinator\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">Defense counsel contends that this record \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d that the family\u2019s suspicions initially focused on a driver other than the defendant or at least that the focus on the defendant was delayed. He argues that, although the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>concededly inadmissible multiple level hearsay, had he known of its existence, he could have used it to cross-examine the victim, her sisters, and her mother<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and could have investigated the matter further before trial and, perhaps, could have unearthed admissible evidence. Defense counsel argues that had he known of the above-quoted entry, he would have interviewed Valerie North and perhaps would have called North to testify. He further argues that had he known of Sarah\u2019s mother\u2019s alleged statement, he could have cross-examined Sarah\u2019s mother and other prosecution witnesses on Sarah\u2019s propensity and ability to fantasize about such matters. The defendant was not precluded at trial from arguing that Sarah may have fantasized the attack. He had both motive and opportunity to inquire into the possibility that Sarah may have fantasized.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The subject of Sarah\u2019s ability to fantasize was briefly discussed at trial. Sarah\u2019s therapist, when questioned about Sarah\u2019s ability to fantasize, opined that Sarah had limited ability to engage in play fantasy. Nothing precluded the defendant from questioning Sarah\u2019s therapist further or questioning any other witness about Sarah\u2019s ability to fantasize about painful personal events. As we discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>supra, </em>note 6, the defendant\u2019s argument that had he had access to the record, he could have more pointedly questioned Sarah\u2019s mother and used the record for impeachment is misplaced. A flat denial by Sarah\u2019s mother would leave the defendant in the same position now as before discovery of the record. Defense counsel has no additional admissible support for the contention that Sarah may have fantasized. Reliance on inadmissible hearsay statements is not sufficient foundation for a motion for a new trial. \u201c[T]he defendant must demonstrate an adequate factual basis for his claim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trung Chi Truong, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 675 (1993). The defendant must do more than allege that at a new trial he might be able to call a witness who might be able to offer relevant, admissible evidence. Before the statement is admissible for impeachment purposes, the defendant must satisfy the judge, through admissible evidence, that the statement \u201c[Sarah] may have fantasized\u201d can be attributed directly to Sarah\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">A defendant\u2019s constitutional rights do not require a new trial in all circumstances where he was denied access to potentially exculpatory psychiatric records. All that is required is that defense counsel be allowed access to such records and a defendant be afforded the opportunity to move for a new trial \u201cwhich motion shall be heard in camera and shall otherwise be governed by the usual principles that apply to new trial motions.\u201d <em>Figueroa, supra </em>at 195.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The decision to grant a motion for a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990). The decision of the motion judge is entitled to special deference if that judge also was the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 32-33 (1923), and cases therein cited. The decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a new trial motion also is within the sound discretion of the judge. Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 572 (1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 753 (1995). He or she must consider whether a substantial issue necessitating a hearing has been raised, looking to the seriousness of the claim presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s factual showing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trung Chi Truong, supra </em>at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The judge below exercised his discretion not to hold an evidentiary hearing. Ordinarily, we would not disturb that decision. We think, however, that our decision in the direct <em>Figueroa </em>appeal may not have been clear that prior to moving for a new trial the burden is on the defendant to investigate any new material to determine whether such material is admissible in evidence or could lead to admissible evidence sufficient to warrant a new trial. Because of the possibility of confusion, we conclude that we should remand for an evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On remand, the motion judge should employ the standard for newly discovered evidence. This is appropriate because the trial judge acted in accordance with the then-applicable law in denying defense counsel access to the DMR records. See <em>Figueroa, supra </em>at 202-203. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 734-735 (1992) (because defendant had no right to report prior to trial, the report is treated as newly discovered evidence). At the time of trial, the defendant had no constitutional right to access to the DMR records. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 269 (1986). Although our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, supra, </em>announced a new rule governing admissibility of otherwise privileged psychiatric records,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and was applied retroactively to this case, see <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>it does not alter the appropriateness of the judge\u2019s ruling when made. As the information contained within the DMR records was unknown to the defendant at the time of trial, it is properly regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>417 Mass. 60, 71 (1994) (\u201cFor purposes of this decision, we shall assume that newly \u2018available\u2019 evidence is like newly \u2018discovered\u2019 evidence and is subject to the same rules\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The appropriate standard for newly discovered evidence is whether \u201cthere is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 306 (1986). On remand, the defendant must establish that the evidence \u201ccasts real doubt on the justice of the conviction. . . . The evidence said to be new not only must be material and credible . . . but also must carry a measure of strength in support of the defendant\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 679-680 (1992), quoting <em>Grace, supra </em>at 305. The defendant hypothesizes that \u201cinvestigative efforts based on the information in the DMR record might have resulted in the introduction of other valuable information.\u201d This is insufficient to cast real doubt as to the justice of the conviction. We remand to the trial judge for an evidentiary hearing, before which the defendant must investigate the leads and at which he must produce such admissible evidence as he has obtained, subject to cross-examination by the Commonwealth to determine whether the new evidence meets the standards for a new trial. The denial of the motion for a new trial is reversed. This matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-15\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 884 (1991), held that under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, counsel for a criminal defendant is entitled to review a complainant\u2019s treatment records to search for evidence of bias, prejudice, or motive to lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The defendant does not here challenge the judge\u2019s denial of his motion as to the other records that had been withheld from defense counsel at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">For a fuller description of the facts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>413 Mass. 193 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The defendant also moved for an order requiring the Commonwealth to produce records from the Newton school department, the Charles River Workshop, Children\u2019s Hospital, and Kennedy Memorial Hospital for Children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Because the records previously ordered by the judge and reviewed in camera could not be located in the Superior Court criminal clerk\u2019s office, the records were resubpoenaed. The trial judge previously had reviewed only three pages of DMR records. One hundred thirty-five pages of records were received pursuant to the second subpoena and reviewed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. This discrepancy is not explained. It is thus uncertain whether the evidence the defendant relies on in support of his motion for a new trial previously was withheld as privileged by the judge or whether it is newly discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The defendant is incorrect in his assumption that if Sarah\u2019s mother denied having made the communication depicted in the record, defense counsel could have sought to introduce the record for impeachment purposes. Before the defendant could introduce the record as impeachment, he would need to prove that the mother made that statement. Even for the limited, nonsubstantive, purpose of impeachment, the record must be attributable to the witness before it may be used. <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 405 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauregard, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 983 (1988). Statements that Sarah\u2019s mother allegedly made to someone in Valerie North\u2019s office which North relayed to Eleanor Sullivan who recorded them almost two months after the fact cannot credibly be attributed to Sarah\u2019s mother. The statements are inadmissible, even for impeachment purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The defendant contends that he did not pursue this line of inquiry because the Commonwealth indicated, in response to the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion for exculpatory evidence \u2014 prior complaint(s) of rape or sexual abuse by alleged victim,\u201d that there were no known prior complaints. This argument is wholly without merit. We note first that defense counsel still does not contend that there have been any prior false complaints of rape or sexual abuse made by Sarah. The Commonwealth could answer the defendant\u2019s motion in the same way today. Second, that Sarah had not made any prior false complaints does not foreclose defense counsel from pursuing the issue whether she had ever fantasized about sexual matters. The defendant\u2019s attempt to equate prior false complaint of rape known to the prosecutor with a fantasy about sexual abuse is unconvincing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The \u201cusual principles\u201d are that a judge \u201cmay grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). \u201cNew trials should not be granted except for substantial reasons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 406 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The ruling in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, supra, </em>represented a departure from previous Massachusetts law and from the Federal law regarding a defendant\u2019s right to access privileged psychiatric records of the complaining witness in a sexual assault case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 269 (1986). See also <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39 (1987). <em>Post-Stockhammer, </em>this court has recognized the importance of confidentiality between survivors of sexual assault and counsellors and has held that defense counsel does not have an unqualified right of access to the survivor\u2019s privileged records. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993). <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 181-183, resurrected in camera review to determine whether records are relevant and held that defense counsel has a right to view only relevant records. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 683 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">As discussed <em>supra </em>at note 5, the evidence may indeed be newly discovered rather than newly available.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
