G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1994 ed.). The defendant asserts that this matter is not within S.J.C. Rule 2:21, 421 Mass. 1303 (1995), because the plaintiff is not seeking interlocutory relief from a ruling of a trial court. We agree with the defendant that rule 2:21 is inapplicable. Although the appeal is not within rule 2:21, we have considered this appeal and conclude that it is without merit. The plaintiff brought her complaint in the Brookline District Court in Norfolk County. That court is in the Appellate Division, Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>District. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 108 (1994 ed.). There was no error of law or abuse of discretion in denying the request for transfer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b900-7\"><em>Despina Kyriakidis </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b900-8\"><em>Maria Rosenthal, </em>pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
