L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 71H-71S (1994 ed.), as a bar to recovery for a skiing injury. In this case, we are asked to consider whether ice conditions on a chairlift offloading ramp are a risk inherent in the sport of skiing and recovery for injury caused thereby is also barred by G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 71H-71S.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">Amy Beth Saldarini, a minor, was injured in a collision with an unidentified skier while alighting from a chairlift at the defendant\u2019s ski resort. Amy and her parents brought suit in the Superior Court for Worcester County against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>fendant, Wachusett, alleging that ice conditions on the chairlift offloading ramp caused the collision between the unidentified skier and Amy, and that the defendant was negligent in allowing the offloading ramp to become icy and in failing to warn skiers of the ice conditions. Wachusett moved for summary judgment, relying on G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 71N and 71O. The Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that pursuant to \u00a7 71O Amy had assumed the risk of ice conditions as a matter of law and was, therefore, barred from recovering for her injuries. Relying on its decision in <em>McHerron </em>v. <em>Jiminy Peak, Inc., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 593 (1995), the Appeals Court reversed. See <em>Saldarini </em>v. <em>Wachusett Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (1995) . We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review and now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">General Laws c. 143, \u00a7 71O, expressly provides that \u201c[a] skier shall be presumed to know of the existence of certain unavoidable risks inherent in the sport of skiing, which shall include, but not be limited to . . . ice conditions . . . and shall assume the risk of injury or loss caused by such inherent risks.\u201d We have today concluded that recoveiy is barred as a matter of law for injury resulting from a risk specifically enumerated in \u00a7 71O as an unavoidable risk inherent in the sport of skiing. See <em>McHerron </em>v. <em>Jiminy Peak, Inc., ante </em>678 (1996) . Ice on the ski area is such a risk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[N]o reasonable mind could fail to immediately conclude that ice is a necessary and obvious danger of skiing .... No improvements in grooming technique have been able to eliminate ice from the New England ski slopes, however, often described as \u2018frozen granular\u2019 and \u2018eastern hardpack.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Snowridge, Inc., </em>818 F. Supp. 80, 83 (D. Vt. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Tilley </em>v. <em>Brodie Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>412 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1992), is misplaced. <em>Tilley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>involved a ski area operator\u2019s respondeat superior liability for a collision between an agent of the ski area operator and a patron. In <em>Tilley, </em>the agent had a duty to avoid the collision and was liable for any resulting injury. See G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 71O (\u201cthe responsibility for collisions by any skier with any other skier or person shall be solely that \u00f3f the skier or person involved and not that of the [ski area] operator\u201d). We held that the liability could be shifted to the ski area operator as the agent\u2019s employer. In this case, there is no allegation that the unidentified woman who collided with Amy was an employee of Wachusett so there can be no respondeat superior liability for her negligence in causing the collision. <em>Tilley </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The defendant had no duty to ameliorate ice conditions on the chairlift offloading ramp. Therefore, there can be no recovery. The Superior Court\u2019s allowance of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Wachusett has any greater responsibility for ice conditions on or near a chairlift offloading ramp than on any other part of the ski area as defined by the statute. Ski area is defined to include \u201call of the slopes and trails under the control of the ski area operator, including cross-country ski areas, slopes or trails, and any recreational tramway in operation on any such slopes or trails . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 71I. As we acknowledged in <em>McHerron </em>v. <em>Jiminy Peak, Inc., ante </em>678, 680-681 (1996), the statute makes no distinction between portions of the ski area for purposes of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
