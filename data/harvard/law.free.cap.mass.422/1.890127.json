Morrissey, stands charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and being a disorderly person. On the defendant\u2019s motion, the District Court judge suppressed all evidence obtained as a result of the stop and detention of the defendant, because the stop was conducted by a police officer acting outside his territorial jurisdiction. The Appeals Court affirmed in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to Appeals Court Rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (1994). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. The Commonwealth asserts that the Appeals Court erred in concluding that \u201cthis case is governed in all material respects by the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grise, </em>398 Mass. 247 (1986).\u201d For the reasons stated in this opinion, we agree with the Commonwealth and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>In the early morning hours of May 29, 1992, Officer Jeffrey Stillings was the officer in charge of the West Boylston police department. At that department\u2019s request, Officer Scott McArthur of the town of Sterling police department went to West Boylston to render assistance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">On the way back to Sterling,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McArthur observed a Buick automobile run a stop sign then veer to the right of the road and narrowly miss a telephone pole. The car quickly corrected, crossed the double solid line separating north and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>south bound traffic, then corrected again and, swerving back to the extreme right, nearly hitting the guard rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">McArthur reported his observations to Stillings on the police radio. Stillings asked McArthur to stop the vehicle. McArthur did so within the West Boylston town limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">McArthur approached the vehicle, which was being operated by the defendant. McArthur asked the defendant to produce an operator\u2019s license, and directed him to get out of the car. At that point, Officer Stillings arrived and \u201cassumed control of the investigation.\u201d Stillings had the defendant perform certain field sobriety tests, formed the opinion that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol, and placed him under arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Relying on <em>Grise, supra, </em>the defendant argues that Officer McArthur\u2019s stop of the defendant was unlawful because it occurred outside McArthur\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, and that the evidence of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor thereby obtained should be suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>407 Mass. 70, 75 (1990). We do not agree. We conclude that this case is not governed by <em>Grise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">In <em>Grise, </em>two Ludlow police officers, while traveling through the city of Springfield, observed a vehicle ignore a red light and weave back and forth between lanes. \u201cBelieving that the defendant may have been operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor, [one of the Ludlow officers] put on the overhead blue lights of the police cruiser and stopped the defendant\u2019s car within the Springfield city limits. Based upon his observations of the defendant, [the officer] arrested him for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor. He placed the defendant in the Ludlow police cruiser, and called the Springfield police for assistance. Springfield police officers transported the defendant to the Springfield police department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. We concluded in <em>Grise </em>that the arrest was unlawful because it occurred outside the arresting officer\u2019s jurisdiction, and that evidence which would not have been obtained but for the arrest should be suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 253. Here, McArthur stopped the defendant at the request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>a police officer whose jurisdiction included the place where the stop occurred. We think that a critical distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Police officers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cmay require suitable aid in the execution of their office in a criminal case, in the preservation of the peace, [or] in the apprehending or securing of a person for a breach of the peace.\u201d G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13 (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 24 (1994 ed.), provides: \u201cWhoever, being required in the name of the commonwealth by a sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable, police officer or watchman, neglects or refuses to assist him in the execution of his office in a criminal case, in the preservation of the peace or in the apprehension or securing of a person for a breach of the peace . . . shall be punished by a fine of not more than fifty dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one month.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Stillings thus had statutory authority to request the assistance of Officer McArthur, and, had he refused, McArthur might have been subject to a criminal penalty. A detention \u201cby the aid or assistant, [in] such circumstances, would be, to all intents and purposes, as valid as if the same had been made by the [local police officer\u2019s] proper hand; \u2014 and . . . the aid or assistant would be under the same protection of the law as the [local police officer] himself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Field, </em>13 Mass. 321, 322, 324 (1816) (holding that the quoted language was a proper jury instruction). Accord <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>158 Va. 897, 902 (1932) (\u201cWhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>one is called to assist an officer he, during the time that duty rests upon him, is justified in doing whatever the officer himself might lawfully do\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 139 (1965).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 21 (1994 ed.), authorizes a police officer to arrest a person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor even if the offense was not committed in the arresting officer\u2019s presence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGeronimo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 722 n.9 (1995). <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Southbridge, </em>679 F. Supp. 131, 133 (D. Mass. 1988). Having received McArthur\u2019s radio report, Officer Stillings had reason to believe that the crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was being committed in Stillings\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. Therefore, Stillings was authorized to stop the defendant to make an investigative inquiry. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 599 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 140 (1990). That authority was transferred to McArthur through Stillings\u2019s request for assistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Field, supra; Byrd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra; </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 139 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The defendant argues that Stillings\u2019s request for assistance constituted a \u201cseizure\u201d of McArthur\u2019s person, violating McArthur\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. We do not consider the defendant\u2019s arguments because he lacks standing to assert McArthur\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>406 Mass. 425, 428 (1990) (\u201cwe hold that the defendants may not successfully advance the unlawfulness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>[a third party\u2019s] arrest as the sole ground for invalidating\u201d the search of the defendants\u2019 apartment which was a \u201cfruit\u201d of that arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In sum, Officer Stillings had statutory authority to request the assistance of any private person \u201cin the apprehending or securing of a person for a breach of the peace.\u201d G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13. Therefore, his request to Officer McArthur gave McArthur the authority to stop the defendant\u2019s automobile. The order of the District Court judge suppressing evidence taken as a result of the stop of the defendant\u2019s automobile by McArthur is vacated, and this matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-10\">Officer Scott McArthur had not been sworn in as a special officer of the West Boylston police force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grise, </em>398 Mass. 247, 252 n.6 (1986). West Boylston and Sterling did not have a mutual aid agreement. See G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 8G <em>(1994 </em>ed.); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCrohan, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 282 (1993). General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 99 (1994 ed.), is inapplicable on the record before us because the request for McArthur\u2019s aid was not made through McArthur\u2019s commanding officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b22-11\">The transcript of the hearing on the motion to suppress indicates that McArthur was wearing a town of Sterling police uniform and was driving a marked police cruiser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b23-9\">The transcript of the hearing on the motion to suppress reveals that there were two passengers in the vehicle. After Stillings arrived, McArthur stayed with the passengers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b24-7\">General Laws c. 37, \u00a7 13 (1994 ed.), applies by its terms to sheriffs. It applies to constables by virtue of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 94 (1994 ed.), which provides that constables \u201cshall have the powers of sheriffs to require aid in the execution of their duties,\u201d and to police officers by virtue of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98 (1994 ed.), which provides that \u201cpolice officers of all cities and towns shall have all the powers and duties of constables except serving and executing civil process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b24-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument from G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 24 (1994 ed.), was raised for the first time on appeal. Although we sometimes exercise our discretion and consider an issue first raised on appeal where \u201cthe questions presented are of some public importance and the result we reach is not changed by our consideration of them,\u201d <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 63 (1983), it is rare for us to consider an argument for reversal of a lower court which is first raised on appeal and is dispositive in favor of the party belatedly raising the issue. We consider the argument because we do not agree with the legal conclusion reached by the judge and the possible ramifications of that ruling on the public interest \u201cin reducing the incidence of drunk driving . . . consistent with the important interest of individuals in being free from unreasonable intrusion on their personal security.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 143 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The Restatement provides that a private actor is not civilly liable and \u201cis privileged to rely upon the officer\u2019s request and assist him unless the facts are such that the actor knows . . . that the officer is not himself privileged to make the arrest.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 139 comment d (1965). Accord R.M. Perkins &amp; R.N. Boyce, Criminal Law 1103 (3d ed. 1982) (private person \u201cis not entitled to delay while he conducts an inquiry into the officer\u2019s actual authority in the particular case, he is protected even if the latter is actually exceeding his authority so long as the assister does not know or have reason to know of the lack of authority\u201d). Cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>293 Mass. 9, 13 (1935) (where defendant failed to argue that he was privileged under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 24, it was \u201cnot necessary to decide ... to what extent, if any, under the statute or at common law a person complying with such a request may be relieved from the consequences of his negligent or grossly negligent conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
