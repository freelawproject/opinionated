He received a life sentence on the murder conviction and two concurrent terms of from eighteen to twenty years for the armed assaults convictions, to run from and after the life sentence for the murder convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he claims error in the trial judge\u2019s instruction on malice, the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on lack of criminal responsibility (commonly referred to as the \u201cinsanity defense\u201d), and the judge\u2019s allowance in evidence of certain statements made by the defendant while at the police station. We decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1994 ed.), to enter a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt on the murder conviction or order a new trial. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We recite the evidence presented to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252 (1993). Pamela Watkins knew the defendant as a teenager and met him again years later in 1987. They began dating and, in 1989, he moved into the home she shared with her daughter Kimberly at 150 Arlington Street in West Medford. In March, 1991, the defendant\u2019s fourteen year old daughter, Nekeya Gomez, moved in with them. Pamela worked full time as a systems analyst and was taking a computer class in the evenings. Her daughter Kimberly was ten years old. The defendant worked for a construction company. In September, 1991, Pamela told the defendant that their relationship was not working. She asked him to leave the apartment by January 1, 1992. In January, the defendant admitted to Pamela that, although he had left the house every morning as if he were going to work, he had in fact not worked since October and was afraid to tell her. He said he could not afford to rent another apartment, and Pamela agreed to allow the defendant and his daughter Nekeya to stay in the apartment rent free until February 1, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On January 27, 1992, Pamela returned from work to find the defendant upset about having to leave the apartment. He told her that her family was going to be sorry if she made him leave. Pamela went to her class and returned home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>around 8 p.m. The defendant was there. Again, the defendant began arguing with her. In the course of the argument, he overturned the dining room table. He refused to allow her to speak privately on the telephone with Kimberly\u2019s father, remaining on an extension line. Pamela called her own father, again with the defendant on the extension, and her father said he would call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Two Medford police officers arrived at the house around 9:10 p.m. The defendant was watching television. He was calm and responded to the officers\u2019 questions intelligently, but appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. He told the officers he had had two beers. He agreed to leave the house on Friday but said he would return on Sunday. When Pamela told him he could return on Sunday only to retrieve his belongings and could not stay, the defendant lowered his head and said, \u201cSomething bad is going to happen.\u201d He then said to Pamela, \u201cWhen the police leave, I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d The police then took the defendant into protective custody. He responded, \u201cFine. Just arrest me.\u201d Although he smelled of alcohol, the defendant was calm, engaged in conversation with the officers, and responded appropriately to booking questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The police assisted Pamela in obtaining an emergency protective order under G. L. c. 209A (1994 ed.). She then returned to the apartment and put the defendant\u2019s belongings in green plastic bags on the front porch as had been arranged with the police. She put Kimberly and Nekeya to bed on the second floor, made sure all the doors and windows were locked, turned out the lights on the front porch, and went to bed on the third floor at 12:45 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">At about 1:30 a.m., the police released the defendant from protective custody. He was sober, calm, and cooperative. Two officers drove him to 150 Arlington Street to retrieve his belongings from the porch. The officers told the defendant not to return to the house and watched as the defendant put the bags in the back seat of his automobile. The officers followed the defendant\u2019s automobile for about two miles until he was \u201con his way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The defendant \u201cdrove around\u201d for about ten or twenty minutes, then went to his sister\u2019s house where he stayed only a few minutes. He stated that he \u201cwanted to talk to her but she didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d He left his sister\u2019s house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>drove back to Medford, feeling rejected by his former boss and by Pamela, and not wanting to go to court the following morning to respond to the protective order. He parked his automobile on a different street \u201cso the police would not see it parked in front of Arlington Street,\u201d and walked through two back yards to reach the back door of Pamela\u2019s apartment, \u201cso the neighbors would not see me.\u201d He kicked in the back door, concealed a gun in the waist of his trousers, and went to the third-floor bedroom. Pamela awoke to the sound of the back door being kicked in and the defendant running up the stairs. She tried to use the telephone while she used her body to clos\u00e9 the bedroom door. The defendant shot through the door. He continued repeatedly to shoot Pamela from three or four feet away, saying, \u201cDie, bitch, die.\u201d He then said, \u201cWatch this,\u201d and put the gun to his head. Pamela looked away, and when she turned again, he was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The defendant went to the second floor after leaving Pamela\u2019s bedroom. The two girls were awake in the same bed. The defendant shot at them, wounding his daughter, Nekeya, and killing Pamela\u2019s daughter, Kimberly, with a gunshot to the head. He then tried to kill himself, but there were no bullets left in the gun.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He left the house, got into his automobile, and drove away. While driving, he looked for more ammunition in order to kill himself. He claimed he had difficulty because the traffic lights were all green. He stated to police that he knew he was shooting at his daughter, and that he shot at her because he did not want her to be a burden to anyone. He shot at Kimberly \u201cbecause she was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">At 2:50 a.m., the Medford police were ticketing a motor vehicle on Arlington Street when they saw the defendant\u2019s yellow automobile drive slowly past them. The police turned the cruiser around to pursue the defendant, but when they reached an intersection, they could not locate his vehicle. Simultaneously, the officers received a radio call from Med-ford police headquarters concerning the shooting at 150 Arlington Street. The police responded, and Nekeya answered the door, covered in blood. The police saw Kimberly on the sofabed, the upper part of her body off the bed. She was dead. They then went to the third floor where they saw Pamela Watkins, conscious but covered in blood. She told them that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the defendant had shot her and was probably going to his sister\u2019s house.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">At about 3 a.m., two Boston police officers arrested the defendant near his sister\u2019s house. He had, in the waistband of his trousers, a nine millimeter Stallard Arms semi-automatic handgun. He held ammunition in his hand. He was sober, stable, and cooperative. When the defendant saw Lieutenant Robert Longo of the Medford police at the Boston police station at around 4:15 a.m., he said to him, \u201c[Lieutenant], can I talk to you? I think I screwed up.\u201d The officer responded that he would talk with him later. The defendant was not booked until 4:50 a.m., when the Medford, Boston, and State police were all available. He was not questioned prior to booking. He received Miranda warnings, see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), and was informed of his right to make a telephone call, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A (1994 ed.). After booking, at 5:30 a.m., the defendant agreed to talk with police. He voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and gave the police a full statement, admitting that he shot Pamela, Kimberly, and Nekeya. He stated that he bought the gun several months before the shooting to kill himself, that he felt \u201churt and rejected by everybody,\u201d that he felt \u201cmistreated and shamed\u201d by his boss, and that \u201cthe shots [he] fired tonight should have been for them because of the way they treated [him] in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">1. At the close of the evidence, the defendant requested and was denied a jury instruction regarding lack of criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such an instruction must be given if requested and supported by the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238, 244 (1977). Expert testimony is not required to raise the issue,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but rather it may be raised by \u201cthe admission of any evidence which, if believed, might create a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility at the time of the killings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246-247. Lack of criminal responsibility in this Commonwealth requires the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>a mental disease or defect, which causes a defendant\u2019s lack of substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). Where there is evidence to raise the issue, the Commonwealth bears the burden to prove the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The judge properly refused to instruct the jury on the issue of criminal responsibility. Nevertheless, the defendant points to the following evidence to support his contention that he lacked criminal responsibility at the time of the crime. Pamela Watkins testified that her prior relationship with the defendant was not marked by violence and that on the day of the killing he appeared to be a different person from the one she had known.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Also, the defendant argues that his behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>was an illogical response to the issuance of a protective order, especially since he should have realized he would be the primary suspect in the crimes. Finally, the defendant claims, the evidence showed he was suicidal and had engaged in a \u201cbizarre, illogical, and crazy\u201d pattern of behavior. This evidence, the defendant claims, raised the issue of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">None of these facts, if believed by the jury, alone or in combination with the others, implicates a lack of criminal responsibility at the time of the crimes. There is no evidence that the defendant suffered from a prior mental illness or was hospitalized. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPlante, </em>416 Mass. 433, 443 n.13 (1993), and cases cited. Suicidal ideation, absent more, is an insufficient basis for a finding of lack of criminal responsibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McInerney, </em>373 Mass. 136, 152 (1977). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>400 Mass. 626, 630-631 (1987) (suicidal attitude, combined with failure to remember stabbing the victim, telling arresting officer to shoot him, and walking into on-coming traffic sufficient to warrant jury charge). The bizarre or inexplicable nature of a crime alone does not provide a foundation for an insanity defense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPlante, supra </em>at 443-444.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>377 Mass. 638, 644 (1979). The record reveals that the defendant was calm and lucid both before and after the crimes. He understood and responded appropriately to the officers\u2019 questions at the house prior to being placed in protective custody, during protective custody, while being taken to the apartment to retrieve his belongings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>shortly before the crimes, and when arrested. That he understood the wrongfulness of his actions is demonstrated by the fact 'that he parked his vehicle around the comer so it would not be seen by police. He entered through the back of the house so as not to be seen by neighbors. He stated that he shot at his daughter because he did not want her to be a burden to anyone, and shot Kimberly Watkins \u201cbecause she was there.\u201d He fully recalled the details of the crime and made a complete and coherent statement to the police. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mills, supra </em>at 630 (defendant had no memory of stabbing victim); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238, 246 (1977) (defendant did not remember crime and felt like he was \u201cfloating\u201d and \u201challucinating\u201d). There is simply no evidence of lack of criminal responsibility in this case. There was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">2. The defendant contends that the judge\u2019s instmction on malice unconstitutionally diluted the standard of proof required for a conviction of murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Malice as an element of murder may be proved by evidence establishing any one of three facts beyond a reasonable doubt: The defendant, acting without justification or legal excuse, must (1) intend to kill the victim, (2) intend to cause grievous bodily harm,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or (3) act such that in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>that, according to common experience, there is a plain and strong likelihood that death will follow the contemplated act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The judge began his charge with the proper instruction on the three prongs of malice as outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, supra. </em>In addition to the standard, approved <em>Grey </em>charge, however, the judge instructed that \u201c[i]f the circumstances attending [the] killing disclose that the death follows from a purposeful, selfish, wrongful motive as distinguished from the frailty of human nature, then there can be malice aforethought.\u201d We have since cautioned against the use of this language. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 487 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, supra, </em>we acknowledged that the above language might lead a jury to believe that a selfish, wrongful mood might be enough to show malice. Rather, we stated, malice should be defined \u201cby reference to the three prongs described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, supra, </em>with such additional explanation as may be appropriate to the understanding of those concepts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude here, nonetheless, that in the context of the judge\u2019s entire charge, the above-quoted language did not create reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In determining the propriety of a jury instruction on appeal,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we consider the instruction \u201cin the context in which it was delivered, in order that we might determine its probable effect on the jury\u2019s understanding of their function\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adrey, </em>397 Mass. 751, 753-754 (1986). The judge clearly and properly laid out the <em>Grey </em>charge. He repeatedly stressed that the Commonwealth carried the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crimes charged. Further, the judge instructed that the jury could consider the effect of intoxication or mental impairment on the defendant\u2019s ability to form a specific intent to kill. The jury were properly instructed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the three prongs of malice. In the context of the over-all charge, the extraneous language, although disapproved, did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">3. The defendant claims it was error for the judge to deny his motion to suppress a statement that he made after his arrest but before he was booked and advised of his right to make a telephone call pursuant, to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A. The defendant\u2019s booking was delayed until the arresting officers, the Medford police, and the State police were all present almost two hours after the defendant was arrested. During that time, the defendant remained handcuffed to a wall and was not questioned. When he saw Lieutenant Longo, the defendant asked him, \u201c[Lieutenant], can I talk to you? I think I screwed up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Unfavorable evidence gained as a result of an intentional deprivation of a defendant\u2019s right to make a telephone call pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A, should be suppressed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 497, 502-503 (1972). That statute provides that \u201c[t]he police official in charge of the station . . . shall permit the use of the telephone, at the expense of the arrested person, for the purpose of allowing the arrested person to communicate with his family or friends, or to arrange for release on bail, or to engage the services of an attorney.\u201d The police are to inform the arrested person of the right \u201cforthwith upon his arrival\u201d at the station, and \u201csuch use shall be permitted within one hour thereafter.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A. Suppressing evidence obtained as a result of an intentional violation of the statute is intended to make the legislation effective in the absence of an express penalty for a violation. <em>We </em>have not extended the policy to unintentional deprivations by the police. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>402 Mass. 333, 341 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 353 (1992), and 420 Mass. 242 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 266 (1982). The delay here was not designed to gain inculpatory information but to allow the officers involved to be present at booking. The defendant was not questioned during that time but simply made to wait for the officers\u2019 arrival. The judge found, after hearing, that there was no intentional delay. His finding is warranted by the evidence. The judge did not err in refusing to suppress the defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">4. The defendant did not ask this court for relief pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Nonetheless, we have reviewed the entire record, and conclude that the interests of justice do not require a reduction in the murder verdict or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The grand jury also returned three indictments charging armed assault in a dwelling, one indictment charging possession of a firearm, one indictment charging possession of ammunition, and one charging violation of a protective order. The Commonwealth chose not to proceed to trial on these indictments, and on November 12, 1992, they were nolle pressed. On two other indictments for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the jury found the defendant guilty. With the defendant\u2019s consent, these convictions were placed on file. Hence, they are not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The defendant did not testify and presented no witnesses in his defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">A ballistician testified at trial that four cartridge casings were recovered on the third floor and four cartridge casings on the second floor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Pamela was hospitalized for over three months recovering from gunshot wounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The judge properly instructed the jury they could consider any mental impairment when determining whether the defendant deliberately premeditated or was able to form the specific intent to kill with malice.

The proposition for which it stands, i.e., that the bizarre nature of a crime is not, in itself, a sufficient basis for charging a jury on lack of criminal responsibility, is not a new development in our law. Although we suggested in past cases that the facts of a crime themselves may \u201ccreate an inference of mental disease or defect,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238, 245 (1977), quoting <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 765 (1977), we noted two years later, well before the defendant\u2019s trial, that we were unaware of \u201cany case where the inexplicableness of a crime alone raises a jury issue of insanity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>377 Mass. 638, 644 (1979). Again, in 1990, we stated \u201c[t]hat the crimes were heinous would not alone support a conclusion that they were the product of an insane mind.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>407 Mass. 279, 286 (1990). Further, the manner in which the defendant committed the crimes is not so bizarre as to, in itself, suggest insanity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The judge instructed the jury that \u201c[mjalice aforethought includes any unexcused specific intent to kill or unexcused specific intent to do grievous bodily harm, or unexcused intent to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death will follow. If in the circumstances known to the defendant a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act, malice may be inferred without any actual intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. Malice aforethought refers to a frame of mind which includes not only anger, hatred and revenge, but also every other unlawful and unjustifiable motive. It is an intent to inflict grievous bodily injury or harm without legal justification. Whether a killing is actually committed with malice aforethought is determined from the nature and the quality of the act which attends the killing. If the circumstances attending a killing disclose that death flows from a purposeful, selfish, wrongful motive, as distinguished from the frailty of human nature, then there can be malice aforethought . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The defendant argues, for the first time on appeal and in a footnote in his brief, that \u201cthe charge \u2018It is an intent to inflict grievous bodily <em>injury or </em>harm\u2019 is at best ambiguous\u201d (emphasis added).
