He raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">1. Whether Kingman\u2019s motion to change venue should have been granted on the basis of \u201cpresumed prejudice\u201d resulting from pretrial publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">2. Whether Kingman\u2019s right of dignity under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s arguments during sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">We affirm as to both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u00b62 Kingman and his friend, Ryan Dibert, went out drinking at a number of Bozeman bars the evening and early morning hours of September 16 and 17, 2008. Their last stop was the Scoop Bar. When they left the Scoop, at around 1:15 a.m., Dibert noticed a motor scooter in the parking lot behind the bar. Dibert jumped on the scooter and began pushing it around. Paul Overby, who also had been at the Scoop drinking that night, and whose friend owned the scooter, confronted Dibert and Kingman. Overby told Dibert and Kingman to leave the scooter alone. Dibert apologized and got off the scooter, and Overby took possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b63 The altercation did not end there, however. Overby yelled at Dibert and Kingman and told them to \u201cget the hell out of here.\u201d Dibert and Kingman, in turn, proceeded to argue back. The interaction escalated and caught the attention of two passersby, who observed Overby, Dibert, and Kingman shouting, gesturing, and posturing. Kingman eventually grabbed Dibert and they began to walk away, but Overby followed, insulting and threatening them. Overby shoved Kingman several times and hit Kingman once, at which point Kingman turned and punched Overby. One of the bystanders, who testified at trial, heard Overby state: Ts that all you got?\u201d Overby then turned around and started to walk back toward the Scoop, at which point Kingman struck Overby on the side of the head. This appeared to stun Overby. Kingman hit Overby again, which caused Overby to fall to the ground. At that point, Kingman got on top of Overby, who was lying face up, and punched Overby in the face upwards of 15 to 20 times. As one of the bystanders described it, \u2018It was unreal how fast [Kingman] hit [Overby] but he hit him many, many, many times over and over and over again.\u201dOverby, meanwhile, just lay there, not responding at all. One of the bystanders yelled at Kingman to stop. Kingman then got off Overby, but Dibert decided to deliver a few \u201cending blows\u201d and kicked Overby three to five times. Dibert and Kingman then fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">\u00b64 Witnesses approached Overby, who was lying on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>unconscious. His face was unrecognizable. It was covered in blood and one of his eyes was swollen. Blood, teeth, and lacerated flesh were \u2018floating around\u201d in his mouth. Overby appeared to be choking on his own blood, so one of the witnesses rolled Overby on his side to allow the blood to flow out of his mouth. Another witness called 911. Shortly after the responding officer arrived, Overby stopped breathing and the officer was unable to find a pulse. The officer thus commenced chest compressions, and Overby eventually started to breathe again, although he still gasped and gurgled. Medical personnel soon arrived, took over Overby\u2019s care, and transported him to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b65 Overby suffered extensive fractures to the vast majority of the bones in his face. Not only were the bones fractured, they had been \u201cpushed back\u201d-meaning that while the bones in our faces are normally \u201cconvex,\u201d Overby\u2019s bones were \u2018flattened or concave.\u201d He also had air inside his cranium due to \u201can open fracture to his brain.\u201d His injuries were life-threatening, and one of the doctors who treated Overby testified that he was surprised Overby survived to make it to the emergency room. Due to the complexity of his injuries and the need for a neurosurgeon, which was not available in Bozeman, Overby was flown to Billings. Overby was in the hospital for about a month and had to undergo reconstructive surgeries. He spent another month in rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b66 In the meantime, after fleeing the scene of the fight, Kingman and Dibert went to Kingman\u2019s home, where the two of them \u201crecapped\u201d what had happened. Kingman, who was \u201creally drunk\u201d and \u2018hyped up on adrenaline,\u201d realized that he had a gash on his hand which would not stop bleeding. Lacking first aid supplies, he decided to go to the home of his friends Zane and Josette in Belgrade to get his hand stitched up. Kingman later explained at trial that Zane and Josette were \u2018like family\u201d to him. Also, he and Zane were \u2018big fans of UFC boxing and contact sports.... [I]f one of us had been in a fight, we\u2019d call each other and brag about it.\u201dThus, before leaving his house, Kingman called Zane and, when Zane did not answer, left the following voicemail message:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">Zane, its Miles. Call me back, dude. I beat this guy to death. I, there\u2019s blood all over the house. In fact, both of my legs have splatters of blood on them. And my right hand, it\u2019s split so f \u2014 ing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gnarly bad like thank god I\u2019m drunk cause it would hurt horrible. I can\u2019t even wash it out it hurts so bad. But oh my god, dude. Wait till you see my shoes and my pants. I kicked the f\u2014 outta this guy, dude. I just stood over him like f \u2014 ing Chuck Liddell getting knocked out. Just one, two, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>one, one, one, two. Just splatters all over both my pants. I\u2019m never washing them again, dude. Yeah. Two knockouts in one night. I, oh my god dude. This guy\u2019s got brain damage. Oh my god. I hit him so f~ -ing hard. Wait till you see my shoes, my pants, and my shirt, dude. I got splatter to the face. In fact, my face has f \u2014 ing got blood splatters from this mother f\u2014 er from hitting him so f\u2014 ing hard on the ground. Just, oh. Why aren\u2019t you answering the phone? My right fist is pretty f\u2014 ing broke, dude. I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t work. I, I\u2019ll work tomorrow, but my right fist is broke, and it hurts horrible. But it\u2019s, it\u2019s bleeding bad. Anyway, we\u2019re gonna send you pictures, dude. My hand. Oh my god, I kicked this mother f\u2014 er to death, dude. I felt, oh my god I wish you were there, dude. Oh. Ask Ryan, dude, I just f\u2014 ing, it sounded like I was like Rocky punching wet meat on this mother. Everybody, a hundred people around, \u2018Stop hitting him. He\u2019s gone.\u2019T was just crack, crack, crack, crack. Oh, this mother f \u2014 er. Oh. I\u2019ve nev, oh god it feels so good. So good. Call me back when you get this. Beep, beep, beep. I don\u2019t care how late. It\u2019s so good. Beep, beep, beep. Oh, I\u2019m gonna call you back right now. Bye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Zane later turned a recording of this message over to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b67 Kingman called his friend Katelin and told her he had been in a bar fight and needed a ride out of town. Katelin picked Kingman and Dibert up and drove them to Zane and Josette\u2019s home in Belgrade. Katelin noticed that Kingman had blood on his clothes and was acting a \u201c[l]ittle bit hyped up and a little bit paranoid.\u201d Kingman was somewhat evasive when Katelin inquired about what had happened. She found his explanations implausible and the whole situation \u201cshocking,\u2019\u2019\u201ccreepy,\u2019\u2019and \u201csuspicious.\u201d After dropping Kingman and Dibert off in Belgrade, Katelin contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b68 Kingman was arrested later that morning (September 17,2008), and the State charged him October 3 with attempted deliberate homicide. The State also charged Dibert with attempted deliberate homicide. The District Court initially set Kingman\u2019s trial for late July 2009; however, pursuant to a defense motion, the court continued the trial to November 12,2009. A three-day jury trial commenced on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b69 In the interim, local media-newspaper, television, and radio-reported on the altercation behind the Scoop and subsequent developments related to the charges filed against Kingman and Dibert. Most of this coverage occurred during the first three weeks following the incident, though there was some sporadic coverage in late 2008 and the first half of2009 as well. In addition to the news media publicity regarding the case, various fundraising activities occurred in the Gallatin County area on Overby\u2019s behalf. His friends placed donation jars in several local businesses, set up a fund at Big Sky Western Bank, and organized a benefit (referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Tillage in the Village \u201908\u201d) in Big Sky, Montana, which reportedly raised $5,800. According to one of the news stories, the majority of Overby\u2019s medical costs were covered by insurance, but the moneys raised by his friends helped with living expenses during his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b610 On June 29, 2009, Kingman\u2019s defense filed a motion for change of venue \u201cdue to the inflammatory nature of the publicity, the repeated statements in the media which presume the guilt of Mr. Kingman, and the resulting prejudice in the community such that it is reasonable to believe he will not receive a fair and impartial trial.\u201d As grounds for the motion, Kingman cited \u00a746-13-203, MCA (providing for change of the place of trial because of prejudice), the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Sections 17 and 24 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b6 11 Following a status conference, the District Court ordered the Clerk of the District Court to draw a jury panel of 150 jurors. Both Kingman and the prosecution agreed that the 150 individuals drawn were a representative sample of potential jurors in Gallatin County. The prosecution and Kingman stipulated to a jury questionnaire, which was mailed to prospective jurors. Included in the questionnaire were several questions related to Kingman\u2019s motion to change venue: whether the prospective juror had seen, read, or heard anything about the case; from what sources and how many times the juror had seen, read, or heard about the case; what the juror thought he or she knew about the case; and, as a result of what he or she had seen, read, heard, or discussed about the case, whether the juror had \u2018formed an opinion that would affect your ability to serve as a juror.\u201d The District Court attached a cover letter directing the prospective jurors, among other things, not to make any investigation or inquiries into the case on their own and not to watch or read any news accounts relating to the case. All 150 prospective jurors returned their questionnaires. On the question whether the juror had seen, read, or heard anything about the case, 96 marked <em>\u201cyes,\u201d </em>47 marked \u2018ho,\u201d 3 left the question blank, and 4 indicated they were unsure whether they knew of the case. As to the question whether the juror had \u2018formed an opinion that would affect your ability to serve as a juror,\u201d27 marked \u201cyes,\u201d 108 marked \u2018ho,\u201d and 15 left the question blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b612 The District Court held a hearing on Kingman\u2019s motion. The court and the parties agreed that the court would decide the motion based on the responses received to the juror questionnaires and on the exhibits submitted by Kingman (recordings of KBZK television broadcasts, copies of newspaper articles, census information, and circulation statistics for the <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle). </em>Kingman and the prosecution presented arguments and thereafter filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The District Court then issued its decision, denying the motion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>court concluded that the pretrial publicity had not been inflammatory and that Kingman had failed to show that the prospective jurors could not set aside what they had heard or read in the media and decide his guilt impartially and based solely on the evidence admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b613 The case proceeded to trial. Kingman argued to the jury that he had attempted to retreat from the altercation with Overby, but when Overby followed and shoved him several times, Kingman reacted in self-defense. Ultimately, the jury acquitted him of attempted deliberate homicide but convicted him of aggravated assault, a lesser included offense. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor recommended the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. In so doing, the prosecutor argued that what Kingman did on September 17, 2008, was \u2018inhuman,\u201d and the prosecutor likened Kingman to an \u201canimal\u201d that needed to be \u201ccaged.\u201d In response, defense counsel argued that this was an offensive and inappropriate argument and that all persons, even those convicted of crimes, are still afforded \u201cat least some measure of human dignity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b614 The District Court sentenced Kingman to the Montana State Prison for 20 years, with none of that time suspended. The court also imposed restitution in the amount of $183,115.43 and ordered Kingman to register as a violent offender. Kingman now appeals. Additional facts are set forth below where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1. Whether Kingman\u2019s motion to change venue should have been granted on the basis of\u2018presumed prejudice\u201d resulting from pretrial publicity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b616 As noted, Kingman asserts his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under Article II, Sections 17 and 24 of the Montana Constitution. Although he presents two separate analyses in this regard-one under the federal Constitution and the other under the Montana Constitution-we conclude, for the reasons which follow, that the framework for analyzing change-of-venue motions is the same under both documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, we reconcile our approach with that followed by the federal courts so as to facilitate consistency in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Foundational Change-of-Venue Principles</p>\n<p id=\"Ami\">\u00b617 A criminal charge brought under Montana law must be filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>county where the offense was committed, and the place of trial must be in that same county, unless otherwise provided by law. Sections 46-3-110(1), -111(1), MCA; <em>see also </em>Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a724 (the accused has the right to be tried by a jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed). Analogously, a federal prosecution occurs in the state and district where the crime was committed. <em>Skilling v. </em>U.S.,_ U.S._, 130 S. Ct. 2896, 2913 (2010) (citing U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a72, cl. 3, and amend. VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b618 At the same time, however, Article II, Sections 17 and 24 secure to the defendant the right to a \u2018fair trial\u201d by an \u201cimpartial jury.\u201d <em>See State v. Allen, </em>2010 MT 214, \u00b6 25,357 Mont. 495,241 P.3d 1045; <em>In re T.J.F. </em>,2011 MT 28, \u00b6 26, 359 Mont. 213, 248 P.3d 804; <em>State v. Dryman, </em>127 Mont. 579, 588, 269 P.2d 796, 800 (1954). The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments likewise guarantee \u201ca fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Ayers, </em>632 F.3d 500, 507 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, if there exists in the county in which the prosecution is pending \u201csuch prejudice that a fair trial cannot be had in the county,\u201d then the court is required (upon motion by the defense or the prosecution) to transfer the cause to another county, direct that a jury be selected from another county, or take any other action designed to ensure that a fair trial may be had. Section 46-13-203, MCA. Similarly, in the federal context, the court must transfer the proceeding to another district if \u201cso great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 21(a); <em>see also Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2913 (\u2018The Constitution\u2019s place-of-trial prescriptions ... do not impede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at the defendant\u2019s request if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial-a \u2018basic requirement of due process.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u00b619 As these rules make clear, the prerequisite for obtaining a change of venue on the ground of \u201cprejudice\u201d is that there is such prejudice as will prevent a fair and impartial trial in the current venue. There are various forms the prejudice might take-such as a community uproar or too many people in the community with close ties to the victim-hut the ground most commonly advanced for a \u2018fair trial\u201d change of venue is that adverse pretrial publicity precludes selection of an unbiased jury. Wayne R. LaFave et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>vol. 4, \u00a7 16.3(b), 806 (3d ed., Thomson/West 2007). In this regard, Kingman points out that prejudice may be \"presumed\u201d in certain circumstances. Indeed, as explained below, a motion for change of venue may be founded on presumed prejudice or on actual prejudice, and different standards apply depending on which sort of prejudice is claimed. This distinction is recognized explicitly in federal caselaw but, until now, has been essentially implicit in our own cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Presumed Prejudice versus Actual Prejudice under Federal Law</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b620  \u201c \u2018The theory of our [trial] system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2913 (brackets in <em>Skilling) </em>(quoting <em>Patterson v. Colorado, </em>205 U.S. 454, 462, 27 S. Ct. 556, 558 (1907)). A defendant can establish that jurors drawn from the community cannot judge his case impartially and unswayed by outside influence, thus necessitating a change of venue, by two methods: he can demonstrate that the jury pool is <em>actually </em>prejudiced against him, or he can demonstrate that juror prejudice should be <em>presumed </em>from prejudice in the community and pretrial publicity. <em>See Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794,803, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 2038 (1975); <em>U.S. v. Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 307-08 (4th Cir. 2003); <em>Foley v. Parker, </em>488 F.3d 377, 387 (6th Cir. 2007); <em>U.S. v. Blom, </em>242 F.3d 799, 803 (8th Cir. 2001); <em>Gallego v. McDaniel, </em>124 F.3d 1065, 1070 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>House v. Hatch, </em>527 F.3d 1010, 1023-24 (10th Cir. 2008); <em>see also e.g. Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2913-25 (analyzing the defendant\u2019s claims of presumed prejudice and actual prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b621 \u2018tP]rejudice is presumed where \u2018pretrial publicity is so pervasive and prejudicial that we cannot expect to find an unbiased jury pool in the community.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019House, </em>527 F.3d at 1023 (quoting <em>Goss v. Nelson, </em>439 F.3d 621, 628 (10th Cir. 2006)); <em>see also U.S. v. Angiulo, </em>897 F.2d 1169, 1181 (1st Cir. 1990) (prejudicial, inflammatory publicity about the case has so saturated the community as to render it virtually impossible to obtain an impartial jury); <em>U.S. v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1150 (11th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (prejudicial publicity has saturated the community, and there is a reasonable certainty that the prejudice prevents the defendant from obtaining a fair trial). To justify a presumption of prejudice under this standard, the publicity must be both extensive <em>and </em>sensational in nature. <em>Angiulo, </em>897 F.2d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b622 The seminal case on presumed prejudice is <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S. Ct. 1417 (1963). There, the defendant\u2019s videotaped confession to authorities was repeatedly broadcast to the relatively small community over the local television station, resulting in a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d which derailed due process and quashed any hope of a fair trial in that locale. <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 726,83 S. Ct. at 1419. The Supreme Court held that \u201cthe spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged,\u201d to the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it, \u2018in a very real sense <em>was </em>Rideau\u2019s trial-at which he pleaded guilty to murder. Any subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality.\u201d <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 726, 83 S. Ct. at 1419 (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>original). The Supreme Court reached this conclusion \"without pausing to examine a particularized transcript of the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the members of the jury.\u201d <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 727, 83 S. Ct. at 1419-20. Prejudice was presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b623 The Supreme Court also presumed prejudice in <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 335, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 1508 (1966), due to \u2018the massive, pervasive and prejudicial publicity\u2019 that occurred before and during Sheppard\u2019s trial on the charge of murdering his wife. Not only was the case made \u201cnotorious\u201d by the \u201cvirulent publicity\u201d about Sheppard and the murder, but numerous pictures of the jurors, with their addresses, appeared in the newspapers, exposing them to expressions of opinion from both cranks and friends. Moreover, \u2018bedlam\u201d and a \u201ccarnival atmosphere\u201d reigned at the courthouse during trial, with newsmen taking over practically the entire courtroom and hounding most of the participants in the trial, especially Sheppard. <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 353-55,358,86 S. Ct. at 1517-18, 1520. Due to the \u2018inherently prejudicial publicity\u201d which saturated the community and the \u201cdisruptive influences\u201din the courtroom, the Supreme Court concluded that Sheppard\u2019s trial had been \u2018inherently\u201d lacking in due process. <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 351-52, 363, 86 S.

The principle of presumed prejudice is \u201crarely applicable\u201d and is reserved for \u201cextreme situations.\u201d <em>See Hayes, </em>632 F.3d at 508; <em>Campa, </em>459 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>1143; <em>accord Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2915 (\u201cA presumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends only the extreme case.\u201d). The bar facing the defendant seeking to prove presumed prejudice is, correspondingly, \u201cextremely high.\u201d <em>McVeigh, </em>153 F.3d at 1182. Thus, it has been said that to establish presumptive prejudice, the defendant must show that \u201can irrepressibly hostile attitude pervade[s] the community\u201d and that the publicity \u201cdictates the community\u2019s opinion as to guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Abello-Silva, </em>948 F.2d at 1176. It likewise has been said that prejudice cannot be presumed unless the trial atmosphere has been \u201cutterly corrupted by press coverage.\u201d <em>Campa, </em>459 F.3d at 1144 (internal quotation marks omitted). Circumstances amounting to \u201ca circus atmosphere or lynch mob mentality\u201d would justify a presumption of prejudice. <em>Stafford v. Saffle, </em>34 F.3d 1557,1566 (10th Cir. 1994). So would proceedings that are \u201centirely lacking in the solemnity and sobriety to which a defendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of fairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 799, 95 S.

The voir dire testimony and the record of publicity must reveal \u2018the kind of wave of public passion\u201d that would make a fair trial unlikely by a jury empaneled from that community. <em>House, </em>527 F.3d at 1024 (internal quotation marks omitted). The relevant question is whether prospective jurors\u2019 responses reflect \u201csuch fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1035,104 S. Ct. at 2891. \u2018Impartiality does not mean jurors are totally ignorant of the case. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how an intelligent venireman could be completely uninformed of significant events in his community. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Abello-Silva, </em>948 F.2d at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Foley, </em>488 F.3d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Montana Law</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b626 Our own cases have resolved the question of prejudice in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b627 In <em>State ex rel. Coburn v. Bennett, </em>202 Mont. 20, 655 P.2d 502 (1982), we held that a change of venue should have been granted based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u2018inherent prejudice.\u201dCobum was charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual intercourse without consent. Bail initially was set at $100,000, but the district court reduced it to $15,000, which Coburn posted, after which he was released. This prompted outrage in the community. Angry citizens marched on the courthouse; public meetings were held; organizations were established devoted to removing the district court judge and to dealing with persons who commit sex crimes; vandalism occurred; and threats were made against Coburn. The local newspaper reported on these events, detailing much of the evidence gathered by investigators and tying that evidence to the defendant. In addition, some articles gave quoted statements by the sheriff, the county attorney, and a deputy county attorney that were prejudicial to the defendant. <em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 22-30, 655 P.2d at 503-07. On several occasions, the newspaper went beyond an objective dissemination of information. \u2018Instead of calming an enraged community and providing an atmosphere in which the processes of justice could go forward without bias, the [newspaper] inflamed an already angry populace.\u201d <em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 30-31, 655 P.2d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">\u00b628 When the district court denied his motion for change of venue, Coburn filed a petition for a writ of supervisory control. Appearing on behalf of the respondent judge, the prosecutor argued that voir dire is the proper time to determine whether prejudice against Coburn still existed. We disagreed. Citing federal caselaw, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">While the determination of whether widespread prejudice prohibits selection of an impartial jury is usually made during voir dire, each case must turn on its special facts. It is widely recognized in the federal courts that while voir dire is usually essential to resolution of a venue question, a motion for change of venue may be decided prior to voir dire if the circumstances of the case indicate inherent prejudice. Effective and economic judicial administration is not well served by calling an inordinate and unwieldy number of veniremen to see if an unbiased jury might be obtained, especially when it is already apparent that a substantial chance of intolerable prejudice exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 32-33, 655 P.2d at 508 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord. State v. Paisley, </em>204 Mont. 191,194-95, 663 P.2d 322,324 (1983) (finding voir dire unnecessary given the extensive and inflammatory media coverage of the charges against the defendant). We noted, in addition, that \u2018tb]eyond the question of judicial economy lie the problems inherent in the voir dire system itself.... The courtroom can exert a unique pressure upon a juror or prospective juror which may render that person\u2019s degree of impartiality indiscernible even to himself.\u201d <em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 33, 655 P.2d at 508. In this connection, we cited another case, <em>State v. Spotted Hawk, </em>22 Mont. 33, 55 P. 1026 (1899), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>which this Court also presumed prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Spotted Hawk, </em>the defendant (Spotted Hawk) was charged in Custer County with the murder of a man named Hoover. Spotted Hawk\u2019s motion to change the place of trial was denied, after which he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be hanged. On appeal, we reversed and ordered a new trial. We did so in light of the following facts and circumstances identified by Spotted Hawk: people in the county believed the Cheyenne Indians had killed Hoover; thus, roughly 200 armed cowboys and ranchmen had gathered near the Cheyenne Indian Agency intending either to force the murderers\u2019 surrender or to go on the Reservation and \u201cexterminate the tribe\u201d; these men were only persuaded from attacking the Indians by the civil authorities of the county; at the time of Hoover\u2019s burial, a large number of men took an oath that they would be present at the trial of the Indians charged with Hoover\u2019s murder, and, if they were acquitted, the men \u201cwould take the law in their own hands, and hang the Indians before they left the courthouse yard\u201d; the Custer County newspapers denounced the Indians and unduly excited the inhabitants with \u201cextravagant and inflammatory\u201d publications; at the time Hoover\u2019s body was found, and thereafter, there was unfriendly talk against Spotted Hawk, and the inhabitants of the county held him in utter contempt; bitterness against the Indians extended to all parts of the county and existed at the time of the trial; and the military authorities sent several companies of soldiers to prevent an outbreak of hostilities between the whites and Indians over Hoover\u2019s murder. <em>Spotted Hawk, </em>22 Mont, at 47-48,53-55,55 P. at 1029,1031-32. In these circumstances, we presumed that such prejudice existed as to preclude a fair trial in Custer County. <em>Spotted Hawk, </em>22 Mont, at 56, 55 P. at 1032. We explained that when the public sentiment is in \u201ca blaze of excitement and passion\u201d against one of the parties to the action, the pressure of this public sentiment could make itself felt during the trial and could influence or bias the jurors, the witnesses, and the officers of court, even if only unconsciously, despite their honest intention of doing their duty. <em>Spotted Hawk, </em>22 Mont, at 56, 55 P. at 1032 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b630 We also presumed that an unbiased jury could not be selected in <em>State v. Dryman, </em>127 Mont. 579, 269 P.2d 796 (1954). There, the defendant (Dryman), then 19 years of age, without benefit of counsel, initially entered a plea of guilty to the charge of murder and was sentenced to be \u2018hanged by the neck until dead.\u201d Following his first appeal to this Court, Dryman was permitted to withdraw his guilty plea. He then filed a motion to change venue on the ground that the people of Toole County were so prejudiced against him that it would be impossible to receive a fair trial by an unbiased jury in the county. The district court denied the motion, but on Dryman\u2019s second appeal, we reversed. We noted that certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>publications by the local newspaper had \u201ctended to fan the flame of high feeling against the defendant rather than to quench it\u201d and had also \u201ctended to give its readers the impression that the law and its procedures were deliberately, by trickery, delay and favoritism, defeating justice.\u201d <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 589, 269 P.2d at 801. Most notably, the paper had circulated a flyer captioned \u2018Extra\u201d at the top, containing a picture of Dryman with the word \u201cKiller\u201d over his picture and detailing the story of the crime and what took place in the courtroom when Dryman was first sentenced to death following his plea of guilty. The article described Dryman as a \u201ccold blooded killer.\u201d It noted that Dryman had the rights to counsel, to a jury trial, and to a change of venue, but that he had declined to exercise these rights. The author opined that Dryman \u201cmust have prejudged in his own heart the black guilt in which he perpetrated the most dastardly deed in the history of Toole County. Either that, or as it appeared he was so steeped in criminal tendencies that nothing could appeal to his warped and stony mind.\u201d Dryman\u2019s prior conviction for robbing a liquor store was cited. <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 581-83, 269 P.2d at 797-98. In addition to the press coverage, we noted that pending his first appeal to this Court, the trial judge, the local sheriff, and the State Prison Commission had all agreed that Dryman should be housed at the state penitentiary in Deer Lodge, rather than the Toole County jail, because \u201cthere was such a feeling and prejudice in Toole County that defendant might have been lynched if he had been kept in Toole County.\u201d <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 588,269 P.2d at 800. Moreover, at the hearing on the motion for change of venue, the State\u2019s witnesses conceded that the feeling in the community toward Dryman was the same then as it had been immediately after the murder and Dryman\u2019s guilty plea. The \u201cwidespread and deep-seated opinion\u201d was that Dryman was guilty and should be hanged. <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 586-87, 590, 269 P.2d at 799-800, 801. We noted that \u2018it seems natural that such opinion should exist in Toole County,\u201d given Dryman\u2019s guilty plea and the inflammatory press coverage. But the existence of such opinion led us to hold that he was entitled to have his new trial moved \u201cfrom Toole County to some other county not adjacent thereto.\u201d <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 590, 269 P.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b631  As can be seen from these examples, this Court will presume prejudice-similar to the approach of the federal courts-in extreme situations where there are such pervasive and strong passions of anger, hatred, indignation, revulsion, and upset in the community that we simply cannot rely on jurors\u2019 claims that they can be impartial. <em>Cf. State v. Abe, </em>1998 MT 206, \u00b6\u00b6 36-41, 290 Mont. 393, 965 P.2d 882 (concluding that the publicity, even if inflammatory, was not so widespread as to generate a general belief about the defendant\u2019s guilt throughout the jury pool). Apart from such exceptional cases, however, we have required the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>show that jurors selected from the community actually could not set aside what they have heard or read in the media and decide the defendant\u2019s guilt impartially and based solely on the evidence admitted at trial. <em>State v. Devlin, </em>2009 MT 18, \u00b6 32, 349 Mont. 67, 201 P.3d 791. Voir dire, we have noted, is a primary method of demonstrating that potential jurors have been so affected by pretrial publicity that they would be unable to render a fair and impartial verdict. <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6 30. Cases reflecting this requirement include <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-34; <em>State v. Bar-Jonah, </em>2004 MT 344, \u00b6\u00b6 83-89,324 Mont. 278,102 P.3d 1229; <em>State v. Bill, </em>2000 MT 308, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55,302 Mont. 415, 14 P.3d 1237; <em>State v. Fuhrmann, </em>278 Mont. 396, 408-10, 925 P.2d 1162, 1170-71 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>268 Mont. 20, 52-55, 885 P.2d 457, 477-79 (1994); <em>State v.

Armstrong, </em>189 Mont. 407, 422-23, 616 P.2d 341, 350 (1980); and <em>State v. Williams, </em>185 Mont. 140, 145-46, 604 P.2d 1224, 1227-28 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Framework and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b632  In light of the foregoing discussion of federal and Montana cases, we now clarify the standards and procedures for analyzing the two different types of prejudice. As the basis of a motion for change of venue, the defendant may allege presumed prejudice, actual prejudice, or both. Where presumed prejudice is alleged-meaning that the court is being asked to presume that jurors selected from the community cannot be impartial-the bar is extremely high. The defendant must demonstrate that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervades the jury pool or that the complained-of publicity has effectively displaced the judicial process and dictated the community\u2019s opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Presumed prejudice, necessitating a change of venue, will be found only in situations analogous to <em>Rideau, Sheppard, Spotted Hawk, Dryman, </em>and <em>Cob urn-4.e., </em>circumstances amounting to \u201ca circus atmosphere or lynch mob mentality.\u201d Where such extreme circumstances are not present, and actual prejudice is alleged, the defendant must show through voir dire or other means that the jury pool harbors actual partiality or hostility against the defendant that cannot be laid aside. The same standards apply if the prosecutor moves for a change of venue under \u00a746-13-203, MCA. \u00b633 Furthermore, because media coverage may occur throughout the pretrial period and the trial itself, and because new publicity may generate new concerns about the defendant\u2019s ability to receive a fair and impartial trial, a motion for change of venue may be made or renewed at any point during the pretrial period, voir dire, or the trial, as circumstances dictate. We have adopted a similar approach with respect to speedy trial motions, explaining that such motions must be evaluated based on the facts existing at the time the motion is decided and that if further delay or changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>circumstances justify reconsideration of the issue, then a renewed motion for a speedy trial must be made. <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2009 MT 292, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 352 Mont. 271, 216 P.3d 754. Likewise, if subsequent events raise new concerns regarding juror impartiality or the ability to receive a fair trial in the current venue, then a renewed motion for change of venue or a post-trial motion for a new trial may be filed. Correspondingly, on appeal, a party will not be heard to complain that a trial court was wrong for refusing to grant a change of venue based on publicity or concerns that arose <em>after </em>the request was made. <em>See e.g. State v. Brandon, </em>264 Mont. 231, 247, 870 P.2d 734, 743 (1994); <em>cf. Hendershot, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b634 Lastly, it is necessary to address our standard of review. Kingman notes that since territorial days, this Court has reviewed a trial court\u2019s change-of-venue ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>See e.g. Territory v. Corbett, </em>3 Mont. 50, 57 (1877); <em>Paisley, </em>204 Mont, at 194, 663 P.2d at 324; <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6 15. Kingman asks us to revise this standard where, as here, the defendant alleges \u201cpresumed prejudice.\u201d He argues in this regard, first, that the standard of review under federal law is de novo where the motion is based on presumed prejudice and, second, that we should adopt the same standard for purposes of Montana law because a motion to change venue on account of prejudicial publicity is rooted in the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AZC\">\u00b635 We decline to adopt this approach. First, it is true that Ttjhis Court cannot adopt a lower standard to protect any right in the United States Constitution than the United States Supreme Court has recognized.\u201d <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 214,108 P.3d 500, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Brinson, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 9,351 Mont. 136,210 P.3d 164; <em>accord State v. Bentley, </em>156 Mont. 129,134,477 P.2d 345,347 (1970) (\u2018Montana cannot guarantee less protection for a citizen under its laws than is demandedby the Constitution of the United States.\u20190. Yet, contrary to Kingman\u2019s implication, there is no clearly established federal law-least of all by the Supreme Court-holding that \u201cde novo\u201d review applies to claims of presumed prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b636 In support of this proposition, Kingman cites <em>McVeigh, </em>153 F.3d at 1179, where the Tenth Circuit stated, on one hand, that it would undertake de novo review of whether the complained-of publicity and the circumstances surrounding that publicity were \u201cof such a nature as to render impartiality impossible\u201d (presumed prejudice), but, on the other hand, that it would review for abuse of discretion \u201cwhether the seated jury could remain impartial in the face of negative pretrial publicity\u201d (actual prejudice). We note that the Fifth Circuit stated the same dual standards in <em>U.S. v. Skilling, </em>554 F.3d 529, 557-58 (5th Cir. 2009) (\u2018We review de novo whether presumed prejudice tainted a trial.... In reviewing actual prejudice, however, we afford greater deference to the district court....\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>130 S. Ct. 2896.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b637 Notably, neither <em>McVeigh </em>nor the Fifth Circuit\u2019s <em>Skilling </em>opinion provides a satisfactory explanation for why a trial court is accorded greater deference in evaluating actual prejudice than it is accorded in evaluating presumed prejudice. More importantly, however, it appears that aside from these two cases, the federal courts of appeals uniformly recite an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review for both presumed prejudice and actual prejudice. <em>See U.S. v. Misla-Aldarondo, </em>478 F.3d 52,58-59 (1st Cir. 2007); <em>U.S. v. Sahhnani, </em>599 F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2010); <em>US. v. Inigo, </em>925 F.2d 641, 654-55 (3d Cir. 1991); <em>U.S. v. Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 307-09 (4th Cir. 2003); <em>U.S. v. Jamieson, </em>427 F.3d 394, 412-13 (6th Cir. 2005); <em>U.S. v. Nettles, </em>476 F.3d 508, 513-15 (7th Cir. 2007); <em>U.S. v. Rodriguez, </em>581 F.3d 775, 784-86 (8th Cir. 2009); <em>U.S. v. Collins, </em>109 F.3d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>U.S. v. Langford, </em>647 F.3d 1309,1319,1332-34 (11th Cir. 2011). It should also be noted that the Tenth Circuit\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own precedents are inconsistent in requiring \u201cde novo\u201d review. <em>Compare McVeigh, </em>153 F.3d at 1179, <em>and Skilling, </em>554 F.3d at 557-58, <em>with U.S. v. Abello-Silva, </em>948 F.2d 1168,1176 (10th Cir. 1991) (acknowledging the two types of prejudice and then stating that \u2018tsjince the decision to transfer venue is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, we review for an abuse of discretion\u2019!), <em>and U.S. v. Asibor, </em>109 F.3d 1023,1037 (5th Cir. 1997) (\u2018We review all questions concerning venue under the abuse of discretion standard. The trial court is entitled to broad discretion in ruling on motions to transfer venue, and its decision will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion.\u2019!).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b638 Second, it is also true that the mechanism allowing the defendant to obtain a change of venue is founded primarily on the principle that a defendant is constitutionally entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury. And it is well established that we review questions of constitutional law de novo. <em>State v. Stock, </em>2011 MT 131, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 1, 256 P.3d 899; <em>State v. Couture, </em>2010 MT 201, \u00b6 47, 357 Mont. 398, 240 P.3d 987. \u201cA district court has no discretion in the correct interpretation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Norquay, </em>2011 MT 34, \u00b6 13, 359 Mont. 257, 248 P.3d 817. Hence, the question whether the defendant ultimately received a fair trial in accordance with due process is still a question over which we exercise plenary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b639 However, in determining the more specific question whether, in light of extant circumstances, such prejudice exists as to necessitate a change of venue, the trial court must be afforded broad deference. Indeed, the nature of this determination simply does not lend itself to de novo review on the cold record. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes especially good sense when pretrial publicity is at issue, because the judge sits in the locale where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>publicity is said to have had its effect and may base her evaluation on her own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror. <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2918. The judge is also, we note, more intimately familiar with the defendant\u2019s reputation, what the local reaction to the crime has been, and the overall community sentiment. Conversely, appellate courts making after-the-fact assessments of the media\u2019s impact on jurors \u2018lack the on-the-spot comprehension of the situation possessed by trial judges.\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2918. Not only is this true with respect to claims of presumed prejudice, it is even more compelling in the context of alleged actual prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">Reviewing courts are properly resistant to second-guessing the trial judge\u2019s estimation of a juror\u2019s impartiality, for that judge\u2019s appraisal is ordinarily influenced by a host of factors impossible to capture fully in the record-among them, the prospective juror\u2019s inflection, sincerity, demeanor, candor, body language, and apprehension of duty. In contrast to the cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in-the-moment <em>voir dire </em>affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\u2019s fitness for jury service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2918 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b640 In short, the trial judge is uniquely positioned to assess whether a change of venue is called for due to prejudice in the community. For this reason, and because there is no clearly established law under the United States Constitution mandating \u201cde novo\u201d review of \u201cpresumed prejudice\u201d claims, we will continue to review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for change of venue. We reiterate, though, that \u2018in exercising its discretion, the court is bound to uphold the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Analysis of Kingman\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b641 Kingman filed his motion for change of venue during the pretrial period, based on media coverage and community sentiment that existed as of late June 2009. The District Court approved the jury questionnaire in August, held a hearing in September, and rendered its decision on October 7, five weeks before trial commenced. By stipulation of the parties, the court\u2019s ruling was based on the responses to the questionnaires and on the exhibits submitted by Kingman (recordings ofKBZK television broadcasts, copies of newspaper articles, census information, and circulation statistics for the <em>Bozeman Daily </em>Chronicle). Kingman did not renew his motion for change of venue at the conclusion of voir dire or during trial. He states on appeal that his motion is based on presumed prejudice, not actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b642 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Skilling </em>and our decisions in <em>Spotted Hawk, Dryman, </em>and <em>Coburn </em>indicate that a variety of factors may bear on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the question whether prejudicial, inflammatory publicity about the case has so saturated the community as to warrant a presumption that an impartial jury cannot be drawn therefrom. First, the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred are clearly relevant. The larger and more diverse the jury pool, the more likely that 12 impartial individuals can be empaneled from that pool. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2915. Second, community sentiment is relevant. The more demonstrably enraged or inflamed the community is, the less likely it will be to find jurors who can render a decision free from bias. <em>See Spotted Hawk, </em>22 Mont, at 53-55, 55 P. at 1031-32; <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 586-89, 269 P.2d at 799-801; <em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 30, 655 P.2d at 507. A third factor is the nature of the publicity-whether it is of the type that readers or viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight, and whether it invites prejudgment of the defendant\u2019s culpability. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916; <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 589, 269 P.2d at 801; <em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 30-31,655 P.2d at 507; <em>see also Devlin, </em>\u00b6 24 (\u201c\u2018Inflammatory\u2019 publicity is publicity which, by its nature, has the tendency to stir up in the community pervasive and strong passions of anger, hatred, indignation, revulsion, and upset such that there are reasonable grounds to believe that jurors chosen from this community could not determine the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence in a fair and unbiased manner and based solely upon the evidence admitted at trial.\u201d). Another relevant factor is the amount of time that elapsed between the crime and the defendant\u2019s trial, and whether community passions diminished during that period. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916; <em>Dryman, </em>127 Mont, -at 586-87, 269 P.2d at 799-800. Lastly, and of\u2018Aprime significance\u201d when evaluating post-verdict whether prejudice existed, is the question whether jurors\u2019 actions ultimately ran counter to a presumption of prejudice-e.g., if they acquitted the defendant of some of the charges. -See <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916 (Skilling\u2019s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts); <em>U.S. v. Arzola-Amaya, </em>867 F.2d 1504,1514 (5th Cir. 1989) (\u2018The jury\u2019s ability to discern a failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes indicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and reinforces our belief and conclusion that the media coverage did not lead to the deprivation of [the defendants\u2019] right to an impartial trial.\u201d). This list identifies some, but not necessarily all, of the factors pertinent to a \u201cpresumed prejudice\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"AiU\">\u00b643 In the present case, the District Court determined that the number of eligible jurors in Gallatin County was 63,000, from which a representative sample of 150 was drawn. The court observed that Kingman had been charged with a \u201cserious\u201d offense, but that homicide charges \u201csadly are not a rare occurrence in Gallatin County recently.\u201d The court noted that the news articles and broadcasts presented by Kingman contained factual accounts of the background of the case and various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>courtroom proceedings occurring after Kingman\u2019s arrest. While the reports spoke of the \u2018brutality\u201d of the injuries inflicted on Overby, the court found that the information was not reported in an inflammatory manner, that terms such as \u201callegations,\u201d \u201caccusations,\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d were used, and that the reports were not calculated to improperly sway public opinion against Kingman.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b644 Nine of the ten articles provided by Kingman were from the <em>Bozeman Daily </em>Chronicle; one article was from a monthly publication entitled <em>The BoZone', </em>and the nine broadcasts were from local television station KBZK. Based on the statistics provided by Kingman, the District Court estimated that roughly half of the households in Gallatin County are exposed to the <em>Chronicle </em>on a daily basis. Furthermore, the KBZK news report, in conjunction with the station\u2019s sister affiliate in Butte, reaches approximately 100,000 viewers; however, the court had insufficient information to estimate how many individuals eligible to serve as jurors in Gallatin County are exposed to KBZK news reports daily. The court noted that six of the <em>Chronicle </em>articles and six of the KBZK reports were printed/aired in the first 36 days following the incident, that the remaining articles and broadcasts were printed/aired in late 2008 and early 2009, and that trial was set for November 12, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b645 Finally, as to ostensible adverse community reaction, the District Court rejected Kingman\u2019s argument that the fundraising efforts to assist Overby were indicative of, and fostered, a community-held perception that Overby was an innocent victim and Kingman was a brutal, unprovoked attacker. The court observed that Kingman had presented no evidence in support of this contention. Turning to the juror questionnaires, the court noted that 27 of the 150 respondents had marked \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cAs a result of what you have seen, heard, read or discussed about this case, have you formed an opinion that would affect your ability to serve as a juror?\u201d (As noted, 108 marked \u2018bo\u201d and 15 left the question blank.) The court found this percentage of affirmative responses to be insufficient to establish that Kingman could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Gallatin County, particularly since the question provided no insight into what the juror\u2019s opinion was, why the juror believed that opinion would affect his or her ability to serve, and whether the juror could lay that opinion aside and render a verdict based on the evidence presented. The questionnaire also asked those respondents who had read, heard, seen, or discussed the case to \u201cplease tell us everything you think you know about this case, in as much detail as possible.\u201d In response, some of the prospective jurors indicated they had heard a great deal about the case, and they described what they knew using terms that had been utilized in news reports, such as \u201cattack,\u201d \u201cstabbed,\u201d and \u201cthe victim was injured and unconscious.\u201d Kingman claimed these responses showed that numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>jurors actually had formed an opinion about the case and about his guilt which affected their ability to be impartial, even if they were not aware that they had formed such an opinion. The District Court rejected this argument, however, observing that while 96 of the 150 prospective jurors indicated they had read, seen, or heard something about the case, 108 respondents indicated they had not formed an opinion that would affect their ability to serve. The court refused to infer that mere knowledge of the case, even in some detail, equates to prejudice against Kingman or a fixed opinion about his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b646 For these reasons, the District Court concluded that Kingman had failed to show a reasonable possibility that he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Gallatin County due to prejudicial pretrial publicity. Kingman disagrees with the court\u2019s analysis and argues that several factors mandate a finding of presumed prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b647 First, Kingman contends that the circumstances of the fight, in which he inflicted extensive injuries with his hands and then expressed pleasure about having done so, would reasonably elicit revulsion and antipathy. He asserts that the news accounts used evocative and emotional language to describe the events, emphasized the graphic details of Overby\u2019s injuries, and presented a \u2018hackneyed narrative\u201d in which Kingman was portrayed as a \u201cdangerous outsider\u201d who disturbed the tranquility of a small community by committing a \u2018brutal,\u2019\u2019\u2018Vicious,\u2019\u2019and \u201csavage\u201d crime against an esteemed local. Having reviewed the articles and broadcasts, however, we cannot agree that the media reports were as slanted and inflammatory as Kingman suggests. Although the reports describe a brutal and gruesome beating, the incident is not reported in a sensationalized manner. The reports do not go beyond an objective dissemination of information, nor do they inflame an already angry populace. <em>Cf. Coburn, </em>202 Mont, at 30-31, 655 P.2d at 507. The reports do not take a position on Kingman\u2019s guilt. <em>Cf. Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 582-83, 269 P.2d at 797-98. They use terms such as \u201callegations,\u201d \u201caccusations,\u201d and \u201ccharges.\u201d Most of the complained-of reports were published or broadcast within the first few weeks after the fight, over a year before Kingman\u2019s trial. Notably, a subsequent <em>Chronicle </em>article, dated May 28,2009, reports Kingman\u2019s side of the story and his claim that Overby was the aggressor and Kingman acted in self-defense. While Kingman speculates that the impact of the early publicity had not appreciably diminished by the time of trial, we do not agree that this is a case like <em>Dryman, </em>where the impact of the news items was still felt more than a year after they were published. <em>See </em>127 Mont, at 586,269 P.2d at 799 (opinion of the Court), 127 Mont, at 591,269 P.2d at 802 (Anderson &amp; Angstman, JJ., dissenting). Contrary to Kingman\u2019s characterizations, the September and October 2008 media reports were not so provocative as to leave the Gallatin County citizenry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>chomping at the bit for 13 months to exact retribution on Kingman.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b648 Second, Kingman observes that his \u201cdramatic confession\u201d in the voicemail left for Zane was reported in three newspaper articles and one television broadcast (all in late September and early October 2008). He asserts that this is the type of information which, like the videotaped confession <em>inRideau, </em>readers and viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight. He also points out that even where the information reported by the media is \u2018factual\u201d (as opposed to editorializing), it may still have a prejudicial impact. He maintains that his \u201cconfession\u201d was blatantly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b649 It is true that \u2018factual\u201d information may create prejudice in the community. <em>See e.g. Dryman, </em>127 Mont, at 590,269 P.2d at 801 (the \u2018fact\u201d that Dryman had pleaded guilty was one of the main reasons that the widespread and deep-seated opinion in Toole County was that he was guilty and should be hanged); <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6 22 (factual information may be reported in an inflammatory manner, and the reporting of factual information may be inflammatory in light of the particular circumstances). It is also true that exposing prospective jurors to a defendant\u2019s recorded \u201cconfession\u201d raises concerns about whether the jurors can shut out this information and judge the defendant impartially. <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 726, 83 S. Ct. at 1419. We are not persuaded here, however, that the reporting of Kingman\u2019s voicemail message justifies presumed prejudice. It should be noted that the message was not broadcast or printed repeatedly. One of the <em>Chronicle </em>articles cited by Kingman does not quote from his message at all, and a second article purports to recite information contained in \u201ccharging documents.\u201d The third article, dated September 20, 2008, and the KBZK broadcast of the same date both report that the prosecution played the voicemail message at Kingman\u2019s bail hearing. The article quotes a significant portion of what Kingman said, and the KBZK broadcast (a copy of which is contained in the record) includes a somewhat indiscernible snippet of the message being played at the bail hearing, with Kingman quoted as saying: \u20181 was just like crack, crack, crack, crack on this *******. I felt, oh god it felt so good. So good. Call me back when you get this.\u201d In <em>Rideau, </em>however, the Supreme Court emphasized the inherently prejudicial impact of repeatedly viewing Rideau confess in detail during a 20-minute interrogation by the local sheriff. 373 U.S. at 724, 83 S. Ct. at 1418. The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">it was a denial of due process of law to refuse the request for a change of venue, after the people of Calcasieu Parish had been exposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged. For anyone who has ever watched television the conclusion cannot be avoided that this spectacle, to the tens of thousands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>people who saw and heard it, in a very real sense <em>was </em>Rideau\u2019s trial-at which he pleaded guilty to murder. Any subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 726, 83 S. Ct. at 1419 (emphasis in original). Whereas the television broadcasts of Rideau showed him admitting, under questioning by authorities, that he had committed three crimes-hence the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that this \u2018in a very real sense <em>was </em>Rideau\u2019s trial\u201d4he broadcast here involved an excerpt of a voicemail message in which the speaker engaged in a drunken and \u201cadrenaline-hyped\u201d rant to a friend. Thus, purely as a qualitative matter, the present case is distinguishable from <em>Rideau </em>in that Kingman\u2019s voicemail message cannot fairly be characterized as his \u201ctrial\u201d to those who heard it. But more importantly, his \u201cconfession\u201d during the message was not broadcast or printed \u201crepeatedly and in depth.\u201d In fact, it was broadcast briefly, and only once, on television. Likewise, it was quoted only once in the newspaper (twice, if one also considers the short quotations taken from \u201ccharging documents\u201d in the second article). Importantly, these instances occurred early on, and long before trial. On these facts, we will not presume that the entire jury pool was prejudiced against Kingman.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b650 Third, Kingman argues that the fundraising efforts for Overby are evidence that the community was inflamed by the pretrial publicity. He quotes in part from <em>Maine v. Super. Ct. of Mendocino Co., </em>438 P.2d 372 (Cal. 1968), wherein the California Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">One of the victims, the girl, was discovered on a public road nearly unconscious with bullet wounds about her neck and head. Her condition was critical and several complicated operations were performed to save her life. Local citizens immediately organized a fund to help the girl\u2019s parents defray the medical expenses, and the Ukiah Daily Journal, the local newspaper, urged every citizen to contribute. It is no small measure of the community\u2019s laudable warmth and generosity that a substantial sum was quickly raised, mostly in modest contributions. We do not hold it to be an invariable rule that sympathy for a victim demonstrates antipathy to the alleged perpetrators of an offense. But such pervasive civic involvement in the fate of a victim, particularly when the events all transpire in a relatively small community, is a strong indication that the venue should be changed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Maine, </em>438 P.2d at 378-79 (footnote omitted). In the present case, Overby\u2019s friends placed donation jars in several local bars and at Poor Richard\u2019s News on Main Street, set up a fund at Big Sky Western Bank, and organized a benefit in Big Sky that raised $5,800. As Kingman notes, these fundraising activities are a tribute to the kindness and generosity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>people of Gallatin County. Kingman has not shown, however, that they constitute such \u201cpervasive civic involvement\u201din Overby\u2019s fate as to justify a presumption of communitywide antipathy toward Kingman. There is no evidence that the media or Overby\u2019s friends \u201curged every citizen to contribute.\u201d In fact, Kingman has produced no evidence as to how many individuals provided contributions and how much of the community was involved in the fundraising. It bears repeating that \u201ca motion for change of venue requires ... fact-specific proof by the moving party.\u201d <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">\u00b651  Lastly, Kingman argues that the publicity\u2019s pervasiveness and prejudicial effect is evidenced by the 27 questionnaire respondents who marked that, as a result of what they had seen, read, heard, or discussed about the case, they had formed an opinion that would affect their ability to serve as jurors. He also posits that the 96 respondents who indicated that they had seen, read, or heard something about the case \u201ccould be predisposed toward conviction.\u201dRegarding this latter point, he asserts that \u201csocial science has repeatedly correlated potential jurors\u2019 exposure to pretrial publicity and prejudgment of criminal defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even if such a correlation exists, however, it does not justify presuming in this case that Kingman could not obtain an unbiased jury in Gallatin County. Showing that some of the potential jurors know about the case does not suffice to demonstrate that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervaded the community. <em>See Stafford, </em>34 F.3d at 1567. Moreover, Kingman reads way more into the questionnaire responses than is warranted. Nearly a third of the respondents indicated that they had not seen, read, or heard anything about the case, and nearly three-quarters of the respondents indicated that they had not formed an opinion that would affect their ability to serve as jurors. These numbers belie a presumption that the entire jury pool was corrupted by anti-Kingman press coverage. Even with regard to the 27 persons who indicated that they <em>had </em>formed an opinion, this question is not very useful in assessing prejudice. As the District Court noted, the question provides no insight into what the juror\u2019s opinion was, why the juror believed that opinion would affect his or her ability to serve, and whether the juror could lay that opinion aside and render a verdict based on the evidence presented. As we have pointed out before, it is not required that jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues or that jurors be without any impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. Indeed, the mere existence of a preconceived notion as to the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence, without more, is insufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality. The relevant question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>whether the juror can lay aside his or her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. <em>Devlin, </em>\u00b6 32. The questionnaire responses here do not show that the jury pool was firmly predisposed to convict Kingman.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b652  Kingman raises a few other considerations, none of which merits discussion. In light of all the facts and circumstances discussed above, we hold under the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kingman\u2019s motion to change venue based on presumed prejudice. Kingman\u2019s evidence of pretrial publicity and community sentiment does not even come close to meeting the high standard necessary to establish such prejudice. There is no indication that the Gallatin County populace was incensed. Nor is there any evidence of \u201ca circus atmosphere or lynch mob mentality\u201d directed at Kingman. He has not shown that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervaded the jury pool. More to the point, he has not demonstrated that the complained-of publicity effectively displaced the judicial process and dictated the community\u2019s opinion as to his guilt or innocence. Indeed, Kingman\u2019s claim of presumed prejudice is substantially refuted by the fact that he ultimately was <em>acquitted </em>of the more serious charge of attempted deliberate homicide and convicted instead of the lesser included offense of aggravated assault. \u2018It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors\u2019 actions run counter to that presumption.\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b653 <em>Issue 2. Whether Kingman\u2019s right of dignity under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s arguments during sentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b654 At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor recommended the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. As justification, he pointed to the \u201csavage nature\u201d of the beating, the severity of the injuries suffered by Overby, Kingman\u2019s \u201canimalistic voice\u201d describing in the voicemail message how much joy and satisfaction he felt, and the fact that the next morning Kingman asked the physician who attended to his injured hand (and who later testified at trial) \u201cwhether he would be able to punch again.\u201dThe prosecutor also cited Kingman\u2019s criminal history, the violent nature of some of his past offenses, his failure to comply with the terms and conditions of his previous probation, and the need to protect the public. Finally, the prosecutor discussed the psychological evaluations of Kingman, which found that he had problems with anger and impulse control, especially when under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Then, to sum up his argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">The basis for this recommendation is very simple, and it\u2019s based upon a very simple concept. Some animals need to be caged. Some creatures are so dangerous that society can\u2019t risk them being amongst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>us. What Mr. Kingman did in September of 2008 is inhuman. No one does that. He does not need to be treated with any sort of respect or admiration. When he\u2019s over at the Detention Center acting up, pounding on walls, breaking sprinkler heads,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he\u2019s acting as the State has just characterized him-as a caged animal. And that\u2019s where he needs to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b655 Defense counsel, as noted, took issue with the prosecutor\u2019s characterizations. He argued that it is downright offensive and wrong to label anyone as \u201can animal that needs to be locked up in a cage.\u201d Counsel noted that \u2018tp]eople in this country are afforded at least some measure of human dignity. And regardless of what they\u2019ve done, ... they\u2019re still people.\u201d Counsel then argued for less than the maximum sentence in light of the fact that Kingman initially had attempted to walk away from the altercation with Overby but Overby continued to provoke and shove Kingman from behind. Counsel asserted that \u201cthis is not a case of Mr. Kingman walking down the street and randomly attacking someone. This is a case of self-defense gone too far.\u201d Counsel then went on to discuss Kingman\u2019s difficult family background, his problems with chemical dependency, and the findings in the psychological reports that his personality disorders are treatable. Counsel argued that Kingman\u2019s potential to be a productive member of society would be wasted if he were given the maximum sentence. Counsel recommended five years. Kingman then gave a statement in which he apologized to Overby and Overby\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b656 In pronouncing sentence, the District Court acknowledged Kingman\u2019s personality disorders and the positive prognosis for rehabilitation. The court also noted Kingman\u2019s willingness to take responsibility for his actions and his honest expressions of remorse for what he had done. Nevertheless, the court imposed the maximum sentence of 20 years at Montana State Prison. In so doing, the court explained that none of the factors identified by Kingman and his counsel mitigated his culpability. \u2018The circumstances of this crime are outrageous; they\u2019re aggravated; they are intolerable. They cannot be mitigated or explained by the defendant\u2019s social history or excused by his use or abuse of alcohol and drugs.\u201d The court observed that Kingman\u2019s \u201cactions were deliberate. He did not walk away when he could have. He totally lost control of himself, and he continued to beat Mr. Overby after he was down on the ground.\u201dMoreover, after the attack, Kingman \u201cwas not horrified by what he had done or how he had responded. Instead, he was thrilled with the effect of what he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>and how he continued to beat Paul Overby like \u2018Rocky punching wet meat.\u2019 \u201d The court also factored into its consideration the severity of the injuries inflicted by Kingman and his \u201csignificant criminal history\u201d involving violence and anger mixed with drug and alcohol abuse. In addition, the court noted Kingman\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the terms and conditions of his previous probation and his instances of misconduct and property damage while incarcerated on the current offense. The court found that Kingman \u201ccannot currently function in the community,\u201d he \u2018is a danger to any community in which he stays with his anger uncontrolled and his alcohol and drug abuse unchecked,\u201d and he \u201crequires long-term incarceration to protect\u201d the victim and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b657 Kingman contends on appeal that in order to secure the maximum sentence, the prosecutor \u201cdehumanized\u201d Kingman by referring to him as an \u201canimal\u201d that \u2018heeds to be caged.\u201d Kingman contends that this violated his right to human dignity under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution, which states: \u2018The dignity of the human being is inviolable....\u201dKingman requests that we vacate his sentence and remand his case for resentencing before a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b658 At the outset, certain of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing clearly pushed the bounds of proper argument. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that Kingman \u201cdoes not need to be treated with any sort of respect\u201d is both wrong and inappropriate, and we categorically reject it. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the court ought to view Kingman as an \u201canimal\u201d needing to be \u201ccaged\u201d is likewise inappropriate. As we have recognized, treatment which degrades or demeans persons, that is, treatment which deliberately reduces the value of persons, and which fails to acknowledge their worth as persons, directly violates their dignity. <em>Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6 81, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872. \u201c \u2018The reformation and prevention functions of punishment both express the community\u2019s disrespect for <em>the actions </em>of the criminal, but the processes of punishment must never disrespect <em>the core humanity </em>of the prisoner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, </em>\u00b6 81 (emphases added) (quoting Matthew O. Clifford &amp; Thomas P. Huff, <em>Some Thoughts on the Meaning and Scope of the Montana Constitution\u2019s \u2018Dignity\u201d Clause with Possible Applications , </em>61 Mont. L. Rev. 301, 331 (2000)). These principles apply no less to the proceeding in which the appropriate punishment is determined, and argument which, in that context, deliberately reduces the value of the convicted defendant or disrespects the defendant\u2019s core humanity is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b659 That being said, we cannot agree with Kingman\u2019s premise that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks-offensive\u201d as they may have been-actually played any part in the District Court\u2019s decision to impose the maximum sentence. For one thing, defense counsel made a point of arguing to the court that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>could not sentence Kingman based on the notion that he is an \u201canimal.\u201d Furthermore, in reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, the court did not even acknowledge the \u201canimal\u201d remarks. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">Chief Deputy County Attorney Whipple has argued that the case has to be considered under its own facts and circumstances, that this defendant is <em>a dangerous individual, </em>who has spent a number of years in and out of prison in California; who has a history of anger issues and severe drug and alcohol abuse and committed this crime while extremely intoxicated, that he has continued to <em>act out in anger </em>even while participating in counseling and receiving medication for his mental health issues. The State feels that it is imperative that he not have an opportunity to hurt anyone else. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoau\">Finally, the court\u2019s articulated reasons make it clear that the court based Kingman\u2019s sentence on the \u2018heinous\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d nature of the offense, the severity of the injuries inflicted on Overby, Kingman\u2019s initial \u201cthrill\u201d over what he had done, his criminal history, his pattern of violence and anger mixed with drug and alcohol abuse, and the danger that he posed to the community. These are all valid considerations when sentencing. <em>See </em>\u00a746-18-101, MCA; <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 72,342 Mont. 1,180 P.3d 1102 (a sentencing court may consider evidence relating to the crime, the defendant\u2019s character, background history, mental and physical condition, and any other evidence the court considers to have probative force).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b660  Kingman notes in his opening brief that he \u201cclaims no improper action on the part of the district court in regard to his sentencing.\u201d His claim, therefore, appears to be that when a prosecutor makes improper argument at sentencing, the defendant is entitled to be resentenced (by a different judge) even though the prosecutor\u2019s remarks had no influence on the trial court\u2019s decision to impose the concededly legal sentence that the defendant received. It is questionable whether such a rule would serve any remedial purpose. But, in any event, we decline to adopt this rule in the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b661 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kingman\u2019s motion for change of venue. Furthermore, Kingman is not entitled to be resentenced based on his dignity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b662 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> To avoid the gratuitous recitation of expletives, Kingman\u2019s repeated and varied usages of the word \u2018fuck\u201d have been abbreviated, as indicated. The message is otherwise quoted verbatim from the audio recording contained in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\"> Of course, \u201cwe may interpret a provision of the Montana Constitution to afford greater protection than that afforded by its federal counterpart.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6 20, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766. Hence, there may be circumstances in which a change of venue is mandated by Montana law although the same is not required by federal law.
