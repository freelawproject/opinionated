The defendants will be collectively referred to as \u2018Cokedale\u201d except when it is necessary to differentiate between the two. We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err in awarding summary judgment to Cokedale for Boehm\u2019s failure to prosecute the action in the name of the real party in interest?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Defendants?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b64 In 2005, Boehm purchased a 20-acre tract of land west of Livingston, Montana. At Boehm\u2019s request, the sellers deeded the property to \u2018Carter Boehm, Trustee.\u201d Cokedale owns a larger parcel of land nearby and uphill from the Boehm tract. During construction of a road up a steep hillside to reach Cokedale\u2019s land, rocks of various sizes rolled downhill into a creek and onto the Boehm property. Defendant Allen Carter was associated with Cokedale in developing its property and constructing the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\u00b65 Boehm sued Cokedale for property damages caused by the rocks, and on April 10,2009, filed a First Amended Complaint adding claims for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Those tort claims were based upon allegations that Carter and others \u201cknocked Plaintiffs glasses from his head, knocked his cell phone, on which he was speaking from his hand, and punched and kicked Plaintiff.\u201dNeither complaint alleged any facts concerning the purported trust. On May 4, 2009, Cokedale filed a request for a more definite statement of the claim, raising the issue whether \u2018Carter Boehm, Trustee\u201d was the real party in interest. In a pleading filed June 24, 2009, Boehm objected to providing a more definite statement, representing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">The real property at issue is held in the name of Carter Boehm, Trustee. <em>No trust exists </em>inasmuch as the designation of ownership in the name of a trustee is a convenience permitted under Montana law for the purpose of holding acquiring and holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>[sic] real property in <em>anticipation of establishing a trust </em>for purpose of ownership. Accordingly, <em>this suit is brought by Carter Boehm personally and as owner of the real property at issue.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApR\">(Emphasis supplied.) Contrary to these representations, Boehm did not seek to amend the complaint to include himself as a plaintiff in his personal capacity. The District Court denied the motion for a more definite statement, but directed the plaintiff to cooperate during discovery to address Cokedale\u2019s concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b66 During discovery, Boehm testified that it is his practice when he purchases real property to have the seller name him as a \u201ctrustee\u201d in the deed. This, he said, is based on advice given him by an unnamed lawyer in Virginia in the 1980s. He also testified that as to the property involved in this action, there was no document that created the trust; that he did not know of any terms of the trust; that he did not know whether the trust was revocable or irrevocable; and that the trust had never filed a tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b67 After a period of discovery including depositions of the principal parties, on February 12,2010, Cokedale moved for summary judgment, asking that either Carter Boehm be named the plaintiff as the real party in interest or, if not, that the action be dismissed. Cokedale argued that discovery had not uncovered any facts supporting the existence of a trust and that therefore under M. R. Civ. P. 17(a), \u2018Carter Boehm, Trustee\u201d was not the real party in interest. In addition, Cokedale argued that since Boehm continued to maintain the action as a trustee, he could not maintain the personal tort claims for infliction of emotional distress or assault. Boehm resisted Cokedale\u2019s motion for summary judgment, arguing now that there was a valid trust under Montana law and that he could sue on all the claims in the amended complaint as a trustee. Boehm did not seek to amend the complaint to include himself as a plaintiff in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"Amk\">\u00b68 The District Court held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment on September 30,2010. Boehm\u2019s attorney argued that there was in fact a valid trust under Montana law and that it arose when Boehm took the property through a deed which identified him as \u2018Carter Boehm, Trustee.\u201d Counsel asserted that Boehm requested the sellers name him as a \u201ctrustee\u201d based upon legal advice Boehm obtained at some time in the past in another state. Counsel further asserted that Boehm was both trustee and beneficiary of the trust, and that the purpose of the trust was for \u2018holding, further conveying, supervising that property.\u201d While acknowledging that Boehm never signed any document creating the trust, counsel argued the trust was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>created \u201cas a matter of law\u201d when Boehm took the deed identifying him as a \u201ctrustee.\u201dAt the hearing the District Court gave Boehm\u2019s attorney the option to amend the complaint to add Boehm individually as a plaintiff, but counsel declined because he had no authority from Boehm to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b69 Thereafter, the District Court issued its Order on Summary Judgment, concluding that Boehm was not the trustee of any trust validly established under Montana law. The District Court found the purported trust had no named beneficiary or process for naming one as required by \u00a772-33-206, MCA; did not satisfy the statute of frauds requirement of \u00a7 72-33-208, MCA; and was not a trust created by operation of law. Since Boehm was perpetuating the lawsuit on behalf of a non-existent trust, the District Court granted Cokedale\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b610 The District Court then determined that Boehm\u2019s action had forced \u2018basically innocent Defendants\u201d to endure unnecessary expense and stress to defend themselves and that equity demanded a remedy. The District Court noted that Boehm had deliberately chosen throughout the case to assert he could maintain the action as a \u201ctrustee\u201d and that Boehm had opposed all efforts to clarify the situation. Boehm\u2019s arguments about his capacity throughout the case caused much briefing and other proceedings that were \u201csuperfluous and unnecessary.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court awarded Cokedale their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred since their Motion for More Definite Statement. The District Court\u2019s Judgment, entered February 9, 2011, awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Cokedale in the amount of $51,473.69 and to Carter in the amount of $23,616.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b611 On appeal, Boehm asserts the District Court erred in its determination that there was no valid trust, leading to dismissal of the action, and improperly awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to Cokedale.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b612 This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center Montana, Inc., </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to determine whether the award was an abuse of discretion. <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 41, 338 Mont. 402, 168 P.3d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b613 Issue 1: <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to </em>Cokedale? Cokedale\u2019s motion for summary judgment was based on M. R. Civ. P. 17(a). Cokedale contended that \u2018Carter Boehm, Trustee\u201d was not the real party in interest because Boehm was not the trustee of a valid trust, and that the tort claims for personal injury could not be maintained by a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b614 It is clear the District Court properly concluded that Boehm was not the trustee of a valid trust. Boehm admitted in discovery the alleged trust was \u201cundisclosed,\u201d was not in writing, had no identifiable terms, and never filed a tax return. While a trust may be created by the declaration of a property owner that he holds the property as a trustee, \u00a7 72-33-201(1), MCA, creation of that trust is \u201c[s]ubject to other provisions\u201d of the trust code. Those other statutory provisions, missing here-as evidenced by the \u201ctrust\u201d Boehm described in his deposition-include a proper manifestation of a trustor to create a trust (\u00a7 72-33-202, MCA); a trust purpose that can be determined with reasonable certainty (\u00a772-33-205, MCA); a designated beneficiary or a trust instrument providing a way to determine the beneficiary (\u00a772-33-206, MCA); and either a written instrument signed by the trustee or the trustor (\u00a7 72-33-208(1) and (2), MCA); or a trust created by operation of law (\u00a7 72-33-208(3), MCA). While Boehm argues that a trust exists by operation of law, he has provided no facts to support the existence of a resulting trust (\u00a7\u00a772-33-216, -217 and -218, MCA) or a constructive trust (\u00a772-22-219, MCA). <em>Hilliard v. Hilliard, </em>255 Mont. 487, 488-89, 844 P.2d 54, 55 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b615 The party alleging the existence of any trust must establish it by clear and convincing evidence that is practically free from doubt. <em>LeFeber v. Johnson, </em>2009 MT 188, \u00b6 27, 351 Mont. 75, 209 P.3d 254. Boehm\u2019s evidence offered to support the existence of a trust in this case fell far short of that standard and the purported trust does not meet the clear requirements of Montana law. Therefore, the District Court properly concluded that Carter Boehm was not the trustee of a valid trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b616 Boehm also argued that he could maintain claims against Cokedale for assault and battery, negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Quite clearly, those claims were based upon alleged personal injury to Carter Boehm, the individual. Boehm has not provided any authority that a person may sue as a \u201ctrustee\u201d for his own personal injury simply because the alleged injuries occurred on property he claims to hold in trust. Absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>such authority, we decline to further consider any contention that the complaint did not need to name Boehm in his individual capacity. <em>See In re Estate of Harmon, </em>2011 MT 84, \u00b6 28, 360 Mont. 150, 253 P.3d 821; <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 30, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998; M. R. App. P. 12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b617 M. R. Civ. P. 17(a) requires that \u201c[e]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d That rule further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest, and such ratification, joinder or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">An important purpose of this rule in civil litigation is to insure the finality of judgments and to prevent a party from being subjected to multiple suits by persons not bound by the action. <em>Gordon v. Hedman, </em>277 Mont. 96, 100, 918 P.2d 680, 682 (1996); <em>Intown Properties Mgmt., Inc. v. Wheaton Van Lines, Inc., </em>271 F.3d 164, 170 (4th Cir. 2001). (Montana\u2019s Rule 17 is identical to the same rule in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.) The Rule\u2019s caution against dismissal is intended to avoid forfeiture of just claims when \u201can honest mistake has been made in choosing the party in whose name the action is filed,\u201din cases where determination of the proper party to bring suit is difficult, or where an understandable mistake has been made. <em>Intown, </em>271 F.3d at 170-71. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that he is the real party in interest. <em>Osrecovery, Inc. v. One Groupe International, Inc., </em>380 F.Supp. 2d 243, 247 (S. D. N. Y. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b618 Therefore, the named plaintiff must be given a reasonable time \u201cafter an objection has been made under Rule 17\u201din which to cure any defect as to the real party in interest. <em>Gordon, </em>277 Mont. at 101, 918 P.2d at 683. The determination of what constitutes a reasonable time after the opposing party raises the Rule 17 issue is left to the discretion of the court. <em>Osrecovery, </em>380 F.Supp. 2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b619 In the present case, a year and a half elapsed between the time Cokedale first raised the real party in interest issue in its motion for a more definite statement (May 4,2009) and the hearing on the motion for summary judgment (September 30, 2010). Thereafter, additional time elapsed until the District Court issued its order on summary judgment (November 1, 2010). In all this time Boehm did nothing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>amend the complaint to join the lawsuit as a plaintiff in his personal capacity, and was unable to provide any substantial evidence to support his contention that he was the trustee of a valid trust or did not otherwise need to be named for his personal injury claims. A year and a half is well beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d contemplated under Rule 17(a), and in such a situation dismissal is appropriate. <em>Metal Forming Technologies, Inc. v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>224 F.R.D. 431, 437-38 (S.D. Ind. 2004) (failure to take affirmative steps to add the real party in interest for 14 months was not reasonable and warranted dismissal). At the conclusion of the summary judgment hearing, Boehm\u2019s attorney suggested he would consider amending the complaint if the District Court were inclined to determine that \u2018Carter Boehm, Trustee\u201d was not the real party in interest. By that time, however, the \u201creasonable time\u201d provided for in Rule 17(a) had expired and Boehm had rejected the District Court\u2019s express offer to agree to join the action individually. Even after the hearing, Boehm did not seek to join as a plaintiff prior to the court\u2019s decision on the motion. The District Court did not err in denying Boehm yet another opportunity to do what should have been done more than a year before.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">\u00b620  Moreover, this is not a case where there was any difficulty determining the identity of the real party in interest, or in which an honest mistake was made identifying the real party in interest. Boehm does not even claim that there was any such difficulty or mistake. Rather, he clings to the fiction that he was trustee of a trust who could maintain the claims in this case based upon legal advice he obtained in another state in the 1980s. Boehm has not presented any legal or even tactical justification for not joining as a plaintiff in the lawsuit in his personal capacity and for insisting that he is suing only on behalf of a trust. Boehm could have saved his lawsuit from dismissal simply by including himself as a plaintiff in his individual capacity, but refused to avail himself of multiple opportunities to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b621 The District Court properly dismissed the action under M. R. Civ. P. 17(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court properly award attorneys\u2019 fees to Cokedale and Carter?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b623 The District Court awarded costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to Cokedale and Carter because Boehm\u2019s maintaining that the action was brought on behalf of a trust caused \u201cexorbitant and unnecessary expense and stress by basically innocent Defendants forced to take on the expense of litigation.\u201d The District Court concluded that all briefing and proceedings related to the trust issue were \u201csuperfluous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>unnecessary,\u201d and awarded all attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Cokedale and Carter from the date of the motion for a more definite statement through the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. As previously noted, the total award to both defendants was approximately $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b624 Boehm argues the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was unjustified because the underlying claims of trespass and property damage arising from the road construction were not frivolous. He further argues the District Court did not provide any justification for departing from the general rule that a prevailing party is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees absent a reason to apply the narrow exception of <em>Foy v. Anderson, </em>176 Mont. 507, 580 P.2d 114 (1978). Boehm also notes the District Court improperly relied upon irrelevant findings that he was an overly litigious member of the \u201coblivious wealthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b625 Cokedale argues the District Court was correct in the conclusion that Boehm\u2019s positions on the trust and real party in interest issues were not well taken and required unnecessary discovery and litigation. Cokedale analogizes this to the attorneys\u2019 fee award affirmed in <em>Zier v. Lewis, </em>2009 MT 266, 352 Mont. 76, 218 P.3d 465, where the defendant was forced into litigation to \u201cprove the obvious.\u201d Cokedale also relies upon \u00a737-61-421, MCA, which allows an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against a party who \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b626 As noted, Montana applies the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that a prevailing party in civil litigation is not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees absent authorization by statute or contract. <em>Kennedy v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 265, \u00b6 52, 296 Mont. 430, 989 P.2d 390. Here the court offered no statutory or contractual basis for awarding fees. In Noy this Court held that a district court dismissing an action has equitable power to grant \u201ccomplete relief\u2019 to make a party whole, and that this includes the power to award attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Foy, </em>176 Mont. at 511-12, 580 P.2d at 116-17. The equitable power described in <em>Foy </em>is a narrow exception to the general rule. <em>Zier </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b627 In the present case, the District Court provided little factual analysis and no legal analysis to support a departure from the rule that a prevailing party is not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Unlike <em>Zier </em>and <em>Foy, </em>the underlying action here, arising from trespass and damage caused by Cokedale\u2019s road building, was not frivolous. It is undisputed Cokedale built the road and, during the process, rocks rolled downhill onto Boehm\u2019s property. This Court has recognized that exceptions to the American Rule should be applied only in rare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>instances and only when a party has been forced to defend against a wholly frivolous or malicious action. <em>Estate of Pruyn v. Axmen Propane, Inc., </em>2009 MT 448, \u00b6 72, 354 Mont. 208, 223 P.3d 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b628 In addition, even though Boehm\u2019s position on the trust issue could and should have been resolved early in the litigation, the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees was not limited to fees incurred in resolving that issue. Rather, the fee award covered all fees incurred between the time of the motion for a more definite statement and the summary judgment hearing a year and a half later. During that time, the parties engaged in general discovery and filed motions on numerous issues, not all of which involved the trust issue and some of which were decided in Boehm\u2019s favor. Finally, we decline to apply \u00a737-61-421, MCA, because the District Court did not base the attorneys\u2019 fee award on that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b629  Therefore, the District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Cokedale and Carter and the award of fees is reversed. Boehm does not separately contend the District Court\u2019s award of costs was error, and the award of costs to Cokedale and Carter is affirmed. Section 25-10-103, MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE, MORRIS and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
