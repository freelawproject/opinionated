Daniels (Daniels) appeals from the conviction and judgment for deliberate homicide entered following jury trial in the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Carbon County. In defense, Daniels asserted justifiable use of force. We affirm and restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err in its rulings regarding the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>admissibility of character evidence of the victim in violation of the Rules of Evidence and Daniels\u2019 constitutional rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by refusing Daniels\u2019proposed jury instructions on justifiable use of force in defense of an occupied structure and burglary as a forcible felony?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b64 In April 2009, the Daniels family rented a ten-acre property in Fromberg, Montana. Daniels, age 66, Buddy (Daniels\u2019 adult son, age 43), Logan (Daniels\u2019 son, age 14), and Hagen (Buddy\u2019s son, age 13), lived together on the property. Daniels and Logan had recently moved to Montana from California, and the property was rented by Daniels so that the Daniels family could live together. Two residential structures were on the property, including a north house consisting of an apartment and attached shop, and the main house located to the south. Buddy, Logan, and Hagen lived in the main house, while Daniels resided in the apartment in the north house.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b65 Daniels and Buddy had plans to develop the property, and on the morning of May 21, 2009, they went to Billings to purchase lumber to build corrals. Daniels and Buddy drank beer while driving home, stopping to buy food and supplies for Logan and Hagen. They stopped at a bar and drank beer and liquor with friends until around 8:00 p.m. According to the bartender, everyone \u201cseemed to be getting along great.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b66 Later, Daniels, Buddy, Logan and Hagen gathered at the main house for dinner. Logan testified that Daniels and Buddy were intoxicated. An argument ensued during dinner over Daniels incorrectly remembering Logan\u2019s birthday and not being \u201ca good grandpa\u201d to Hagen. The argument escalated, with Buddy asking Daniels to leave the main house, and Daniels refusing. Buddy broke two chairs and Daniels threw a beer at Buddy. Buddy then struck Daniels and wrestled him to the ground, pinning him there and telling him to leave. Buddy then rolled or drug Daniels down the stairs. Daniels testified he did not remember being struck, only that he ended up at the bottom of the stairs. The argument continued as Daniels and Buddy moved into the mud room. Hagen testified \u201cit kind of toned down a little bit\u201d and that neither person seemed to be hurt. Daniels headed to his house, with Buddy following. Hagen testified that he and Logan decided to \u201cseparate\u201d Daniels and Buddy, and the boys started to go towards Daniels\u2019 house. Daniels went into his house and was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>only witness to the events that occurred inside the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b67 Daniels testified that he \u201cwent straight to the refrigerator and grabbed a beer,\u201d and went upstairs. He said he was quite upset, took a .22 pistol out of a holster and sat on his bed \u201cthinking about shooting myself.\u201d Daniels testified he heard the front door open and Buddy\u2019s angry voice. Buddy came up the stairs and verbally challenged Daniels. Daniels testified that when Buddy came up the stairs, Daniels said, \u2018No more. Go home. It\u2019s over. Go home. Get out of here.\u201d Daniels told police \u2018tb]y that time I\u2019m around on this side of my bed at my nightstand and my pistol lays right there. I picked up my pistol and I said Bud, just leave and leave me alone. He said fuck you and your pistol. I\u2019ll shove that mother fucker up your ass and he come toward me, pop, pop.\u201d Daniels testified Buddy \u201cstraight-arm[ed] me in the chest,\u201d and the pistol went in the air and he pulled the trigger \u201cto protect myself.\u201d Daniels told police that he fired three shots ten feet from Buddy. He told police his intent was to \u2018Tg]et away from him\u201d and \u201cto stop him,\u201d and that \u2018fa]ny time you pick up a gun and you pop a cap, your intent is to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b68 After the shooting, Daniels went downstairs. Logan and Hagen came through the doorway and Daniels told them to leave. Logan and Hagen testified that Daniels said that he had just shot and killed Buddy. Daniels called 911, telling the dispatcher: \u2018He\u2019s wantin\u2019 to beat me up all the time and he owes me a ton of money and arguin\u2019 about this and one thing another. He ripped my shirt off of me and he shoved me down the stairs one thing another and I... I come over to my little house and he followed me up here gonna kick my ass one thing another and I said leave me alone. I can\u2019t out.. I can\u2019t beat you. I\u2019m too old. I can\u2019t whip him anymore. I picked up my gun, he said oh fuck you. What ya gonna do with that gun you know and blah, blah and I said I... I ain\u2019t gonna do it anymore. I\u2019m tired of it. Then I pulled the trigger. I\u2019m guilty 100%.\u201d Daniels testified he remembered telling the 911 dispatcher he was \u201cone hundred percent guilty,\u201d and meant that \u201cI had shot my son. I knew that I had done this. I was not looking for any kind of defense at the time. I was not looking for justification. I was just-yes, I did it.\u201d A trooper who arrived at the scene testified that Daniels\u2019 demeanor struck him as almost j ovial and upbeat, and Daniels \u201casked if [the trooper] could get him a beer because it might be the last one that he would ever have.\u201d Six hours after the shooting Daniels\u2019 blood alcohol content was 0.08. Daniels was arrested at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b69 Daniels had an abrasion on his left elbow, and no other injuries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Buddy had two gunshot wounds, one to the back of his head at the base of his skull-which the forensic pathologist/medical examiner, Dr. Thomas Bennett, believed was sustained first-and a second gunshot wound to the middle of his back. The third bullet went into the ceiling. The gunshot to the back of Buddy\u2019s head struck and fractured the base of the skull. Dr. Bennett testified that the shot to Buddy\u2019s skull probably took place when he was upright, and it would have rendered Buddy immediately unconscious and caused him to fall directly to the ground. Dr. Bennett believed Buddy was still alive at that point and his heart would still have been beating. Dr. Bennett opined the second shot to the middle of his back occurred when Buddy was on the ground. According to Dr. Bennett, this shot broke two ribs and perforated Buddy\u2019s lung, causing his chest cavity to fill with blood. Dr. Bennett believed both shots were fired very close in time. Dr. Bennett believed the first shot was fired from a distance of \u201cat least four to five feet or more,\u201d and the second shot was fired from a closer distance of approximately a foot and a half away. Injuries sustained from the two gunshot wounds caused Buddy\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b610 The State filed an Information charging Daniels with deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State later amended the Information to alternatively charge mitigated deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a745-5-103, MCA. Daniels pled not guilty to the charges and filed notice of his intent to rely on the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. The State filed a motion in limine to prohibit Daniels from referencing testimony regarding Buddy\u2019s alleged character for violence until a proper foundation had been laid by Daniels, and Daniels sought an order excluding \u201cany argument by the prosecution that would tend to shift the burden of proof.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) The District Court entered preliminary rulings and deferred final rulings until trial. In January 2010, a six-day jury trial was conducted, during which Daniels testified. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the charge of deliberate homicide. The District Court sentenced Daniels to 60 years in Montana State Prison, with a condition that he be ineligible for parole for 20 years. Daniels appeals. Additional facts as necessary will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b611 A district court has broad discretion when determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. Generally, we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Dist. Ct. of the Eighteenth Jud. Dist., </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 31,358 Mont. 325,246 P.3d 415. A district court abuses its discretion if it \u201cacts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19. Tn exercising its discretion, however, the trial court is bound by the Rules of Evidence or applicable statutes. Thus, to the extent the court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>see also Dist. Ct. of the Eighteenth Jud. Dist., </em>\u00b6 31. Our review is plenary for questions regarding constitutional law. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>2009 MT 427, \u00b6 50,354 Mont. 63, 221 P.3d 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err in its rulings regarding the admissibility of character evidence of the victim in violation of the Rules of Evidence and Daniels\u2019 constitutional rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">A. 2009 Legislative Changes</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b613 The central theme of Daniels\u2019 arguments is that the District Court erred by making rulings in violation of legislation enacted by the 2009 Legislature. HB 228 proposed an act \u201cpreserving and clarifying laws relating to the right of self-defense and the right to bear arms.\u201d Laws of Montana, 2009, ch. 332, at 2271 (emphasis omitted). Under prior law, the State bore the burden of proving the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, but it did not need to prove \u201cthe absence of justification.\u201d <em>State v. Henson, </em>2010 MT 136, \u00b6 33, 356 Mont. 458, 235 P.3d 1274 (citing <em>State v. Longstreth, </em>1999 MT 204, \u00b6 22, 295 Mont. 457, 984 P.2d 157; additional citation omitted). In <em>Longstreth, </em>we explained that \u201cas an affirmative defense, justifiable use of force requires the defendant to produce sufficient evidence on the issue to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt and that the State\u2019s burden is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offense charged, <em>which does not include the absence of justification.\u201d Longstreth, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u00b614 The sponsor of HB 228, Representative Kerns, indicated to the House Judiciary Committee that the bill \u201cshifts the burden to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>prosecutor to prove ... the absence of justification\u201d in self-defense claims. Mont. H. Comm, on Jud., <em>Hearing on H. Bill 228, </em>61st Legis., Reg. Sess., (Jan. 22,2009). Committee discussion on HB 228 expressly referred to <em>Longstreth. </em>Mont. H. Comm, on Jud., <em>Hearing on H. Bill </em>228,61st Legis., Reg. Sess., Exhibit 3, at 1-2 (Jan. 22,2009) (noting HB 228\u2019s provision on the burden of proof for justifiable use of force \u201cis important and needed to clarify law in Montana resulting from the 1999 <em>Longstreth </em>opinion by the Montana Supreme Court\u201d). Rep. Kerns explained that the \u201cmeat of the bill\u201d was that \u2018^ou are innocent until proven guilty in terms of self-defense. That the State must prove an absence of justification beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to self-defense claims. That\u2019s the foundation of our judicial system in this nation, and we\u2019re just specifying that it applies to self-defense claims as it does [to] every other aspect of the law.\u201d Mont. Sen. Comm, on Jud., <em>Hearing on H. Bill 228, </em>61st Legis., Reg. Sess., (Mar. 17, 2009). HB 228 included a provision which is now codified as \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">Justifiable use of force-burden of proof. In a criminal trial, when the defendant has offered evidence of justifiable use of force, the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s actions were not justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>See also </em>Laws of Montana, 2009, ch. 332, \u00a79, at 2275. The enactment of HB 228 effectively abrogated <em>Longstreth, Henson </em>and other cases to the extent they held that the burden of proof for the defense of justifiable use of force (JUOF) was on the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVY\">\u00b615  Daniels further argues that the passage of HB 228 \u201creversed the long-held rule in Montana that justifiable use of force\u201d is an affirmative defense, apparently because defendants have historically been required to prove affirmative defenses. <em>See State v. Gratzer, </em>209 Mont. 308, 318, 682 P.2d 141, 146 (1984). However, this argument overstates the effect of the legislation. Section 45-3-115, MCA, unchanged by HB 228, continues to provide that JUOF is an affirmative defense, which we have defined as \u201cone that admits the doing of the act charged, but seeks to justify, excuse or mitigate it.\u201d <em>State v. Nicholls, </em>200 Mont. 144, 150, 649 P.2d 1346, 1350 (1982). A defendant is still required to provide written notice to the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>of his intention to rely upon the defense of JUOF. Section 46-15-323(2), MCA. And, while the Legislature provided that the burden of proof can ultimately be shifted to the State, it placed the initial burden of evidence production upon the defendant. Under \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA (2009), the defendant has the initial burden to \u201coffer[] evidence of justifiable use of force\u201d before the burden of proof is shifted to the State. If the defendant offers no evidence, then he fails to satisfy his initial burden and the defense fails. <em>See </em>\u00a726-1-401, MCA (\u2018The initial burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side. Thereafter, the burden of producing evidence is on the party who would suffer a finding against him in the absence of further evidence.\u201d). Accordingly, though the ultimate burden of proof can be shifted to the State, JUOF still operates as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b616  We also disagree with Daniels\u2019 implication that by providing pre-trial notice of his intention to rely on JUOF as a defense, he satisfied his burden under \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA (2009), to \u201coffer[] evidence,\u201d and thereby shifted the burden of proof to the State. Notice does not place the defense of JUOF at issue during the trial. <em>City of Red Lodge v. Nelson, </em>1999 MT 246, \u00b6 13,296 Mont. 190, 989 P.2d 300; <em>State v. Logan, </em>156 Mont. 48, 65, 473 P.2d 833, 842 (1970) (the notice of self-defense served by defendant on the State pre-trial is immaterial and does not place the matter into issue during trial; defendant is not bound to rely on this defense at trial, notwithstanding service on the State).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">B. The District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b617 The thrust of Daniels\u2019 overlapping arguments is that the District Court erred in its rulings regarding the foundation required for the introduction of character evidence about Buddy. Before trial, the State filed a motion in limine requesting the court to \u201cissue an order prohibiting the Defendant at trial from referencing or soliciting testimony regarding the victim\u2019s alleged character for violence, including specific acts of violence, until a proper foundation is laid by the Defendant ....\u2019\u2019At hearing, the court noted the statement in <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2005 MT 120, \u00b6 20,327 Mont. 138,112 P.3d 1014, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>failure to establish the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s violent past rendered certain character evidence of the victim \u2018Irrelevant and inadmissible.\u201dDefense counsel argued that \u201cthere are various ways for a defendant to establish his knowledge of the violent nature of the victim. It doesn\u2019t have to be through the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d The court responded it felt it was a \u201csticky wicket\u201d in that fyou\u2019re asking someone else to really comment on what only the individual himself can readily establish.\u201d The State added that \u201ca distinction needs to be made at some point of reputation evidence and specific instances of violent behavior by the victim,\u201d stating that the State\u2019s concern was \u201cthe State\u2019s case being prejudiced by the introduction of specific acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">\u00b618 Relying on <em>Montgomery, </em>the court made an initial ruling on the State\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">[F]or evidence of the victim\u2019s character and propensity for violence to be admissible the evidence first must be related to the issue of the reasonableness of force used by the defendant. And at this point, the Court\u2019s assuming that based on the defendant\u2019s obvious indications that justifiable use of force is a defense in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">Secondly, the defendant must establish his knowledge of the violent nature of the alleged victim in order for that evidence to be admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">I will reserve how that must be established, but just for general guidance, it would seem that without the defendant\u2019s testimony in that regard, relative to what his understanding was, it may be difficult to show that. But I\u2019m keeping an open mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">And then finally, the defendant must show that this knowledge motivated his own level of force....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">So if the defendant fails to make that showing, the evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">During trial, prior to the State calling Hagen as a witness, Daniels indicated Hagen had knowledge of a previous act of violence by Buddy that Daniels wanted to inquire into on cross-examination. The court said it would disallow cross \u201cuntil there\u2019s some foundation laid for that pursuant to Montgomery and other cases. I thought about this previously, but I think the defendant is going to have to testify.\u201d Citing <em>State v. Cartwright, </em>200 Mont. 91, 650 P.2d 758 (1982) and <em>Logan, </em>the court concluded \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow it until that foundation is laid.\u201d However, during defense cross-examination, Hagen testified that Buddy had \u201c[a] little bit\u201d of a reputation for fighting, without objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>from the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b619 During Logan\u2019s testimony, the court sustained the State\u2019s objection to a defense question asking about Buddy\u2019s reputation \u2018for being a fighter.\u201d In the chambers conference which followed, defense counsel indicated \u201cI did not interpret your previous ruling to go to reputation,\u201d and the State argued \u201cI believe that reputation for violence only comes in ... once the defendant testifies and he says that he relied upon the defendant\u2019s reputation for violence and he acted upon that.\u201d The court responded \u201cit seems to me to be the appropriate way to go.\u201d Thereafter, questioning resumed, but no reference was made to Buddy\u2019s reputation for violence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b620 Thereafter, Daniels took the stand, and defense counsel asked: \u2018Do you know of any other instances in the past of Bud being violent to you?\u201d The State objected and, at the ensuing chambers conference, the court stated that the State\u2019s objection would be sustained because the level of testimony so far was \u2018insufficient foundation that what was going on in his mind was that he was recalling other specific instances of violence committed by this victim.\u201d Daniels\u2019 counsel then made an offer of proof of six instances of Buddy\u2019s past behavior he wished to admit. The court ruled that four of the six instances were more prejudicial than probative and would be excluded under M. R. Evid. 403.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also ruled that a 2007 Columbia Falls bar fight and a 2004 incident at a barbecue in Wyoming would be admissible upon the proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b621 However, when Daniels resumed testifying, he did not offer this foundation. Instead, counsel asked: \u2018TI]n your decision to shoot Bud, did you take into consideration his propensity for violence?\u201d Daniels answered \u2018Ty]es, I did.\u201d Defense counsel then asked if Buddy had a reputation for \u2018being violent,\u201d \u2018fighting,\u201d \u201ca short fuse,\u201d and \u2018holding grudges,\u201d to which Daniels answered \u201c[y]es, he does.\u201d Defense counsel then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Now when you decided to shoot, you had just come from the main house; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">[Daniels]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>[Defense counsel]: And so that was really what was on your mind, is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">[Daniels]: The events of that evening, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">[Defense counsel]: So you had just gotten beat up; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">[Daniels]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">[Defense counsel]: Is it fair to say your main motivating force that night was what happened that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">[Daniels]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Immediately thereafter, the parties met with the court in chambers and the State argued that, after this testimony, the specific instances of Buddy\u2019s character for violence had no probative value and would only be prejudicial. Daniels agreed and indicated <em>\u201cwe </em>chose to go away from specific acts and go through that. We went through general reputation. That\u2019s what we did.\u201dThe court confirmed that reputation evidence had been received \u201cobviously without objection, as to propensity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">i.) Rules of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\u00b622 Daniels challenges the District Court\u2019s ruling that he needed to testify in order to lay the foundation necessary for admission of Buddy\u2019s character evidence. He also contends the District Court abused its discretion by disallowing cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses on Buddy\u2019s reputation and acts of violence, asserting the rulings were premised on case law which has been overruled by HB 228.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">\u00b623 While HB 228 provides for shifting of the burden of proof of JU OF, the Montana Rules of Evidence still apply and \u201cgovern all proceedings in all courts in the state of Montana ...,\u201dM.

Rule 405 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">(a) Reputation or opinion. In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">(b) Specific instances of conduct. In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, or where the character of the victim relates to the reasonableness of force used by the accused in self defense, proof may also be made of specific instances of that person\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b624  Daniels first argues the court erred in disallowing defense cross-examination concerning specific instances of Buddy\u2019s violent conduct under Rule 405(a). As noted, the State called Hagen as a witness, and during the defense cross-examination, Hagen testified to Buddy1 s reputation for being a fighter without objection from the State. Daniels construes Rule 405(a) to permit <em>further </em>defense cross-examination about specific instances of Buddy\u2019s conduct because reputation evidence was elicited during earlier defense questioning of Hagen. In other words, Daniels argues that the last sentence of M. R. Evid. 405(a) permitted the defense to conduct cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>regarding specific instances of Buddy\u2019s conduct once the defense had elicited evidence of Buddy\u2019s reputation. We disagree with Daniels\u2019 interpretation of the Rule. Rule 405(a) permits cross-examination about specific instances of conduct by a party who is <em>adverse </em>to the witness\u2019 reputation or opinion testimony, not by the <em>same </em>party. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-101(1), MCA (emphases added) (\u201c\u2018Direct examination\u2019 is the <em>first </em>examination of a witness on a particular matter. \u2018Cross-examination\u2019 is the examination of a witness by a party <em>other than the direct examiner.\u201d)-, see also State v. Jones, </em>48 Mont. 505, 516,139 P. 441,445 (1914) (first emphasis in original) (\u201cAs the favorable [reputation] testimony tends to sustain the presumption of innocence which the law indulges in favor of the defendant, by introducing it the defendant tenders an issue of fact, <em>viz., </em>whether his reputation is such as the witnesses say it is, and the <em>prosecution </em>has the right to <em>cross-examine </em>the witnesses to ascertain the sufficiency of the grounds upon which they base their statements.\u201d). Otherwise, a party could offer reputation evidence and thereby open the door to further examination about specific instances, an interpretation which would swallow the rule. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b625 Daniels next argues that \u2018It]he court abused its discretion by disallowing [him] the ability, on cross-examination, to present evidence of specific acts of Buddy\u2019s violent past and reputation for violence\u201d until proper foundation had been laid by Daniels\u2019 testimony. (Emphasis omitted.) He argues the District Court erroneously relied on pre-HB 228 cases such as <em>Logan, Cartwright, </em>and <em>Montgomery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHO\">\u00b626 In <em>Logan, </em>the defendant was charged with first degree murder and had given notice of his intention to claim self-defense. <em>Logan, </em>156 Mont. at 52, 473 P.2d at 835. We held that evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation was admissible only after the issues of self-defense and the identity of the aggressor had been raised. <em>Logan, </em>156 Mont. at 64,473 P.2d at 842. Concluding the defendant had not yet joined these issues when making his offers of proof, \u201cno foundation then existed for the admission of this testimony\u201d and the district court properly excluded the evidence. <em>Logan, </em>156 Mont. at 65, 473 P.2d at 842. In <em>Cartwright, </em>the defendant challenged the district court\u2019s refusal of evidence of threats made by the victims and their family. <em>Cartwright, </em>200 Mont. at 103, 650 P.2d at 764. The defendant did not admit to the killing, stating only that he did \u201cnot remember firing any shots.\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>200 Mont. at 104, 650 P.2d at 765. Affirming, we held that \u201cthe accused must first lay a foundation that he acted in self defense before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>he can introduce evidence of the violent character of the victim\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted), noting Logan\u2019s statement that \u201c\u00a3[u]ntil such time as defendant took the stand and admitted the killing, the issue of self defense was not joined at the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>200 Mont, at 104,650 P.2d at 764-65 (quoting <em>Logan, </em>156 Mont. at 65, 473 P.2d at 842). In <em>Montgomery, </em>the defendant shot and killed a man in his home who turned out to be an individual the defendant had fought with earlier. <em>Montgomery, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. We held that the defendant \u201cmust establish that he knew he was shooting [the victim], that he knew of [the victim\u2019s] past violent conduct, and that his knowledge of this conduct led him to use the level of force he did.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>\u00b6 19. We concluded that evidence of the victim\u2019s past was \u201cirrelevant and inadmissible,\u201d since the defendant \u201cdid not establish that his knowledge of [the victim\u2019s] past led him to use the level of force he employed.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>\u00b6 20.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUF\">\u00b627 In contrast to Daniels\u2019 assertion that pre-HB 228 cases on foundation and relevance have been overruled, the discussions in <em>Montgomery, </em>reiterated in <em>Deschon </em>and <em>Henson, </em>as to the foundation required for admission of character evidence of the victim, remain good law. 'Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d M. R. Evid. 402. Consequently, \u2018ts]ince [the defendant] did not establish that his knowledge of [the victim\u2019s] past led him to use the level of force he employed, [the victim\u2019s] past was irrelevant and inadmissible.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>see also Deschon, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Henson, </em>\u00b6 27. While the burden may shift to the State to prove the absence of justification under \u00a746-16-131, MCA (2009), this burden does not eliminate the need to satisfy foundational requirements for the admissibility of evidence pursuant to the Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b628  The District Court did not err in requiring Daniels to lay a proper foundation, here, by testifying. Given the circumstances here, the court properly determined that Daniels\u2019 testimony was necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>to provide the requisite foundation for the evidence of Buddy\u2019s past which he initially intended to offer. Daniels fails to specifically demonstrate how the foundation for his proffered evidence could have otherwise been established, and therefore, we need not address whether the foundation could have been alternatively laid. And, in the end, Daniels did not offer evidence of the two incidents in Buddy\u2019s past which the District Court had approved following his offer of proof, but rather testified that it was the events of the evening in question which motivated his behavior. The District Court did not abuse its discretion,</p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">ii.) Constitutional arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b629 Daniels argues, Tb]y requiring Larry\u2019s testimony to provide foundation for Buddy\u2019s character and reputation, the court shifted the burden of proof to Larry,\u201d thereby violating his constitutional right to due process. Daniels argues sufficient objections exist for the review of this issue on direct appeal, but alternatively requests we apply plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b630 Daniels filed a pre-trial motion in limine requesting the court to exclude \u201cany argument by the prosecution that would tend to shift the burden of proof pursuant to the U.S. and Montana Constitutions and \u00a746-16-204, M.C.A.\u201d(Emphasis omitted.) Prior to opening statements at trial, the District Court granted Daniels\u2019 motion, stating: \u2018Then there\u2019s some question about shifting the burden of proof. I\u2019m going to believe that the State isn\u2019t going to attempt to do so. And if you think that the State is treading on thin ice in that regard, you need to let me know. But that request is granted.\u201dDaniels offered no objection during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b631 Generally, \u2018[a] defendant must make a timely objection to properly preserve an issue for appeal.\u201d <em>State v.

While \u201cwe have repeatedly approved the use of a motion in limine to preserve an objection for appeal \u2018provided the objecting party makes the basis for his objection clear to the district court,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Vukasin, </em>2003 MT 230, \u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 204, 75 P.3d 1284 (citation omitted), the objector is still obligated to make the basis and grounds for the objection clear to the court. <em>State v. Weeks, </em>270 Mont. 63, 85, 891 P.2d 477, 490 (1995). Further, the \u201cspecific objections must be made to portions of testimony deemed inappropriate; broad general objections do not suffice.\u201d <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont, at 85, 891 P.2d at 490. Consequently, we conclude that Daniels\u2019 motion in limine did not preserve an objection for appeal since his motion was generalized, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>did not provide notice to the court of the specific action to which he objected. <em>See Vukasin, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>State v.

Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 34, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252. For plain error review of an unpreserved issue, \u201cthe appealing party must (1) show that the claimed error implicates a fundamental right and (2) \u2018firmly convince\u2019 this Court that failure to review the claimed error would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Norman, </em>2010 MT 253, \u00b6 17, 358 Mont. 252, 244 P.3d 737 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b633 A fundamental principle of our criminal justice system is that the State prove every element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 284, \u00b6 33, 312 Mont. 458, 59 P.3d 1122 (citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 363-64, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 1072-73 (1970), and we have previously stated \u201c[i]f the burden of proof was shifted as [the defendant] claims, there is no doubt his fundamental constitutional rights have been violated.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 33. Evidentiary foundation is a related, but separate issue from determining which party bears the burden of proof. As we have discussed herein, by requiring Daniels to comply with evidentiary requirements, the District Court did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof on an element of the offense. Further, the District Court was clear at trial that the State bore the burden of proof to prove the elements of deliberate homicide as well as the absence of JUOF, and so instructed the jury. Thus, we are not \u201c\u2018firmly convince[d]\u2019 \u2019\u2019that failure to review Daniels\u2019 claim would result in \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial ... or compromise the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d and we decline to invoke the plain error doctrine. <em>Norman, </em>\u00b6 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b634 Daniels raises a second constitutional argument. He asserts \u2018[b]y compelling Larry to testify in order to lay the foundation for his justification evidence, the court violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent\u201d under the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution. The State answers that Daniels never objected that he was being compelled to testify, and notes that he does not seek plain error review of this issue. In reply, Daniels argues his right to remain silent argument is properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>preserved for appeal because of \u201cnumerous references to the Fifth Amendment throughout the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b635 Daniels is correct that there are references to the Fifth Amendment in the record; however, they do not encompass the argument he is asserting on appeal. When the State filed its motion in limine, it requested that Daniels testify during a pre-trial hearing to lay a proper foundation for his evidence. In response, Daniels\u2019 counsel vigorously opposed that suggestion, arguing \u201cthe most important reason that we object to this, Your Honor, is that what they\u2019re asking for is some look into Mr. Daniels\u2019 mind.... Well, he has a Fifth Amendment right to keep that to himself. Whether he testifies or not <em>at trial, </em>is also up to him.... If he wants to give it up <em>at trial, </em>he can do that.\u201d (Emphases added.) The District Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">I think the Fifth Amendment, and then the Montana constitution protections, as well, preclude the Court from requiring the defendant to take the stand <em>at this time </em>and make such a showing. And if he fails to make such a showing <em>at any time, </em>that evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">(Emphases added.) Thus, Daniels raised his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent during the pre-trial hearing, and prevailed there on his argument. However, he also indicated the likelihood he would testify at trial, which he did. During trial, Daniels\u2019 counsel stated repeatedly that Daniels would testify and offered no objection to his doing so based upon the Fifth Amendment. Daniels has not asserted, either in the District Court or on appeal, that he would have declined to testify had the court not made its ruling. <em>See State v. Kutnyak, </em>211 Mont. 155, 172,685 P.2d 901,910 (1984) (\u201cdefense counsel neither objected to the ruling[s] of the trial judge nor asserted that his client could not be compelled to testify to establish self-defense. In addition, he never stated during trial or on appeal that he would not have had his client testify if the trial judge had not made that ruling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b636 \u201cTt has long been the rule of this Court that on appeal we will not put a District Court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced, participated, or to which appellant made no objection. Acquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it. This Court will not hold a district court in error when it has not been given an opportunity to correct itself.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019State v.

Daniels argues that this refused jury instruction had \u201cample evidentiary support\u201d in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b640 Section 45-3-103, MCA (2009), pertaining to the use of force in defense of an occupied structure, was amended by HB 228. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">(1) A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the use of force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other person\u2019s unlawful entry into or attack upon an occupied structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">(2) A person justified in the use of force pursuant to subsection (1) is justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">(a) the entry is made or attempted and the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent an assault upon the person or another then in the occupied structure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">(b) the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony in the occupied structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Section 45-3-103, MCA (2009).

Daniels attempts to distinguish <em>Hagen, Sorenson, </em>and <em>Beach </em>from his case because the statute was amended by HB 228. Notably, however, the statute as amended by HB 228 still contains the same key phrase \u201cunlawful entry into or attack upon an occupied structure\u201d that the versions in our prior cases relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b642 \u201cA district court must only instruct the jury on those theories and issues which are supported by evidence presented at <em>trial\u201d Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 438, 903 P.2d at 1385. The evidence at trial indicated the following: Daniels signed the Residential Lease-Rental Agreement, but Buddy was listed on the lease under the section entitled \u201cAdditional Occupants,\u201d denoting that he was to \u201coccupy the premises\u201d along with Hagen and Logan. The realtor who had facilitated the lease testified that each person was to have free use of the property, and that the lease agreement was intended to cover both homes. Hagen testified the property was considered to be a \u201cwhole family estate\u201d and a \u2018family home,\u201d and he felt free to move about the whole property, often going between the two houses. Logan testified that people Tp]retty much\u201d went where they wanted on the property, and that Buddy also went to Daniels\u2019 house. Logan also testified that he went to Daniels\u2019 house every day and slept there \u2018[a] few times.\u201d Logan testified that Daniels never knocked when entering the main house, and that he, Hagen and Buddy never knocked when entering Daniels\u2019 house. While Daniels testified that he always locked his house when he left, he also testified that Logan had a key and the family knew that they could \u2018jimmy the door [open] from the shop.\u201d While Daniels argues on appeal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u2018family members very rarely entered into each others\u2019 bedrooms,\u2019\u2019both Hagen and Logan testified that they had been in Daniels\u2019 bedroom. Finally, when asked if he ever told other family members not to enter his house, Daniels testified that he had never said that to Logan, and had only told Hagen not to come inside if Hagen was going to use bad language.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b643  We conclude that the evidence clearly established that Buddy was not a trespasser into Daniels\u2019 house, that he was a co-occupant, and that his entry into Daniels\u2019 house was lawful. Because \u201can unlawful entry is a prerequisite to asserting the defense of justifiable use of force in defense of an occupied structure,\u201d <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440, 903 P.2d at 1386, the District Court correctly denied Daniels\u2019 proffered jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b644 Daniels also argues the District Court erred by refusing to include the definition of burglary as a forcible felony for consideration with his defense of JUOF in defense of a person. When instructing the jury on JUOF to defend a person, the District Court instructed the jury that a \u2018forcible felony\u201d means \u201cany felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a745-3-101(2), MCA. The District Court included aggravated assault as a forcible felony within the instructions, giving the definition for aggravated assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA. Daniels asked that burglary be added as a forcible felony for the jury to consider under \u00a745-3-102, MCA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The District Court declined to do so, reasoning that there were insufficient facts to demonstrate that Buddy\u2019s entry into Daniels\u2019 house was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b645 An individual commits burglary if \u2018he knowingly <em>enters or remains unlawfully </em>in an occupied structure with the purpose to commit an offense therein.\u201d Section 45-6-204(1), MCA (emphasis added). Additionally, \u201c[a] person enters or remains unlawfully in or upon any vehicle, occupied structure, or premises when he is not licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to do so.... The privilege may be revoked at any time by personal communication of notice by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>landowner or other authorized person to the entering person.\u201d Section 45-6-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b646  Daniels argues enough evidence existed to support the theory that Buddy unlawfully entered Daniels\u2019 house to support including burglary in the forcible felony instruction. However, as indicated by the above discussion, the evidence established that Buddy\u2019s entrance into Daniels\u2019 house was lawful for purposes of the jury instruction on JUOF in defense of an occupied structure, and we also hold that Buddy\u2019s entry was not unlawful for purposes of the burglary statute. \u2018To constitute a burglary the nature of the entry must itself be a trespass.\u201d <em>State v. Feldt, </em>239 Mont. 398,400, 781 P.2d 255,256 (1989). Daniels concedes that \u2018Buddy was on the lease,\u201d and the evidence indicated that the family members had leave to be in both houses. While Buddy may have committed unlawful acts that night, he did not commit burglary. His entry was not contingent upon Daniels\u2019 permission, and by his words, Daniels could not transform Buddy\u2019s lawful presence into a trespass. The District Court correctly denied Daniels\u2019 proffered instruction on burglary as a forcible felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-5\"> Because Buddy\u2019s death occurred in May of 2009, the 2007 MCA was in effect, except for the justifiable use of force amendments enacted within House Bill (HB) 228, which went into effect on April 27,2009.

Therefore, we take no position on the quantum of evidence required under \u00a746-16-131, MCA (2009), to shift the burden of proof to the State, as that issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\"> At the close of the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, defense counsel indicated for the record \u201cwe had other witnesses that fell in that category and that would have been Logan Daniels.\u201d Thus, \u201cwe made the decision not to call other witnesses who would have gotten on the stand and who would have testified as to reputation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\"> This ruling is not disputed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b460-14\"> The State asserts that the \u201conly evidentiary issue before this Court is whether the district court erred in excluding prior specific instances of Buddy\u2019s violence ....\u2019\u2019The State notes that testimony about Buddy\u2019s reputation for fighting was given without objection during Hagen and Daniels\u2019 testimony. However, reputation evidence was excluded during Logan\u2019s testimony, on the ground of insufficient foundation. Daniels focuses on the District Court\u2019s \u201cone constant ruling,\u201d which he describes as \u201cthat there would be no evidence of Buddy\u2019s past acts <em>or reputation </em>absent proper foundation being laid via Larry\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, we deem Daniels\u2019 arguments to encompass the exclusion of reputation evidence as well as prior specific acts of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\"> Instead of utilizing Rule 404(a)(2), Daniels appears to argue on appeal that Buddy\u2019s character was admissible because it was \u201can essential element\u201d of the JUOF defense, citing M. R. Evid. 404(c). Rule 404(c) states \u2018jejvidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is admissible in cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense.\u201d <em>See also </em>the first prong of M. R. Evid. 405(b). However, a \u2018Victim\u2019s character for violence is not an \u2018essential element\u2019 of the defense of justifiable <em>force.\u201d Nelson, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Sattler, </em>\u00b6 45. Here, Daniels conceded in both his response to the State\u2019s motion and at the pre-trial hearing that a victim\u2019s character is not an essential element of the JUOF defense. Therefore, we do not analyze Daniels\u2019 evidentiary arguments in the context of M. R Evid. 404(c), but rather under M. R. Evid. 404(a)(2). This approach is reinforced by Daniels\u2019 argument to the District Court, in support of introduction of Buddy\u2019s character evidence, that \u2018Ta]n exception is allowed when the character trait of the victim is offered by the accused,\u201d thereby implicitly relying on M. R. Evid. 404(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> <em>See also Deschon v.

Therefore, the State correctly notes that the discussions in <em>Cartwright </em>and <em>Logan, </em>premised upon whether self-defense had been joined, do not apply. To the extent that the District Court\u2019s reliance on these cases could be considered error, it was harmless, as the court correctly analyzed relevance pursuant to <em>Montgomery.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\"> The prior version stated, in part: A person \u2018is justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if: (1) <em>the entry is made or attempted in violent, riotous, or tumultuous manner </em>and he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent an assault upon or offer of personal violence to him or another then in the occupied structure ....\u2019\u2019Section 45-3-103(1), MCA (2007) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\"> Section 45-3-102, MCA, provides Ta] person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or another against such other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force.
