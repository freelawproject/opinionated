We affirm. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b62 <em>I. Did the District Court err by denying Roundstone\u2019s motion to dismiss?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\u00b63 <em>II. Is \u00a7 45-7-306, MCA, void for vagueness as applied to Roundstone?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\u00b64 <em>III. Did the prosecution violate Roundstone\u2019s due process rights by seeking an unusually severe sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">\u00b65 In 2006, Roundstone was convicted of assault with a weapon and sentenced to a five-year commitment to the Department of Corrections (DOC or Department). He was placed at the Montana State Prison (MSP). In March 2007, Roundstone was transferred to the Helena Prerelease Center (HPRC or prerelease). In July of 2007, while still placed at HPRC, Roundstone appeared before the Board of Pardons and Parole (Board). The Board granted his parole conditioned, inter alia, upon successfully completing prerelease center requirements and obtaining employment. The Board projected Roundstone would complete the requirements of the prerelease center about September 11, 2007. Roundstone requested a ten-day furlough to obtain employment in Hardin. Pursuant to the furlough rules which he signed, Roundstone agreed that he would \u201creport to the supervising Probation &amp; Parole Officer immediately upon arrival in the community and daily thereafter as instructed by the officer,\u201d and was warned that \u201c[a]bsconding from furlough or failure to return on time will be considered felony escape.\u201dHis Furlough Request And Permit indicated that he would return to the prerelease center on October 4, 2007 \u2018if necessary,\u201d depending on whether he obtained employment or sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>a ten-day furlough extension. If Roundstone obtained employment while on furlough, his probation officer would convey this information to the Board, which could issue a parole certificate, without requiring him to return to HPRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b66 Roundstone\u2019s furlough request was granted, and he was released from the prerelease center on September 24 for a ten-day period running through October 4. Roundstone reported to his probation officer, Cotton Secrest, in Hardin on the first day of his furlough, but failed to report thereafter. On October 9, Secrest initiated arrest proceedings for Roundstone, who was apprehended in November 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b67 Roundstone was charged with felony escape pursuant to \u00a745-7-306, MCA (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Amended Information alleged that Roundstone, \u201can inmate subject to official detention with the Montana Department of Corrections, temporarily assigned to the Helena Pre-Release Center, purposely or knowingly removed himself from official detention.\u201d The Information also alleged that Roundstone Tailed to report to his Probation and Parole Officer.\u201d The State filed a Notice of Persistent Felony Offender pursuant to \u00a746-13-108, MCA, indicatingits intention to seek that designation if Roundstone was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b68 Roundstone moved to dismiss the charge, arguing he could not commit escape because he was not subject to official detention while on furlough. He characterized furlough as \u201ca program of parole,\u201d which is exempted under the escape statute. The State responded that Roundstone had inmate status at HPRC, which constituted a community corrections facility or program, and he was therefore subject to official detention. The District Court conducted a hearing at which Annette Carter, a State Probation and Parole Officer and supervisor, testified. The District Court granted Roundstone\u2019s motion as to his failure to report to his probation officer while he was on furlough, reasoning that Roundstone was \u201con a parole-related furlough.\u201d The District Court denied the motion as to the allegation that Roundstone had \u201cremoved himself from official detention,\u201d\u2019 reasoning that when Roundstone was released on furlough, he was instructed to return to HPRC, \u201ca form of \u2018official detention.\u2019\u201d Accordingly, the District Court denied Roundstone\u2019s motion \u201cto the extent that the Amended Information charge[d] [Roundstone] with failing to report back to official detention\u201d at HPRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u00b69 The State then moved for leave to file a Second Amended Information fin order to conform more closely with the Court\u2019s Order.\u201d The Second Amended Information alleged that Roundstone committed escape by failing to return to official detention at HPRC following temporary leave for the specific purpose of obtaining employment. Roundstone pled not guilty to this charge and filed another motion to dismiss, which was denied. Roundstone filed a petition for writ of supervisory control with this Court challenging the denial of both motions to dismiss, and we denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b610 Roundstone then entered a guilty plea to the charge, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motions to dismiss. Roundstone was sentenced to ten years to the DOC, with five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b611 \u2018The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case presents a question of law which we review de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Knowles, </em>2010 MT 186, \u00b6 23, 357 Mont. 272, 239 P.3d 129. The District Court\u2019s denial of Roundstone\u2019s motion to dismiss based on its interpretation of the escape statute was a conclusion of law. <em>See State v. Chandler, </em>277 Mont. 476, 478, 922 P.2d 1164, 1165-66 (1996). This Court reviews conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 11, 340 Mont. 167, 174 P.3d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b612 \u201cOur review of constitutional questions is plenary.\u201d <em>State v. G\u2019Stohl, </em>2010 MT 7, \u00b6 7, 355 Mont. 43, 223 P.3d 926. Statutes have a presumption of constitutionality, and we will construe a statute to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation whenever possible. <em>State v. Samples, </em>2008 MT 416, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 292, 198 P.3d 803. The party challenging a statute has the burden of demonstrating the statute is unconstitutional. <em>G\u2019Stohl, </em>\u00b6 7. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed issues of law and fact, which are reviewed de novo. <em>State v.

Rardon, </em>2005 MT 129, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 228, 115 P.3d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\u00b614 <em>I. Did the District Court err by denying Roundstone\u2019s motion to dismiss?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">\u00b615 Section 45-7-306(2), MCA, sets forth the crime of escape, providing that \u201c[a] person subject to official detention commits the offense of escape if the person knowingly or purposely eludes official detention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>or fails to return to official detention following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited time.\u201d Further defined is \u201cofficial detention,\u201d the interpretation of which is the central issue in this appeal. Roundstone argues the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the escape charge against him because he was not in \u201cofficial detention\u201d while on furlough. Alternatively, Roundstone argues that, while on furlough, he should also be considered on \u201cparole\u201d and therefore exempt from the definition of \u201cofficial detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">A. Official Detention</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b616 Roundstone contends dismissal of the escape charge is required under <em>State v. Roberts, </em>275 Mont. 365, 912 P.2d 812 (1996). The State argues that \u00a7 45-7-306, MCA, was substantially amended after <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b617 Roberts was an inmate at MSP and was granted parole subject to conditions, including finding housing and employment. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 366, 912 P.2d at 813. Roberts was approved for a ten-day furlough from MSP. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 366, 912 P.2d at 813. Roberts failed to meet with his parole officer as scheduled and was charged with felony escape under \u00a745-7-306, MCA. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 366, 912 P.2d at 813. Roberts moved to dismiss the charge arguing that he was not subject to official detention while on furlough. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 366, 912 P.2d at 813. The State contended that Roberts was in a supervised release program, a category of \u201cofficial detention\u2019\u201d under \u00a745-7-306(1), MCA. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 367, 912 P.2d at 813. The district court denied his motion, and he was convicted. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 367, 912 P.2d at 813. On appeal, we analyzed the supervised release program statutes and administrative rules, concluding the \u201cterm \u2018supervised release program\u2019 contained in \u00a745-7-306(1), MCA, clearly and unambiguously refers to the supervised release program ... and not to the furlough associated with parole proceedings under \u00a746-23-215, MCA.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 368, 912 P.2d at 814. Because it was \u201cclear that Roberts was released from the MSP into the parole-related furlough program and not into the supervised release program,\u201d we reversed. <em>Roberts, </em>275 Mont. at 369, 912 P.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b618 As the State notes, the statutes have been revised since <em>Roberts. </em>Section 45-7-306(1), MCA(1993), applied <em>inRoberts, </em>defined \u2018\u201c[o]fficial detention\u2019 \u201d as a listing of imprisonment, confinements, detentions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>program placements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1997, the statute was amended, and now more broadly defines \u201c\u2018[ojfficial detention\u2019 \u201dto mean the <em>\u201cplacement of a person in the legal custody </em>of a municipality, a county, or the state\u201d as a result of, inter alia, an arrest, detention, charge, conviction or program placement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-7-306(l)(a), MCA (emphasis added). Legislative history reveals that one purpose of the 1997 amendments was to address our decision in <em>Roberts. See </em>Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 43, </em>55th Legis., Reg. Sess., Exhibit 5, at 1 (Jan. 29, 1997) (\u2018The 1997 proposed amendments are intended to clarify finally that any person who has been charged with or convicted of a felony who is under lawful custody of the state ... (other than a probationer or parolee) is guilty of felony escape if he escapes from or fails to return to that custody following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose.... This will also remedy another Montana Supreme Court opinion, <em>State v. Roberts, </em>in which the Court held that an escape while on a 10-day leave from MSP to find employment for future parole status did not constitute a felony.\u201d). Moreover, the supervised release statutes and the administrative rules referenced in <em>Roberts </em>have all been repealed. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>1997, ch. 322, \u00a715, at 1483; <em>see also </em>Admin. R. M. 20.7.102, 20.7.103. Thus, <em>Roberts </em>does not control the outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b619 Notably, the holding in another case, relied upon by the State, has also been the subject of legislative action. The State argues that because Roundstone was furloughed from a prerelease center, he was in a \u201ccommunity corrections facility or program\u201d and therefore within \u201cofficial detention\u201d under \u00a745~7-306(l)(a)(iv), MCA. In support, the State cites <em>Chandler, </em>277 Mont. at 480, 922 P.2d at 1166, where we held, after a survey of the applicable statutes, that a prerelease center is a community corrections facility or program for purposes of the escape statute. <em>See also State v. Romannose, </em>281 Mont. 84, 89, 931 P.2d 1304, 1307 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b620 However, in 1997, the Legislature enacted House Bill 125, which clarified that community corrections facilities were distinct from prerelease centers. The bill authorized courts to sentence offenders to a \u201cprerelease center or prerelease program\u201d as a sentencing option separate from community corrections facilities. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 1997, ch. 322, \u00a71, at 1471-73 (emphasis omitted). According to a DOC exhibit submitted to legislative committees, \u2018Section 1 of the proposed statute clarifies that community correction facilities and pre-release centers are <em>two different entities </em>by allowing judges to sentence offenders to either facility.\u201d Mont. Sen. Finance &amp; Claims Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 125, </em>55th Legis., Reg. Sess., Exhibit 1, at 1 (Mar. 19, 1997) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The exhibit also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">There are many references in the statutes to \u201ccommunity corrections facilities,\u201d but, only a few references to pre-release centers. Unfortunately, everyone from attorneys and judges to lay persons perceive \u201ccommunity corrections facility\u201dand \u201cpre-release center\u201d are interchangeable, and treat them as interchangeable. They are not. A community corrections facility is something created by and for an individual community pursuant to the community corrections act, M.C.A. \u00a7 53-30-301 <em>et seq. A </em>prerelease center is a department of corrections entity pursuant to M.C.A. \u00a753-1-202 which the department administers. We need to clearly differentiate between the two, and specify how they should be treated differently by department of corrections, judges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>offenders, and attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Mont. Sen. Finance &amp; Claims Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H, Bill 125, </em>Exhibit 1, at 1. The legislation made other changes to distinguish between the two programs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As testified by DOC representatives, \u201c[t]his bill takes the DOC out of the community corrections process .... This bill intends to clarify that the DOC\u2019s role is in pre-release and not in community corrections facilities. The community corrections business is a local entity.\u201d Mont. Sen. Finance &amp; Claims Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 125, </em>at 2-3. The legislation was intended to clearly differentiate between prerelease programs administered by the DOC and community corrections facilities administered locally. Consequently, <em>Chandler </em>is no longer controlling on this question, and the State\u2019s argument that Roundstone was in official detention by virtue of being in \u201ca community corrections facility or program\u201d under \u00a745-7-306(l)(a)(iv), MCA, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b621 The State also argues that Roundstone was subject to official detention while on furlough pursuant to \u00a745-7-306(l)(a)(i), MCA, by which detention is defined as the \u201cplacement of a person in the legal custody of... the state as a result of... a conviction for an offense ....\u201d The State argues this definition was satisfied because \u201cwhen Roundstone was in prison, he was in the legal custody of the State as a result of a conviction for an offense.\u201d When Roundstone was transferred to HPRC, a DOC program, he remained in the custody of DOC. Accordingly, the State argues that Twjhen Roundstone was temporarily released on a furlough, his status did not change and he continued to be subject to official detention.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00b622 State prisons and prerelease centers are part of adult correctional services \u2018included in the department of corrections to carry out the purposes of the department.\u201d Sections 53-1-202(1); -202(2)(a) and (b)(i), MCA. DOC is required to maintain, by contract, prerelease centers for such purposes as \u201cpreparing inmates of a Montana prison who are approaching parole eligibility or discharge for release into the community.\u201d Section 53-l-203(l)(c)(i), MCA. Roundstone was placed at the prerelease facility, from which he was released on furlough, with a scheduled return date of October 4, 2007 unless further developments negated the requirement to return. On furlough, Roundstone remained in the legal custody of DOC. Section 46-23-215(3), MCA (\u201cWhile on furlough, the prisoner remains in the legal custody of the department and is subject to all other conditions recited by the hearing panel.\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b623  Roundstone was placed at MSP and the prerelease center, then given furlough, only by virtue of having been convicted of the assault charge. Thus, under the broader language enacted in 1997, Roundstone was \u201cplace[dj\u201d in the \u2018legal custody of ... the state\u201d as a result of \u201ca conviction for an offense.\u201d Section 45-7-306(l)(a)(i), MCA. Roundstone remained in official detention while on furlough from the prerelease center and, therefore, subsection (i) of \u00a7 45-7-306(l)(a), MCA, is satisfied and he is guilty of escape. This conclusion is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent in amending the escape statute in 1997. Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 43, </em>at 6 (House Bill 43 \u2018Includes any inmate in the custody of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Department or any inmate on furlough.\u201d). <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">B. Furlough and Parole</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b624 Roundstone next argues that he was actually on parole and thus excluded from \u201cofficial detention\u201d by \u00a7 45-7-306(l)(b), MCA, which provides that \u2018tojfficial detention does not include supervision of a person on probation or parole ....\u2019\u2019Roundstone argues that furlough should be considered parole under the statutes, given the essential characteristics of parole. Noting that parole is defined as \u201cthe <em>release </em>to the <em>community </em>of a prisoner by the decision of a <em>hearing panel </em>prior to the expiration of the prisoner\u2019s term, <em>subject to conditions imposed by the hearing panel </em>and subject to supervision of the department,\u201d \u00a7 46-23-103(5), MCA (emphases added), Roundstone compares a definition of furlough from <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>as \u2018fa] brief <em>release </em>from prison.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>745 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009) (emphasis added). He cites \u00a746-23-215(3), MCA, which provides that Twjhile on furlough, the prisoner remains in the legal custody of the department and is subject to all other conditions recited by the hearing panel.\u201d Roundstone\u2019s argument is that this \u201cparallel\u201d language necessarily means that furlough should be considered parole because it satisfies the statutory definition of parole.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u00b625 Section 46-23-218, MCA, authorizes the Board of Pardons and Parole to adopt rules pertaining to parole. <em>See also </em>Admin. R. M. 20.1.101(3)(a) (2007) (the Board \u2018is responsible for the oversight of Montana\u2019s inmate parole and furlough programs\u201d); Admin. R. M. 20.1.101(l)(d)(i) (2010). The Standard Operating Procedures of the Probation and Parole Bureau provide that \u2018[fjurlough offenders are not eligible for Gate Money <em>until such time </em>as they are on parole status,\u201d and if the offender secures acceptable living arrangements and/or employment, then the offender <em>\u201cmay he </em>eligible to be placed on parole status without returning to the correctional facility.\u201d (Emphases added.) The Procedures state that \u201c[i]f the offender fails to report as ordered to the supervising parole officer or fails to return to the facility as ordered in the furlough permit, the offender may be charged with escape ....\u2019\u2019Before release, Roundstone signed next to a provision in the Furlough Program Rules that stated, \u201c[a]bsconding from furlough or failure to return on time will be considered felony escape.\u201d This same document noted that furlough provided an opportunity to seek employment or living arrangements \u2018in order to develop a parole plan\u201d and that if such employment or living arrangements were obtained and approved, then the offender \u201cmay be eligible to be placed on parole.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Roundstone\u2019s probation officer was authorized to initiate the final steps for the Board\u2019s issuance of a parole certificate upon completion of the conditions. These Procedures and Program Rules indicate that furlough must be satisfactorily completed before attaining parole. Consistent herewith, we held in <em>Romannose </em>that the evidence did not support defendant\u2019s claim to be a parolee when he was on \u201c\u2018live-out\u2019 \u201d status from a prerelease center. <em>Romannose, </em>281 Mont. at 89, 931 P.2d at 1308. In making that determination, we noted that the defendant was on inmate status while a resident of the prerelease, and he signed forms acknowledging that any unauthorized absence would constitute felony escape and that he was in official detention until the Board formally approved him for parole. <em>Romannose, </em>281 Mont. at 89, 931 P.2d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b626 This position was supported by evidence at the hearing. Carter testified that Roundstone was on inmate status when he was transferred from prison to the prerelease center and on inmate status when he left the prerelease center on furlough. Carter explained that \u201ceverybody on furlough is an inmate.\u201d Additionally, the court asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Carter whether a person can be an inmate and be on parole at the same time, to which Carter responded, \u2018No.... During that furlough status ... he\u2019s still considered an inmate. They do not start that parole status until the completion of the furlough.\u201d Carter testified that Roundstone was \u201celigible for parole\u201d but \u2018hot actually placed on parole until the Parole Board completes a parole certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b627 While Roundstone urges us to conclude that furlough is \u201cprecertificate parole ... and after furlough is completed the prisoner is granted post-furlough parole,\u201d we decline to do so, as it would essentially require rewriting the statutes. While, admittedly, both furlough and parole are forms of \u201crelease\u201d and are subject to the Board\u2019s conditions, the Legislature has not provided in statute that furlough is, in fact, parole.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There are regulatory distinctions between the two based on statute which this Court recognized in <em>Romannose. </em>Neither is there ambiguity requiring application of the rule of lenity, as Roundstone urges.

Roundstone did not raise a vagueness challenge below, despite significant pre-trial motion practice, but instead pled guilty. The above discussion in Issue One describes the clear notices Roundstone received about furlough and the expectations of him, including reporting to his probation officer and returning to the prerelease center. He was advised that failure to do so could lead to an escape charge. We conclude that his assertions of vagueness do not compel our review under plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b634 Regarding the LAC claim, the record does not disclose the reasons counsel did not raise a vagueness challenge or that there is no plausible justification for trial counsel\u2019s failure to do so. It is plausible that counsel did not think the vagueness challenge was meritorious or that the decision was strategic, given that a plea agreement had been negotiated. <em>See State v.

We dismiss the IAC claim without prejudice to pursuing postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b635 <em>III. Did the prosecution violate Roundstone\u2019s due process rights by seeking an unusually severe sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b636 Roundstone claims the prosecutor sought an unusually harsh sentence in response to Roundstone\u2019s challenge of the escape charge, which violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b637 The principle of prosecutorial vindictiveness originates from the idea that it is unconstitutional for the State or its agent to penalize a person for exercising his or her legal rights. <em>See U.S. v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 2488 (1982); <em>see also Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 27-28, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 2101-02 (1974). \u201c\u2018To punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Knowles, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. at 372, 102 S. Ct. at 2488 (internal quotation omitted)). Citing <em>Blackledge, </em>this Court has stated that \u2018Retaliatory action on the part of the prosecutor for the exercise of procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>rights by an accused has been held to violate constitutional due process requirements.\u201d <em>State v. Sather, </em>172 Mont. 428, 434-35, 564 P.2d 1306, 1310 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b638  To establish that a prosecution was vindictive, a defendant must establish either (1) actual vindictiveness, or (2) a rebuttable presumption of vindictiveness in those cases in which a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness exists. <em>Wasman v. U.S., </em>468 U.S. 559, 566, 568-69, 104 S. Ct. 3217, 3222-23 (1984); <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S at 373, 380-81, 104 S. Ct. at 2488, 2492; <em>see also U.S. v. Raymer, </em>941 F.2d 1031, 1040 (10th Cir. 1991). \u2018In sum, where the presumption applies, the sentencing authority or the prosecutor must rebut the presumption that an increased sentence or charge resulted from vindictiveness; where the presumption does not apply, the defendant must affirmatively prove actual vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Wasman, </em>468 U.S. at 569, 104 S. Ct. at 3223.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b639 Roundstone concedes the presumption of vindictiveness is not at issue, and he argues on the basis of actual vindictiveness. Roundstone\u2019s argument is based upon comments made by the prosecutor during the change of plea and sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">The practice of the [DOC] of giving concurrent sentences for somebody who is a violent offender, or anybody else, and decides to walk away from either prison or from a pre-release center, there has got to be a consequence. All of the others, at least the ones that I\u2019ve prosecuted, were not treated as persistent felony offenders because they came in prior to getting to this stage of the proceedings and accepted responsibility. And they accepted responsibility. And I think that there ought to be a message, at least from this county attorney and hopefully from the judges of this district, that if you come to the Helena Pre-Release Center and you walk away from it, there is going to be a consequence, and it\u2019s not going to be concurrent time. And if you make that mistake, then you ought to accept responsibility and come into court and do so, because if you don\u2019t, there is going to be a consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The evidence required to prove actual vindictiveness has been described as objective proof \u201cthat the prosecutor\u2019s charging decision was motivated by a desire to punish [the defendant] for doing something that the law plainly allowed him to do,\u201d <em>see Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. at 384, 102 S. Ct. at 2494, or evidence of the prosecutor\u2019s bad faith or malicious actions. <em>Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 28, 94 S. Ct. at 2102.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b640 The plea agreement provided that each side was free to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sentencing recommendations, which were understood by Roundstone to be nonbinding upon the court. Probation and Parole Officer Carter testified at the sentencing hearing and, when asked about sentences pursued by the DOC in escape cases, stated: \u2018They generally look at two-year sentences .... The bulk of the time they are concurrent to somebody\u2019s sentence. I actually have an issue with that. I don\u2019t think there is any accountability for people when they escape because it-^eally there is no consequence for that.\u201d When asked by the court for her recommendation on Roundstone, Carter stated that, after detention, \u2018I would want to see some suspended time or significant amount of time to make sure that he\u2019s able to stay clean and sober because he was only out on furlough for a matter of weeks when he escaped and then was consuming alcohol again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b641 After Carter\u2019s testimony, the State gave its recommendation of ten years with five years suspended and then the prosecutor made the comments to which Roundstone objects. While the comments could be viewed as careless, they came, notably, following the concerns expressed by Carter about sentences which imposed no \u201caccountability\u201d or \u201cconsequence[s]\u201d on escape offenders, with the prosecutor adding that this sentence was \u201cnot going to be concurrent time\u201d-Carter\u2019s specific criticism. The sentencing judge wisely put the issue in proper perspective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">I\u2019m not going to punish you for what you did as far as filing all of these motions; I think that is fine. But the law requires me to give you five years. So I\u2019m going to-and I think it\u2019s important that you have some suspended time, as [the prosecutor] suggested, for follow-up. And that doesn\u2019t require your incarceration, it just requires that you comply with their directives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b642 The prosecutor\u2019s comments were brief and handled well by the sentencing court.

Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 11, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929 (citation omitted). In the Amended Information, the State alleged that Roundstone was subject to official detention with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>DOC, temporarily assigned to the prerelease center, and purposely or knowingly removed himself from official detention. The State argued in its brief in opposition to Roundstone\u2019s motion to dismiss: \u2018In September, 2007, Roundstone was on inmate status at the Helena Pre-Release and was given a furlough to go to Hardin for the purpose of finding employment. ... Despite the furlough, Roundstone was still subject to the rules of the pre-release ...\u201d The District Court referenced \u00a745-7-306(l)(a)(i), MCA, in its order denying Roundstone\u2019s motion to dismiss. While the State did not expressly cite \u00a7 45-7-306(l)(a)(i), MCA, its theory was encompassed by the provision. The State\u2019s appellate arguments fall within the scope of its theory before the District Court-that Roundstone was subject to official detention while on furlough from the prerelease center. The District Court indicated its awareness of \u00a745-7-306(l)(a)(i), MCA. Thus, the unfairness that the rule seeks to avoid is not present here, and rejecting consideration of the State\u2019s arguments would be an \u201cunduly harsh application\u201d of the waiver rule. <em>See Whitehorn v.
