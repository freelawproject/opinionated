(Waynco) appeals from the order and the findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. The District Court concluded that Waynco materially had breached a contract with AAA Construction of Missoula, LLC (AAA). CLR Properties, Inc., and Choice Land Corp. (collectively CLR) appeal the denial of their claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>attorney fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b62 Waynco raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly conclude that AAA\u2019s bid constituted a binding contract between the parties?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court properly deny CLR\u2019s claim for attorney fees ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A97\">\u00b65 This case arises from a commercial real estate improvement project in Missoula, Montana. CLR hired Waynco as the general contractor. Waynco selected all subcontractors. Waynco supervised all work performed at the project. Waynco also controlled access to the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b66 Waynco solicited a bid from AAA to perform concrete work. Brady Nelson, AAA\u2019s member/manager, and Robert Rozier, Waynco\u2019s president, walked through the site before AAA submitted its bid. Rozier explained the scope of work to Nelson. Rozier specifically advised Nelson not to bid on demolition and reconstruction for the front of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b67 Nelson submitted AAA\u2019s bid on March 30,2007. The bid explicitly set forth the scope of work upon which AAA was bidding, including costs and measurements of work to be performed. AAA\u2019s bid estimated the total cost at $94,918.25. Nelson submitted the bid to Chris Wright, the project\u2019s supervisor for Waynco.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b68 Wright signed AAA\u2019s bid under the section entitled \u201cAcceptance of Proposal.\u201dWright made interlineations to the proposal, however, by crossing out the words \u201cAcceptance of Proposal\u201d and handwriting on the form \u2018Pending contract with owner. Final scope/subcontract to follow. Thanks!\u201dWaynco used AAA\u2019s bid to formulate Waynco\u2019s general contract bid to CLR. CLR accepted Waynco\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b69 AAA began work at the project site on May 1, 2007. Waynco requested that AAA perform additional demolition and paving work on the building\u2019s west side. The parties agreed that Waynco would pay AAA an additional $13,500 for this extra work on top of the $94,918.25 bid, for a total contract price of $108,419.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">\u00b610 Waynco sent AAA a document entitled \u2018Subcontract Agreement\u201d on May 17, 2007-two weeks after AAA had begun work. The Subcontract Agreement contained work beyond what AAA had agreed to perform, including demolition and construction work for the front of the building. The Subcontract Agreement contemplated no increase in compensation for AAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">\u00b611 AAA responded with a new bid of $206,858.25 for all the work contained in the Subcontract Agreement. AAA assumed that the Subcontract Agreement had expanded the scope of work in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Waynco\u2019s directive in the site walk through to omit work for the front of the building. Waynco rejected AAA\u2019s $206,858.25 offer for the scope of work set forth in the Subcontract Agreement. AAA refused, in turn, to perform the additional work without increased compensation. The parties failed in several attempts to negotiate a resolution on price for the additional work.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">\u00b612 Rozier called Nelson on June 6, 2007, to advise Nelson to Tg]et your ... ass into the building and sign the contract, or you\u2019ll never receive a nickel, and I\u2019ll refer this to my lawyer.\u201d AAA left the project that same day as AAA feared that it would not be paid for any of its work. AAA had completed a majority of the work outlined in AAA\u2019s bid by the time that it left the project. Waynco never paid AAA for any labor or materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b613 AAA filed a construction lien on the property in the amount of $88,720.63. CLR petitioned the District Court to substitute a surety bond for the construction lien. The District Court discharged the lien and replaced it with the surety bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b614 AAA filed a complaint against CLR and Waynco. AAA alleged that Waynco had breached the contract. AAA further alleged that CLR had been unjustly enriched from AAA\u2019s work. Waynco filed a counterclaim in which it alleged that AAA had breached the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b615 All parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted CLR\u2019s motion for summary judgment for the unjust enrichment claims, but both AAA\u2019s and Waynco\u2019s breach of contract claims proceeded to a non-jury trial. The District Court determined that AAA\u2019s bid constituted a binding contract between the parties. Waynco materially had breached the contract by failing to pay AAA for any goods or services that it had provided. The District Court awarded AAA the full amount of its $88,720.63 lien. The District Court also awarded AAA costs of $2,300.22 and attorney\u2019s fees of $23,318.13.</p>\n<p id=\"AqF\">\u00b616 CLR sought its attorney fees for the lien foreclosure action pursuant to \u00a771-3-124, MCA. CLR argued that the lien was not valid because the District Court discharged the lien in September 2007. The District Court rejected CLR\u2019s claim that AAA\u2019s lien had been invalid. The court noted that it found the lien valid in its November 2009 order, and had discharged the lien only when CLR substituted the surety bond. Waynco and CLR appeal. AAA cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to CLR on its unjust enrichment claim. We need not address this issue in light of our result of the direct appeal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b617 We review the factual findings of a District Court sitting without a jury to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Eldredge v. Asarco Inc., </em>2011 MT 80, \u00b6 30, 360 Mont. 112, 252 P.3d 182. A District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the District Court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Eldredge, </em>\u00b6 30. We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings. <em>Eldredge, </em>\u00b6 30. We review for correctness a District Court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>.Eldredge, </em>\u00b6 30. We note that whether a contract exists-a central issue in this case-presents a combined issue of fact and law. <em>Johnston v. </em>Palmer, 2007 MT 99, \u00b6 38, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b618 <em>Issue 1: Did the District Court properly conclude that AAA\u2019s bid constituted a binding contract between the parties?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b619 Identifiable parties capable of contracting, consent, a lawful object, and sufficient consideration comprise the essential elements of any contract. <em>Zier v. Lewis, </em>2009 MT 266, \u00b6 19, 352 Mont. 76,218 P.3d 465. Consent must be mutual, and the parties must agree upon the same thing, in the same sense. <em>Zier, </em>\u00b6 19. Acceptance of an offer on terms that vary from those offered represents a rejection of the offer. <em>Zier, </em>\u00b6 19. This rejection puts an end to the negotiation unless the parties assent to the new terms. <em>Zier, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b620 The District Court determined that AAA\u2019s bid constituted an offer that Waynco had accepted. Waynco asserts that it never accepted AAA\u2019s terms, so no contract existed between the parties. Waynco relies heavily on Wright\u2019s interlineations on AAA\u2019s bid to contend that Waynco intended to make a counter-offer rather than accept AAA\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u00b621  A party\u2019s intent regarding contract formation presents a question of fact. <em>See Thompson v. Lithia Chrysler Jeep Dodge of Great Falls, </em>2008 MT 175, \u00b6 32, 343 Mont. 392, 185 P.3d 332. The District Court cited substantial evidence to conclude that Wright had intended to accept AAA\u2019s bid. Wright, on behalf of Waynco, signed AAA\u2019s bid. Wright admitted that he accepted AAA\u2019s bid upon CLR\u2019s awarding of the general contract to Waynco. CLR awarded the contract to Waynco.</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">\u00b622 Other factors point to Waynco\u2019s acceptance of AAA\u2019s bid. Waynco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>controlled access to the project site. Waynco allowed AAA to commence work without any other agreement in place. AAA worked for over two weeks before Waynco sent the Subcontract Agreement to AAA. Waynco allowed AAA\u2019s work to continue for over a month without any signed agreement in place except AAA\u2019s bid. These facts, viewed in a light most favorable to AAA, provide substantial evidence that Waynco intended to accept AAA\u2019s bid and that this acceptance established a contract between the parties. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\u00b623 Even if we agreed that Wright\u2019s interlineations represented a counter-offer, we still would be compelled to determine that a contract existed with AAA\u2019s bid constituting the bulk of the contract\u2019s terms. As previously noted, acceptance that varies the contractual terms represents no acceptance. <em>Zier, </em>\u00b6 19. Acceptance that varies the proposed terms should be interpreted as a counter-offer that extinguishes the original offer. <em>Zier, </em>\u00b6 19. The terms of a counter-offer generally can be determined only by reviewing the previous negotiations between the parties. Arthur L. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>vol. 1, \u00a73.35,591 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., rev. ed., West 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"AAM\">\u00b624 A counter-offer tends to incorporate all previously offered terms except those that the counter-offer expressly seeks to modify or add. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>at 491. As with any offer, a party may accept a counter-offer either through verbal acceptance or through performance. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 28-2-501, 503, MCA. The accepting party generally demonstrates assent through performance with a counteroffer. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>at 492. Thus, even assuming that Waynco intended its interlineations to constitute a counter-offer, AAA accepted that counter-offer through its performance of its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b625  Waynco\u2019s alleged interlineated counter-offer implicitly incorporated the terms of AAA\u2019s bid. It simply added the interlineations as the additional terms. AAA manifested its acceptance of this counter-offer through its commencement of work at the project site. A meeting of the minds occurred when AAA started performing its contractual obligations. Waynco indicated its acceptance when it allowed AAA to start working when Waynco controlled access to the site. This meeting of the minds created a contract between Waynco and AAA. <em>See Hetherington v. Ford Motor Co., </em>257 Mont. 395,400-401,849 P.2d 1039, 1043 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b626 Waynco alternatively argues that the Subcontract Agreement modified any contract previously established by AAA\u2019s bid. Waynco cites the following facts to support this modification claim. Waynco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>alleges that Nelson orally agreed to the Subcontract Agreement. Second, Nelson submitted a payment application that complied with procedures set forth in the Subcontract Agreement. Waynco claims that Nelson\u2019s compliance with the payment procedures indicates AAA\u2019s consent to the Subcontract Agreement. Third, Nelson admitted to having signed the Subcontract Agreement on behalf of AAA. We address each of these claims in turn to determine whether the parties modified their original contract in the form of the Subcontract Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b627  Written contracts may be modified through two methods. Parties may modify a written contract through a subsequent written contract. Section 28-2-1602, MCA. Parties also may modify a written contract by an executed oral agreement. Section 28-2-1602, MCA; <em>Matzingerv. Remco, Inc., </em>171 Mont. 383,387,558 P.2d 650,652 (1976). Waynco alleges that Nelson orally agreed to the Subcontract Agreement. Waynco never performed its obligation to pay AAA for goods and services rendered, however, and AAA had not performed the obligations that the Subcontract Agreement added to the obligations listed in AAA\u2019s bid. The parties had not fully executed the alleged oral agreement, and therefore, the alleged oral agreement could not operate as a modification to incorporate the terms of the Subcontract Agreement. <em>Matzinger, </em>171 Mont, at 387, 558 P.2d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b628 We next analyze whether Nelson\u2019s compliance with the Subcontract Agreement\u2019s payment procedures demonstrates AAA\u2019s assent. AAA\u2019s compliance with the Subcontract Agreement\u2019s payment procedures set forth in the Subcontract Agreement fails to establish the parties had modified the contract. AAA responded to the Subcontract Agreement with a new bid of $206,858.25. AAA expressly refused to perform the additional work as contemplated by the Subcontract Agreement, including the demolition and construction work for the front of the building. We cannot agree that AAA\u2019s alleged compliance with the payment process set forth in the Subcontract Agreement rises to the level of its assent to a written agreement or a fully executed oral contract. Section 28-2-1602, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b629 Waynco further argues that Nelson admitted to having signed the Subcontract Agreement. This argument fails to recognize the axiomatic law governing offer and acceptance. An accepting party must communicate its assent to the offeror. Section 28-3-301(3), MCA. A written contract must be delivered before it becomes effective. Section 28-2-906, MCA. Waynco alleges that it discovered at trial that Nelson had signed the Subcontract Agreement. Nelson conceded on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>examination that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that he signed the Subcontract Agreement at some point. The District Court concluded-and Waynco does not dispute-however, that AAA never returned a signed Subcontract Agreement to Waynco. Accordingly, AAA never manifested written consent to modify the original contract. Section 28-3-301(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b630 Waynco argues as a final alternative that AAA\u2019s material breach precludes recovery even if AAA\u2019s bid represents the parties\u2019 contract. Waynco correctly notes that Montana law prevents a party in material breach from maintaining a breach of contract action against the other contracting party. <em>See R.C. Hobbs Enterprise, LLC v. J.G.L Distributing, Inc., </em>2004 MT 396, \u00b6 35, 325 Mont. 277, 104 P.3d 503. The District Court determined, however, that Waynco, not AAA, was the party in material breach. AAA performed a majority of its contractual obligations before AAA left the site. AAA left the site only after Waynco threatened to withhold payment. Waynco failed to pay AAA for over a month\u2019s worth of goods and services rendered after AAA had left. These facts demonstrate that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Waynco was the materially breaching party.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b631 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court properly deny CLR\u2019s claim for attorney </em>fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b632 Section 71-3-124, MCA, provides in part that \u2018the reasonable attorney fees must be allowed to the defendant against whose property a lien is claimed if the lien is not established.\u201d CLR contends that AAA\u2019s lien was not established because the District Court had discharged the lien. The District Court discharged the lien, however, only when CLR substituted a surety bond. This substitution did not mean that AAA had failed to establish the lien. The District Court only allowed CLR to substitute one form of security for another. Section 71-3-551, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b633  The California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hutnick v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, </em>763 P.2d 1326, 1330 (Cal. 1998), proves instructive as to how bonds affect liens. Like Montana, California law allows a lien\u2019s discharge upon the lienee filing a surety bond. The court in <em>Hutnick </em>recognized that a bond \u201cdoes not change the relation or rights of the parties otherwise than in substituting its obligations for the [property] subject to the lien..\u2019! <em>Hutnick, </em>763 P.2d at 1330. The court further explained that \u2018it was not within the legislative purpose in permitting the substitution to deteriorate the lienor\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Hutnick, </em>763 P.2d at 1330. Montana\u2019s legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>similarly did not intend the lien substitute statute to allow lienees to recover their attorney fees by simply securing a surety bond despite their underlying liability.
