Shattuck, who brought this action individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Dane M. Shattuck (Shattuck). Defendants appeal from the District Court\u2019s holding that the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, commonly known as CHIP, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>constitutes insurance and is subject to the \u201cmade whole\u201d statute. Shattuck cross appeals the District Court\u2019s further determination that BCBSMT is not an \u2018insurer\u201d in its role here and therefore not subject to the \u201cmade whole\u201d statute. The appeal arises from the District Court\u2019s certification of its ruling as a final judgment, which we approved by order on October 19, 2010. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b62 In July 2007, Dane Shattuck, a minor, tragically died from injuries sustained after being hit by an automobile driven by a third-party tortfeasor. Dane received medical care at KRMC for his injuries, which were billed in the amount of $2,365.75. At the time of his injuries and death, Dane was enrolled in CHIP, administered by DPHHS. KRMC was a CHIP hospital provider and submitted the bill for Dane\u2019s care to BCBSMT, which served as third-party administrator (TPA) of the CHIP program for DPHHS. Pursuant to the payment terms of the provider agreement, KRMC was paid the sum of $2,005.85 from CHIP through BCBSMT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b63 Pursuant to \u00a771-3-1111, et seq., MCA, KRMC asserted a health care provider lien for the amount of $2,365.75 against recoveries Shattuck may obtain against responsible third parties. Dane\u2019s estate recovered $100,000 in automobile insurance proceeds for damages associated with Dane\u2019s injuries and death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shattuck took the position that KRMC\u2019s lien was unnecessary because CHIP had paid the bill in full and requested KRMC release the lien. KRMC contended that because BCBSMT had the authority to adjust overpayment charges on claims, including claims involving third-party tortfeasors, it could not release its lien without jeopardizing payment for its services, and thus had no choice but to pursue its lien. In January 2008, Shattuck commenced an action against KRMC and BCBSMT challenging the lien\u2019s validity. Shattuck alleged breach of contract, wrongful assertion of an invalid lien, constructive fraud, deceit, conspiracy, tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, and actual fraud, and sought release of KRMC\u2019s lien, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>interest, general and punitive damages, and attorney fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shattuck asserted that the Defendants unlawfully acted to avoid application of common law and statutory \u201cmade whole\u201drules. She argued that KRMC could not foreclose the lien because she had not been made whole. As stated in Shattuck\u2019s complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\">The agreement between KRMC and Blue Cross (and other insurers and administrators) is designed to avoid the \u201cmade whole\u201d requirements of Montana common law and statutes, including, but not limited to, Sections 2-18-902, 33-22-1602, and 33-20-1102, MCA. The agreement resulted in a constructive fraud and deceit upon Shattuck designed to deprive her of the protection of Montana\u2019s \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine, by allowing health insurers and administrators, such as Blue Cross (and other insurers and administrators), to collect subrogation without the injured party first being fully compensated and \u201cmade whole\u201d for his or her injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">KRMC filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that CHIP was not insurance and BCBSMT was not an insurer, with which BCBSMT joined. The District Court ruled that CHIP constitutes insurance and was subject to the \u201cmade whole\u201d statute, reasoning, in part, that the Montana Insurance Code \u201cattempts to be inclusive of numerous kinds of insurance and plans, expressly excluding those programs not to be included. ... CHIP is not expressly excluded.\u201d However, the court also determined that BCBSMT was not an insurer. Both KRMC and BCBSMT moved to certify the order as final pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b), which was granted by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b64 Prior to the court\u2019s certification, Shattuck filed an amended complaint naming DPHHS as an additional defendant. DPHHS appeared on March 16, 2010, and moved to vacate the Rule 54(b) certification. On March 19, 2010, BCBSMT and KRMC filed a joint appeal from the certified order to this Court. Shattuck moved to dismiss the appeal, and DPHHS moved to remand the appeal to permit an opportunity for DPHHS to present evidence and argument to the District Court on the issue of CHIP\u2019S status as insurance. In April 2010, this Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice and remanded the matter to the District Court for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b65 On remand, DPHHS sought reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ruling on CHIP, but on August 30, 2010, the District Court issued an order reaffirming its earlier determination that CHIP was insurance. The District Court again granted Rule 54(b) certification, and DPHHS filed an appeal to this Court, which was joined by BCBSMT and KRMC. This Court determined that the Rule 54(b) certification was sufficient and permitted this appeal to proceed. We designated the issues as \u201cwhether the Montana Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) is an insurance covered by the \u2018made whole\u2019 doctrine codified in the Montana Insurance Code and whether Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana, as administrator of CHIP, is an \u2018insurer\u2019 for purposes of this lawsuit,\u2019\u2019reasoning that these issues were of statewide importance that merited prompt and final resolution. Shattuck then filed a notice of cross appeal \u2018from that part of the Orders at issue in this appeal that hold that [BCBSMT] is not an \u2018insurer\u2019 for purposes of the \u2018made-whole\u2019 rule, either as an insurance company or as an administrator.\u201d KRMC and BCBSMT moved to dismiss the cross appeal, which we denied. Therefore, the two issues on appeal to this Court which have been certified, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b), are:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b66 <em>Issue 1: Bid, the District Court err by concluding that CHIP constitutes insurance subject to the \u201cmade whole\u201d provision of the Montana Insurance Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b67 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court err by concluding that BCBSMT, in its capacity as third-party administrator of CHIP, is not an \u2018Insurer\u201d for purposes of the \u201cmade whole\u201d rule? </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b68 \u2018We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court.\u201d <em>Gaston Eng\u2019g &amp; Surveying, P.C. v.

The program is jointly financed by the Federal and State governments and administered by the States. Within broad Federal rules, each State decides eligible groups, types and ranges of services, payment levels for benefit coverage, and administrative and operating procedures.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 457.1 (2006); <em>see generally </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71397aa-jj (2006). <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to federal law, the purpose of the state CHIP programs \u2018is to provide funds to States to enable them to initiate and expand the provision of child health assistance to uninsured, low-income children in an effective and efficient manner that is coordinated with other sources of health benefits coverage for children.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397aa(a). Federal funds cannot be received until a State submits a plan setting forth how the State intends to use the funds consistent with federal regulations, and only after such a plan has been approved. 42 U.S.C. \u00a71397aa(b); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a71397bb. Approval is given by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 42 C.F.R. \u00a7457.50 (The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>plan is a comprehensive written statement, submitted by the State to CMS for approval....

Section 53-4-1003, MCA (2005).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> DPHHS \u201cmay establish, administer, and monitor a program to provide health care to uninsured children.\u201d Section 53-4-1003, MCA; <em>see generally </em>Title 53, Chapter 4, Part 10, MCA. CHIP is a statutorily created program with the purpose \u2018to provide health care to children who are not eligible for health care services under the Montana medicaid program.\u201d Section 53-4-1002(1), MCA. To be qualified for the CHIP program at the time of Dane\u2019s death in July of 2007, a child must have been 18 years of age or younger, have had a combined family income at or below 150% of the federal poverty level or at a lower level determined by DPHHS, may not have been already covered by private insurance offering creditable coverage, may not have been eligible for Medicaid benefits, and must have been a United States citizen or qualified alien and a Montana resident. Section 53-4-1004(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b612 DPHHS, BCBSMT, and KRMC argue that CHIP is not insurance because it is a legislatively provided public assistance program. Shattuck responds that CHIP constitutes disability insurance under Montana statute, and that it is \u2018factually\u201d insurance based upon statute and interdepartmental and public statements made about the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b613 Insurance and insurance companies are governed by Title 33 of the Montana Code Annotated. \u201cInsurance\u201d\u2019 is defined as \u201ca contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another or pay or provide a specified or determinable amount or benefit upon determinable contingencies.\u201dSection 33-l-201(5)(a), MCA. Tndemnity\u201dis defined by Montana statute as \u201ca contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties or of some other person.\u201dSection 28-11-301, MCA. \u201cInsurer\u201d\u2019is defined as \u201cevery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>person engaged as indemnitor, surety, or contractor <em>in the business of entering into contracts of </em>insurance.\u201d Section 33-1-201(6), MCA (emphasis added). Any person or entity desiring to act as an insurer must obtain a certificate of authority issued by the commissioner. Section 33-2-101(1), (3), MCA (\u201c[A] person acting as an insurer and an insurer transacting insurance in this state must have a subsisting certificate of authority issued by the commissioner.... A person who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a felony ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">\u00b614 DPHHS is an agency of state government established pursuant to \u00a72-15-2201, MCA. Undisputed evidence indicates that DPHHS does not have a certificate of authority from the insurance commissioner pursuant to \u00a733-2-101, MCA. DPHHS\u2019 duties include: to \u201cadminister and supervise public assistance,\u2019\u2019\u201cassist and cooperate with other state and federal departments ... by performing services in conformity with public assistance purposes,\u201d and \u201cadminister all state and federal funds allocated to the department for public assistance.\u201d Section 53-2-201(l)(a),(e),(f) MCA. DPHHS has been granted authority to \u201cmake rules, consistent with state and federal law, establishing the amount, scope, and duration of services to be provided to recipients of public assistance.\u201d Section 53-2-201(2)(c), MCA. \u201cPublic assistance\u2019\u201d is defined as \u201ca type of monetary or other assistance furnished under this title [Title 53] to a person by a state or county agency, regardless of the original source of the assistance.\u201dSection 53-4-201(10), MCA (effective July 1, 2006). These provisions illustrate that DPHHS\u2019 duties pertain to the provision of public assistance, as opposed to \u201cengaging]... in the business of entering into contracts of insurance.\u201d Section 33-1-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b615 We have noted that \u00a3Tt]he legislature enacted the Montana Insurance Code, Title 33, MCA, to govern and regulate the business of insurance.\u201d <em>Ogden v. Mont. Power Co., </em>229 Mont. 387, 392, 747 P.2d 201, 204 (1987). In <em>Ogden, </em>we determined that Montana Power Company was not in the business of insurance because it was \u201cprimarily in the business of providing power and utilities to customers, although it insures itself.\u201d <em>Ogden, </em>229 Mont. at 393, 747 P.2d at 205. Similarly, as a general matter, the \u201cbusiness\u201d of DPHHS is to provide public assistance, not to enter into insurance contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">\u00b616 Defendants cite to <em>Thayer v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>1999 MT 304, 297 Mont. 179, 991 P.2d 447, for its analysis of subrogation and the made whole doctrine in the context of a legislatively provided benefit. In <em>Thayer, </em>the Plaintiff Phyllis Thayer\u2019s husband, Gerald, died from injuries received in an employment-related accident, and Phyllis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>received medical and survivor death benefits related to Gerald\u2019s accident from the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF). <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Subsequently, Phyllis recovered settlements from defendants responsible for the damages caused by Gerald\u2019s injuries and death. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Due to that recovery, the UEF advised Phyllis that she was no longer entitled to future survivor benefits from the Fund. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 10. Phyllis then brought an action challenging the UEF\u2019s termination of benefits, arguing that the UEF could not assert a subrogation interest in her settlement until she had been made whole. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 16. On appeal, we rejected Phyllis\u2019 argument, holding the UEF was \u2018hot an insurer and has not been paid premiums\u201d by Gerald\u2019s employer \u201cto assume the risk of any loss.\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 21. We explained that Ttjhe Fund is a legislatively provided source from which to minimize the hardships imposed when an injured worker is unable to get workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of the employer\u2019s failure to provide coverage.\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 21. We noted that the statutes creating the UEF provided that UEF claimants \u201care not guaranteed full payment of benefits ....\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing \u00a739-71-510, MCA). Importantly, for purposes of this case, we distinguished the UEF from an insurer:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Moreover, the statutory scheme of the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund requires that we treat the Fund differently than an insurer. Payments from the Fund are dependent upon the Fund\u2019s ability to pay claims. The legislature has directed the Fund to pay claims to the best of its ability and to make proportional reductions to all Fund claimants when the present funds are inadequate to pay all claims. <em>See </em>\u00a739-71-510, MCA. The setoff provisions contained in \u00a7 39-71-511, MCA, are uniquely necessary to assure some payment to as many uninsured employees as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 22. Reasoning that the UEF \u2018is merely a safety net and stands in the place of the employer,\u201d this Court affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion that the termination of Phyllis\u2019 future survivor benefits was proper. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b617 As a legislatively provided benefit by which hardships on low-income, uninsured children without access to health care are minimized, CHIP serves purposes similar to those we noted with regard to the UEF in <em>Thayer. </em>Since the program\u2019s inception, CHIP enrollees have never paid premiums to DPHHS to assume the risk of loss for health coverage, similar to the absence of any premiums paid by uninsured employers for UEF to assume any loss in <em>Thayer. </em>Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>CHIP is funded from federal and state funds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Also like the UEF in <em>Thayer, </em>the statutory scheme creating CHIP provides that CHIP enrollees are not guaranteed payment of benefits. Under federal statute, \u2018in]othing in this subchapter [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1397aa et seq.] shall be construed as providing an individual with an entitlement to child health assistance under a State child health plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397bb(b)(4). Under state law, Admin. R. M. 37.79.201(9) (2007)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides that \u2018CHIP eligibility and benefits are not an entitlement. If funding is insufficient, the department may reduce enrollment numbers or reduce eligibility to a lower percentage of the federal poverty level to limit the number of individuals who are eligible to participate.\u201d DPHHS is also authorized to reduce benefit levels for those it deems eligible: \u2018If the department determines that there is insufficient funding for the program, it may... limit the amount, scope, or duration of specific services provided.\u201d Section 53-4-1004(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AhS\">\u00b618 Further, since first passed in 1999, the authorizing legislation for CHIP has contained a contingent provision which terminates the program upon loss of federal funding. Laws of Montana, 1999, ch. 571, \u00a7 15, at 2555 (the act \u201cterminates on the date that the director of the department of public health and human services certifies to the governor that the federal government has terminated the program or that federal funding for the program has been discontinued\u201d). Thus, similar to the UEF in <em>Thayer, </em>CHIP eligibility and benefits are dependent upon the availability of funding for DPHHS to pay claims. Equally applicable here is <em>Thayer\u2019s </em>statement that \u2018Tt]he legislature has directed the Fund to pay claims to the best of its ability and to make proportional reductions to all Fund claimants when the present funds are inadequate to pay all claims.\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>see also </em>\u00a753-4-1004(4), MCA; Laws of Montana, 1999, ch. 571, \u00a715, at 2555.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">\u00b619 Shattuck argues that <em>Thayer </em>is distinguishable because \u00a739-71-511, MCA, at issue in <em>Thayer, </em>required the offset of benefits from the UEF, whereas \u2018[t]here is no statute similar to \u00a739-71-511, MCA, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>CHIP.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, while there is not a specific \u201coffset\u201d statute within CHIP\u2019s authorizing legislation, DPHHS is statutorily authorized to lien and collect from third-party recoveries obtained by recipients of public assistance. Section 53-2-612, -613, MCA; <em>see also Blanton v. Mont. Dept. of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2011 MT 110, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14, 360 Mont. 396, 255 P.3d 1229. Moreover, similar to <em>Thayer, </em>there is an abundance of federal and state statutory authority which conditions the payment of CHIP benefits, and even the continuation of the very program, on the receipt of federal funding. DPHHS has been given broad authority to restrict eligibility and decrease services depending on existing financial support for the program. Further, <em>Thayer </em>relied on other factorsAhe lack of payment of premiums, the provision by the Legislature, and the need to assure coverage to as many claimants as possible-all of which are present here. The absence of the particular statute cited in <em>Thayer </em>does not minimize the application of <em>Thayer\u2019s </em>reasoning here.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b620 Shattuck argues that CHIP is \u2018factually\u201d insurance due to the many references to \u2018insurance\u201d within the program\u2019s internal documentation and public advertising, and thus should also be deemed insurance as a matter of law. Shattuck correctly notes that the term \u2018Insurance\u201d appears in the name of the CHIP program as well as in various statutes and public documents. <em>See e.g. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397bb(b)(3)(C) (emphasis added) (\u2018The [State CHIP] plan shall include a description of procedures to be used to ensure ... that the <em>insurance </em>provided under the State child health plan does not substitute for coverage under group health plans\u201d); \u00a753-4-1001, MCA (emphasis added) (\u2018This part may be cited as the \u2018Children\u2019s Health <em>Insurance </em>Program Act.\u2019 \u201d). However, the term more frequently used in federal law is \u201cchild health assistance.\u201d <em>See e.g. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a71397aa; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397bb(b)(l)(A); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397bb(b)(3)(D); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397bb(c)(l); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397gg(a)(l); 42 U.S.C. \u00a71397jj(a). \u201c\u2018Child health assistance\u2019 \u201dis defined as \u201cpayment for part or all of the cost of health benefits coverage for targeted low-income children ....\u201d42 U.S.C. \u00a71397jj(a). State law also typically identifies the CHIP program as a \u2018health care program.\u201d Sections 53-4-1002(1) (\u2018[t]he purpose ... is to create a program to provide health care to children\u201d); 53-4-1003 (DPHHS may \u201cestablish, administer, and monitor a program to provide health care to uninsured children\u201d); 53-4-1009(1), MCA (DPHHS \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>adopt rules necessary for the administration of the program\u201d). DPHHS argues that the \u201ccasual use\u201d of the word \u2018insurance\u201d does not create an insurer/insured relationship or constitute a legal conclusion, and we agree. The use of the term \u2018insurance\u201d does not necessarily make it so, as Tt]he law respects form less than substance.\u201dSection 1-3-219, MCA; <em>see also Epletveit v. Solberg, </em>119 Mont. 45, 60, 169 P.2d 722, 730 (1946) (\u2018Equity will not permit a mere form to conceal the real position and substantial rights of parties.\u201d). We conclude that CHIP is not \u2018factually\u2019insurance as contemplated by Title 33 of the Montana Code Annotated.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">\u00b621  Therefore, based upon a review of the statutory provisions defining insurance and insurer, the statutes governing the CHIP program, and our applicable precedent, we conclude that CHIP does not constitute insurance under Montana law. While Shattuck urges us to hold that CHIP is disability insurance subject to the \u201cmade whole\u201d provision of \u00a733-22-1602(4), MCA, \u201c[djisability insurance\u201dis defined as <em>\u201cinsurance </em>of human beings: (a) against bodily injury, disablement, or death by accident or accidental means or the medical expense or indemnity involved; or (b) against disablement or medical expense or indemnity resulting from sickness.\u201d Section 33-1-207(1), MCA (emphasis added). Given our conclusion that CHIP is not insurance, it necessarily follows that CHIP is not disability insurance and therefore not subject to the statutory \u201cmade whole\u201d provision applicable to such insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b622 Shattuck argues, alternatively, that even if CHIP is not insurance, a \u201cmade whole\u201d rule nonetheless applies pursuant to common law principles and Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution. These issues were likewise raised and analyzed in <em>Thayer. </em>We began by surveying the line of our cases pertaining to the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine, beginning with <em>Skauge v. Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>172 Mont. 521, 565 P.2d 628 (1977). In <em>Skauge, </em>we held that \u201cwhen the insured has sustained a loss in excess of the reimbursement by the insurer, the insured is entitled to be made whole for his entire loss and any costs of recovery, including attorney\u2019s fees, before the insurer can assert its right of legal subrogation against the insured or the tort-feasor.\u201d <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632. We explained that subrogation was \u201ca device of equity which is designed to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by the one who in justice, equity and good conscience should pay it. ... Subrogation is classified as legal or conventional; legal subrogation arises by operation of law, upon the fact of payment made by the insurer; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>whereas conventional subrogation arises by the contract of the parties.\u201d <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont, at 524-25, 565 P.2d at 630. We premised our \u201cmade whole\u201d holding on the reasoning that, \u201c \u2018[w]hen the sum recovered by the Insured from the Tort-feasor is less than the total loss and thus either the Insured or the Insurer must to some extent go unpaid, the loss should be borne by the insurer for that is a risk the insured has paid it to assume.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632 (citation and emphasis omitted); <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 19. This reasoning for application of the made whole doctrine within the insurance context was later reiterated in <em>Zacher v. American Insurance Co., </em>243 Mont. 226, 794 P.2d 335 (1990) and <em>Ness v. Anaconda Minerals Co., </em>279 Mont. 472, 929 P.2d 205 (1996). <em>See also Swanson v. Hartford Insurance Co., </em>2002 MT 81, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.3d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b623 We distinguished the subrogation and \u201cmade whole\u201d principles of these cases in <em>Thayer, </em>reasoning that the holdings in iVess, <em>Zacher, </em>and <em>Skauge </em>did not apply because the UEF was not an insurer, was not paid premiums, and Fund claimants were not guaranteed full payment of benefits by statute. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 21. We then took up the claim that such a result would violate the right to full legal redress as set forth in Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 28. Citing the Constitutional Convention minutes and our analysis of the issue in <em>Trankel v. Montana Department of Military Affairs, </em>282 Mont. 348, 938 P.2d 614 (1997), we reasoned that because the UEF was not an insurer and was statutorily created to provide a substitute source of benefits to the employee of an uninsured employer, \u201c\u00a739-71-511, MCA, does not violate the right to full legal redress as set forth in Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 33. We reach the same conclusions with regard to the CHIP program. <em>See Thayer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 33; <em>see also Blanton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54-55 (the \u201cmade whole\u201d common law doctrine was not implicated for a related public assistance program, Medicaid, because <em>Ark. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, </em>547 U.S. 268, 126 S. Ct. 1752 (2006) was controlling (holding that states can only seek reimbursement of Medicaid expenses under third-party liability statutes from settlement proceeds representing compensation for medical expenses)). Shattuck has not presented arguments under either the common law or the Montana Constitution which require a different outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b624  We conclude that the District Court erred by determining that the Montana Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is \u2018insurance\u201d governed by the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b625 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court err by concluding that BCBSMT, in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>its capacity as third-party administrator of CHIP, is not an \u2018insurer\u201d for purposes of the \u201cmade whole\u201drule?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">\u00b626 On cross appeal, Shattuck contends the District Court erred and that \u2018BCBSMT is an \u2018insurer\u2019 under CHIP or is otherwise obligated to comply with the \u2018made whole\u2019 rule.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Appellants argue that the District Court properly determined that BCBSMT was not an insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b627  Section 53-4-1007(2)(a), MCA, gives DPHHS the authority to \u201ccontract for a health care service based on a fee for service when the department does not contract for a health care service through an insurance plan, a health maintenance organization, or a managed care plan. In operating the program and providing health services, the department may ... contract with an insurance company, third-party administrator, or other entity to provide administrative services, including but not limited to processing and payment of claims with program funds ....\u201d As of October 2006, DPHHS contracted with BCBSMT for third-party administrative services for the CHIP program.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The effective contract between DPHHS and BCBSMT stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">The purpose of this contract is to purchase Third Party Administrative (TPA) services from the Contractor who is an authorized third party administrator with a valid certificate of authority issued by the Montana Commissioner of Insurance to transact business in the State of Montana. The Montana Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan (hereinafter referred to as \u2018CHIP\u201d) provides health coverage for low-income children who are not eligible for Medicaid and are not covered under a contract for health insurance. The Department determines eligibility based on state and federal laws, rules and regulations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(a) It is understood and agreed that Contractor is not a \u2018fiduciary\u201d for the Plan and that such functions have been retained by the Department....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(c) This Agreement is not a third-party beneficiary contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>shall not, in any manner whatsoever create or increase any rights of any Member or other third party with respect to the Plan or Contractor, nor shall this Agreement be deemed a contract of insurance under any laws or regulations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">(d) Under this Agreement Contractor provides administrative claims payment services and does not assume any financial risk or obligation with respect to Claims. Notwithstanding any provision of this Contract, the responsibility of Contractor with respect to the Plan shall be limited to the performance of the ministerial services described in this Contract within a framework of policies, interpretations, rules, practices, and procedures made by the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Under this contract, BCBSMT performed only administrative services for the CHIP program. Having already determined that CHIP is not insurance subject to Title 33, we conclude that our resolution of that issue also resolves the cross appeal. Given the capacity of BCBSMT in this matter as the third-party administrator of CHIP, a public assistance program, we conclude that BCBSMT is not acting as an insurer and is therefore not subject to the made whole rule for purposes of administrating the CHIP program. In sum, because CHIP is not insurance, neither is BCBSMT an insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b628 Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> The District Court noted that Shattuck paid a $4.25 co-payment on KRMC\u2019s charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> Shattuck\u2019s briefing indicates that a highway design claim was also recently settled for the sum of $55,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> Shattuck also requested that the matter be certified as a class action, seeking injunctive relief, compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages, and attorney fees.

Montana HMK now includes the state public assistance programs, Montana children\u2019s Medicaid, and Montana CHIP. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-4-1104(2), MCA (2009).
