We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b62 On June 19, 2010, Bozeman Police Officer Joel Hiester observed Jason Jenkins driving a motorcycle erratically. Hiester stopped Jenkins, administered field sobriety tests, and arrested him for driving a motorcycle under the influence of alcohol. At the Gallatin County Detention Center Jenkins agreed to a breath test using the Intoxilyzer 8000 device. The test showed that Jenkins had a blood alcohol content of .138. The State charged Jenkins with DUI, fourth or subsequent offense, a felony, \u00a761-8-731, MCA. That charge was tried to a jury in March, 2011 and Jenkins was convicted. The District Court committed Jenkins to the Montana Department of Corrections for 13 months, followed by a five-year suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b63 On appeal Jenkins contends that the District Court erred by admitting hearsay evidence as part of the foundation for the admission of the results of his breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b64 Determining the adequacy of the foundation for admission of evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>State v. Pol, </em>2008 MT 352, \u00b6 11, 346 Mont. 322, 195 P.3d 807. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s rulings on admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion, which occurs if the trial judge acts arbitrarily or unreasonable and substantial injustice results. <em>State v. Bonamarte, </em>2009 MT 243, \u00b6 13, 351 Mont. 419, 213 P.3d 457; <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2007 MT 49, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 164, 153 P.3d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u00b65 The State of Montana closely regulates breath analysis instruments like the Intoxilyzer 8000, and the Montana Department of Justice has adopted regulations that law enforcement agencies must follow to insure the accuracy of the results of breath tests. <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2011 MT 184, \u00b6 6, 361 Mont. 301, 258 P.3d 417; <em>State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, \u00b6 8, 297 Mont. 263, 991 P.2d 461. The regulations require that the accuracy of the instruments be certified annually by the State and once every 31 days in the field, usually by the local law enforcement agency. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 7. The State must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>demonstrate that the accuracy of the instrument was certified in accordance with the regulations as part of the foundation for admission of breath test evidence. <em>State v. Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b6 8, 289 Mont. 399, 961 P.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b66 At Jenkins\u2019 trial the State, through the testimony of Officer Hiester, submitted the annual certification of the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer 8000 by the Forensic Science Division of the Montana Department of Justice. That document was received without objection. The State then offered through Hiester two field certification documents for the device, prepared by an officer with the Gallatin County Sheriffs Department. Jenkins objected to the field certification documents as hearsay because Hiester, while certified as a breath test specialist, was not the author or custodian of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b67 On appeal Jenkins argues that the field certification documents were hearsay and were admissible only upon compliance with M. R. Evid. 803(6). That Rule provides an exception to hearsay exclusion for \u201crecords of regularly conducted activity\u201d as attested by the \u201ccustodian or other qualified witness.\u201d Jenkins contends that Hiester was not a \u201ccustodian or other qualified witness\u201d who could provide the required foundation for the field certification documents under Rule 803 because he did not observe or participate in the certification of the breath testing instrument. Jenkins contends that the District Court therefore erred in considering the field certifications as part of the foundation for the breath test evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b68 When a district court is considering the State\u2019s foundation evidence preliminary to determining whether to admit the results of a breath test, it must proceed under M. R. Evid. 104(4); <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 14. Rule 104(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court. <em>In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence </em>except those with respect to privileges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">(Emphasis added.) It is established that when a district court is determining whether there is adequate foundation for admission of breath test results in a DUI prosecution, Rule 104(a) authorizes the court to do so without regard to whether the certification forms are hearsay. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 16. In <em>State v. White, </em>2009 MT 26, 349 Mont. 109, 201 P.3d 808, there is language that indicates that breath instrument certification documents are hearsay and may not be received by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>district court unless the State demonstrates an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See e.g. White, </em>\u00b6 12. This language is inconsistent with <em>Delaney </em>and with <em>State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, \u00b6 32, 326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001, where we followed Delaney and held that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was not implicated by the use of these certification reports. Although neither party cited <em>White </em>in its briefs, we have overruled prior decisions when necessary to resolve discrepancy in our case law, and we conclude that it is appropriate to do so here. <em>See Quantum Elec. v. Schaeffer, </em>2003 MT 29, \u00b6 24, 314 Mont. 193, 64 P.3d 1026; <em>Gilco v. Permann, </em>2006 MT 30, \u00b6 24, 331 Mont. 112, 130 P.3d 155. Therefore, to the extent that <em>White </em>is inconsistent with <em>Delaney, </em>M. R. Evid. 104(a) and this opinion, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b69  In the present case the State was not required to demonstrate that the field certifications fell within an exception to the hearsay rule. Neither the admissibility of the certifications nor whether they were an exception to the hearsay rule were determinative of whether the District Court could consider them in deciding whether there was adequate foundation for the breath test results. The existence of foundation is a question of law for the district court to decide and is not an issue for the jury. The certifications are not substantive evidence of the DUI offense. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b610  Jenkins has not attempted to distinguish the clear rule of <em>Delaney </em>or M. R. Evid. 104(a) which control the result in this case. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the results of the breath test. The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
