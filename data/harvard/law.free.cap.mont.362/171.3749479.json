She also challenges a sentencing condition that prohibits her from entering bars. The State concedes that the restitution determination was not supported by substantial evidence. We reverse in part and affirm in part and remand for recalculation of restitution. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err by ordering payment of lost profits, in addition to the replacement value of the stolen goods, as part of O\u2019Connell\u2019s restitution obligation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by prohibiting O\u2019Connell from entering bars as a condition of her sentence ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b64 O\u2019Connell and her husband were involved in a theft scheme whereby O\u2019Connell\u2019s husband would steal property from a local business and sell the stolen goods for cash. The Hunting Shack, Inc. is a Ravalli County business that buys and refurbishes expended brass bullet casings. O\u2019Connell\u2019s husband would sneak into the fenced storage area of The Hunting Shack, collect the casings in containers, roll the containers back under the fence, and load them into O\u2019Connell\u2019s vehicle. O\u2019Connell would then drive to a recycling company where her husband would sell the casings as scrap metal. From April to October of 2009, the couple stole 33,815 pounds of expended brass casings and received $32,179.25 in payments from the sale of the casings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">\u00b65 O\u2019Connell pled guilty to Accountability for Theft (Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Scheme) under \u00a745-2-301 and 45-6-301 (l)(a), MCA (2007), <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to a plea agreement. O\u2019Connell\u2019s husband was charged with felony theft and sentenced to 10 years in prison for his part in the scheme. O\u2019Connell\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) revealed that she is an illegal drug user, indulging in marijuana daily without a medical marijuana card and using hard drugs with frequency in the past. The PSI indicated that, although her current use of alcohol is rare, O\u2019Connell had alcohol problems in her teenage years and received a Minor in Possession of Alcohol citation during that time. O\u2019Connell had previously participated in two outpatient chemical dependency programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b66 The District Court imposed a two-year deferred imposition of sentence with various conditions, including prohibitions on entering bars, entering casinos, and on consumption of alcohol. During the oral imposition of sentence, the District Court stated: \u201cWith regard to ... entry into bars, I think it would be extremely unseemly for the Defendant to be ... having a good time in a bar when she\u2019s owing $159,000 to a business that she stole from, and so I will implement those recommendations.\u201d In addition, O\u2019Connell was ordered to pay restitution to The Hunting Shack in the amount of $159,606.80, representing both the cost and the lost profits for the stolen brass casings. The amount designated as profits lost on the casings was provided by the manager of The Hunting Shack, with little explanation of how the amount was calculated. O\u2019Connell contests the condition prohibiting her from entering bars and the portion of the restitution amount attributed to The Hunting Shack\u2019s lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b67 We review factual findings regarding restitution to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Essig, </em>2009 MT 340, \u00b6 12, 353 Mont. 99, 218 P.3d 838 (citing <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426). Factual findings are clearly erroneous when they are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>State v. Coluccio, </em>2009 MT 273, \u00b6 40, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282, (citing <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313). Evidence is substantial if a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Coluccio, </em>\u00b6 40 (citing <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>26, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998). Conclusions of law regarding the measure of restitution are reviewed for correctness. <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 1, 11 P.3d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b68 We review probation and sentencing conditions under a two-pronged review. First, we will review de novo the legality of the probation or sentencing conditions. Then, we will review the reasonableness of the conditions for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Sadowsky, </em>2008 MT 405, \u00b6 10, 347 Mont. 192, 197 P.3d 1018; <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, \u00b6 7, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966; <em>State v. Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 511, 182 P.3d 88; <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b69 <em>1. Did the District Court err by ordering payment of lost profits, in addition to the replacement value of the stolen brass casings, as part of O\u2019Connell\u2019s restitution obligation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b610 O\u2019Connell argues that \u201cthe district court erred as a matter of law when it determined that lost profits was a proper measure of restitution,\u201d and, alternatively, that even if lost profits were proper, the amount awarded was not supported by substantial evidence in this case. O\u2019Connell points to the invoices used by The Hunting Shack\u2019s manager in determining the cost of the stolen casings. The manager admitted he used the wrong invoices for the calculation and that those invoices were from different shipments than those from which the casings were stolen. Noting the calculus the manager used for lost profits, O\u2019Connell argues the manager did not explain how the factors that went into the calculus were determined, did not offer testimony regarding the proper sale price of the casings, and did not provide testimony regarding the cost of labor. The manager admitted his figures were based on the assumption that all the stolen casings would have been remanufactured and that he did not account for casings that would be found to be unsuitable for remanufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b611 To the extent that O\u2019Connell argues lost profits were not a proper measure of restitution as a matter of law, the State argues future lost profits may be an appropriate measure of damages for a restitution award, citing to <em>State v. Kalal, </em>2009 MT 103, \u00b6 2, 350 Mont. 128, 204 P.3d 1240. The State also argues that lost profits need not be calculable with precision, citing to <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 29, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495 (lost profits are recoverable so long as 'the losses were calculated by use of reasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u00b612 A sentencing court must \u201crequire an offender to make full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>restitution to any victim who has sustained pecuniary loss, including a person suffering an economic loss.\u201d Section 46-18-241 (1), MCA. Pecuniary loss is defined as \u201call special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities ....\u2019\u2019Section 46-18-243 (l)(a), MCA. The definition of pecuniary loss was amended in 2003 to include \u201cthe full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, harmed, or otherwise devalued as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d Section 46-18-243 (l)(b), MCA. Because the definition of \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d includes damages that could be recovered in a civil action, we look to precedent in tort and contract law to determine the proper measure of restitution. <em>Kalal, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b613 In <em>Stensvad v. Miners and Merchants Bank of Roundup, </em>196 Mont. 193, 640 P.2d 1303 (1982), a breach of contract case, we stated that damages for lost profits may be awarded if they are not speculative. <em>Stensvad, </em>196 Mont. at 206, 640 P.2d at 1310; <em>Silfvast v. Asplund, </em>99 Mont. 152, 161-62, 42 P.2d 452, 456 (1935). In <em>Trifad Ent., Inc. v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 227, 306 Mont. 499, 36 P.3d 363, a conversion case, we remanded for determination of damages, including possible damages for \u201cfuture lost income and profits ....\u201d <em>Trifad, </em>\u00b6 45. We have also held that, if the circumstances warrant, \u2018loss of future profits, although often speculative, are recoverable ....\u201d <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29. These cases demonstrate that, as a matter of law, lost profits can be ordered as part of a restitution condition within a criminal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A7T\">\u00b614  However, the State has conceded to O\u2019Connell\u2019s alternative argument-that the District Court\u2019s determination of lost profits in this matter was based upon speculation and not supported by substantial evidence. Because the casings were timely replaced, there was no evidence the profits of the company were actually affected. Further, the State notes the evidence the manager offered was not sufficient to support the multiplier he used to calculate the lost profits. Thus, the evidence presented was not calculated by use of \u201creasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29. We reverse the restitution award and remand for recalculation of restitution based upon the replacement value of the casings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b615 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by prohibiting O\u2019Connell from entering bars as a condition of her sentence ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b616 When a district court defers imposition of sentence, as here, it has authority to impose \u201cany ... reasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d Section 46-18-201 (4)(o), MCA. District courts also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>have broad authority to order \u201cany ... limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202 (l)(f), MCA. The condition must have a nexus to either the offender or the offense. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. In order to have a nexus to the offender or offense, this condition must \u201crelate to rehabilitation or protection of society within the particular context of an offender\u2019s crime or the unique background, characteristics, or conduct of the offender.\u201d <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>2010 MT 44, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 286, 228 P.3d 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b617 O\u2019Connell argues the District Court abused its discretion by imposing the condition prohibiting her from entering bars because she does not have a recent history of alcohol abuse. She argues that neither alcohol nor drugs were related to her theft offense, and therefore, the condition is overly broad. She reasons that the restriction will be detrimental to her ability to gain employment since she will be unable to work in a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b618 However, O\u2019Connell admits to recent and chronic drug abuse, stating she uses marijuana on a daily basis to self-medicate and provide \u201crelief from my anxiety symptoms,\u201d despite having a prescription for anxiety medication. Her PSI states she has a long history of hard drug use, including \u201ca whole lot\u201d of methamphetamines, and use of hash, cocaine, LSD, and mushrooms. O\u2019Connell does not have a medical marijuana card and is prohibited from using illegal drugs as one of her sentencing conditions, which she does not challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b619 In <em>Brotherton, </em>we upheld a condition that prohibited alcohol consumption due to Brotherton\u2019s background and characteristics of drug use, including a significant history of illegal drug dependency. <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-24 (internal quotations omitted). We were persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that \u201cthere is a real danger that [he] will simply replace his addiction for illegal drugs with the legal drug of alcohol.\u201d <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. In <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, 322 Mont. 294, 95 P.3d 717, we upheld conditions that prohibited Kroll from gambling and entering casinos. <em>Kroll, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Kroll\u2019s behavior had demonstrated that he was easily lured into money-making schemes, although he had no previous problems with gambling in casinos. Nonetheless, we upheld the casino condition because it bore a \u201csufficient connection\u201d to his offense and furthered Kroll\u2019s rehabilitation. <em>Kroll, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31; <em>see also State v. Greensweight, </em>2008 MT 185, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29, 343 Mont. 474, 187 P.3d 613 (upholding a condition prohibiting alcohol where defendant had a long history of drug use, but little history of alcohol use).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u00b620  The principles stated in these cases are equally applicable to O\u2019 Connell and the bar condition. O\u2019 Connell has a long history of illegal drug use and continues to use on a daily basis. A restriction on entering bars is sufficiently connected to her circumstances and furthers her rehabilitation by preventing her from being in places where alcohol is purveyed, which may lessen the chance that she will replace or supplement her use of illegal drugs with alcohol and thereby hinder her rehabilitation. <em>See Brotherton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Although the District Court\u2019s statement that it was imposing the condition for purposes of appearances was unnecessary, the condition was properly imposed upon O\u2019Connell. <em>See Ronning v. Yellowstone County, </em>2011 MT 79, \u00b6 8, 360 Mont. 108, 253 P.3d 818 (\u2018We will not reverse a district court where it reached the right result, although for the wrong reason.\u201d). We affirm the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b621 Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> Although the defendant\u2019s acts continued until October 3, 2009, and \u00a745-6-301, MCA, was amended effective October 1,2009, the language of the subsection pertinent to the charge here was not revised.
