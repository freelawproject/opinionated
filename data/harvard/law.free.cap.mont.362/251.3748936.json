R. App. P. 15(3) on a certified question from the Honorable Ralph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>B. Kirscher, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the District of Montana. The question of law is: Whether, under Montana\u2019s liberal construction of exemptions, Debtors may claim an exemption in a Yamaha 4 wheel all-terrain vehicle (\u201cATV\u201d), as a sporting good pursuant to \u00a725-13-609(1), MCA. This Court accepted the certified question on April 19, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b62 The undisputed facts, supplied by the Bankruptcy Court, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">1. Debtors are joint debtors and this is a joint case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">2. Debtors filed their bankruptcy case on December 13, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">3. The Debtors\u2019 Amended Schedule B itemizing their personal property lists at paragraph 25 a 2006 Yamaha 4 wheel ATV. Schedule C lists Debtors\u2019 exemptions, including an exemption in the 2006 Yamaha ATV claimed exempt as \u201cSporting Goods\u201d pursuant to MCA \u00a725-13-609(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">4. The Trustee objected to Debtors\u2019 claim of exemption under \u00a725-13-609(1) on the grounds that the sporting goods exemption does not apply to an ATV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">5. Debtors responded to the Trustee\u2019s objection asserting that, under the liberal construction of Montana exemption statutes provided at Article XIII, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution, and the plain language of \u00a7 25-13-609(1), their ATV should be exempt as a sporting good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The Bankruptcy Court requests an answer to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u00b63 Article XIII, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution requires the Legislature to enact liberal homestead and exemption laws, which the courts will liberally construe in favor of debtors where the legislative intent is not clear. <em>In re Maynard, </em>2006 MT 162, \u00b6 4, 332 Mont. 485, 139 P.3d 803. Liberal construction may not, however, disregard the plain mandate of the legislature. <em>MacDonald v. Mercill, </em>220 Mont. 146, 151, 714 P.2d 132, 135 (1986); \u00a71-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">\u00b64 Section 25-13-609, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">A judgment debtor is entitled to exemption from execution of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">(1) the judgment debtor\u2019s interest, not to exceed $4500 in aggregate value, to the extent of a value not exceeding $600 in any item of property, in ... firearms and other sporting goods ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">(2) the judgment debtor\u2019s interest, not to exceed $2500 in value, in one motor vehicle[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">The Holzapfels contend that their ATV falls under the exemption for \u2018firearms and other sporting goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u00b65  The parties have focused their arguments on whether an ATV is a \u201csporting good\u201dunder \u00a725-13-609(1), MCA. However, an ATV is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under Montana law, and consequently it falls under the specific \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d exemption provided in \u00a7 25-13-609(2), MCA. Section 61-1-101(46), MCA (2011), defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as a \u2018Vehicle propelled by its own power,\u201d and includes a \u201cquadricycle if it is equipped for use on the highways.\u201d A quadricycle can be for both highway and off-highway use, and is characterized as a motor vehicle even if designed for offroad use. Section 61-1-101(50), MCA (2011).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a quadricycle, the ATV is subject to registration and title requirements. Sections 61-3-201; -313(2); and -321(8), MCA. Under Montana law, the meaning of a word or phrase defined in the code is applicable wherever that word or phrase occurs \u201cexcept where a contrary intention plainly appears.\u201d Section 1-2-107, MCA. Therefore, the cited definitions in Title 61 apply to the phrase \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in Title 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b66 These registration and title requirements applicable to \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d are not applicable to \"firearms or other sporting goods.\u201d Since the Legislature has provided a specific and separate exemption for a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d it follows that the exemption for \u2018firearms and other sporting goods\u201d was not intended to include motor vehicles. This Court must apply the plain mandate of the legislature. <em>MacDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 151, 714 P.2d at 135; <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. Dep\u2019t. of Natural Resources &amp; Cons., </em>2005 MT 351, \u00b6 13, 330 Mont. 186, 127 P.3d 394; \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (the role of the court is to ascertain and declare the terms and substance of a statute, striving to adopt a construction giving effect to all provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b67  Therefore, the answer to the certified question is that under Montana law the Debtors may not claim an exemption in a Yamaha 4 wheel all-terrain vehicle as a sporting good pursuant to \u00a725-13-609(1), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b277-8\">JUSTICE WHEAT dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b68 Article XIII, \u00a75 of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he legislature shall enact liberal homestead and exemption laws.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Furthermore, we are committed to \u201cliberally construe exemption laws in favor of debtors where legislative intent is not clear.\u201d <em>In re Maynard, </em>2006 MT 162, \u00b6 4, 332 Mont. 485, 139 P.3d 803 (citing <em>In re Zimmerman, </em>2002 MT 90, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 337, 46 P.3d 599; <em>MacDonald v.

First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Great Falls, </em>207 Mont. 376, 383, 675 P.2d 96, 100 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b69 The question here is whether an ATV qualifies for exemption under \u00a725-13-609(1), MCA, as a \u201csporting good.\u201dThe majority relies on the definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to include a quadricycle (\u00a761-1-101(46), MCA (2011)), and the registration and title requirements attendant thereto, to disqualify an ATV as a \u201csporting good.\u201d I think the majority\u2019s analysis is too restrictive. There are thousands of farmers, ranchers, hunters, and other outdoor sports enthusiasts who use ATVs as an integral part of their outdoor activities. A hunter riding his ATV into the back country with his hunting rifle is certainly using his firearm \u201cand other sporting goods.\u201d ATV club members trailering their ATVs to a back country trailhead for a group ride in the mountains could be considered as recreating with sporting goods.</p>\n<p id=\"ATT\">\u00b610 Such liberal construction was recognized by Bankruptcy Judge Peterson in <em>In re Mutchler, </em>95 B.R. 748 (D. Mont. 1989). In <em>Mutchler, </em>the debtor claimed an exemption under \u00a725-13-609(1), MCA, in a boat, a boat trailer, a snowmobile, and a motorcycle. In allowing these exemptions, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">Thus, I conclude that under [\u00a7] 25-13-609(1) [, MCA,] any item of property may be exempt up to $600.00, provided the entire exemption for all items of property including those specifically enumerated does not exceed $4,500.00 in the aggregate. I believe this interpretation comports with legislative intent and clearly eliminates much controversy over what particular items may be claimed as exempt. Since each item of property claimed exempt by Bonnie Mutchler, except the 1970 Silverline boat and Yamaha motorcycle is less than $600.00, those items are properly exempt under \u00a725-13-609(1) [,MCA]. As to the boat and motorcycle, those items will be turned over to the Trustee for sale, whereupon Bonnie Mutchler will be given a credit for $600.00 in each item as her exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Mutchler, </em>95 B.R. at 755. Although Judge Peterson was extending the exemption to a boat, trailer, snowmobile, and motorcycle rather than an ATV, the same logic applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b611 People who are forced to file for bankruptcy are entitled to a fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>start. Part of that fresh start, as recognized by our Constitution, is a liberal construction of the exemption laws. For these reasons, I would allow the exemption in the ATV.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-4\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> The cited definitions in subsections (46) and (50) of \u00a7 61-1-101, MCA, were renumbered in the 2011 publication of the Montana Code Annotated. In the 2009 edition of the code, those same subsections were numbered (40) and (44) respectively. The definition of \u201coff-highway vehicle\u201d remained unchanged from 2009 to 2011, but the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d was amended in ways that do not affect the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
