The Estate of Terry L. Richerson (Estate) through its personal representative, Deborah Richerson, appeals from the order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, granting summary judgment to The Cincinnati Insurance Company (Cincinnati). We affirm. We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment in favor of Cincinnati?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u00b63 The dispute concerns the Estate\u2019s entitlement to medical payments under a motor vehicle policy issued by Cincinnati for the subject vehicle. We discuss the tragic facts in order to provide the foundation for the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\u00b64 Terry L. Richerson (Mr. Richerson) was the owner and foreman of a concrete finishing company. His company was one of two concrete finishing subcontractors working on a project for the Benefis Hospital in Great Falls. On November 2,2005, Mr. Richerson crossed the street from the area in which his company was performing concrete work to use an outhouse. After exiting the outhouse, Mr. Richerson was seriously injured when a concrete truck, owned by United Materials and employed by the other concrete subcontractor, backed over him. Mr. Richerson was caught in the truck\u2019s differential or driveshaft, and although the exact distance is disputed, he was transported at least five feet and possibly up to fifty feet by the truck. Mr. Richerson had no physical contact with or other connection to the truck prior to the accident. He later died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">\u00b65 The Estate requested medical payments under the policy Cincinnati issued to United Materials for the truck involved in the accident. Cincinnati denied the claim. The pertinent language of the medical payments coverage section of the Cincinnati policy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">A. Coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">We will pay reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>and funeral services to or for an \u2018insured\u201d who sustains \u2018bodily injury\u201d caused by \u201caccident\u201d....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">B. Who is an Insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">3. Anyone for injuries while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered \u201cauto\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">F. Additional Definitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">2. \u2018Occupying\u201d means in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b66 The policy thus provides coverage for injuries suffered by a claimant while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered auto, and \u201coccupying\u201d is further defined as \u2018in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u201d The Estate argued to the District Court that because Mr. Richerson was caught in and transported by the concrete truck, he was \u201cupon\u201d it, and therefore he was \u201coccupying\u201d the truck, qualifying him as an insured under the policy. Cincinnati countered that Mr. Richerson was not \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle, did not meet the definition of \u2018insured,\u201d and was not entitled to coverage. Both parties filed for summary judgment, agreeing that no issues of material fact were in dispute. Applying the \u201creasonable connection\u201d test from our case precedent, the District Court concluded that Mr. Richerson was not occupying the covered auto as defined in the policy and, accordingly, granted summary judgment in favor of Cincinnati.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u00b67 We will review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district courts. <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 275, \u00b6 19,345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389 (citing <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 9, 293 Mont. 140, 974 P.2d 623). We review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of a contract for correctness. <em>Giacometti v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 14, 354 Mont. 15, 221 P.3d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment in favor of Cincinnati?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b69 Summary judgment is only appropriate \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\u201d along with any affidavits demonstrate that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and that the party moving for summary judgment is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M. R. Civ. P. \u2018The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law.\u201d <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 10. Here, both parties take the position that no issues of material fact exist. Thus, whether summary judgment is appropriate turns on the correctness of the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions in interpreting the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b610  We have employed the \u201creasonable connection\u201d test to determine whether an injured person is an occupant of a vehicle for purposes of obtaining coverage under the vehicle\u2019s insurance. <em>Nelson v. Iowa Mut. Ins. Co., </em>163 Mont. 82, 515 P.2d 362 (1973); <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont. 336, 628 P.2d 659. Under this test, we look to whether the claimant\u2019s activities at the time of the accident \u201cwere so reasonably connected\u201d to the insured auto that, under the law, the claimant could be said to be an occupant within the policy\u2019s meaning. <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont, at 339, 628 P.2d at 661 (citing <em>Nelson, </em>163 Mont. 82, 515 P.2d 362); <em>see Nelson, </em>163 Mont, at 86, 515 P.2d at 364 (determining whether \u2018Tsjuch activity was reasonably carried out and was reasonably connected with the operation of the vehicle.\u201d). Pursuant thereto, Cincinnati argues that because Mr. Richerson was neither in contact with the truck nor engaged in any activity with the truck prior to the accident, he was not reasonably connected to the vehicle. In other words, Mr. Richerson was not associated with the truck for any purpose except for the accident itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b611 The Estate argues that because Mr. Richerson was caught in and transported five to fifty feet, he was \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle. Citing <em>Aucoin v. Lafayette Ins. Co., </em>771 So.2d 95, 97 (La. App. 3 Cir. 2000), the Estate asks that we reject application of the reasonable connection test, offering that Tc]overage issues that hinge on whether a claimant was \u2018upon\u2019 a vehicle fall into two categories: those where the claimant was actually upon the vehicle and those where the claimant wasn\u2019t.\u201d The Estate asks us to find that Mr. Richerson was \u201coccupying\u201d the truck by virtue of his physical contact with it and end the inquiry, arguing that \u201c[t]he \u2018reasonable connection\u2019 test was developed for claimants who have no or only tenuous contact with a covered vehicle when injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>.... It has no application in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b612 <em>Aucoin </em>categorized cases depending on whether or not the claimant had physical contact with the vehicle at the time of the accident. <em>Aucoin, </em>771 So.2d at 97. Depending upon the circumstances, a claimant could be found to be \u201cupon\u201d the covered vehicle and therefore \u201coccupying\u201dit, in either category. <em>Aucoin, </em>771 So.2d at 97-98; <em>see Hastings v. Int\u2019l Serv. Ins. Co., </em>490 So.2d 656 (La. App. 2 Cir. 1986) (claimant in physical contact with insured auto was found to be \u201coccupying*); <em>Westerfield v. LaFleur, </em>493 So.2d 600 (La. 1986) (claimant <em>not </em>in physical contact with insured auto found to be \u201coccupying\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b613 However, the Estate\u2019s argument requires that virtually any pedestrian injured in a vehicle accident would be deemed to be \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle by having been in any way \u201con\u201d the vehicle at the moment the accident occurred. Even <em>Aucoin </em>noted that \u201c[t]he fact that the impact caused [the claimant] to touch the insured vehicle should not determine coverage.\u201d <em>Aucoin, </em>771 So.2d at 98 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b614 The reasonable connection test we have employed permits a broad review of the facts, avoiding a microscopic focus on whether the claimant was physically \u201con\u201d the vehicle at the moment of impact, as demonstrated in <em>Sayers. </em>There, Donald Sayers was tuning-up a vehicle for Charles Storm. Sayers advised Storm to run the engine to clean the carburetor, so Storm left to purchase gasoline. On the way to the gas station, Storm\u2019s vehicle ran out of gas. Storm walked back to Sayers\u2019s, obtained a can of gasoline and a set of jumper cables from Sayers, and rode back to the stalled vehicle with a man named Yates. Yates and Storm were unable to start the stalled vehicle, so they returned to Sayers\u2019s for his assistance. Sayers, Storm, and a man named Galetti then drove to the stalled vehicle in Galetti\u2019s Suburban, intending to use it to jump start Storm\u2019s vehicle. Galetti parked with his Suburban facing Storm\u2019s vehicle to facilitate the jump. As Sayers was leaning over the engine of Storm\u2019s vehicle, an uninsured vehicle struck Storm\u2019s vehicle, pinning Sayers between the Storm vehicle and the Galetti Suburban. <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont, at 337-38, 628 P.2d at 660-61. Sayers sought payment under Galetti\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, but Safeco contended that Sayers was not \u201coccupying\u201d Galetti\u2019s Suburban since he was working on Storm\u2019s vehicle and several feet away from Galetti\u2019s Suburban at the time of the accident. Similar to the policy definition in the present case, Galetti\u2019s Safeco policy defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin or upon or entering into or alighting from.\u201d <em>Sayers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>192 Mont, at 338, 628 P.2d at 661. We reasoned that, although Sayers was not in physical contact with the Galetti vehicle, \u2018Sayers rode in the Galetti vehicle for the single purpose of jump-starting the disabled car using Galetti\u2019s battery. His attempted assistance was undeniably dependent upon and thus reasonably connected to the Galetti vehicle.\u201d <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont, at 339, 628 P.2d at 661. Sayers\u2019s \u201c \u2018activity [was] reasonably carried out and [was] reasonably connected with the operation of the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont, at 339, 628 P.2d at 661 (quoting <em>Nelson, </em>163 Mont, at 86, 515 P.2d at 364). Thus, despite the fact that Sayers was not in contact with the vehicle at the time of the accident, we held that he was nonetheless \u201coccupying\u201d the Galetti vehicle and was covered. <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont, at 339, 628 P.2d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"AqBn\">\u00b615 Unlike Sayers, Mr. Richerson had no contact with or connection to the vehicle other than the accident itself. The concrete truck was not hired by Mr. Richerson and was being used on a separate job. He was not working with the truck in any way and was not entering or exiting the truck. He had no purpose or connection with the truck other than the incidental contact that led to his unfortunate injuries and death. This was insufficient to trigger coverage under the definition of \u201coccupying\u201d in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\">\u00b616  The District Court correctly concluded that Mr. Richerson was not an insured and did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, MORRIS and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-11\"> As part of its analysis, the District Court first applied the \u201cphysical contact\u201d test and concluded that because Mr. Richerson was not in physical contact with the vehicle immediately prior to the accident, he was not occupying the vehicle. However, we explained in <em>Sayers v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>192 Mont. 336, 628 P.2d 659 (1981), that the physical contact test \u2018is not determinative under Montana law\u201dand essentially rejected it as the proper test. <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont. at 338. Indeed, the claimant in <em>Sayers </em>was \u201cat least ten feet\u201d from the vehicle at the time of the accident, yet we concluded he was covered by the policy. <em>Sayers, </em>192 Mont. at 338-39. As indicated by the discussion herein, a claimant\u2019s physical contact with the insured vehicle is factually relevant to the \u2018Reasonable connection\u201d test, but it is not a stand-alone test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
