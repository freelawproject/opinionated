We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">\u00b62 The facts surrounding the underlying charges are detailed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281, and we will not fully recite them here. Riggs was convicted by a jury of incest, sexual intercourse without consent, and two counts of sexual assault, all felonies, involving the sexual abuse of four young girls-D.M., D.C. (one of Riggs\u2019 step-daughters), S.M., and M.J. Riggs was sentenced to 24 years in the Montana State Prison, followed by a suspended sentence of 25 years. This Court affirmed his conviction. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"AXj\">\u00b63 Riggs, acting pro se, filed his first petition for postconviction relief on July 26, 2006. The District Court initially denied Riggs\u2019 petition. Riggs obtained counsel and was allowed to file an amended petition for postconviction relief (\u2018Petition\u201d). The Petition alleged approximately 80 claims of ineffective assistance of Riggs\u2019 trial counsel, Herman \u2018Chuck\u201d Watson III (\u2018Watson\u201d). The State responded. The District Court partially denied Riggs\u2019 Petition, finding that many of Riggs\u2019 claims were procedurally barred, did not satisfy the pleading requirements, did not pass substantive review, or were withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">\u00b64 An evidentiary hearing was held on the 12 remaining claims in Riggs\u2019 Petition on October 22-23, 2009. Both parties submitted evidence and witness testimony. On September 29, 2010, the District Court issued extensive Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order denying Riggs\u2019 remaining 12 claims. Riggs appeals. We will discuss the facts of each claim separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b65 We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 66, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74; <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 14, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b66 Riggs\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claims can be grouped into two general areas^retrial and trial. He alleges that Watson \u201cdid no pretrial work,\u201d specifically that Watson failed to: (1) file motions; (2) interview witnesses; (3) object to the Information being amended; (4) prepare his witnesses to testify; and (5) object to the late disclosure of the State\u2019s rebuttal expert. Riggs also alleges that during trial, Watson failed to: (1) properly conduct voir dire and challenge jurors; (2) object to the admission of the victims\u2019/witnesses\u2019 prior consistent statements; and (3) object to the admission of Riggs\u2019 statements. Riggs argues these errors alone, or cumulatively, warrant the reversal of his conviction and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b67 We note that Riggs\u2019 appeal focuses exclusively on the issues stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>above in \u00b6 6, and does not address all the 80-plus claims alleged in his Petition and subsequently dismissed by the District Court. Our consideration of Riggs\u2019 appeal is confined to the issues presented. <em>See In re B.P., </em>2001 MT 219, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 430, 35 P.3d 291 (we will not formulate arguments for a party on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b68 The State argues that while Riggs\u2019 expert (in his postconviction proceedings), William Boggs (\u2018Boggs\u2019), would have conducted his defense much differently, Watson\u2019s performance falls -within the wide range of professionally competent assistance. The State asserts that Riggs has not shown the errors, if any, were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b69 When reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we employ the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984). <em>State v. Savage, </em>2011 MT 23, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. 207, 248 P.3d 308. In order for a criminal defendant to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he or she must demonstrate both (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687; <em>Savage, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 67. If the defendant makes an insufficient showing regarding one prong, the other need not be addressed. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b610 To establish deficient performance, the defendant must show that, considering all the circumstances, counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. In making this determination, we keep in mind that counsel\u2019s function is to make the adversarial process work in a particular case. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690. We \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 69. In scrutinizing counsel\u2019s performance, we must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15. That another attorney would have handled the case differently does not mean counsel was ineffective. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689 (\u2018There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u2019). We \u201cmust judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed at the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690. The Sixth Amendment guarantees reasonable competence, not perfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b611  A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will not succeed when predicated upon counsel\u2019s failure to make motions or objections which, under the circumstances, would have been frivolous, or would have, arguably, lacked procedural or substantive merit, or would likely not have changed the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Heddings v. State, </em>2011 MT 228, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 90, 265 P.3d 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b612 A defendant must also establish prejudiceAhat but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 67. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403. The prejudice inquiry focuses on whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance renders the trial result unreliable or the proceedings fundamentally unfair. <em>State v. Rose, </em>2009 MT 4, \u00b6 115, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749 (abrogated on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">A. Alleged Pretrial Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">1. Pretrial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b613 First, Riggs alleges that Watson failed to file any pretrial motions, other than one motion to sever. He argues the motion to sever \u201cneglected to put forward the best argument for severance.\u201d This, Riggs argues, \u201centitles\u201d him to a presumption of ineffectiveness. However, the presumption of ineffectiveness arises only in extraordinary circumstances, such as when \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984); <em>Hammer v. State, </em>2008 MT 342, \u00b6 12, 346 Mont. 279, 194 P.3d 699. Counsel\u2019s failure must be complete. <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 696-97 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u00b614  The circumstances that allow for a presumption of ineffectiveness are not present here. Watson did more than file one motion to sever, as we noted in <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 8. He also moved to dismiss several charges for lack of probable cause. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 8. Watson also filed various other pretrial motions, and successfully argued for the exclusion of certain evidence before opening statements. There was not a complete failure on Watson\u2019s part to test the prosecution\u2019s case. Further, Riggs has not shown how Watson\u2019s failure to file additional or different motions would have resulted in a different outcome. <em>Heddings, </em>\u00b6 33. Riggs has simply not demonstrated either <em>Strickland </em>prong. We find no ineffectiveness on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">2. Witness Interviews</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u00b615 Here, Riggs argues that Watson\u2019s \u201cfailure to conduct any investigation constitutes neglect and deficient representation.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Watson\u2019s failures, according to Riggs\u2019 position on appeal, are failing to interview numerous witnesses, including CJ Gonder (\u201cGonder\u201d), Riggs\u2019 son Daron Riggs (\u201cDaron\u201d), and Jason Sullivan (\u201cSullivan\u201d). Riggs claims that Gonder\u2019s and Daron\u2019s testimony would exonerate him. Riggs also claims Sullivan\u2019s testimony would be \u201cexculpatory and would have told the jury that [S.M.], at least, lied about sex.\u201d Riggs alleges Watson \u201cdidn\u2019t interview anybody\u201d and that failure destroyed Riggs\u2019 life.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b616 Watson had a duty \u2018to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Weaver v. State, </em>2005 MT 158, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 441, 114 P.3d 1039 (citing <em>State v. Thomas, </em>285 Mont. 112, 119, 946 P.2d 140, 144). We assess a decision not to investigate for reasonableness in light of all the circumstances of the case, \u201capplying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 17. Counsel\u2019s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691; <em>Thomas, </em>285 Mont. at 117-18, 946 P.2d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b617 To say that Watson failed \u201cto conduct any investigation\u201d is an overstatement. Watson testified that \u201cwe interviewed everybody who could reasonably have any information about this case.\u201d He further testified that he determined who may have information based upon \u2018interviewing everybody who Rob [Riggs] and LaRae [Riggs\u2019 then-wife (\u201cLaRae\u201d)] suggested we interview as well as my determination.\u201d Notably, according to Watson, neither Riggs nor LaRae mentioned that Gonder or Daron would have useful information.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b618 Watson\u2019s private investigator, Linda Sanem (\u201cSanem\u201d), conducted most of the witness interviews. Watson explained that he did this so his investigator could be called to impeach a witness if the witness\u2019s story changed. The record reveals that Sanem conducted many interviews, including Detective Hanson (the primary investigator), M.J., S.M., D.C., D.M., Riggs, LaRae, and Sullivan, as well as others. Sanem testified that, based on the information she gleaned, she never felt it necessary to interview Gonder or Daron. Sanem was in regular contact with Watson about the interviews and investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b619 Assuming that Watson did not meet his duty to investigate, Riggs must still show a reasonable probability that, had Watson interviewed the witnesses, the outcome would have been different - that is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>information obtained from these witnesses would have produced a different result. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 21. Riggs has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b620 We agree with the District Court that Gonder\u2019s testimony was less than convincing. His hearing testimony conflicts with Riggs\u2019 and LaRae\u2019s trial testimony, which never mentioned Gonder's presence at their home on September 25, 1999 (the night D.M. was assaulted) or November 3, 2000 (the night S.M. was assaulted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His hearing testimony also somewhat conflicts with his own affidavit. Ultimately, Gonder could not be sure of the dates he was at the Riggs\u2019 home or who was present. Gonder\u2019s testimony is far from \u201cexculpatory\u201das Riggs has alleged. Riggs has not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if Watson had interviewed Gonder.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b621 Daron\u2019s testimony suffers the same problems as Gonder\u2019s. His testimony about who was present in Riggs\u2019 home conflicts with undisputed trial testimony about who was or was not present in the home on September 25,1999, and November 3,2000. Additionally, the affidavit he submitted was not prepared by him, but by an investigator for Riggs. We agree with the District Court that Daron demonstrated little independent, reliable recall about the events of September 25, 1999, and November 3, 2000. Riggs has not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if Watson had interviewed Daron.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b622 Regarding Sullivan, this claim was dismissed on the pleadings by the District Court. Riggs attempts to make an argument here about Watson\u2019s failure to call Sullivan as a witness, not failure to interview. Sanem did, in fact, interview Sullivan. Sullivan met Riggs in the Gallatin County jail, then came forward with a story about S.M. and D.C. being \u201cvery sexual and aggressive\u201d at a party. It is not at all clear that Sullivan\u2019s story was admissible, especially given \u00a745-5-511, MCA (Montana\u2019s rape shield statute), and Riggs has cited no Montana authority to support its admissibility. Riggs has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, had Watson called Sullivan as a witness, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b623 Riggs has made no argument on appeal regarding any other specific witnesses that should have been interviewed, and we will not make his arguments for him. <em>In re B.P., </em>\u00b6 41. Riggs has not met his burden under <em>Strickland', </em>therefore his ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>claims for failure to interview witnesses fail. We find no ineffectiveness on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">3. Amendment of the Information</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b624 The Information charged Riggs with sexual assault against M. J. \u201ccommitted within the month of March, 2001[.]\u201dThe State sought to amend the Information to change the date from March 2001 to November 2000. The motion stated \u2018The amended charge is supported by the original affidavit of probable cause. Defense counsel [Watson] has been advised of the instant motion and has no objection.\u201d The State filed its motion to amend on March 1, 2002. Trial began on March 4, 2002. Before voir dire, the State addressed the pending motion. The District Court sought Watson\u2019s position on the motion. Watson stated \u20181 don\u2019t have any objection. I think they\u2019re entitled to amend the Information on, you know, a technicality up to the time of trial. I have no objection.\u201d The District Court granted the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b625 Riggs argues that the amendment was not merely to form, but to substance, and as such was prohibited by \u00a746-11-205(1), MCA, which bars the State from substantively amending an Information within 5 days of trial. The District Court determined this claim was record based, and therefore could not be raised in a petition for postconviction relief, but rather must have been raised on direct appeal. Since Riggs did not raise the issue on direct appeal in <em>Riggs, </em>the District Court dismissed the claim as procedurally barred. Riggs argues it was error for the District Court to dismiss the claim without a hearing because the record did not reveal why Watson did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b626 An amendment is one of form where the same crime is charged, the elements of the crime and the proof required remain the same, and the defendant is informed of the charge against him. <em>State v. Spotted Eagle, </em>2010 MT 222, \u00b6 10, 358 Mont. 22, 243 P.3d 402. Unless the time of an event is a \u201cmaterial ingredient in the offense,\u201d timing is not required to be stated with \u201cimpossible precision.\u201d <em>State v. Shaver, </em>233 Mont. 438, 445-46, 760 P.2d 1230, 1234-35 (1988). Especially in cases of child abuse, this court has not required the information to precisely state the time of an offense. <em>Shaver, </em>233 Mont. at 445-46, 760 P.2d at 1234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b627 Under the particular facts of this case, the amendment was to form only, and as such, it was not ineffective for Watson to fail to object. All of the elements of the sexual assault charge remained the same, the proof required was the same, and Riggs was informed of the charge. The affidavit of probable cause discusses two incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>regarding M.J.-ene occurring in November 2000 and one occurring during \u201cspring break.\u201d Riggs had notice, from the time he was originally charged, that the State was alleging that he sexually assaulted M. J. in November 2000. Although the claim was dismissed as procedurally barred before the hearing, Riggs did question Watson at the hearing about why he did not object to the amendment. Watson stated T think as I recall, I knew all along that this was one incident in November and that this was just a typo.\u201d Further, the only testimony the State elicited from M. J. at trial was about the incident in November 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b628 Based upon all the information in the record, we find that Riggs has not met his burden under <em>Strickland </em>to show that both Watson\u2019s failure to object fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that if Watson had objected, there exists a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different. We find no ineffectiveness on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">4. Witness preparation</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b629 Riggs argues that Watson failed to prepare him and LaRae to testify at the trial. He argues \u2018Watson didn\u2019t do anything right.\u201d The crux of the argument appears to be that Watson was ineffective in preparing the witnesses because the prosecutor asked Riggs \u2018If this jury is to believe your testimony today, they must conclude that\u201d the girls have got to be \u201cmistaken or lying?\u201d Boggs, Riggs\u2019 expert, testified that \u2018if you\u2019ve set up your client to testify and that\u2019s going to be the last question he\u2019s asked, he shouldn\u2019t be there, and you haven\u2019t done anything right. You can\u2019t have that question asked[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b630 The State argues that Riggs is essentially blaming Watson for allowing him to testify, instead of getting Riggs a plea agreement. Further, the State argues that no amount of preparation could overcome the truth, and that Riggs has failed to show how any additional preparation would have changed the outcome of the trial. \u00b631 Regarding Watson\u2019s alleged failure to prepare LaRae to testify, we conclude Riggs' claim has no merit. LaRae testified at the hearing that Watson spent time with her and she \u2018felt prepared. I felt like we had-we, I guess at that time, had an awesome defense.\u201d Riggs himself testified Tm not going to say she didn\u2019t do a-have a good testimony at my trial.\u201d LaRae also testified that she and Riggs were using drugs and alcohol frequently in the months leading up to trial, and would fall out of contact with Watson. She testified \u2018I think [Watson] was providing the best assistance he could. I\u2019m not sure there was a whole lot of cooperation ... [flrom Rob, from me, from really anyone.\u201d Riggs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>has not shown that a reasonable probability exists that, had Watson spent more time preparing LaRae, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b632 Regarding Watson\u2019s alleged failure to prepare Riggs, Watson testified that he spent \u201cat least a dozen\u201d hours preparing Riggs. Riggs testified during his four or five in-person meetings with Watson \u2018there was never any preparation for my trial.\u201d Significantly, Riggs never testified to what he felt Watson should have done to prepare him for his trial testimony. Nor has he argued on appeal what Watson should have done, or how further preparation would have resulted in a different outcome at trial. Riggs simply states Tt]he trial transcript bears witness to Watson\u2019s failure to prepare Riggs and his wife to testify.\u201d Based upon both the record and the testimony from the hearing, it is unclear how any additional preparation by Watson could have resulted in either Riggs not testifying, or the prosecution not asking that particular question. Success is not the test of efficient counsel. <em>State v. Martz, </em>233 Mont. 136, 140, 760 P.2d 65, 68 (1988). That Boggs would have prepared Riggs differently does not make Watson ineffective. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b633 Riggs has not met his burden under <em>Strickland. </em>He has not shown that, had Watson spent more time preparing him to testify, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\"><em>5. </em>State\u2019s rebuttal expert</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b634 Riggs appears to argue both that Watson was ineffective for failing to object to the \u2018late\u201d disclosure of the State\u2019s rebuttal expert, Dr. Bellante, and for failing to object because her expert report was not disclosed. For these propositions, he cites \u00a746-15-322(6), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">The prosecutor shall furnish to the defendant no later than 5 days before trial or at a later time as the court may for good cause permit, together with their statements, a list of the names and addresses of all persons whom the prosecutor intends to call as rebuttal witnesses to evidence of good character or the defenses of alibi, compulsion, entrapment, justifiable use of force, or mistaken identity or the defense that the defendant did not have a particular state of mind that is an element of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u00b635 This section applies only to rebuttal witnesses called for the specific purposes listed in the statute. <em>See State v. Sage, </em>221 Mont. 192, 196, 717 P.2d 1096, 1098 (1986) (the duty to disclose rebuttal witnesses does not arise until the defendant has given notice of affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>defenses). Dr. Bellante was called to rebut Riggs\u2019 expert testimony regarding investigative techniques employed by the officers who interviewed the four girls. Section 46-15-322(6), MCA, does not apply to Dr. Bellante\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b636 Further, even if it did apply, the notice was filed more than five days before the trial, and was not late. Watson testified that he did not object because \u20181 had actual notice well prior\u201d to the formal notice. Watson did not move for Dr. Bellante\u2019s expert report under \u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because he \u201cpreviously determined that there were no notes or records.\u201d There is no evidence in the record that any report, or statement, was prepared by Dr. Bellante.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b637 Based upon these facts, we agree with the District Court that Riggs failed to show that Watson\u2019s decision not to object for either \u2018late\u201d disclosure or failure to file an expert report<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was objectively unreasonable. We also agree that Riggs has not shown that had Watson objected, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>Heddings, </em>\u00b6 33. We find no ineffectiveness on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">B. Trial Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">1. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b638 Riggs argues that Watson\u2019s failure to strike juror Donahue, who served on the jury, from the panel was \u201ca very serious professional mistake that probably affected the fact finding body.\u201d He also argues that Watson did not delve further into juror Klein\u2019s relationship with M. J.\u2019s family, and used a preemptory challenge instead of challenging Klein for cause. Riggs argues these juror errors were structural, thus prejudice must be presumed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b639 The State argues Watson fulfilled his duty to ensure Riggs\u2019 right to a fair trial by a panel of impartial jurors. Specifically, the State argues that juror Donahue did not express any bias against Riggs, and his responses during voir dire did not require Watson to remove him from the jury panel. Regarding juror Klein, the State argues Riggs has not shown any prejudice because Klein did not serve on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u00b640 The purpose of voir dire in a criminal case is to determine the existence of a prospective juror\u2019s partiality, that is, his or her bias and prejudice. <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738. The right to a trial by an impartial jury is principally secured through the voir dire and challenge process; therefore, defense counsel must develop information in the record that demonstrates a juror\u2019s bias as to a party or issue in the case. <em>State v. Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 115, 112 P.3d 1005. Adequate voir dire enables counsel to properly raise challenges for cause. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 15. Adequate voir dire also enables counsel to intelligently exercise preemptory challenges, which are essentially a matter of trial strategy. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b641  Disqualification based on a juror\u2019s prejudice is necessary only when a juror forms a fixed opinion on the guilt or innocence of the defendant which he or she would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 154, 43 P.3d 968.).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b642 Jury selection is \u201ccritically important\u201din assuring the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial and impartial jury. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 24. Errors in the jury selection process are structural errors. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 24. Structural errors undermine the fairness of the entire proceeding and are presumptively prejudicial. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"AYU\">i. Juror Klein</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b643 Riggs\u2019 claim regarding Watson\u2019s questioning of Klein was dismissed by the District Court as record-based, and thus it should have been raised on appeal. We agree with the ultimate conclusion, although for a different reason - Riggs has not shown Watson\u2019s performance was deficient. Watson questioned Klein about his knowledge of M.J.\u2019s family. Klein said T know Rick [M.J.\u2019s father].\u201d Watson asked Klein if he would \u2018be hampered by your concerns about what might occur or what you might have to deal with in the event you return a not guilty verdict based on your personal relationship with [M.J.] and her family.\u201d Klein responded \u201cI have no personal relationship with her. I\u2019m not sure I have ever met the child.\u201d Klein also said \u20181 think there would be a lot of agony, but hopefully, we\u2019ll have the instructions necessary as a jury to weigh the evidence on the basis of how it\u2019s presented in fairness associated with it. I think I could personally set aside any feelings towards that ....\u2019\u2019Finally, Klein said he could find Riggs not guilty if the State did not prove its case, even if he personally suspected Riggs was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b644 Watson testified that, based on the entirety of the exchanges with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Klein, he felt that Klein ultimately said he could set aside any potential for bias and be a fair juror despite knowing M.J.\u2019s father. Therefore, Watson felt he had no basis to challenge Klein for cause. Klein, however, did not serve on the jury; he was removed with a preemptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b645 After reviewing all of Klein\u2019s answers during voir dire, and the evidence presented at the hearing on Riggs\u2019 Petition, we cannot say that Watson\u2019s questioning of Klein fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Watson\u2019s questioning of Klein revealed that Klein could set aside any personal feelings, weigh the evidence presented, and acquit Riggs if the State did not prove its case. Watson was not ineffective in his questioning of Klein,</p>\n<p id=\"AHi\">ii. Juror Donahue</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b646 Riggs argues juror Donahue should not have served on the jury because of four specific answers he gave during voir dire. In response to one of the witnesses having a learning disability, Donahue said T ve had a learning disability all my life and I know what she\u2019s going through and what it can do to her.\u201d He also said, with that in mind, he would be able to weigh her (the witness\u2019s) credibility \u201caccurately.\u201d Second, the prosecutor asked whether anyone had \u201ca particularly strong feeling4s anybody a teetotaler? Yes, Mr. Donahue, you don\u2019t drink at all?\u201d Donahue said \u2018No, I had to quit six years ago.\u201d Donahue also said \u201calcohol will do strange things to people.\u201d When asked if he \u201ccould listen to the facts and reach an impartial decision without letting the alcohol evidence weigh too heavily\u201d in his mind, Donahue responded \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know; that\u2019s the question right there. I\u2019d have to hear all the facts.\u201dThird, Donahue said he felt the defendant should testify, despite the defendant\u2019s right to not testify. Finally, in response to a question about how to cross-examine child victims, Donahue said children should not be cross-examined Tike an adult would be.\u201d Donahue said that he could be impartial in a case like Riggs\u2019 (involving child sexual abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b647 The State argues that Watson\u2019s decision to keep Donahue on the jury panel was reasonable, given Watson\u2019s explanation. Watson testified that he didn\u2019t find anything about Donahue\u2019s answers that would indicate partiality or bias. Watson felt Donahue\u2019s statement regarding having a learning disability was not \u201cparticularly noteworthy,\u201d nor did he feel it would create any sympathy with the witness. Watson testified that Donahue\u2019s statements about alcohol raised no alarm because Watson never thought alcohol was an issue in the case in any significant sense-hobody testified he [Riggs] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>intoxicated.\u201d Also, Watson said he would be suspicious of a juror that did not think alcohol would do strange things to a person. Watson felt that was a commonly held belief. Watson was also not troubled about Donahue\u2019s feeling that the defendant should testify because Riggs intended to testify, and Watson felt \u201cthis guy would be reassured and be more likely to believe him [Riggs].\u201d Finally, regarding Donahue\u2019s feelings on cross-examining the victims, Watson felt that Donahue\u2019s response did not indicate bias or impartiality because Watson also felt fyou have to be careful about how you cross-examine child victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AA0\">\u00b648 The District Court found that Watson\u2019s failure to use a preemptory challenge on Donahue was objectively reasonable and was not ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b649 We agree with the District Court. After reviewing all of Donahue\u2019s answers during voir dire, and the evidence presented at the hearing on Riggs\u2019 Petition, we cannot say that Watson\u2019s handling of Donahue fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Even Boggs agreed that a reasonable attorney could form different opinions about Donahue\u2019s statements regarding alcohol and Donahue\u2019s desire for the defendant to testify. Donahue\u2019s responses, in their totality, do not reveal any prejudice or bias against Riggs. It is reasonable that Watson made a strategic decision to keep Donahue on the jury in light of the case Watson was going to present. Watson was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">2. Witnesses\u2019 Prior Consistent Statements</p>\n<p id=\"AaL\">\u00b650 Riggs argues that the stories of the four girls, \u2018the State\u2019s only evidence against Riggs, were swaddled in the credibility of adults and presented once, twice and three times to the jury through social workers, law enforcement officers, and the girls\u2019 mothers.\u201d Riggs argues several witnesses offered prior consistent statements, which were inadmissible at trial because there was no allegation of subsequent fabrication, improper influence, or motive. Riggs argues Watson\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the statements was ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b651 The State argues that many of the witnesses cited by Riggs did not actually testify to prior consistent statements by the girls. Further, the State argues it was part of Riggs\u2019 defense strategy to show the inconsistencies in the multiple statements made by the girls to detract from their credibility. Therefore, Watson did not object to the admission of the girls\u2019 multiple statements for strategic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b652 The District Court found that Boggs\u2019 testimony at the hearing showed that the alleged prior consistent statements were not hearsay, were successfully objected to, or were inconsistent with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>statements made by the girls. While Boggs may have taken a different strategic approach to the case, and the statements specifically, the District Court found that Watson\u2019s approach was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b653 We agree with the District Court. Counsel\u2019s use of objections lies within his or her discretion. <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 63, 106 P.3d 1175. Objections may, or may not, be made for any number of reasons. <em>See State v. Olsen, </em>2004 MT 158, \u00b6 17, 322 Mont. 1, 92 P.3d 1204. Here, no objection was made because Watson wanted to point out the numerous inconsistencies in the girls\u2019 statements. Watson testified that he wanted to use the girls\u2019 various statements at trial to \u00a3impeach[] these girls to death with what [Riggs] is now calling consistent statements which don\u2019t strike me as being consistent at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">\u00b654 Boggs\u2019 testimony was, essentially, that if all you have is inconsistent victim statements, you \u201cquite likely\u201dshould not be at trial in the first place. In other words, he did not agree with Watson\u2019s strategy. Differing strategies cannot be the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689 (\u2018There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d). We conclude that Watson\u2019s trial strategy was objectively reasonable. Riggs has not met the first <em>Strickland </em>prong; thus, his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">3. Riggs\u2019 Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b655 Finally, Riggs argues that Watson was ineffective for failing to object or move to exclude several of Riggs\u2019 own statements made to law enforcement during the 1999 investigation regarding D.M.\u2019s allegations. Riggs\u2019 specific statements were: that he had been molested as a child, that he had more to do than \u201ctalk about some shit that some lying little kid was talking ... about him[,]\u201d and \u201cwhy would I do that to somebody else if I could do it to my own kids\u201d but that he would not do that. Riggs argues these statements were inadmissible 1) because they were bad character evidence under <em>State v. Gommenginger, </em>242 Mont. 265, 270-71, 790 P.2d 455, 459 (1990), and 2) by operation of \u00a7 41-3-202(5)(b), MCA. The State argues that the statements were not bad character evidence and that \u00a7 41-3-202(5)(b), MCA, has no application in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b656 The District Court found that Riggs\u2019 statements were admissible under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) as the admissions of a party opponent. The District Court also declined to address Riggs\u2019 argument regarding \u00a741-3-202(5)(b), MCA, finding it was raised on appeal and considered by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>i. Bad Character Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b657 We do not agree that Riggs\u2019 statements were bad character evidence under <em>Gommenginger. Gommenginger </em>dealt with the testimony of one police officer, who testified that he learned from confidential informants and other officers that the defendant was a drug dealer. We concluded his testimony amounted to \u2018hearsay\u201d and contained \u201celements of both opinion and reputation evidence\u201d and its admission constituted reversible error. <em>Gommenginger </em>did not deal with statements made by the defendant himself, and has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b658 Riggs\u2019 statements were admissible under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) which provides that a statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party and is the party\u2019s own statement. <em>State v. Smith, </em>276 Mont. 434, 441, 916 P.2d 773, 777 (1996). Just as in <em>Smith, </em>the statements were made by the defendant in a criminal case (Riggs), offered against him by the prosecution, through the testimony of the person to whom the statements were made. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 441, 916 P.2d at 777. The statements were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b659 Watson was not ineffective for failing to object to the admission of these statements under <em>Gommenginger. Heddings, </em>\u00b6 33. The statements were admissible and did not constitute bad character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">ii. Section 41-3-202(5)(b), MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b660 While we did not consider on direct appeal the issue of the applicability of \u00a741-3-202(5)(b), MCA, we agree with the result the District Court reached. Section 41-3-202(5)(b), MCA, deals with the Department of Public Health and Human Services\u2019 (DPHHS) handling and retention of reports of child abuse or neglect. Riggs\u2019 statements were made in connection with a DPHHS investigation in 1999, which was closed as \u201cunfounded\u201d by Detective Hanson. Riggs argues that \u00a7 41-3-202(5)(b), MCA, required the destruction of the reports from that investigation well before his trial in 2002 - \u201cwithin 30 days of the determination that the child has not suffered abuse or neglect.\u201d Section 41-3-202(5)(b), MCA. The State argues that while Detective Hanson used the word \u201cunfounded\u201d he was not using it in the technical sense required under the child abuse and neglect statutes, thus the correct destruction period is found in \u00a741-3-202(5)(c)(i), MCA, which governs unsubstantiated reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u00b661 After a review of the report and the hearing testimony, we agree with the State. \u201cUnfounded\u201d means \u201cafter an investigation, the investigating person has determined that the reported abuse, neglect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>or exploitation has not occurred.\u201d Section 41-3-102(31), MCA. \u2018Unsubstantiated\u201d means \u201cafter an investigation, the investigator was unable to determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the reported abuse, neglect, or exploitation has occurred.\u201d Section 41-3-102(32), MCA. Detective Hanson\u2019s report does not say that the abuse did not occur, rather it says Ta]s no corroborating evidence exists, recommend the case be closed as unfounded.\u201d Indeed, the report\u2019s substance indicates more than an \u201cunfounded\u201d report. Further, Gayle Frandsen, a DPHHS employee, testified at the hearing that her records indicated the 1999 D.M. investigation was closed as \u201cunsubstantiated, no charges being filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b662 The report was classified by DPHHS as unsubstantiated, and therefore \u00a741-3-202(5)(c)(i), MCA, applies. That section provides that unsubstantiated reports are destroyed \u201cwithin 30 days after the end of the 3-year period starting from the date the report was determined to be unsubstantiated.\u201d Section 41-3-202(5)(c)(i), MCA. Under this statute, the destruction date of the report would have been <em>after </em>Riggs\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b663 We find no ineffectiveness on Watson\u2019s part for failing to attempt to exclude Riggs\u2019 statements under \u00a741-3-202(5)(b), MCA. It does not apply to the 1999 report. <em>Heddings, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b664  For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Riggs\u2019 Petition. Because we find no ineffective assistance of counsel on Riggs\u2019 individual claims, there can be no cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b665 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b180-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> Riggs mentions Daron had a \u201cfriend\u201d over on November 3, 1999.
