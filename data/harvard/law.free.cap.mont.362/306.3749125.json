The sole issue on appeal is whether the court unlawfully sentenced Simmons in violation of her due process rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">\u00b62 The State arrested and charged Simmons with distribution of drugs. Simmons lawfully held a medical marijuana caregiver card but was accused of distributing marijuana to people without medical marijuana user cards. Simmons was released after posting bond. While on release, Simmons confronted and intimidated a confidential informant linked to her drug arrest. Based on this incident, the District Court revoked her bail and permitted the State to amend the Information to include a new charge of felony witness tampering. The District Court ordered that Simmons be transported to the Montana State Hospital (MSH) for purposes of a mental evaluation to determine her fitness to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">\u00b63 Following her evaluation at MSH, Drs. John Van Hassel and Virginia Hill issued a report determining Simmons did not suffer from a mental disease or defect, or from a developmental disability, and she was capable of understanding the proceedings against her and assisting in her defense. However, Drs. Van Hassel and Hill did diagnose Simmons with cannabis dependence and opioid abuse, compounded by \u2018Personality Disorder [Not Otherwise Specified] (Mixed Personality Disorder with Antisocial, Narcissistic, Borderline and Histrionic Features).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">\u00b64 Simmons was returned to the custody of the Ravalli County Detention Center (RCDC) for approximately three months and was then released to house arrest. During this time, the State filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>insurance fraud charge against Simmons for fraudulently billing time as a massage therapist. Simmons was arrested again when she made additional threats against a different individual she believed was an informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b65 Simmons pleaded guilty to one count of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs for providing medical marijuana to someone without a user card, one count of distribution for providing oxycodone pills, and one count of theft by insurance fraud. She pleaded no contest to one count of tampering with a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b66 During the sentencing hearing, Lieutenant Scott Leete, a commander of the RCDC, testified that Simmons is \u201cprobably one of the most problematic inmates that I\u2019ve experienced,\u201d because she \u201cchallenge[d] standard operating procedures, demanded a lot of attention, special conditions regarding diet, visitation, concessions for ... a specialist to come in to see her, issues with visitation, medical issues, property issues, commissary issues.\u201d On cross-examination, following defense counsel\u2019s questions concerning treatment for Simmons\u2019s medical and mental health issues at the jail, the court sustained objections to questions suggesting inadequate mental health services at RCDC. Defense counsel explained that services available at RCDC were relevant to Simmons\u2019s behavior and issues concerning rehabilitation and appropriate placement. In response, the court stated \u201cI think we have already been way too far down this road. I\u2019m not going to grade her based on her deportment in the jail. I care about the crimes she committed.\u201d Simmons called two witnesses; both provided testimony which sought to explain Simmons\u2019s behavior while incarcerated at RCDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b67 Following the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court sentenced Simmons to twenty years in prison with ten years suspended. In addition to the testimony at the sentencing hearing, the court considered the pre-sentence investigation, the MSH evaluation, and a mental health evaluation conducted on Simmons\u2019s behalf by licensed clinical social worker Paul Sells. Based on the evaluations, the court found Simmons would be unlikely to respond quickly, if at all, to correctional or rehabilitative treatment and would be likely to commit other crimes if given the opportunity. The court noted Sells\u2019s conclusion that Simmons\u2019s personality disorder would be exceedingly difficult to treat and stated, \u2018there is no conventional treatment for a serious personality disorder of this type.\u201d The court observed, \u2018the Defendant\u2019s personality disorder has manifested itself through negative behavior in the detention center and intimidation of an individual [Simmons suspected was a confidential informant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b68 On appeal, Simmons argues the District Court violated her right to due process by considering evidence from the sentencing hearing it stated it was not going to consider, namely her behavior while at RCDC. She argues the court limited her opportunity to explain or rebut the evidence by cutting short her cross-examination, yet considered it in passing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b69 \u2018We review criminal sentences that include at least one year of actual incarceration for legality only.\u201d <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 59, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102. When the issue on appeal is whether the district court violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at sentencing, \u2018the question is a matter of law which we review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 19, 319 Mont. 117, 82 P.3d 903 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court unlawfully sentenced Simmons in violation of her due process rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b611  When imposing a sentence, the court may consider any relevant evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s character, history and mental condition, and any evidence the court deems has \u201cprobative force.\u201d <em>State v. Collier, </em>277 Mont. 46, 63, 919 P.2d 376,387 (1996). The right to due process includes the right of a defendant to explain, argue and rebut any information which may lead to a deprivation of life or liberty. <em>State v. Roedel, </em>2007 MT 291, \u00b6 65, 339 Mont. 489, 171 P.3d 694. A defendant also has a due process guarantee against a sentence predicated on misinformation. <em>Kills On Top v. State, </em>2000 MT 340, \u00b6 67, 303 Mont. 164, 15 P.3d 422 (citing <em>Bauer v. State, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 306, 983 P.2d 955). Despite this guarantee, the due process clause does not protect against all misinformation at sentencing. Instead, the inquiry turns on whether the court premised the sentence on materially false information. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b612  Based on a review of the record, we conclude Simmons\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the District Court referenced her \u201cnegative behavior\u201d while at RCDC. The court\u2019s lengthy discussion of the reasons for its sentence indicate it relied on the considerable evidence before it regarding the nature of Simmons\u2019s crimes, her amenability to treatment, and the likelihood of re-offense if she were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>not incarcerated. In addition to discussing Simmons\u2019s character and personality disorder, the court noted the seriousness of the offenses, finding \u2018there is also a public safety concern due to the fact that the Defendant was essentially a small time drug dealer.\u201d Further, even though Simmons had no prior convictions, the court found the charges against her were \u201call part of a continuing course of an ongoing criminal enterprise.\u201d In sum, the District Court considered numerous pieces of evidence pertaining to Simmons\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and the severity of the crimes she committed. Simmons has not met her burden on appeal of showing the sentencing court relied on materially false allegations in forming the sentence. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201ca defendant is under an \u2018affirmative duty to show the alleged misinformation is materially inaccurate or prejudicial before a sentence will be overturned by this Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b613  Finally, Simmons\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the District Court exercised its discretion to cut short the cross examination. A convicted defendant does not have an unfettered right to cross-examine witnesses during a sentencing hearing. \u201c[T]he right of cross-examination at a presentence hearing is a discretionary matter of the trial court and will not be overruled without a showing of abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Trangsrud, </em>200 Mont. 303,307-08,651 P.2d 37, 39-40 (1982) (citing <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 1083 (1949)). The \u2018latitude of cross-examination is in the discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not interfere unless it is manifest that the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Atlas, </em>224 Mont. 92, 101, 728 P.2d 421, 427 (1986). The courts are thus endowed with flexibility in structuring cross-examination during a sentencing hearing so long as the procedures sufficiently protect a defendant\u2019s rights. Here, the court imposed the sentence after Simmons had the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses against her and to call witnesses on her own behalf to rebut the State\u2019s evidence and offer alternative explanations for Simmons\u2019s behavior. Such safeguards were sufficient to protect her due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b614 Based on the controlling authority cited above, the record demonstrates the District Court\u2019s sentence was lawful and did not violate Simmons\u2019s due process rights. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
