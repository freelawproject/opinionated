Fasch filed a negligence action in the Sixteenth Judicial District, Rosebud County, against the Montana Department of Transportation (DOT), M.K. Weeden (Weeden), the construction contractor, and Weeden\u2019s subcontractor, United Rental Technologies, Inc. (United), which was in charge of signage in the construction area. The District Court entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and an order granting summary judgment in favor of DOT, Weeden, and United (collectively Defendants), from which Fasch appeals. We reverse and remand for further proceedings. We consider:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u00b63 On Saturday, October 2,2004, Fasch drove his three-wheeled ATV from his home to the home of his friend, Jason Hirsch (Hirsch), to deliver some fresh produce. In order to travel to and from Hirsch\u2019s house, Fasch drove over U.S. Highway 59, which was then under construction. On his return trip from Hirsch\u2019s house, Fasch was involved in a one-vehicle accident within the construction zone. Fasch\u2019s ATV rolled several times, and he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u00b64 Vehicles traveling through the construction zone were routed over the \u201cold highway,\u201d which was paved and abutted the \u2018hew highway\u201d being constructed by Weeden. At the time of the accident, the new highway consisted of packed fill dirt and was not yet paved. The elevation of the new highway was 2 feet higher than the old highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">\u00b65 The parties offered differing versions of what occurred in the accident. Fasch asserts he was driving his ATV on the old highway where vehicles traversing the construction zone were routed. He claims he was \u2018hugging\u201d the right-hand side of the road, where the elevation differential would have been, when one of his wheels struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>or fell into a culvert hole he claims extended onto the old highway. In his deposition, Fasch stated, \u201c... I was just driving up right along this edge right here, and that\u2019s when I hit the hole.\u201d When asked how far into the pavement the hole extended, Fasch replied, \u2018It wasn\u2019t even a foot, I don\u2019t think. I was right up against, riding on the edge of this, so it didn\u2019t take much for it to slip into the hole.\u201d Fasch testified that this caused his ATV to roll several times and come to rest on the fill dirt of the new highway, right side up and still running.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b66 The Defendants assert Fasch was not driving on the old highway but was in the area of the elevated fill dirt of the new highway where vehicles were not allowed. Counsel for United argued at the summary judgment hearing that \u2018from the record that was existing in terms of the signage and the location of the three-wheeler tracks, Mr. Fasch was traveling off the traveled way.\u201d The Defendants contend that as Fasch was driving on the fill dirt of the new highway, he came upon the culvert hole, crashed into it, and rolled. The Defendants claim the culvert hole was almost two feet away from the edge of the old highway, and Fasch could not have hit the hole while driving on the pavement. At the summary judgment hearing, the attorney for Weeden and DOT stated that measurements demonstrated the hole was two feet away from the pavement. The parties do not dispute that the ATV came to a stop on all three wheels on the fill dirt of the new highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b67 Fasch was knocked unconscious for some period of time and upon regaining consciousness, crawled to his ATV, reversed directions, and drove back to Hirsch\u2019s house. Hirsch realized Fasch was in need of immediate medical attention and decided to take him to the hospital in Miles City. Because Fasch was having difficulty breathing, Hirsch stopped at the crash site on the way to the hospital to retrieve Fasch\u2019s inhaler, which had been lost during the accident. Fasch was later taken to Billings for treatment of a punctured lung, broken rib, and other injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b68 After taking Fasch to the hospital, Hirsch returned to the crash site to gather Fasch\u2019s belongings that were strewn about. He saw one set of three-wheeler tracks in the fill dirt, which he first assumed had been left by Fasch when approaching the culvert hole. About this initial conclusion, Hirsch later explained in an affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">At the time, I did not take into consideration the three-wheeler tire marks [Fasch] had to have made when he got back onto his three-wheeler and drove back south to my place to get help. Because I saw a set of tracks on the south side, I assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>meant that he was approaching the hole from fill. Because I made that assumption right off, I didn\u2019t stop to look to see if there were any marks at the edge of the pavement where it tips toward the hole, where he could have caught an edge and gone in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">Hirsch also saw indications that the three-wheeler had rolled several times, and the handle bars or baskets affixed to the ATV had gouged into the fill dirt. Hirsch gathered items that were strewn about the site and returned to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b69 While the record contains some ambiguity on the question, it appears Hirsch did not see any signage, cones, or warnings around the culvert hole itself, though he did see signs informing the traveling public of a detour. In his deposition, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">Q. Were there any signs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Q. Any cones?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">A. No, and I - Q. Any flags?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">Q. Any kind of warning at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">A. Not on the hole that he hit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">Hirsch indicated there were detour signs on the road some distance before the culvert hole that directed traffic onto the old highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">\u00b610 Two days after the accident, on Monday, October 4, 2004, DOT Project Manager Jay Fleming and two other DOT employees conducted an inspection of the accident scene. One of the DOT employees summoned Hirsch, who pointed out to the DOT employees that signs, which were then near the culvert hole, had not been there two days earlier when the wreck occurred. In his deposition, Hirsch testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8K\">Q. So the site was basically unchanged from the time of the accident until Monday, when you went there with the State folks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">A. No, it was not unchanged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">Q. What was changed from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">A. And I stated this to the State guys. There were cones set up on the highway right where the hole was, and there was [sic] flags stuck in the ground warning of the site, you know, orange flags and stuff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">Fleming claims the signs, which were near the culvert during the inspection on Monday, were also there the previous Friday, the day before the accident. Fleming stated, <em>\u201cl </em>know what they looked like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Friday when I left, and I know what they looked like Monday when I got back.\u201d At his deposition, Fleming was asked: \u201cAnd would it be a fair statement that according to my understanding of the diagram, that these vertical panels would have been just off the paved way and between the paved way and where this culvert started, am I correct on that?\u201d \u2018Yes,\u201d Fleming replied. Because the signs were the same on Monday as they were the preceding Friday, Fleming believes they were there on Saturday when the wreck occurred. Both Fleming and Hirsch made diagrams of the accident scene, with Hirsch\u2019s lacking signs and with Fleming\u2019s containing signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b611 Fleming unsuccessfully attempted to take photographs of the scene. When asked by Fasch\u2019s counsel about the fate of the photographs, Fleming replied, \u2018tf]or lack of a better term, the camera ate them.\u201dThe parties made no other efforts to memorialize the tracks or demonstrate how they were made by the ATV, and there was no photographic evidence of the culvert hole to demonstrate its proximity to the old highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b612 The parties agree only one set of tracks was made in the fill dirt. However, they disagree about whether the tracks were made while Fasch was approaching or leaving the culvert area. Defendants argue the tracks were made by Fasch when he was approaching the culvert hole on the fill dirt. United\u2019s counsel stated, Tw]e believe that the record establishes very clearly that he was off the traveled way and that that was his intention all along to be driving, basically, in the burrow pit.\u2019\u2019Fasch counters that he made the tracks when driving back to Hirsch\u2019s house for help after overturning onto the fill dirt and that he initially struck the culvert hole while driving on the paved old highway. As noted by Fasch\u2019s counsel at the hearing, \u2018Walter testified that he only drove on the fill dirt after the accident when he returned to Hirsch\u2019s residence after his ATV flipped up onto the dirt from the paved highway.\u201d Fasch offered that two sets of tracks would have been present if he had initially driven his ATV on the fill dirt-ene set leading up the culvert hole and one set leading away.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b613 As discussed in further detail herein, the District Court granted the Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Fasch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b614 We review orders granting summary judgment de novo, using the same criteria and evaluation the district court used pursuant to Rule 56(c), M. R. Civ. P. <em>Schmidt v. Washington Contractors Group, Inc., </em>1998 MT 194, \u00b6 7, 290 Mont. 276, 964 P.2d 34 (citing <em>Wiley v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Glendive, </em>272 Mont. 213, 216, 900 P.2d 310, 312 (1995)). Under Rule 56(c), M. R. Civ. P., summary judgment is proper only when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and admissions on file show no genuine issues of material fact exist and when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b616 Under Rule 56(c), M. R. Civ. P., summary judgment is appropriately granted only when there is an absence of a genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The moving party bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 338, 133 P.3d 165. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to \u201cshow by more than mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, that a genuine issue of material fact exists.\u201d <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 449, 999 P.2d 1010). The Court is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 19. We have observed that summary judgment is an \u201cextreme remedy.\u201d <em>Hajenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 507, 155 P.3d 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b617 \u201c[A]t the summary judgment stage, the court does not make findings of fact, weigh the evidence, choose one disputed fact over another, or assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Andersen v. Schenk, </em>2009 MT 399, \u00b6 2, 353 Mont. 424, 220 P.3d 675. Ordinarily, questions of negligence are \u201cpoorly suited\u201d for adjudication by summary judgment and are better left for determination by a jury at trial. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b618 Here, the parties disputed whether Fasch was driving on the fill dirt or on the old highway when the accident occurred, whether the set of tracks led to or away from the culvert hole, whether the culvert hole abutted the old highway or whether it was two feet away, and whether signage was present in the immediate area of the culvert hole at the time the accident occurred. In its order granting summary judgment, the District Court entered the following Findings of Fact, based on its review of the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">2. At the time of the accident, Fasch was driving his ATV in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the barrow pit approximately eight feet off the edge of the traveled way in an area of packed dirt....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">3. The area where Fasch was driving... was not intended to be used as a path for vehicles ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">5. At the time of the accident, there were three vertical panels just off the paved way and where the culvert started .... In addition, there were two ultra panels, one on both sides of the vertical panels .... These panels delineated the traveled way from the fill area, where Fasch drove his three-wheeler ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">6. Prior to construction, the State ensured that the signage was proper for the project....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">9. If Fasch would have been driving on the asphalt portion of the highway, which had been marked by United Rentals, he would not have come into contact with the hole ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">11. A diagram created by representatives from the State of Montana, after inspection of the accident site, depicts Hirsch\u2019s [sic] ATV tracks in a fill area off the asphalt highway designated for travel....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">12. Although Fasch claims he was driving on the asphalt... the physical evidence at the scene of the accident refutes this claim....</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">In entering its findings and for its reliance on the physical evidence, the District Court cited the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372,127 S. Ct. 1769 (2007). In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant police officer sought summary judgment on plaintiff s claim that the officer had used excessive force during a high speed chase of plaintiff and offered a videotape from the dash camera of a police cruiser. <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 374-76,127 S. Ct. at 1772-73. Plaintiff opposed summary judgment by offering his version of the chase, wherein he claimed he was driving safely and courteously. <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 378-79, 127 S. Ct. at 1775. The Supreme Court reasoned that the videotape \u201cso utterly discredited\u201d the plaintiff s version of the chase \u201cthat no reasonable jury could have believed him.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 380, 127 S. Ct. at 1776. The Supreme Court held, Tw]hen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 380, 127 S. Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\u00b619 The District Court here concluded that, like the video in <em>Scott, </em>the ATV tracks constituted irrefutable physical evidence that Fasch had approached the culvert hole while driving on the fill dirt. (\u2018Fasch\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>testimony, which was refuted by the physical evidence at the scene of the accident, is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.... This case is similar [to Scoii] because the physical evidence of tire marks from the three-wheeler contradicts Fasch\u2019s statements that he was not driving in the fill area.\u201d) The District Court determined that Fasch could not have hit the culvert hole had he been driving on the old highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">\u00b620 However, although tracks made in fill dirt are indeed \u201cphysical evidence,\u201d the Defendants here have not captured and produced this evidence. They did not provide an imprint or photographs with an analysis to demonstrate the direction the ATV was traveling when it made the tracks or provide physical evidence of the proximity of the culvert hole to the old road. Defendants merely produced witness recollection and a diagram depicting a single set of tracks in the fill dirt and the location of the culvert. Fasch produced the same-witness recollection and a diagram-to support his theory that the tracks were made when he drove over the fill dirt to return to Hirsch\u2019s house. Thus, the Defendants\u2019 evidence here does not provide nearly the weight or significance of the videotape in <em>Scott </em>and cannot be said to have \u201cso utterly discredited\u201d Fasch\u2019s testimony that \u2018ho reasonable jury could have believed him.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 380, 127 S. Ct. at 1776. Given the evidence offered by the parties here, Fasch established a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b621 The District Court also weighed the evidence inappropriately when it found that signage was in place to direct travelers away from the culvert hole and toward the old highway. Based upon the weighing of evidence, the District Court concluded Fasch had failed to stay on the old highway in violation of \u00a761-8-328 (1), (3) and \u00a761-8-314, MCA (2003), and as a result, the Defendants owed no duty to Fasch because he was an unforeseeable plaintiff who was not in the zone of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b622  We conclude that \u201creasonable minds could differ\u201d as to the resolution of these material factual issues on this evidence and that they should be resolved by trial. <em>Prindel </em>\u00b6 46. Resolution of the factual issues will also affect the determination of the legal issue of duty. Therefore, we decline to address the duty issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b623  The District Court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. We reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
