The court granted the Dees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and Myers appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u00b62 Myers raises two issues on appeal which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA, requires proof of an existing farm or residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the existence of a farm or residence and the necessity of a road to access that farm or residence are determinations for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">\u00b65 George Vincent inherited a 160-acre parcel of mountainous property near Canyon Creek in Lewis and Clark County (tract B in the diagram below). His three sisters inherited the contiguous 160-acre parcel as tenants in common (tract A in the diagram below). Myers purchased a one-third interest in tract A from one of the sisters, while Vincent purchased the remaining two-thirds interest in tract A from the other two sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">\u00b66 In April 2000, Myers brought a partition action against Vincent regarding tract A. While the partition action was pending, Vincent sold tract B and his two-thirds interest in tract A to the Dees. The Dees were then added as real parties in interest in the partition action. Over the next several years, the District Court issued numerous orders in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the matter, one of which was appealed to this Court. <em>See Myers v. Vincent, </em>2004 MT 176N, 2004 Mont. LEXIS 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b67 Eventually, on January 23, 2008, the District Court entered an order awarding the southernmost one-third of tract A to Myers and the northernmost two-thirds of tract A to the Dees. The court also denied Myers access from the county road (also referred to as Empire Road or Lost Horse Creek Road) to his property. Since the county road runs through tract B, which is owned entirely by the Dees, this access would have required Meyers to travel across 62 feet of the Dees\u2019 tract B property to reach Myers\u2019 portion of tract A. The District Court denied Myers access to his property across tract B because tract B was outside of the parcel of property partitioned. The court also determined that Myers had not established that either an easement by necessity or an implied easement existed across the Dees\u2019 property. This ruling of the court has not been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"pAP-\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b68 Myers filed the present action against the Dees on July 10, 2009. In his Complaint, Myers asked the court to grant him access to his property across the Dees\u2019 tract B property based on the right of eminent domain. Myers\u2019 property contains several dilapidated buildings including a historic cabin in which no one has lived for decades. Myers alleged that the cabin qualifies as a residence, and that pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 70-30-102(36) and -107, MCA, the right of eminent domain may be exercised to create a private road leading from a highway to a residence or farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b69 On May 20,2010, the Dees moved for summary judgment arguing that because the historic cabin is uninhabitable, no residence or farm exists on Myers\u2019 property, and the eminent domain statutes cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>applied. After a hearing on the matter, the District Court determined that Myers was required to make a prima facie showing under \u00a7 70-30-102(36), MCA, as to the current existence of a residence or farm on the property before he was entitled to a jury trial under \u00a770-30-107, MCA, relating to the necessity and value of the property to be taken. Because Myers failed to make such a showing, the court granted the Dees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and awarded the Dees their costs. Myers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion de novo. <em>Lee v. Great Divide Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 80, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 147, 182 P.3d 41 (citing <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Horton, </em>2003 MT 79, \u00b6 10, 315 Mont. 43, 67 P.3d 285). Under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c), summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Moreover, the party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of proving that no genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>See Roy v. Blackfoot Telephone Co-op., </em>2004 MT 316, \u00b6 11, 324 Mont. 30, 101 P.3d 301. The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove by more than mere denial and speculation that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Roy, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b611 <em>Whether \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA, requires proof of an existing farm or residence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b612  Eminent domain is the right to take private property for public use. <em>Richter v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 165, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 379, 962 P.2d 583 (citing \u00a770-30-101, MCA). We noted in <em>Richter, </em>that the procedures for taking property pursuant to eminent domain are entirely statutory in Montana. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing Title 70, chapter 30, MCA). And, under Montana\u2019s eminent domain statutes, a private right exists to create a road leading from a highway to landlocked property containing a residence or farm. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing \u00a770-30-102(6), MCA (now \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b613 In this case, Myers contends that the historic cabin on his property is a residence for purposes of \u00a7 70-30-102(36), MCA. He argues that the statutes governing eminent domain do not require proof that a farm or residence is presently in use before eminent domain maybe applied. Hence, Myers contends that the District Court erred in reading that requirement into the statutes and in granting the Dees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00b614 The Dees argue on the other hand that the eminent domain statutes require a showing of a presently-used farm or residence. The Dees maintain that on the facts before us here, because there is no presently-used farm or residence on Myers\u2019 property, the District Court was correct in granting their Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A6W\">\u00b615 There are no cases in Montana that define the term \u201cresidence\u201d for purposes of \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA. There are, however, two cases that define the term \u2018farm\u201d as used in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Groundwater v. Wright, </em>180 Mont. 27, 588 P.2d 1003 (1979), the plaintiff owned a tract of land with no access, so he sought to condemn an access route from a county road to his property over defendant\u2019s land using the eminent domain statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence produced at trial showed that plaintiffs property was not being farmed or used as a residence at that time, although the plaintiff did testify that he would like to build a home on the property when he retires. Because the jury found that there presently was no necessity for the road, as there was no farm or residence on the property, the court entered judgment for defendants. <em>Groundwater, </em>180 Mont. at 28-30, 588 P.2d at 1004-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b617 On appeal, this Court stated that in order to prevail, plaintiff must show that eminent domain would be exercised to provide necessary access from a highway to a residence or farm. The Court held that because the evidence presented showed that the land was not presently being farmed or used as a residence, plaintiff failed to establish that his proposed condemnation was necessary. <em>Groundwater, </em>180 Mont. at 29-30, 588 P.2d at 1004-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b618 Similarly, in the <em>Richter </em>case, plaintiffs sought a declaration that a public right-of-way had been established across defendants\u2019 property in the early 1900s or, alternatively, a condemnation order granting plaintiffs an easement across the property. The district court rejected the public right-of-way claim, but entered a preliminary condemnation order and judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b619 On appeal, we analyzed the term \u2018farm\u201d to determine whether the facts in that case fit within the requirements of the eminent domain statutes. We noted in <em>Richter </em>that while \u2018farm\u201d is not defined in Title 70, chapter 30, MCA, it is defined in several other chapters of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>MCA. We rejected each of those definitions, however, because they are limited in their application to the particular statutory scheme in which they are found. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-20. \u2018TWJhen a word is defined in any part of the MCA, the same definition applies wherever the word appears <em>unless \u2018a contrary intention plainly appears.\u2019\u201d Richter, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting \u00a71-2-107, MCA) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b620 Because \u2018farm\u201d was not defined for purposes of \u00a7 70-30-102(6), MCA (now \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA) and because other definitions of the term in the MCAs were not applicable to this statute, we concluded in <em>Richter </em>that we must construe the term according to its plain meaning. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing \u00a71-2-106, MCA; <em>State v. Nye, </em>283 Mont. 505, 510, 943 P.2d 96, 99 (1997)). And, based on the plain meaning of the term \u2018farm,\u201d we held in <em>Richter </em>that because plaintiffs had not prepared, fertilized, tilled or otherwise cultivated their property for agricultural purposes, the property could not be considered a \u2018farm.\u201d <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6 22. Consequently, we reversed the district court\u2019s condemnation order because plaintiffs failed to establish a public use on behalf of which eminent domain could be exercised. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b621 Just as the term \u2018farm\u201d is not defined in the eminent domain statutes for purposes of \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA, the term \u201cresidence\u201d is not defined there either. While \u201cresidence\u201d is defined in other sections of the MCA, none of those definitions are applicable here as each of those definitions is expressly limited in its application to the section of the MCA in which it appears,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the exception of \u00a71-1-215, MCA. And, even though \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, does not contain the limiting language of the other statutory definitions of the term \u201cresidence,\u201d it is not applicable in this case as it refers to an individual\u2019s <em>legal </em>residence as, for example, pointing out that a minor\u2019s legal residence is with the minor\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b622 As we did in <em>Richter </em>with the term \u2018farm,\u201d we must construe the term \u201cresidence\u201d according to its plain meaning because it is not defined for purposes of \u00a7 70-30-102(36), MCA, and because other definitions of the term in the MCAs are not applicable in this case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>cases too numerous to mention here, we have utilized dictionaries when seeking to define the common use and meaning of a term. <em>Ravalli County v. Erickson, </em>2004 MT 35, \u00b6 13, 320 Mont. 31, 85 P.3d 772 (citing <em>Town of Whitehall v. Preece, </em>1998 MT 53, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 288 Mont. 55, 956 P.2d 743). We will utilize this same method to determine the plain meaning of the term \u201cresidence\u201d as that term is used in \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b623 <em>Webster\u2019s New American Dictionary </em>445 (Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1995) defines \u201cresidence\u201d as \u201cthe act or fact of residing in a place as a dweller or in discharge of a duty or an obligation,\u201d \u2018the place where one actually lives,\u201d or \u201ca building used as a home.\u201d Similarly, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1423 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009) defines \u201cresidence\u201d as \u2018Tt]he act or fact of living in a given place for some time,\u201d\u201c[t]he place where one actually lives, as distinguished from a domicile,\u201d or \u201c[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b624  Under the rationale of <em>Groundwater </em>and <em>Richter, </em>and with the foregoing dictionary definitions in mind, we conclude that requiring some sort of on-going use or physical activity to constitute a residence is not an unreasonable interpretation for purposes of \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA. Thus, we further conclude that the term \u201cresidence\u201d in \u00a7 70-30-102(36), MCA, refers to a habitable structure or dwe lling place-i.e., a place where people are living.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b625 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA, requires proof of an existing farm or residence for application of the eminent domain statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">ISSUE 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the existence of a farm or residence and the necessity of a road to access that farm or residence are determinations for the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">\u00b627 The District Court concluded that Myers must make a prima facie showing under \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA, as to the current existence of a farm or residence on his property before he is entitled to a jury trial under \u00a770-30-107, MCA, relating to the necessity and value of the property taken. Because Myers failed to make such a showing, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the Dees.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b628 Myers argues that this was error on the District Court\u2019s part because the determination of whether there is a farm or residence on his property is inextricably intertwined with the necessity for access which is statutorily left to the determination of the jury. The Dees argue on the other hand that a necessity analysis under \u00a7 70-30-107, MCA, is not required here because it is undisputed that there is not a presently-used residence on Myers\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u00b629 Section 70-30-107, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">Private roads. Private roads may be opened in the manner prescribed by [Title 70, chapter 30, MCA], but in every case the necessity of the road and the amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening of the road <em>must be first determined by a jury, </em>and the amount of damages, together with the expenses of the proceeding, must be paid by the person to be benefited. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In addition, we stated in <em>Groundwater </em>that \u201c[t]he question of necessity is one of fact to be determined as other questions of fact in the light of all the evidence.\u201d <em>Groundwater, </em>180 Mont. at 30, 588 P.2d at 1004 (quoting <em>Montana Power Co. v. Bokma, </em>153 Mont. 390, 397-98, 457 P.2d 769, 774 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b630 We conclude that the District Court erred here because whether there is a residence on the property as we defined it in the previous issue, <em>see </em>\u00b6 24, and whether a necessity exists to condemn another\u2019s property to create a road to access that residence are generally questions of fact for a jury to determine. Nevertheless, we affirm the District Court on this issue because it is undisputed that the historic cabin on Myers\u2019 property has not been lived in for decades. It is also undisputed that the cabin has no windows or doors, no running water, and no sanitary system, thus it is completely uninhabitable. As such, the cabin cannot be considered a \u201cresidence\u201d for purposes of \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b631  In other words, had there been disputed issues of material fact about whether the historic cabin was a farm or residence, as our case law defines those terms <em>(see Richter, Groundwater </em>and \u00b6 24 above), then a jury should have resolved that factual issue before going on to resolve matters of necessity, damages and expenses under \u00a770-30-107, MCA. Here, however, Myers failed to first establish the predicate that there was a genuine factual issue regarding the existence of a farm or residence under \u00a770-30-102(36), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b632 We will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision when it reaches the correct result, even if it reached that result for the wrong reason. <em>In re Marriage of Szafryk, </em>2010 MT 90, \u00b6 18, 356 Mont. 141, 232 P.3d 361 (citing <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Talmage, </em>2007 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 125, 152 P.3d 1275).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b633 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Dees.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-11\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\"> Myers attempts to distinguish <em>Groundwater </em>from the instant case claiming that <em>Groundwater </em>was decided prior to the enactment of the statutes at issue here.
