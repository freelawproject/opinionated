The District Court concluded the structure did not unreasonably interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 easement rights in the ditch. We reverse. We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b62 <em>Whether the District Court erred in allowing Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge to remain in the Cooley-Goffena irrigation ditch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b63 The Cooley-Goffena irrigation ditch has been diverting water from the Musselshell River for over a century. The original owners, George Handel and John Cooley, claimed water rights through use of the ditch in 1891 and 1892. At some point prior to 1949, Handel\u2019s interest was acquired by the Goffena family, the owners of the Musselshell Ranch Company, resulting in the split ownership of the ditch between the Cooleys and the Goffenas which continues to the present day. The ditch diverts the Musselshell to the north of the river, then continues in a generally easterly direction to its various places of use on plaintiffs\u2019 lands. The Goffenas rely on the water from the ditch to irrigate over 300 hay ground acres, which serve a 30,000 acre cattle operation. They own the rights to approximately four-fifths of the water in the ditch when it is in operation from April to October. The Cooleys also use the ditch to irrigate hay fields for their cattle operation, and own the vast majority of the remainder of the water rights. For purposes of convenience, the Cooleys and Goffenas are hereinafter referred to collectively as \u2018MRC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">\u00b64 At various times throughout its history, the location of the ditch has been altered to accommodate the needs of large construction projects, notably the construction of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad in about 1907 and a 2002 road-widening project on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>U.S. Highway 12. The latter project had a substantial impact on Edwin and Jean Bohlman\u2019s property (now Joukova\u2019s) and the Cooley-Goffena ditch running through it. In April 2002, as part of the road-widening project, the State obtained an easement from the Bohlmans to relocate the ditch to its present location on Joukova\u2019s property and arranged for the easement to be recorded in favor of MRC. The recorded easement does not encompass the entire ditch. The ditch travels across Joukova\u2019s property for about a half-mile, but the recorded easement covers under 200 yards of that length. The easement rights on the remainder of the ditch, including the portion in which the culvert and rock bridge at issue are located, are claimed through historical use and as incidents of ownership of the ditch and water rights. There is no question as to the validity or existence of either the primary ditch easement or secondary easement for ditch maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\">\u00b65 As a result of the relocation, some of the Bohlmans\u2019 land previously made inaccessible by the ditch became dry and useable. An access gate was installed by the State, enabling access to the Bohlmans\u2019 property from Highway 12 for the first time. In 2006, the Bohlmans subdivided their land and sold the property in question to Joukova. The access gate installed in 2002 provided the only route from Highway 12 to the parcel, with the only other legal access through the Bohlmans\u2019 retained land to the north. Shortly after she purchased the property, Joukova graveled the road over opposition from the ditch users, who claimed the access gate was not intended to provide access to Joukova\u2019s property, but rather to the ditch for maintenance purposes alone. Joukova proceeded with construction over MRC\u2019s objections after obtaining a permit from the State to construct an approach from the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b66 The dispute between the parties flared up again on June 2,2009, when plaintiffs were performing ditch maintenance on Joukova\u2019s property and encountered the newly-installed culvert and bridge. Joukova had placed a culvert in the ditch bottom, and had completely filled in the ditch surrounding the culvert on either side with rock and gravel. She then added several additional feet of rock and gravel above the culvert, up to the height of the ditch bank, to create a sturdy rock bridge across the ditch. Plaintiffs\u2019 maintenance crew was forced to exit the ditch with the bulldozer to go around the bridge. When the crew had finished cleaning out the ditch, they dismantled the east end access gate to exit the property, as Joukova had not unlocked the gate to allow the maintenance crew to continue along the ditch from west to east. Communication between the parties was difficult as Joukova <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>has no phone installed at her property. A confrontation ensued when Joukova and her husband came upon the maintenance crew dismantling the gate. The parties engaged in a spirited discussion of their respective property rights, after which Jeff Goffena departed in such haste that his truck\u2019s wheels spun gravel at Joukova and her husband, breaking Joukova\u2019s glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b67 The following day, Joukova penned a letter seeking redress for her glasses and demanding that the Goffenas stop questioning her property rights. She sent a copy of the letter to Bud Goffena, as well as to Mary Cooley and the Musselshell County Sheriffs Department. MRC responded through counsel and litigation began soon thereafter. Joukova sought to protect her culvert, bridge and access from the highway. MRC sought to prohibit Joukova from accessing her property from Highway 12 via the improved road along the ditch bank, and sought removal of the bridge and culvert. MRC also sought access to Joukova\u2019s locked east-end gate and reinstallation of the west-end gate removed by Joukova.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b68 The District Court found credible Joukova\u2019s testimony that she informed plaintiffs of her intention to install the culvert, although plaintiffs ardently disputed this point. The parties did <em>not </em>dispute, however, that Joukova did not receive permission for the installation, either in writing or orally. At most, Joukova argued that she received tacit permission because MRC raised no objections after allegedly being informed. She installed the culvert to the west of the pipeline to access the sliver of her property between the ditch and the highway, which amounts to an acre or so of useable land that she attests is a desirable location to water her horses. Joukova\u2019s culvert is 48 inches wide, slightly larger than the 40-to-47.5-inch cement pipeline installed by the state as part of the road construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b69 The District Court upheld Joukova\u2019s rights to continue using the Highway 12 access and the improved road along the ditch bank, concluding that this use was not inconsistent with MRC\u2019s secondary easement rights. The court further concluded that the culvert and bridge installed in 2009 could remain in place, as they did not \u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d with plaintiffs\u2019 secondary easement rights, \u201cparticularly considering that [Joukova] is unable to meaningfully utilize her property lying south of the ditch otherwise and considering that the Plaintiffs have allowed or permitted similar culverts in the past.\u201d The court concluded, however, that Joukova was interfering with MRC\u2019s secondary easement rights in other respects, and ordered Joukova to provide the ditch users with access through the locked gate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>on the east end of the property and to reinstall the removed gate on the west end. The court therefore declined to award either party attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a770-17-112(5), MCA, as neither party \u201cprevailed\u201d within the meaning of the statute. MRC does not challenge on appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\">\u00b610 MRC states in its brief that the other issues decided by the District Court are no longer relevant because Joukova has complied with court orders regarding the two gates and no longer uses the road adjacent to the ditch bank; Joukova disputes this latter point, but in any case these issues were not appealed. MRC appeals only the District Court\u2019s ruling that Joukova\u2019s culvert does not interfere with or encroach upon its secondary easement rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 24, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, including its interpretation of statutes, to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Gibson v. Paramount Homes, LLC, </em>2011 MT 112, \u00b6 10, 360 Mont. 421, 253 P.3d 903; <em>Stevens, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the District Court erred in allowing Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge to remain in the Cooley-Goffena irrigation ditch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\n<em>1. Legal Framework.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u00b613 In 1981, the Montana Legislature codified the common law principle, commonly known as a \u201csecondary easement,\u201d that an owner of a ditch easement has the right to enter on the servient tenement to maintain the ditch. Section 70-17-112, MCA. Committee members suggested the bill would express \u201cin very specific terms what the case law already provides\u201d and, even in the absence of the law, \u201canyone with a ditch easement does have a secondary easement and the right to maintain that easement.\u201d Mont. H. Water Comm., <em>H. Bill 596 Executive Session, </em>47th Legis., Reg. Sess. 2 (Feb. 12, 1981); <em>Hearing on H. Bill 596, </em>Reg. Sess. at 1. Testimony supporting the bill addressed the perceived danger from urban sprawl to ditch easements, made worse by the fact that very few ditch rights are on deeded rights-of-way and real estate developers and new landowners are often unaware of their existence, location, or scope. The statute thus served the twin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>purposes of codifying secondary easement rights and, more importantly, of increasing the availability of legal remedies by allowing an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the prevailing party. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">70-17-112. Interference with canal or ditch easements prohibited. (1) A person with a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter, inspect, repair, and maintain a canal or ditch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">(2) No person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">(3) The provisions of subsection (2) do not apply if the holder of the canal or ditch easement consents in writing to the encroachment or impairment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">(5) If a legal action is brought to enforce the provisions of this section, the prevailing party is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">As the drafters recognized, secondary easement rights were well-established in the common law and in Montana independent of \u00a770-17-112, MCA. \u2018The right to enter upon the servient tenement for the purpose of repairing or renewing an artificial structure, constituting an easement, is called a \u2018secondary easement,\u2019 a mere incident of the easement <em>....\u2019\u2019Laden v. Atkeson, </em>112 Mont. 302, 305-06, 116 P.2d 881, 883 (1941) (citing treatises).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b614 In construing the requirements of \u00a770-17-112, MCA, we consider our discussion and application of its provisions over the statute\u2019s thirty-year history. \u201cWe presume that the legislature is aware of the existing law, including our decisions interpreting individual statutes .... We presume that if the legislature disagreed with our interpretation ... it would have amended the statute accordingly.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.2d 584 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). <em>See also </em>Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>vol. 2B, \u00a7 49:5, 32-34 (7th ed., Thomson-Reuters/West 2008) (\u201cJudicial construction of a statute becomes part of the legislation from the time of its enactment.\u201d). Cases decided by this Court after enactment of the statute illustrate that the common law governs determination of the location and scope of the secondary easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u00b615 We made clear in <em>Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, \u00b6 43, 298 Mont. 116, 993 P.2d 701, for example, that the seminal 1941 case <em>Laden v. Atkeson </em>still \u201csets forth the rules governing secondary ditch easements in Montana.\u201d Thus, we explained, the statute does not define <em>\u201cwhere, how, when </em>and <em>why\u201d </em>the dominant owner may rightfully enter to inspect, repair and maintain the ditch \u201cwithout unreasonably burdening the servient owner,\u201d or accordingly \u201cwhether an encroachment or impairment [of that right] occurred.\u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 10 (emphasis in original). We cited <em>Gabriel v. Wood, </em>261 Mont. 170, 176-77, 862 P.2d 42, 45-46 (1993), as authority for our observation that any obstruction of an easement must not \u201c \u2018interfere with <em>reasonable </em>use of the right-of-way.\u2019 <em>\u201d Engel, </em>\u00b6 50 (emphasis added). <em>See also Mason v. Garrison, </em>2000 MT 78, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49, 299 Mont. 142, 998 P.2d 531 (fences and garden beds \u201cmaterially\u201d and \u201cunreasonably\u201d interfered with dominant owners\u2019 easement rights to access and recreate on lakefront). Since a secondary easement is \u201ca mere incident of the easement\u201d <em>(Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 305-06, 116 P.2d at 883), we apply the same analysis whether the case concerns primary or secondary easement rights. <em>See Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10; <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2009 MT 286, \u00b6 47, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\">\n<em>2. Nature ofMRC\u2019s Easement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b616 Joukova does not challenge the validity ofMRC\u2019s easement. As noted in the statement of facts above, a small portion of MRC\u2019s easement through Joukova\u2019s property was recorded in conjunction with the widening of Highway 12; the culvert and bridge, however, are not located in the part of the ditch covered by this recorded easement. MRC\u2019s rights at issue here, concerning the portion of the ditch that includes the culvert and bridge, are claimed through prescriptive use and as attendant rights to the water right. While MRC\u2019s rights are statutorily <em>recognized </em>in \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, (\u201c[e]ach canal or ditch easement obtained by prescription ... is included within the scope of this section\u201d) they are not <em>created </em>by statute, as the statute itself makes clear in subsection (4): \u201c[n]othing in this section establishes a secondary easement where none existed prior to April 14,1981.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b617 Prescriptive easements generally restrict the dominant owner to whatever was in place historically, since the right \u2018is governed by the character and extent of the use during\u201d the prescriptive period. <em>Clark v. Heirs &amp; Devisees of Dwyer, </em>2007 MT 237, \u00b6 26, 339 Mont. 197, 170 P.3d 927 (citations omitted); Jon W. Bruce &amp; James W. Ely, Jr., <em>The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>\u00a78.12 (Thomson Reuters 2011); \u00a770-17-106, MCA. MRC\u2019s easement rights thus include both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>right to flow a certain amount of water during a prescribed period and, secondarily, the right to maintain the system designed to flow that water as it historically has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b618 MRC\u2019s rights in Joukova\u2019s land must be balanced with Joukova\u2019s own rights as the owner of the fee. In <em>Mattson, </em>we described as \u201clongstanding and well-settled\u201d the principle that \u201csecondary easement rights must be exercised \u2018in such a reasonable manner as not to needlessly increase the burden upon\u2019 or do \u2018unnecessary injury to\u2019 the servient estate.\u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 47 (citing <em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes </em>\u00a74.10 (2000); <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 306, 116 P.2d at 884; <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 43). Joukova, in turn, may \u201cmake use of the land in any lawful manner that [she] chooses, which use is not inconsistent with and does not interfere with the use and right reserved to the dominant tenement or estate.\u201d <em>Flynn v. Siren, </em>219 Mont. 359, 361, 711 P.2d 1371, 1372 (1986) (quoting <em>City of Missoula v. Mix, </em>123 Mont. 365, 372, 214 P.2d 212, 216 (1950)). Historical uses made of the servient tenement during the prescriptive period also bear upon Joukova\u2019s rights in the servient estate. Bruce &amp; Ely, <em>The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 8.24, 8.27; 25 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Easements and Licenses </em>\u00a784 (2004) (\u2018tw]hen the character of an easement is once fixed, no material alterations ordinarily can be made by either the servient owner or the easement owner without the other\u2019s consent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\n<em>3. Analysis.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b619 The balancing of rights suggested by these general rules incorporates a standard of reasonableness: whether the servient owner\u2019s us <em>^unreasonably </em>interferes with the easement rights. <em>Gabriel, </em>261 Mont. at 178, 862 P.2d at 47. <em>See </em>Bruce &amp; Ely, <em>The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>at \u00a7 8.21 (\u201c[although the servient owner is entitled to use the servient land, the owner may not <em>unreasonably </em>interfere with the easement holder\u2019s enjoyment of the servitude.\u201d) (emphasis added). If interference is \u201cslight and immaterial ... it is not objectionable.\u201d 25 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Easements and Licenses </em>\u00a784 (2004). <em>See also </em>Gerald Korngold, <em>Private Land Use Arrangements: Easements, Real Covenants, and Equitable Servitudes </em>\u00a74.06(a) (2d ed., Juris Publg. 2004). Equally clear is that whether interference is reasonable depends on the factual circumstances of each particular case. <em>Gabriel, </em>261 Mont. at 176-78, 862 P.2d at 45-48; <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 11; Bruce &amp; Ely, <em>The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>at \u00a78.21 (Tw]hether a particular activity by the servient owner constitutes an unreasonable interference is a question of fact, and uniform rules are difficult to formulate.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u00b620 We have recognized that \u2018Tw]hat may be considered reasonable is determined in light of the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Gabriel, </em>261 Mont. at 176, 862 P.2d at 46. For example, the servient owner\u2019s actions cannot make the easement more \u2018inconvenient, costly, or hazardous to use.\u201d Korngold, <em>Private Land Use Arrangements: Easements, Real Covenants, and Equitable Servitudes </em>at \u00a7 4.06(a); <em>e.g. Hatfield v. Ark. Western Gas Co., </em>632 S.W.2d 238, 241 (Ark. App. 1982) (\u201c[t]he owner of the servient estate can do nothing tending to diminish its use or make it more inconvenient or create hazardous conditions\u201d); <em>Beiser v. Hensic, </em>655 S.W.2d 660, 663 (Mo. App. E. D. 1983). <em>In Flynn v. Siren, </em>we concluded that the placement of a chained gate across an easement unreasonably interfered with the dominant owners\u2019 easement rights. <em>Flynn, </em>219 Mont. 359, 711 P.2d 1371 (1986). We found dispositive evidence \u201cestablishing] that the placing of the gate on the easement created a traffic hazard; that the gate, as installed, was too small to allow the passage of some farm machinery; and that the gate would have reduced [business traffic].\u201d We concluded that the dominant owners were \u201centitled to an ungated, unbarricaded, unchained, free and unobstructed use of the right-of-way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 711 P.2d at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">\u00b621 We also dealt with the placement of a gate in <em>Stamm v. Kehrer, </em>222 Mont. 167, 720 P.2d 1194 (1986). We concluded in <em>Stamm </em>that the construction of a fence and installation of a gate-despite the gate never having been locked, and rarely having been closed4mpermissibly interfered with the dominant owner\u2019s easement rights. The new fence and gate, while preserving access to the dominant owner\u2019s garage, cut off her historically-used access from the alley to her lawn. We noted that the dominant owner was an elderly woman, who \u201ctestified that the gates were very difficult for her to maneuver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 720 P.2d at 1196. Similarly, in <em>Strahan v. Bush, </em>237 Mont. 265, 773 P.2d 718 (1989), we held a gate unreasonably interfered with the dominant owners\u2019 use, as one owner (a year-round resident) could not \u201copen the gate without assistance, and is therefore restricted in her movement from the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 773 P.2d at 721. The gate also interfered with snow removal and road maintenance, and plainly inconvenienced the dominant owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\">\u00b622 In contrast, when a gate does not make use of the easement more inconvenient, costly, or hazardous for the dominant owner, no unreasonable interference will be found. It is generally held that \u201cthe owner of the servient estate may erect gates across the way if they are constructed so as not to interfere unreasonably with the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>passage.\u201d 25 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Easements and Licenses </em>\u00a788 (2004). This was our conclusion in <em>Gabriel. </em>We noted that the dominant owners did not \u201cuse the easement to any significant extent\u201d and observed that the district court had set forth \u201cstandards regarding Wood\u2019s gates in order to ensure the [dominant owners\u2019] reasonable access.\u201d <em>Gabriel, </em>261 Mont. at 177, 862 P.2d at 46-47. Likewise, other uses not affecting the dominant owner\u2019s use of an easement will not trigger a finding of unreasonable interference. <em>In Boylan v. Van Dyke, </em>247 Mont. 259, 263-65, 806 P.2d 1024, 1026-27 (1991), we upheld a finding that the servient owner\u2019s construction of a pond did not interfere with the dominant owner\u2019s ditch easement, even though a dam had been placed across the ditch. Our decision was based on the district court\u2019s determination that the pond did not interfere with the flow of water through the ditch and had actually facilitated maintenance of the ditch. <em>See also Titeca v. State, </em>194 Mont. 209, 634 P.2d 1156 (1981) (use of road by public did not interfere with dominant owner\u2019s use of road).</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u00b623 Forcing the dominant owner to defend an easement right in court also may constitute unreasonable interference with the right. <em>Kephart v. Portmann, </em>259 Mont. 232, 239, 855 P.2d 120, 124 (1993); <em>Byrum v. Andren, </em>2007 MT 107, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50, 337 Mont. 167, 159 P.3d 1062. That claim has not been raised by MRC which, as noted, challenges on appeal only the installation of the culvert and bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b624 The ditch owners in the present case testified to the inconvenient and hazardous new route that Joukova\u2019s culvert forced them to take when performing maintenance on the ditch. Unlike other culverts installed with MRC\u2019s permission, Joukova\u2019s culvert is located in an uneven area with heavy growth, making entry and exit from the ditch with heavy equipment difficult. The District Court found that the culvert and bridge did not \u201cobstruct or impede the flow of water\u201d in the ditch-and thus did not impair MRC\u2019s primary easement right. The court also found that having to exit and re-enter the ditch \u201cminimally hindered\u201d and was not \u201ca major imposition\u201d on MRC\u2019s maintenance activities. The court\u2019s conclusion that no unreasonable interference was present failed to take into account the statute\u2019s express prohibition against encroachment, in light of the law\u2019s historical view that permanently obstructing a right of passage is not permitted. Case law makes clear that such a permanent and immovable encroachment constitutes unreasonable interference with the easement right.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b625 Our gate cases help illustrate this point. Where the obstruction was immovable, such as a chained and locked gate <em>{Flynn) </em>or fixed fence <em>{Stamm), </em>we have concluded that unreasonable interference was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>present. In contrast, when the obstruction was removable4he gate could be opened and traffic could proceed as normal-we have concluded that the interference was no more than necessary to achieve a reasonable balance of the parties\u2019 property rights. <em>Gabriel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42, 45-46; <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 50, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\">\u00b626 \u2018The prevailing view is that the owner of a servient estate may not erect any structures that encroach on a right-of-way.\u201d Bruce &amp; Ely, <em>The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>at \u00a78.22 (citing cases). Servient owners \u201ccannot pursue a development plan that encroaches upon a right-of-way even if the dominant owner still has an unobstructed passageway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a78.22 (citing <em>Louis W. Epstein Fam. Partn. v. Kmart Corp., </em>13 F.3d 762, 766-69 (3d Cir. 1994)). \u201cIf the improvement is temporary and easily removed, it is generally not unreasonable. The more expensive the improvement or the more difficult its removal is likely to be, the more likely is the conclusion that the improvement is an unreasonable interference with the easement <em>....\u2019\u2019Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes </em>\u00a74.9 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">\u00b627  Some permanent encroachments may not justify a finding of unreasonable interference. The particular facts of a situation are always controlling, and what is reasonable or unreasonable is often a close call. We permitted the dam in <em>Boylan </em>because it did not impede the flow of water <em>or </em>increase the maintenance of the ditch. <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 264, 806 P.2d at 1027. <em>See also Marsh v. Pullen, </em>623 P.2d 1078 (Or. App. 1981) (suggesting that the installation of eight-to-ten-inch speed bumps constituted an unreasonable interference, and concluding that seven-inch speed bumps did not). On the facts present here, we conclude Joukova\u2019s rock bridge and culvert constitutes an unreasonable interference with MRC\u2019s secondary easement rights. MRC\u2019s reasonable secondary easement rights to enter the ditch for repair and maintenance have been impaired and encroached upon.</p>\n<p id=\"A_9\">\u00b628  Furthermore, the public policy espoused in \u00a770-17-112, MCA, does not countenance the installation of culverts such as Joukova\u2019s absent written permission from the easement holder. Tacit permission is insufficient. <em>Glenn v. Grosfield, </em>274 Mont. 192, 196, 906 P.2d 201, 204 (1995). As one court put it when confronted with a servient owner\u2019s filling of land subject to the United States\u2019 flowage easement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">[T]he Government does not have the burden of showing the impact of the fill material placed on the easement by [the servient owner] on the operation of the flowage easement and the impoundment of flood water in the Grapevine Reservoir. If every land owner whose property is encumbered by a flowage easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>acquired by the Government for the [reservoir] placed fill material in the easement, it is obvious that the Government\u2019s ability to impound flood water would be seriously impaired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><em>U.S. v. Austin Two Tracts, L.P., </em>239 F. Supp. 2d 640, 643 (E.D. Tex. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b629 Analogizing to the present case, if every landowner whose property is encumbered by a ditch easement placed culverts in the ditch, it is obvious the ditch owners\u2019 ability to exercise their secondary easement rights to maintain the ditch would be seriously impaired. Though Joukova complains that having to exit and re-enter the ditch at one point along the maintenance route is not a material inconvenience, we cannot condone Joukova\u2019s unilateral installation of the culvert and rock bridge simply because other landowners along the ditch have not followed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b630 We therefore cannot agree with the District Court that the placement of the permanent, irremovable culvert and rock bridge did not interfere with or encroach on MRC\u2019s secondary easement rights. Joukova has erected a structure that prevents normal, historic use of that portion of the secondary easement, thereby violating \u00a770-17-112, MCA. MRC is entitled to removal of the culvert and bridge. Joukova cannot be deprived of her rights to use her land currently accessed via the rock bridge, but she is required to make use of this land in a manner that does not impair the rights held in the land by MRC. Joukova may seek other alternatives for access to this portion of her property, short of erecting a permanent structure in the ditch bed. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court and remand for entry of an order directing removal of the culvert and bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b631 While the Dissent agrees the culvert and bridge must be removed, it \u201cstrenuously\u201d objects to the proposition that the law obliges dominant and servient owners to be reasonable with one another. As we stated in <em>Mattson, </em>however, \u201c[r]ights must be exercised with reference to the rights of others.\u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 47. A dominant owner\u2019s secondary easement rights are \u201cconfined by the responsibility of not unreasonably burdening the servient owner.\u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 50. It is easy in the abstract to think that interpreting the statute-for the first time-to create an absolute bar to <em>any </em>disturbance in a ditch, no matter how slight, will diminish conflicts between landowners and relieve the courts from easement disputes. But had the Dissent\u2019s hard-and-fast rule been applied in <em>Byrum, </em>for example, we would have been compelled to reverse, rather than affirm, the district court\u2019s ruling that the servient owners had not physically interfered with the dominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>owners\u2019 ditch easement by \u201coccasionally blocking]\u201d the dominant owners from using the headgates on the ditch, though they eventually allowed access. <em>Byrum, </em>\u00b6 46. Our ruling today upholds MRC\u2019s secondary easement to maintain its ditch as is reasonable and as it historically has done. Section 70-17-106, MCA. This ruling applies the letter of the law in harmony with the well-settled principles that have guided this Court\u2019s interpretation of easement disputes for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b632 We cannot agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the installation of the culvert and rock bridge did not interfere with MRC\u2019s secondary easement rights. Joukova\u2019s construction of a structure permanently blocking use of a portion of MRC\u2019s secondary easement inarguably encroaches on the easement. As set out above, the law governing easements makes clear that construction of the culvert constituted an unreasonable interference with MRC\u2019s easement rights, for which the statute required Joukova to obtain written permission.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b633 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b37-6\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b634 I agree with much of the legal analysis in Justice Nelson\u2019s dissenting opinion and believe we must be careful about applying general, common law easement concepts or public policy where the Legislature has enacted a specific statute governing the ditch easement dispute at issue.

However, I believe the Court has reached the correct outcome and thus concur in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b635 The District Court found the installation of the culvert and rock bridge had hindered Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to maintain their ditch and, although the court deemed the hindrance to be minimal, it is clear to me that Defendants\u2019 actions \u201cencroach[ed] upon or otherwise impair[ed]\u201dPlaintiffs\u2019 secondary easement rights.

Opinion, \u00b6 30. As to the remainder of the Court\u2019s Opinion, however, I respectfully, but strenuously, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b637 Resolution of this case involves nothing more than a straightforward application of a clear and unambiguous statute, which states that \u201c[n]o person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.\u201d Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. There is no need for the Court\u2019s lengthy excursion into caselaw-most of which does not even involve ditch easements4n order to resolve the question before us. More to the point, there is no justification whatsoever for the Court\u2019s outright refusal to apply a controlling statute according to its plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"A7G\">\u00b638 The majority boldly rewrites \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA, so that the statute\u2019s clear and unqualified prohibition, \u2018ho person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch,\u201d now reads: \u2018ho person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch, <em>unless the encroachment or impairment does not unreasonably interfere with the easement\u201d </em>This sua sponte remaking of the statute is untenable in the extreme, and it violates any number of rules of statutory construction, not the least of which is \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA: \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Worse still, while the majority has not outright repealed the statute, the engrafted language thoroughly compromises the shield which the Legislature enacted to protect irrigators from the very sort of conduct that is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b639 The Legislature could not have been clearer: \u2018No person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch.\u201d Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. I would simply enforce this plain and unambiguous statutory mandate and hold that Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge violate the statute because-as we all agree-they encroach upon or otherwise impair MRC\u2019s easement rights. I would not embark on a discussion of common law principles, asking whether the encroachment or impairment arises to \u201cunreasonable interference,\u201d as this consideration is not included in the statutory language and, thus, is not part of the statutory calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Rules of Statutory Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b640 I begin with three general observations. First and foremost, the Court\u2019s extended discussion of common law doctrines-more specifically, cases addressing \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>easements4s entirely beside the point and unnecessary, given the facts here. At issue is a statute, \u00a770-17-112, MCA, the language of which is perfectly plain, clear, and unambiguous. <em>See </em>Opinion \u00b6 13. That being the case, principles of common law, which might otherwise be applicable to the issue at hand, have been statutorily abrogated. Section 1-2-103, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\">The rule of the common law that statutes in derogation thereof are to be strictly construed has no application to the statutes of the state of Montana. The statutes establish the law of this state respecting the subjects to which they relate, and their provisions and all proceedings under them are to be liberally construed with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Accordingly, the Court\u2019s discussion of the common law that applies to <em>other </em>types of easements has no relevance here and is, therefore, dicta because \u00a770-17-112, MCA, has trumped all of that with respect to ditch easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b641 Second, because the statutory language is plain, clear, and unambiguous, there is no need to resort to legislative history, as the Court does at \u00b6 13. Our rules of statutory construction are quite clear on this point. Tn interpreting a statute, we look first to the plain meaning of the words it contains. Where the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation. In this regard, words used by the legislature must be given their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Rocky Mt. Bank v. Stuart, </em>280 Mont. 74, 80, 928 P.2d 243, 246-47 (1996) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 73, \u00b6 21, 305 Mont. 53, 31 P.3d 335 (THhere is no reason for us to engage in a discussion of the legislative history to construe [a] statute when we have determined that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face.\u201d). Here, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning, the Legislature\u2019s intention is crystal clear from the language of the statute: no person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch. There is no need to consult legislative history to ascertain the meaning of these unambiguous words.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b642 Third, because the Legislature has spoken in the clearest possible language, the Court is not at liberty to interpret the statute by reading into it language that is not there. \u201c[0]ne of the most basic precepts governing this Court\u2019s function [is] the long-standing mandate that we must not insert what the Legislature has omitted.\u201d <em>Saucier v. McDonald\u2019s Rests. of Mont., Inc., </em>2008 MT 63, \u00b6 70, 342 Mont. 29, 179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>P.3d 481 (citing \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA). Here, the Court improperly reads into \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA, language of \u2018interference\u201d and \u201creasonableness\u201d in an unnecessary and misguided attempt to \u2018balance\u201d property rights and create its own perception of good \u201cpublic policy.\u201d Rather than simply enforce the \u2018balance\u201d and \u201cpublic policy\u201d that the Legislature itself has already decreed, the Court effectively legislates from the bench and amends the statute to achieve a more palatable result. I discuss these observations in further detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Application of \u00a770-17-112, MCA</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">\u00b643 Again, regardless of the law applicable to other types of easements, the analysis of ditch easements is governed by \u00a770-17-112, MCA. This statute provides, first, that \u2018Ta] person with a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter, inspect, repair, and maintain a canal or ditch.\u201d Section 70-17-112(1), MCA. This is a codification of prior caselaw. In <em>Laden v. Atkeson, </em>112 Mont. 302, 116 P.2d 881 (1941), we observed that \u2018[a] person having an easement in a ditch running through the land of another may go upon the servient land and use so much thereof on either side of the ditch as may be required to make all necessary repairs and to clean out the ditch at all reasonable times.\u201d <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 306, 116 P.2d at 883 (internal quotation marks omitted). We explained that this is called a \u201csecondary easement\u201d and that it is \u201ca mere incident of the [primary] easement that passes by express or implied grant, or is acquired by prescription.\u201d <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 305-06, 116 P.2d at 883 (internal quotation marks omitted). The rationale behind this principle is that \u201cwhen the use of a thing is granted, everything is granted by which the grantee may reasonably enjoy such use, that is, rights that are incident to something else granted-here to water and ditch rights.\u201d <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 306, 116 P.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b644 Next, the statute states that \u2018[n]o person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.\u201d Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. There may be no encroachment upon or impairment of \u201cany\u201d easement for a canal or ditch-neither the primary easement nor the secondary easement. The prohibition on encroachment and impairment, without any qualifications or exceptions, is <em>more protective </em>than our non-ditch caselaw, which prohibits only \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d with an easement holder\u2019s rights. <em>See </em>\u00b6 49, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b645 Here, it can be said, as a matter of law and irrefutable fact, that MRC\u2019s primary easement (the ditch itself) has been encroached upon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>There is, after all, a massive obstruction right in the middle of it: Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge. Nobody could plausibly or rationally suggest that this is not an \u201cencroachment\u201dupon the primary easement. Obviously, it is. In fact, it is the embodiment of what \u00a770-17-112(2), MCA, expressly prohibits. Evidently, Joukova thought that she could blatantly flout the statute and that MRC either would not pursue the matter or would lose in court. Unfortunately, she was correct as to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">\u00b646 For reasons that are not clear from the briefs or the record, MRC has not pursued the most obvious claim it could raise: that its <em>primary </em>easement has been violated by virtue of the physical occupation of the ditch. Instead, MRC has raised only its <em>secondary </em>easement rights, as the Court notes at \u00b6 10. Nevertheless, the standard is still the same: Has Joukova \u201cencroached upon or otherwise impaired\u201d MRC\u2019s secondary easement? Section 70-17-112(2), MCA; <em>see also </em>Opinion, \u00b6 15 (\u2018\u00cdW]e apply the same analysis whether the case concerns primary or secondary easement rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b647 At the outset, it is necessary to identify the specific secondary easement rights at issue. MRC\u2019s ditch easement was established by prescription. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 16. Ditch easements obtained by prescription are expressly included within the protections of \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, as stated under subsection (4) of the statute. Furthermore, as noted, a secondary easement may be acquired by prescription. <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 305-06, 116 P.2d at 883. The Court asserts that the location and scope of this easement is governed by the common law. Opinion, \u00b6 14. The truth is, however, that there is a controlling statute which states that \u201c[t]he extent of a servitude is determined by the terms of the grant or <em>the nature of the enjoyment by which it was </em>acquired.\u201dSection 70-17-106, MCA (emphasis added). We accordingly have recognized, in numerous cases, that the scope of an easement gained by prescription is defined by the character and extent of the use made during the prescriptive period. <em>Leichtfuss v. Dabney, </em>2005 MT 271, \u00b6 30, 329 Mont. 129, 122 P.3d 1220; <em>Kelly v. Wallace, </em>1998 MT 307, \u00b6 31, 292 Mont. 129, 972 P.2d 1117, and cases cited therein. Here, MRC has cleaned and maintained its ditch for the last 60 years by utilizing a bulldozer (with an eight-foot-wide blade), a backhoe, or a trackhoe through the bottom of the ditch and on the ditch banks. Maintenance begins at the point of diversion on the Musselshell River and continues through to MRC\u2019s property, a distance of several miles. As the Court acknowledges, \u201c[tjhere is no question as to the validity or existence of... [this] secondary easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>for ditch maintenance.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b648 Knowing the extent of MRC\u2019s secondary easement, the only question remaining is whether Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge \u201cencroach upon or otherwise impair\u201d that easement. Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. In this regard, the Court concedes that Joukova\u2019s culvert \u2018impair[s]\u201d MRC\u2019s secondary easement rights. Opinion, \u00b6 29. The Court also concedes that the culvert and the rock bridge are an \u201cencroachment\u201d upon the easement. Opinion, \u00b6 24. Given these facts, there is nothing more to say. Section 70-17-112(2), MCA, has been violated. End of story.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Court\u2019s Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b649 The error in the Court\u2019s approach is its dogged refusal to apply the statute according to its plain language. Our cases have adopted the principle that the owner of a servient estate may make use of the land in any lawful manner that she chooses, so long as the use is not inconsistent with and does not interfere with the rights reserved to the easement holder. <em>See City of Missoula v. Mix, </em>123 Mont. 365, 372, 214 P.2d 212, 216 (1950); <em>Titeca v. State, </em>194 Mont. 209, 214, 634 P.2d 1156, 1160 (1981); <em>Flynn v. Siren, </em>219 Mont. 359, 361, 711 P.2d 1371, 1372 (1986); <em>Stamm v. Kehrer, </em>222 Mont. 167, 171, 720 P.2d 1194, 1196 (1986). Subsequently, we modified this rule to prohibit only interference that is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>See Strahan v. Bush, </em>237 Mont. 265, 268-69, 773 P.2d 718, 721 (1989); <em>Gabriel v. Wood, </em>261 Mont. 170, 176-78, 862 P.2d 42, 45-47 (1993); <em>Mason v. Garrison, </em>2000 MT 78, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49, 299 Mont. 142, 998 P.2d 531. No one disputes this standard, insofar as it applies to easements <em>other than </em>ditch easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b650 With respect to ditch easements, however, the Legislature has abrogated that standard. The Legislature removed any subjective inquiry into the <em>reasonableness </em>of an encroachment or impairment. The Legislature determined, as a matter of public policy, that \u2018tn]o person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.\u201d Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. Had it wanted to, the Legislature could have used the words \u201c[n]o person may <em>unreasonably interfere with </em>any easement for a canal or ditch.\u201dThe Legislature did not use those words, however. Rather, the Legislature chose a more clear, objective, and categorical prohibition: no encroachment or impairment, period.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b651 Accordingly, whether an encroachment or impairment amounts to \u201cinterference,\u201d and whether the encroachment or impairment is \u201cunreasonable,\u201d are not the issue. There is no allowance in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>for encroachments and impairments that interfere \u201creasonably\u201d with the easement. Nor, for that matter, are there allowances for encroachments and impairments that are \u201cslight and immaterial\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 19) or \u201cminimal\u201d (the standard applied by the District Court). Pursuant to the plain statutory language, no person may \u201cencroach upon\u201d or \u201cotherwise impair\u201d any easement for a ditch, no matter how \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cslight,\u201d \u2018immaterial,\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d one might think the encroachment or impairment is.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">\u00b652 Unfortunately, the Court replaces the statutory standard with its own judge-made standard, as evidenced by at least three statements in the Opinion. First, referring to Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge, the Court observes that \u201csuch a permanent and immovable encroachment constitutes unreasonable interference with the easement right.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. It does not matter, however, whether the encroachment constitutes unreasonable interference. The fact that it is an \u201cencroachment\u201d means that it is <em>per se </em>in violation of the statute. Second, the Court observes that Ti]f interference is \u2018slight and immaterial ... it is not objectionable.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19 (ellipsis in original). What possible relevance could this statement have to the analysis unless the Court is engrafting a \u201cslight and immaterial interference\u201d exception onto the statute? Third, the Court states that \u2018isjome permanent encroachments may not justify a finding of unreasonable interference.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 27. Again, what purpose could this statement serve except to dilute the statutory standard by creating an exception where the otherwise prohibited encroachment does not \u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d with the easement holder\u2019s rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The Court\u2019s Fictitious Presumption that the Legislature Agrees with It</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b653 The Court asserts that \u2018ti]n construing the requirements of \u00a770-17-112, MCA, we consider our discussion and application of its provisions over the statute\u2019s thirty-year history.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14. The Court then goes on to state that \u2018\u201c[w]e presume that the legislature is aware of the existing law, including our decisions interpreting individual statutes .... We presume that if the legislature disagreed with our interpretation ... it would have amended the statute accordingly.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14 (ellipses in original). For reasons discussed further below, I do not believe these principles are applicable in the present case. Briefly, we have not previously addressed the specific question presented here, and thus the Legislature has not yet had the opportunity to \u201cdisagree\u201d with our statutory interpretation. But even assuming, for the sake of argument, that we have, in fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>interpreted \u00a770-17-112, MCA, in a way that is relevant to this case, I cannot agree with the foregoing quoted principles in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b654 As an initial matter, for purposes of clarity, the Court cites <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.3d 584, for the language quoted above about what we \u201cpresume.\u201d <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 14. It should be noted, however, that this language is not properly attributed to <em>Swanson. </em>Rather, the specific language quoted by the Court actually appears in a parenthetical citation to a different case-namely, <em>Gaustad v. City of Columbus, </em>265 Mont. 379, 382, 877 P.2d 470, 472 (1994). <em>See Swanson, </em>\u00b6 22. <em>Gaustad, </em>in turn, cites <em>In re Wilson\u2019s Estate, </em>102 Mont. 178, 194, 56 P.2d 733, 737 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b655 Second, the Court misapplies the quoted principles about what we \u201cpresume.\u201d We presume that the Legislature, <em>when it actually enacts legislation-i.e., when it affirmatively takes </em>action-^roceeds having in mind existing law, including this Court\u2019s interpretations of the statute or statutes at issue. <em>See Swanson, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Gaustad, </em>265 Mont. at 382, 877 P.2d at 472; <em>Wilson\u2019s Estate, </em>102 Mont. at 194, 56 P.2d at 737. Section 70-17-112, MCA, however, was enacted in 1981 and has never been amended. Thus, the presumption that the Legislature agrees with our interpretations of the statute is not applicable in the present case. Nevertheless, the Court perverts this principle to hold that when the Legislature <em>does not enact any legislation at </em>all-i.e., when the Legislature <em>takes no action whatsoever in relation to a particular </em>statute^he Legislature tacitly ratifies this Court\u2019s statutory construction. This proposition is without foundation in law or reason.</p>\n<p id=\"Av0\">\u00b656 It is one thing for the Legislature to affirmatively enact legislation mindful of this Court\u2019s existing statutory interpretations, which is the point we made in <em>Swanson, Gaustad, </em>and <em>Wilson\u2019s Estate. </em>It is quite another, however, for the Legislature to do nothing at all. To presume that the Legislature\u2019s passive failure to amend a statute constitutes affirmative \u201cagreement\u201d with our statutory interpretation is a dangerous and untenable precedent. Notably, this is analogous to presuming that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to grant certiorari in a particular case means that the Supreme Court agrees with the lower court\u2019s decision; after all, following the majority\u2019s reasoning, if the Supreme Court disagreed with the lower court\u2019s decision, it would have taken the case and reversed it. Of course, it is axiomatic that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari is not a decision on the merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And the same is obviously true regarding the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend a statute following this Court\u2019s construction of it. There are any number of reasons why the Legislature might not take up the matter. The Court\u2019s presumption assumes that (1) the Legislature is aware of all of our statutory interpretations, (2) the Legislature has the resources to analyze and address all of those statutory interpretations during its biennial sessions, (3) the Legislature convenes its members to decide whether they agree or disagree with this Court\u2019s various statutory constructions, and (4) when a majority of the members decline to amend a statute, it is because they affirmatively agree with what we have said. This rationale is complete fiction and without any basis in reality. Typically, when a statutory issue is brought to the Legislature\u2019s attention, it is because a lobbyist disagrees with one of our decisions and has determined to expend the resources to get the statute amended. <em>See e.g. </em>Laws of Montana, 2001, ch. 229 (amending the exclusive remedy provision in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with the express purpose of abrogating our statutory analysis in <em>Sherner v. Conoco, </em>Inc., 2000 MT 50, 298 Mont. 401, 995 P.2d 990). But it is sheer folly to \u201cpresume\u201dthat when the Legislature takes <em>no action at all </em>with regard to a given statute, it must have considered what we said and agreed with it. That is not what our discussions in <em>Swanson, Gaustad, </em>and <em>Wilson\u2019s Estate </em>stand for. Moreover, this approach ignores this Court\u2019s continuing obligation to interpret statutes according to their plain meaning and to correct its own mistakes. <em>See e.g. State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300. As a result of today\u2019s decision, however, the Legislature has been put on notice: It must apprise itself of all of this Court\u2019s statutory interpretations and, if it disagrees with a particular interpretation, it must \u201camend the statute accordingly\u2019 lest a failure to act be \u201cpresumed\u201d to be affirmative agreement with what we have said.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">\u00b657 Third, regardless of whether the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend a statute can be construed as tacit agreement with this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>construction of the statute, our decision today implicates important access-to-justice issues. Our courts are faced with increasing numbers of ordinary citizens who must represent themselves. These individuals must be able to open the Montana Code Annotated and rely on the plain language of the statutes contained therein. Ordinary citizens should not be required-as they now are under today\u2019s decision-to obtain and sift through myriad volumes of the Montana Reports in order to ascertain whether this Court has construed a particular statute differently than its plain language, and then comb through the annals of legislative history to determine whether the Legislature has failed to amend the statute and, thereby, tacitly expressed its agreement with what we have said. For one thing, only attorneys would be aware, in the first place, that this Court occasionally construes statutes contrary to their plain language (today\u2019s decision being an example). Moreover, only attorneys would have the skills to conduct the legal research necessary to make this determination. Indeed, had MRC itself opened the Montana Code Annotated and looked at \u00a770-17-112(2), MCA, it would have seen that \u2018[n]o person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.\u201d MRC would not have known that this Court (according to today\u2019s majority opinion) has previously construed this language to mean something less rigorous than what it actually says-namely, that \u201cno person may <em>unreasonably interfere with </em>any easement for a canal or ditch.\u201d And MRC most certainly would not have understood, as it now must, that the corollary to this rule is also true-i.e., that a person <em>may reasonably interfere </em>with an easement for a canal or ditch. It undermines the goal of access to justice, and is simply unfair, that self-represented litigants cannot rely on what the Montana Code Annotated actually says and must hire an attorney to figure out what this Court has said, and what the Legislature has not said, on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b658 Lastly, also at \u00b6 14 of the Opinion, the Court cites Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>vol. 2B, \u00a749:5, 32-34 (7th ed., Thomson Reuters/West 2008), for the proposition that \u2018[\u00a1Judicial construction of a statute becomes part of the legislation from the time of its enactment.\u201d Notably, this was the same argument made by the dissent in <em>Stiffarm </em>and supported by the same authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">However, \u2018judicial construction of a statute becomes part of the legislation from the time of its enactment.\u201d Norman J. Singer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction, </em>vol. 2B, \u00a7 49:5, 32-34 (7th ed., Thompson-West 2008). Whether this Court\u2019s initial construction of the statute was correct or not, it has become the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 24 (Baker &amp; Rice, JJ., dissenting). This approach, however, was decidedly <em>rejected </em>by the Court in <em>Stiffarm, </em>which held: \u2018We conclude, however, that we cannot reconcile our duty to apply legislation as written with the decisions in these [prior] cases. We accordingly expressly overrule [the prior cases].\u201d <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 18. Our decision in <em>Stiffarm </em>stands for the proposition that it is \u201cour duty to apply legislation as written.\u201d <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 18. Inexplicably, the majority disregards this rule in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b659 In sum, even assuming, for the sake of discussion, that we have previously interpreted \u00a770-17-112, MCA, in a manner that is pertinent to the present case, I disagree with the propositions that the Legislature\u2019s failure to take any action in regard to our interpretation (1) justifies our \u201cpresuming\u201d that the Legislature agrees with our construction and (2) relieves us of our duty to apply legislation as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The Court\u2019s Misapplication of our Caselaw</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b660 That said, while the Court implies that we have, over the last 30 years, \u201cdiscussed and applied\u201d the provisions of \u00a770-17-112, MCA, in a way that is pertinent to the present case <em>(see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 14), the fact is that none of the easement cases cited by the Court have addressed the specific arguments raised by MRC here. First of all, almost none of the cited cases involved a secondary ditch easement or, more specifically, the application of \u00a770-17-112, MCA. Their irrelevance, therefore, is self-evident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Secondly, the two cited cases that did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>involve a ditch easement (discussed below) are readily distinguishable from the present case. Before discussing those cases, however, it is necessary first to review what MRC is specifically arguing on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u25a0 \u2018The Ditch Owners have grave concerns over the District Court\u2019s reliance on an alleged \u2018minimal\u2019 hindrance standard of their rights under 70-17-112, MCA. The plain language of the statute does not allow for any encroachment or impairment of irrigation ditch owners\u2019 secondary easement rights on the basis that the encroachment only \u2018minimally\u2019 interferes with ditch maintenance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u25a0 \u2018The plain language of 70-17-112, MCA, prohibits <em>any </em>impairment or encroachment of a ditch owner\u2019s secondary easement rights without the ditch owner\u2019s permission.... [T]he Court cannot insert \u2018what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u2019 Section 1-2-101, MCA.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u25a0 \u2018The District Court inserted a standard into 70-17-112, MCA, that cannot be found in the plain language of the statute.... [T]he District Court found Joukova\u2019s culvert/rock bridge to have \u2018hindered\u2019 the Ditch Owners\u2019 ability to clean the Ditch. Yet, the court went one step too far in justifying Joukova\u2019s hindrance by qualifying the impairment as minimal-inserting a \u2018minimal\u2019 standard into \u00a770-17-112, MCA. Nowhere in \u00a770-17-112, MCA, is there an allowance for minimal encroachment or impairment of a secondary easement right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\u25a0 \u201cJoukova has provided no authority-either statutory or common law-that the District Court is entitled to insert a \u2018minimal\u2019 standard into 70-17-112, MCA. This is for good reason, as no such authority exists. Section 1-2-101, MCA, prevents district courts from inserting words into statutes. Here, the plain language of \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, controls the resolution of this dispute: \u2018[n]o person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation ....\u2019 The District Court\u2019s insertion of a \u2018minimal\u2019 standard (in violation of \u00a71-2-101, MCA) to the statute must be reversed.\u201d (Ellipsis and brackets in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">As will be seen, neither of the ditch cases cited by the Court addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>these arguments, as they were not made in those cases. The present case is the first in which we have been squarely presented with the question whether some encroachments or impairments are acceptable while others are not. It is bad enough that the Court answers this question incorrectly. It is worse that the Court cloaks its erroneous answer in the mantle of prior cases which did not even confront the question directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">\u00b661 First, in <em>Boylan v. Van Dyke, </em>247 Mont. 259, 806 P.2d 1024 (1991), the servient landowners (the Van Dykes) constructed a one-acre pond on their land. To do so, they placed a dam across Boylan\u2019s irrigation ditch (the Tudor Lane Ditch)-a patent violation of his primary easement, incidentally. Boylan then filed suit, \u201cclaiming that construction of the pond interfered with his ditch right to transport irrigation water down the Tudor Lane Ditch.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 261-62, 806 P.2d at 1025. The district court correspondingly framed the issue as \u201cwhether the pond interfered with Mr. Boylan\u2019s use of the Tudor Lane Ditch, and if so, what the damages were.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 262, 806 P.2d at 1026. After personally examining the pond and the ditch, the judge concluded that \u201cthe Complaint of the plaintiff that they were deprived of the waters of Spring Creek is dispelled.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 263, 806 P.2d at 1026. Bottom line, \u2018Mr. Boylan failed to present any evidence to support his claims of unlawful interference.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 266, 806 P.2d at 1028. On appeal, Boylan maintained that \u201cthe construction of the pond was an unlawful interference with his ditch easement\u201d because \u201cthe pond deprived him of irrigation water for his land and reduced the value of his land to half of. what it was worth prior to construction of the pond and the destruction of his ditch.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 264, 806 P.2d at 1027. \u201cAfter reviewing the record in this case,\u201d however, we concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to support Mr. Boylan\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 264-65, 806 P.2d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b662 The Court misstates our holding in <em>Boylan, </em>citing it for the propositions that \u201cuses not affecting the dominant owner\u2019s use of an easement will not trigger a finding of <em>unreasonable </em>interference,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22 (emphasis added), and \u2018fsjome permanent encroachments may not justify a finding of <em>unreasonable </em>interference,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 27 (emphasis added). The word \u201cunreasonable,\u201d however, does not appear anywhere in the <em>Boylan </em>decision. In point of fact, we never considered whether the interference alleged by Boylan was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Rather, we concluded that he had simply failed to show \u2018interference\u201d at all. And this is why <em>Boylan </em>contributes nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>to the statutory analysis in the present case. At no point in that decision did we address whether a \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d encroachment or impairment is permissible under the statute. While Boylan certainly could have pursued the claims which MRC has pursued here, given that the Van Dykes had erected a dam and created a pond in the ditch, Boylan merely claimed that the dam and pond deprived him of irrigation water for his land and reduced the value of his land. The district court found this to be factually unsupported. We likewise found no evidence to support Boylan\u2019s claims. The only point where we even purported to apply \u00a770-17-112, MCA, was in granting costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the Van Dykes as the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Boylan, </em>247 Mont. at 267, 806 P.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b663 The second case, relied on heavily by the Court, is <em>Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, 298 Mont. 116, 993 P.2d 701. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, 19, 25, 31. As author of the <em>Engel </em>opinion, however, I can state with assurance that we did <em>not, </em>in that case, address the arguments under consideration here. Contrary to the Court\u2019s insinuations, there was no question raised as to whether an encroachment upon or impairment of a secondary ditch easement violates \u00a770-17-112, MCA, no matter how \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d it is. In fact, the district court in <em>Engel </em>concluded that the Gampps had \u201cencroached upon and impaired\u201d Engel\u2019s secondary easement, and no one disputed that conclusion on appeal. And there certainly was no discussion of whether the encroachment and impairment were \u201cunreasonable\u201d-fehe Court\u2019s misreading of <em>Engel </em>notwithstanding. Indeed, the primary question in the case was whether Engel had \u201cprevailed\u201d on her claims in the district court, thus justifying an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 10. This necessitated a discussion of what her claims were, how the district court analyzed those claims, and whether she prevailed on them-nothing more. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b664 <em>Engel </em>involved a ditch easement which began at the western end of the Gampps\u2019 property and flowed north, northeast, and then east, eventually passing through Engel\u2019s adjacent property. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 12. The issue prompting the litigation concerned Engel\u2019s secondary access easement. There was a footpath along the ditch that was used for such purposes as regulating the head gates, cleaning out the ditch, and routine inspection. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 12. This footpath was Engel\u2019s <em>principal </em>secondary easement for accessing the ditch. The problem was that vehicles could not use this route, and some of the repair and maintenance work required vehicular access. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Engel thus claimed she had an <em>alternate </em>secondary easement which allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>her to drive vehicles across the Gampps\u2019 property. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 17. Engel based this claim on \u2018historic use\u201d; however, she failed to show that she had ever attempted to establish, maintain, or improve a vehicle route over the Gampps\u2019 property. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 44. Furthermore, any such historic use would have involved negotiating a gate, which was usually locked, at the boundary of the Gampps\u2019 property. Engel\u2019s husband had put this gate in place back when the Engels held both their own property and the Gampps\u2019 property in common ownership, and he required that ditch users notify him before accessing the property. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">\u00b665 Accordingly, the district court concluded that Engel\u2019s secondary easement was along the footpath. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 41. The district court rejected her claim of an <em>existing </em>secondary easement across the Gampps\u2019 property based on historic use. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 44. Instead, recognizing that vehicular access to the ditch was occasionally necessary, the district court established a \u2018hew, additional\u201d secondary easement across the Gampps\u2019 property that she could use for this purpose. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 37, 41-44, 46. The district court defined the location and scope of this \u2018hew\u201d easement by what the court thought was reasonably necessary for Engel and not unduly burdensome to the Gampps. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24,44, 50, 52-55. The scope of this \u2018hew\u201d easement <em>included </em>the gate at the boundary of the Gampps\u2019 property. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24,46, 55. Hence, <em>Engel </em>was not a \u201cgate case\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 25) in the sense that a physical obstruction was placed across a formerly unobstructed access route. The gate was always there. It was within the scope of the secondary easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b666 The district court concluded, however, that the Gampps had \u201cencroached upon and impaired\u201d Engel\u2019s secondary easement rights by intimidating and threatening her and by keeping the gate locked when she needed access. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 34, 47. Significantly, there was no discussion whatsoever by the district court as to whether this encroachment and impairment was \u201cunreasonable\u201d or \u201cminimal.\u201d Nor was there any discussion by this Court as to whether the Gampps\u2019 conduct amounted to \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d with Engel\u2019s secondary easement. The fact of the impediments was sufficient to violate the statute. <em>See Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b667 The Court\u2019s entire discussion (in the present case) of\u2018the common law\u201d of easements is premised on our citations in <em>Engel </em>to <em>Laden v. Atkeson, </em>112 Mont. 302, 116 P.2d 881 (1941), and <em>Gabriel v. Wood, </em>261 Mont. 170, 862 P.2d 42 (1993). Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. As an initial matter, it should be noted that the Court misstates our citation to <em>Gabriel </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>Engel. </em>In <em>Gabriel, </em>which involved an obstruction to a primary-easement (an ingress/egress road), we said that \u201ca gate may be constructed across the easement if it . . . does not interfere with reasonable use of the right-of-way.\u201d 261 Mont, at 177, 862 P.2d at 46. The Court, at \u00b6 15 of the Opinion, quotes part of this language, but changes the word \u201ca gate\u201d to \u201cany obstruction of an easement\u201d (a dubious rewriting of <em>Gabriel </em>in itself), italicizes the word \u201creasonable\u201d for added emphasis, and then, shockingly, attributes this passage as \u201cour observation\u201d in <em>Engel. </em>However, we did not \u201cobserve\u201d in <em>Engel </em>that \u201cany obstruction of an easement must not interfere with <em>reasonable </em>use of the right-of-way.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15 (emphasis in original, internal quotation marks omitted). This is a blatant rewriting of that case. The proposition for which we cited <em>Gabriel </em>in <em>Engel </em>was this: \u201ca servient owner may maintain a locked gate across an easement so long as it does not \u2018interfere with the use and right reserved to the dominant tenement or estate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 50 (quoting <em>Gabriel, </em>261 Mont. at 176, 862 P.2d at 45). Contrary to the Court\u2019s discussion at \u00b6 15 of the Opinion, we did not qualify the word \u201cinterfere\u201d with the word \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b668 More importantly, our citations to <em>Laden </em>and <em>Gabriel </em>in <em>Engel </em>concerned the rules for defining the location and scope of a secondary easement in the first instance. We did not cite <em>Laden </em>or <em>Gabriel </em>for the Court\u2019s proposition here that \u2018the common law\u201dcontrols over the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA. Engel had complained that the district court should have enjoined the Gampps from interfering with her alternate secondary easement. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48, 50. Recall that the district court had only just determined the parameters of that \u2018hew\u201d easement within the context of the <em>Engel </em>case. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 42. We noted, however, that Ttjhere is substantial evidence that Engel\u2019s access for routine inspections and maintenance is, and always has been, \u2018free and uninterrupted,\u2019 contrary to her assertion on appeal.\u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 50. Then, after citing <em>Gabriel </em>for the foregoing proposition (that a servient owner may maintain a locked gate across an easement, so long as it does not interfere with the use and right reserved to the dominant tenement), we observed that the district court had fashioned Engel\u2019s \u2018hew\u201d secondary easement for vehicular access, with the allowance for a locked gate, so that the Gampps would not be unreasonably burdened. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b669 In other words-and this is the critical aspect of <em>Engel </em>that is apparently lost on the Court today-the gate and the fact that it could be locked were an integral component of Engel\u2019s alternate secondary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>easement. Engel could not claim interference with her easement based on the locked gate for the simple reason that she never had the right to unfettered access in the first place. Of course, the Gampps were required to unlock the gate upon receiving notice that Engel needed to access the ditch over their property. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 52. But a careful reading of <em>Engel </em>shows that our discussion at \u00b6\u00b6 50-52 stands for the unremarkable proposition that a gate, which is kept locked except when Engel serves notice that she needs access, is an inherent limitation on her alternate secondary easement. This is an important distinction from the present case, where the culvert and bridge were never an inherent limitation on MRC\u2019s secondary ditch easement. Rather, MRC\u2019s easement-the validity of which is not in dispute, and the location of scope of which are not at issue-entities MRC to an obstructed ditch, the entire length of which can be maintained with a bulldozer as established through prescriptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\">\u00b670 Accordingly, there are two points to be understood about <em>Engel. </em>First, we did not hold that some interference with a ditch easement is acceptable under the statute while other interference is not, depending on what we think is \u201creasonable.\u201d We were not presented with that argument. Moreover, Engel\u2019s claim of \u2018interference\u201d had no merit anyway, given that the access restrictions about which she complained were within the scope of her \u201cnew\u201d alternate secondary easement as fashioned by the district court. Second, we did not hold, or even intimate, in <em>Engel </em>that the touchstone of analysis under \u00a770-17-112(2), MCA, is \u201cunreasonable interference.\u201dRather, the Court today manufactures that proposition out of whole cloth, despite the unambiguous statutory prohibition against encroachments and impairments <em>of any kind.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b671 In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Court, at \u00b6 23, summarily dismisses two precedents that contradict its approach here. In <em>Kephart v. Portmann, </em>259 Mont. 232, 855 P.2d 120 (1993), after the Portmanns exercised their right to enter, repair, and maintain their ditch under \u00a770-17-112(1), MCA, the Kepharts filed suit and thereby forced the Portmanns into court to defend the existence of the ditch right and corresponding secondary easement. We held that \u201cthe Kepharts\u2019 lawsuit constituted an impairment of the Portmanns\u2019 easement under \u00a770-17-112(2), MCA.\u201d <em>Kephart, </em>259 Mont. at 239, 855 P.2d at 124. The words \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d appear nowhere in our decision. Likewise, in <em>Byrum v. Andren, </em>2007 MT 107, 337 Mont. 167, 159 P.3d 1062, after the easement holders accessed their ditch for maintenance purposes, the Byrums filed suit alleging trespass. We held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>filing of the trespass claim \u2018impaired and interfered\u201d with the easement holders\u2019 rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. <em>Byrum, </em>\u00b6 50. Nowhere did we analyze whether this impairment and interference was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d The fact of impairment and interference was enough-as the statute contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b672 The Court contends that our reasoning in Byrum, \u00b6 46, is contrary to the statute\u2019s \u2018hard-and-fast\u201d rule. Opinion, \u00b6 31. Again, as author of the <em>Byrum </em>opinion, I can state with assurance that we did <em>not, </em>in that case, address the arguments under consideration here. Moreover, what we held in the cited paragraph of <em>Byrum </em>was simply this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Respondents allege physical interference [with their ditch rights], namely that Byrums had continually confronted Respondents while they attempted to maintain the Ditch, blocked Respondents from accessing the headgate, and verbally harassed Respondents. The District Court found that the Byrums had not denied Respondents access to the headgate and had not prevented water from being conveyed down the Ditch. Testimony from trial indicates that the Byrums did occasionally block Respondents from using the headgates on the Ditch, but that the Byrums eventually allowed access. Evidence in the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Byrums did not physically deny Respondents\u2019 access to the headgate. The court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous in this regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\"><em>Byrum, </em>\u00b6 46. We were not presented with and did not address the question whether some interference is reasonable while other interference is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b673 But even if it <em>could </em>be said that <em>Byrum, </em>or any of our other cases, is authority for the Court\u2019s approach of engrafting language onto a clear and unambiguous statute (which I do not believe to be the case), then our cases are wrong and should be corrected, not perpetuated. <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300 HW]e cannot reconcile our duty to apply legislation as written with the decisions in these [prior] cases. We accordingly expressly overrule [the prior cases].\u201d). As Winston Churchill is reported to have said: \u2018If you simply take up the attitude of defending a mistake, there will be no hope of improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b674 In sum, the Court cherry-picks and misquotes language from a variety of cases-most of which have nothing to do with ditch easements4o justify its foray into \u201cthe common law\u201d and its application of an \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d standard in lieu of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>statutory \u2018bo encroachment or impairment\u201d standard. The fact is that none of the foregoing cases is authority for the Court\u2019s holding that an encroachment upon or impairment of a ditch easement is permissible, notwithstanding \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA, if the encroachment or impairment interferes reasonably with the easement holder\u2019s rights. More to the point, none of our cases stand for the proposition that we may dilute the clear and unqualified statutory standard in favor of our own subjective \u201creasonableness\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u2018Public Policy\u201d and \u2018Balancing\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b675 As a final matter, I cannot agree with basing our decision on what we think is the better \u201cpublic policy.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. On the subject of ditch easements, the Legislature has spoken. It has taken the decision out of our hands and has set the standard that is to apply. <em>See </em>\u00a71-2-103, MCA. \u2018No person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation ....\u201d Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. Whether there is interference, and whether that inference is unreasonable, is not part of the statutory calculus and, thus, is not relevant. I would simply apply the plain language of the statute, not try to improve upon it based on our own notions of what is good \u201cpublic policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b676 For the same reason, I cannot agree with the premise that we must \u201cbalance\u201dproperty rights in this case. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 18,19,25. There is no \u2018balancing\u201d for the courts to do when a party holds a ditch easement. The Legislature has already struck the \u2018balance\u201dthat it has determined is appropriate: no person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation, period. We are wrong to tweak this language by inserting a \u2018balancing\u201d requirement where the Legislature has already decided that the balance weighs in favor of the irrigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b677 In this regard, the Court\u2019s statement that \u201cJoukova cannot be deprived of her rights to use her land currently accessed via the rock bridge,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30, is simply wrong; of course she can. Joukova bought her land in 2006 subject not only to MRC\u2019s preexisting ditch easement, but also to Montana statutory law which states that \u201c[n]o person\u201d-Joukova included-inay encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation.\u201d Section 70-17-112(2), MCA. Hence, Joukova never even had, in the first place, a right to use her land in any manner that involved encroaching upon or otherwise impairing MRC\u2019s easement rights. Indeed, most of Joukova\u2019s problems are of her own making and her ignoring the remedy which the statute provides. She should not now be heard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>complain. As we stated over 60 years ago,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">[i]t is a rather specious argument to say that the [servient landowner] may not use this land as it desires to do, because of the burden imposed by the [easement] and therefore the burden must be lightened. One may not invade the property rights of another and justify or attempt to excuse or explain such legal wrong because of the need. The answer thereto is that the [servient landowner] knew of the limitations imposed on this property at the time it purchased, so it is assumed the [servient landowner] received what it paid for. If it desires the full unrestricted fee another conveyance is called for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><em>City of Missoula v. Mix, </em>123 Mont. 365, 372, 214 P.2d 212, 216 (1950). \u201cBalancing\u201d of Joukova\u2019s rights is simply inapplicable to this case. She received what she paid for: land that is burdened by a ditch easement which she may not encroach upon or otherwise impair. If she can figure out how to use her land without violating MRC\u2019s ditch easements, she is free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b678 In conclusion, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s analysis. As a matter of undisputed fact, the Court acknowledges that we are dealing with an \u201cobstruction\u201dthat constitutes an \u201cencroachment\u201dupon MRC\u2019s ditch easement and that \u2018impairs\u201dMRC\u2019s secondary easement rights. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 29. That is the end of the inquiry. Joukova\u2019s rock bridge and culvert violate the statute and must be removed. Whether the bridge and culvert \u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d with the ditch easement (passim), whether such interference is \u2018ho more than necessary to achieve a reasonable balance of the parties\u2019 property rights\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 25), whether the bridge and culvert constitute a \u201cmajor\u201d imposition on MRC\u2019s maintenance activities (Opinion, \u00b6 24), whether the bridge and culvert cause \u201cmaterial inconvenience\u201dto MRC (Opinion, \u00b6 29), whether the bridge and culvert were \u201cexpensive\u201d to install (Opinion, \u00b6 26), and whether the bridge and culvert are \u201cdifficult\u201d to remove (Opinion, \u00b6 26) are all totally and completely irrelevant. The statute is violated by virtue of the encroachment and impairment. End of story.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b679 But instead of enforcing the plain and unambiguous language that the Legislature has chosen, the Court has modified that language to allow for \u201cinterference\u201d that is \u201creasonable.\u201d Effectively, what the Court has done is reintroduce into the law of ditch easements a subjective \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry that the Legislature specifically removed from the analysis of encroachments and impairments upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ditch easements entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">\u00b680 And, lest there be any doubt, the Court\u2019s \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d approach is not limited to secondary easements. As the Court states at \u00b6 15, \u201cwe apply the same analysis whether the case concerns primary or secondary easement rights.\u201d What this means is that had MRC objected that Joukova\u2019s culvert and rock bridge violate MRC\u2019s <em>primary </em>easement (which they do, by virtue of encroaching upon the ditch), MRC would still have to show that this encroachment \u201cunreasonably interferes\u201d with its easement rights because, as the Court states at \u00b6 27, \u201cts]ome permanent encroachments may not justify a finding of unreasonable interference.\u201d This is so deliberately contrary to the statutory mandate as to be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b681 From a broader perspective, in its attempt to \u2018balance\u201d property rights and create its own \u201cpublic policy,\u201d the Court has now placed farmers and ranchers who depend on irrigation rights and the ability to access and maintain irrigation ditches-the life\u2019s blood of their operations-in an untenable position. As a result of today\u2019s Opinion, a servient landowner no longer needs to meet with the holder of a canal or ditch easement in order to negotiate the easement holder\u2019s written consent to the desired encroachment or impairment (see \u00a770-17-112(3), MCA). Instead, the servient landowner can simply encroach upon and impair the ditch easement at will, so long as she does not \u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b682 There is no reason, much less any legal basis, why owners of canal or ditch easements should have to defend, as they henceforth must, their statutory easement rights from the \u2018interference\u201d (reasonable or otherwise) of every hobby rancher with 20 acres and a horse. In this regard, I agree with MRC\u2019s observations in its reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">The statute does not allow for any encroachments or impairments without written permission for good reason. Under the District Court\u2019s \u201cminimal\u201dstandard [and now this Court\u2019s \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d standard], any landowner through which a canal is located may employ self-help by changing the character of a ditch without court approval, or at a bare minimum, permission of the easement holders. Based on the District Court\u2019s holding [and now this Court\u2019s holding], a landowner may install an obstruction in a ditch without permission. The ditch owner\u2019s only recourse is to go to court and file suit to have the obstruction removed. This \u201cshoot first, ask forgiveness later\u201d method of self-help was not contemplated by the Legislature in \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. This is especially evident in the fact the Legislature prescribed a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>method for obtaining a ditch owner\u2019s permission to impair or encroach the ditch owner\u2019s secondary easement rights. Section 70-17-112(3), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b683 While the majority admonishes this Dissent that the law obliges dominant and servient landowners \u201cto be reasonable with one another,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 31, the failing of the Court is its intransigent refusal to recognize that the law requires no such thing. Indeed, the overriding obligation of dominant and servient landowners is, first, to each follow the law! Here, MRC followed the law in exercising its easement rights in the manner it had for over 60 years. Joukova, on the other hand, had her statutory remedy-obtaining written consent from MRC for her encroachment upon their ditch easement and the corresponding impairment of their secondary easement-and she blatantly ignored that process. Joukova thumbed her nose at \u00a7 70-17-112(3), MCA, and arrogantly planted her culvert and rock bridge squarely in the middle of the irrigation ditch that MRC depended upon for the life\u2019s blood of its haying and cattle operations. So much for reasonableness!</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b684 The majority drapes itself in the mantle of history-er, more accurately, revisionist history. In point of fact, until today, Montana\u2019s farmers, ranchers, and irrigators were not burdened with the necessity of having to shut down their seasonal ditch maintenance operations to deal with and, ultimately, litigate with hobby ranchers, second-home owners, the rich and famous, and others who blatantly flout the statute that the Legislature enacted to prevent precisely the conduct which this Court now decrees must be reasonably accommodated in the interests of neighborly harmony. A more wrong-headed and perverse result is difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b685 At the risk of its inaction being deemed by this Court as agreement with our decision in this case (Opinion, \u00b6 14), it will, no doubt, be left to the next session of the Legislature to amend \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, to make it <em>even more </em>clear and plain that \u2018ho encroachment\u201d and \u2018ho impairment\u201d really does mean \u2018ho encroachment\u201d and \u2018ho impairment\u201d and that there are not implicit exceptions for encroachments and impairments that the courts and servient landowners believe \u2018interfere reasonably\u201d with the ditch owner\u2019s rights. In that respect, at least, I suspect that the lobby for farmers, ranchers, and irrigators is a good deal more dynamic than whatever the hobbyists will be able to put up.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b686 While I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse the District Court, I otherwise strenuously dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-4\"> <em>See Evans v.
