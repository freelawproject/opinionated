We find the following issue dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b62 <em>Whether the District Court erred by failing to provide a detailed statement of the facts upon which it found L.L.A. to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b63 On February 14,2011, the State of Montana petitioned, pursuant to \u00a753-21-121, MCA, for L.L.A.\u2019s involuntary commitment to MSH. The State\u2019s petition recounted information from reports submitted by certified mental health professionals Carleen Grussling and Fred Huskey, describing several instances of L.L.A.\u2019s bizarre behavior. These events included L.L.A. swinging a frying pan at her father\u2019s groin because she believed he was \u201craping her through the air waves,\u201d burning kitchen chairs and starting clothes on fire in the bathtub due to \u2018bio-terrorism,\u201d throwing wine on her parents and the walls of their home to \u2018baptize\u201d them, and claiming her mother and father were \u2018imposters\u201d or \u201cevil twins\u201d of her parents. Both Grussling and Huskey were of the opinion that L.L.A. suffered from the mental disorder of Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type, and recommended she be committed to MSH.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b64 On February 17, 2011, the District Court held a hearing on the petition. L.L.A.\u2019s father testified and related the events stated in the petition along with other information raising concern about her mental health. Huskey, who had reviewed L.L.A.\u2019s clinical history and examined her before the hearing, testified that her responses during the evaluation suggested paranoid delusions and offered implausible explanations for her behavior. For example, L.L.A. believed a former classmate and his family lived underneath her family\u2019s home. L.L.A. gathered a \u201csurvival packet\u201d of supplies for them, including lit candles, and threw it underneath the house. Huskey diagnosed L.L.A. with a Psychotic Disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), noting the need to rule out Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder because \u201cthere may be indications of the possibility, but we need more information and more observation[.]\u201d L.L.A. told Huskey and testified at the hearing that she did not believe she was mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b65 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court orally made brief findings and pronounced L.L.A. would be committed to MSH for a period not to exceed 90 days. The State then indicated it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>prepare a commitment order and have it ready for the court in \u201c[l]ess than ten minutes.\u201d The District Court\u2019s written order contained seven findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">1. Respondent has been advised of Respondent\u2019s rights and appropriate notices have been given as required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">2. Respondent suffers from mental disorders as defined by \u00a753-21-102(9), M.C.A., specifically diagnosed as Psychotic Disorder NOS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">3. Respondent is in need of commitment as defined by \u00a753-21-126, M.C.A. in that Respondent\u2019s mental disorder has resulted in recent acts or omissions which make her unable to protect her life and safety. Further, Respondent\u2019s mental disorder is treatable with a reasonable prospect of success, and will, if untreated, predictably result in further deterioration of Respondent\u2019s mental condition which will create an imminent threat to Respondent and/or others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">4. The Respondent is either unable to or unwilling to consent to treatment so Respondent requires commitment at the Montana State Hospital for up to ninety (90) days unless sooner released as determined appropriate by the staff at the State Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">5. Of the treatment alternatives available and investigated by the Professional Person, commitment to the Montana State Hospital offers the least-restrictive environment for the needs of the Respondent, and other possible alternatives, including out-patient treatment, are not suitable, based upon the Respondent\u2019s refusal and/or inability to accept treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">6. The Professional Person has recommended involuntary medication of the Respondent if necessary to protect the Respondent and to facilitate effective treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">7. If discharged from the Montana State Hospital prior to the expiration of the commitment period, Respondent would benefit from community treatment and aftercare, including case management services, to assist with monitoring Respondent\u2019s mental health condition and medication, facilitating treatment, and finding housing and employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\u00b66 On appeal, L.L.A. claims the District Court erred in making insufficient findings of fact supporting her commitment. She argues the requirements of \u00a753-21-127(8)(a), MCA, were not followed and, as a result, the order committing her to MSH must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b67 Whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact meet the statutory-requirements is a question of law which we review for correctness. <em>In re Mental Health ofE.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 5, 339 Mont. 107,168 P.3d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred by failing to provide a detailed statement of the facts upon which it found L.L.A. to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b69 The procedural requirements for an involuntary commitment are prescribed in \u00a7\u00a753-21-126 an(j 127, MCA. This Court consistently has emphasized the need for strict compliance with statutory requirements in involuntary commitment proceedings. <em>In re Mental Health ofL.K.S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100; <em>In reA.K, </em>2006 MT 166, \u00b6 14, 332 Mont. 511,139 P.3d 849; <em>In re </em>C.R.C., 2004 MT 389, \u00b6 16, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065; <em>In re Mental Health of S.J., </em>231 Mont. 353, 355, 753 P.2d 319, 320 (1988). We have stressed the laws \u201care of critical importance because of the \u2018calamitous effect of a commitment,\u2019 including loss of liberty and damage to a person\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of </em>T.J.D., 2002 MT 24, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 222, 226, 41 P.3d 323 (citing <em>In re Mental Health ofRM., </em>270 Mont 40, 44, 889 P.2d 1201, 1204 (1995)); <em>In re Shennum, </em>210 Mont. 442, 450-51, 684 P.2d 1073, 1078 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u00b610 On a petition for involuntary commitment, the court must first determine whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder. If the court so finds, it then considers whether commitment is necessary based on the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of respondent\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health or safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. Once the court concludes commitment is required, \u00a753-21-127(8)(a), MCA, mandates the court\u2019s order contain \u201ca detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d L.L.A. asserts the District Court\u2019s findings were insufficient because they merely recited the language of \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA, and did not address any facts specific to L.L.A. The State responds with three separate arguments: 1) the findings were adequate, 2) L.L.A. is precluded from challenging the findings on appeal because she did not give the District Court an opportunity to correct them, and 3) even if the findings were insufficient, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b611  We have held \u201cconclusory statements of statutory criteria\u201d do not \u201cconstitute strict compliance with the statutory mandate of \u00a753-21-127(8)(a), MCA.\u201d <em>E.P.B., </em>\u00b6 13. Here, the District Court\u2019s order contains no indication of the facts upon which it found that, because of her mental disorder, L.L.A. is substantially unable to protect her life and safety or that imminent threat of injury to herself or others will result if she is left untreated. Citing <em>In re Mental Health of O.R.B., </em>2008 MT 301, 345 Mont. 516,191 P.3d 482, and In <em>re Mental Health of L.R., </em>2010 MT 76, 356 Mont. 20, 231 P.3d 594, the State asserts the court\u2019s factual findings were sufficient because they are similar to those we have upheld in previous cases. Both of those cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b612 In <em>O.R.B., </em>the trial court entered nineteen findings of fact in its commitment order and each was supported by evidence presented from the commitment hearing. \u00b6 20. The court\u2019s oral findings also included four pages of transcript in which it \u201cmeticulously reviewed the testimony received in support of each finding of fact.\u201d <em>O.R.B., </em>\u00b6 21. There, the District Court illustrated events and facts specific to the respondent which demonstrated she suffered from a mental disorder and required commitment. <em>O.R.B., </em>\u00b6 21. For instance, the court discussed O.R.B.\u2019s mental status evaluation, her diagnosis, failure to follow through with necessary medical treatment, failure to maintain a proper diet, and her at-risk living conditions. <em>O.R.B., </em>\u00b6 21. In <em>L.R., </em>the District Court also made several findings unique to L.R., including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that she was paranoid, had grandiose thoughts, showed extreme religious ideation, and was suspicious of those trying to help her. <em>L.R., </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b613 The court\u2019s order here enumerated seven \u2018Findings of Fact,\u201d derived almost exclusively from the language of \u00a753-21-126, MCA. The only information specifically reflecting L.L.A.\u2019s circumstances was her diagnosis (Psychotic Disorder [Not Otherwise Specified]), but the order contains no findings reflecting the basis for that determination. In contrast to L.R., there were no findings concerning L.L.A.\u2019s particular behavior and thought processes which supported the conclusions made by the court. Although the findings in <em>L.R. </em>were minimally sufficient for the statutory requirements of \u00a7 53-21-127, MCA, they at least included some findings specific to L.R.\u2019s actual behavior demonstrating why she required commitment. <em>L.R., </em>\u00b6 21. The findings in this case lack any such references.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b614 For example, the State contends the following findings are sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements: \u2018Respondent\u2019s mental disorder has resulted in recent acts or omissions which make her unable to protect her life and safety,\u201d and that lack of treatment would \u201cpredictably result in further deterioration of [her] mental condition which will create an imminent threat to her and/or others.\u201d These statements do not describe facts particular to L.L.A., however, but conclusions. While the court did find that L.L.A. was \u201cunable or unwilling to consent to treatment,\u201d the order contains no information about L.L.A.\u2019s behavior demonstrating she was unable to protect herself or the basis for its determination that her unwillingness to obtain treatment would result in imminent danger to herself or others. We have held such a \u201cconclusory restatement of the statutory criteria\u201d is insufficient to comply with the requirement for a detailed statement of facts. <em>In re G.M., </em>2007 MT 100, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 116,157 P.3d 687.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">\u00b615 In <em>E.P.B., </em>we noted it appeared the deputy county attorney had prepared the commitment order for the court before the hearing had even commenced. \u00b6 12. We expressed concern for employing this method in involuntary commitments, noting the numerous rights implicated by the proceedings. E.P.B., \u00b6 12. We stated, \u2018[i]n a different case, adoption of a petitioner\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions might be appropriate in light of the evidence presented, but district courts must-at the very least-ensure that such \u2018prepared\u2019 orders comply with statutory mandates.\u201d <em>E.P.B., </em>\u00b6 12. Here, based on the record, it likewise appears the State hastily prepared proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>findings of fact, which the District Court adopted without assuring compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b616 The State nonetheless contends L.L.A. is precluded from challenging the District Court\u2019s findings because she did not provide the court with notice and an opportunity to correct its error. In support of this assertion, the State cites <em>In re </em>D.D., 277 Mont. 164, 920 P.2d 973 (1996). There, the District Court\u2019s commitment order \u2018found that D. D. had received the benefit of all applicable statutory and constitutional rights and was seriously mentally ill and in need of further evaluation and treatment.\u201d <em>D.D., </em>277 Mont. at 167,920 P.2d at 975. In support of its order, the court attached the written report of a doctor who had evaluated D.D. and testified during the hearing. D.D., 277 Mont. at 167, 920 P.2d at 975. On appeal, D.D. argued the District Court\u2019s order was inadequate under M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (1995), which required the court to \u2018find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d We affirmed the commitment order, in part because D.D. did not give the District Court an opportunity to correct its error. <em>D.D., </em>277 Mont. at 169, 920 P.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b617 The 1995 version of the commitment statute at issue in <em>D.D. </em>did not contain language identical to that now present. It provided: \u2018The court shall enter into the record a detailed statement of the facts upon which it found the respondent to be seriously mentally ill and, if the court authorized involuntary medication, of the facts upon which it found involuntary medication to be necessary.\u201d Section 53-21-127(2)(c), MCA (1995). As noted above, the current statute requires the court\u2019s findings of fact to include a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court determined the respondent <em>requires commitment. </em>Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA (2009). Our decision in <em>D.D. </em>was not based on the statutory requirements that are controlling in this case. Since that case was decided, we have applied the language of the current statute and we have never faulted a respondent for failing to ensure a district court\u2019s findings were sufficient to order commitment. <em>G.M., </em>\u00b6 22; <em>E. P.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13; <em>L.R., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-23. Moreover, we have held that M. R. Civ. P. 52(b) does not require a party to seek amendment as a precondition to appeal the insufficiency of a court\u2019s findings. <em>In re Marriage of Metcalf, </em>183 Mont. 266, 269-70, 598 P.2d 1140, 1142 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b618 Therefore, <em>D.D. </em>is not apposite to the extent it relied on the respondent\u2019s failure to raise the deficiencies in the findings of fact at the district court level pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 52(a), and it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>provide ground to assert waiver of the requirement for a detailed statement of facts in \u00a753-21-127(8)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b619 Finally, the State argues that, even if deficiencies in the District Court\u2019s findings of fact rendered the order inadequate, it was harmless error because the record contained sufficient evidence to support the commitment. In <em>In re R.J.W., 226 </em>Mont. 419, 424, 736 P.2d 110, 113 (1987), we did apply harmless error review to the district court\u2019s factual findings but warned courts to comply with the statutory requirements in the future:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">Given the detail in the record as a whole, we find that this was harmless to appellant under the facts here. Future findings of fact should more carefully detail the factual basis on which a finding of serious mental illness is premised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In D.D., we affirmed the district court both because the respondent did not seek specific findings of fact at the trial court level and the deficiencies in the commitment order constituted harmless error; however, we again emphasized \u201cwe do not recommend the shortcut method used by the District Court in this case[.]\u201d 277 Mont. at 169,920 P.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b620 Since our decisions in both those cases, we have firmly enforced the statutory requirements for involuntary commitment proceedings. <em>L.K.S., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-26; <em>In re D.L.T., </em>2003 MT 46, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 18, 314 Mont. 297, 67 P.3d 189 <em>(overruled on other grounds by Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727); <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 16; AJE, \u00b6\u00b6 11,14; <em>G.M., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-22, <em>E.P.B., </em>\u00b6 13. In <em>G.M., </em>we specifically emphasized our language in <em>R.J.W. </em>instructing district courts to provide more carefully detailed statements of fact. As a result, we declined to apply harmless error to the deficient factual findings in that case. <em>G.M., </em>\u00b6 21. While we have found errors harmless in involuntary commitment proceedings after D.D. and <em>R.J.W., </em>those errors did not amount to violation of the specific statutory mandates for ordering an involuntary commitment. <em>See e.g. O.R.B., </em>\u00b6 30 (District Court failed to ensure professional person\u2019s recommendation was included in his written report); <em>In re A.S.B., </em>2008 MT 82, \u00b6 36, 342 Mont. 169,180P.3d625 (District Court erred by incorporating hearsay from a report into its order).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b621 Our adherence to the statutory scheme for involuntary commitment is not a matter of elevating form over substance. Findings of fact serve an important purpose. They \u2018inform the court of appeals of the basis of the judgment.\u201d <em>In re Marriage ofBartsch, </em>2007 MT 136, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 386, 162 P.3d 72. They are of particular necessity in commitment cases because the order of commitment apprises the receiving staff at MSH, treatment professionals, and even law enforcement who may be involved in transporting the patient, of the particular condition and behaviors that prompted hospitalization or gave rise to the need for commitment. The statute\u2019s express requirement for a detailed statement furthers that purpose and we therefore decline to apply harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b622 Since we are reversing the commitment order on this ground, we need not address L.L.A.\u2019s additional arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b623  We hold the District Court erred in failing to provide a detailed statement of facts supporting its commitment order as required by \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA. Accordingly, the order involuntarily committing L.L.A. is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
