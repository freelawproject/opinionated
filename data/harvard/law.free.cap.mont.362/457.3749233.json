Following a non-jury trial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and a Decree of Dissolution, dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage and distributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>all property. Karen appeals, and Dan cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s property distribution. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b62 Karen and Dan were married in 1989. They first separated in 1998; Karen petitioned for dissolution in early 1999. The couple reconciled in 2000 and moved to dismiss the pending dissolution. However, Karen again petitioned for dissolution in 2008. The District Court held hearings on the matter on May 11 and July 9, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b63 At the time of marriage, Dan was an employee of the State of Montana. He eventually attained an administrator position that paid approximately $82,000 per year. He was terminated from that position in January 2010, but continues to work another position with the State of Montana earning approximately $37,800 annually. He has a master\u2019s degree in security studies from the Naval Postgraduate School. Karen has worked occasionally during the marriage, but has spent the majority of the near 19 years of marriage as a homemaker. At the time of the hearing, Karen was working part time at a local ranch. Karen has a high school education and relative lack of employment skills due to her employment history. Karen and Dan have two adult children; a child support order is not subject to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b64 Through his employment, Dan has a State of Montana Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS) defined benefit plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties agree that Dan has over 22 years of service credit and was 53 years old at the time of trial. Karen sought one-half of the marital portion of the PERS account as retirement income. Dan sought to be awarded the entire retirement account and contended the value of the account was limited to the amount of his contributions plus interest. The District Court found that Karen should be entitled to 50 percent of the marital portion of the pension, taking into consideration that the parties were married for almost 19 years, and that Karen has limited employment skills and no other retirement accounts. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Court ordered Karen\u2019s counsel to prepare a Family Law Order to effect this division. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-2-907, MCA. The marital duration for calculation purposes was held to be 18 years, 10 months and 19 days.</p>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">\u00b65 As part of the marital estate the District Court also divided a Glacier County, Montana, property that was purchased from Karen\u2019s brothers for $25,000 in 2000. The District Court determined that valuation was not necessary because \u2018Dan has suggested that the parcel be awarded 160 acres to Karen ... and 80 acres to Dan....\u201dDan contends on appeal that he only suggested this division with the understanding that \u2018Karen would not receive any proceeds of his PERS retirement account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b66 The District Court also awarded Karen $75,000 from the ordered sale of the family\u2019s Wylie Drive home, seemingly to reflect that the prior family home-sold to purchase this one-had been a gift from Karen\u2019s father. The family\u2019s previous home was deeded to Karen by her father in 2001. They resided in the home until its sale in 2004, with Dan\u2019s earnings contributing to the support of the family and maintenance of the property during this time. When this home was sold, the proceeds were deposited in the couple\u2019s joint bank account and contributed to the purchase of the Wylie Drive home. The District Court denied Dan\u2019s claim for reimbursement of $13,635.20 in expenditures he claims to have made on improvements to the Wylie Drive home while he occupied it for a month during the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">\u00b67 Karen raises two issues on appeal which we restate as follows: did the District Court\u2019s order provide for an equitable division of the Dan\u2019s PERS retirement plan, and did the District Court err in its distribution of the Glacier County Property? Dan cross-appeals the distribution of the Glacier County property in light of the District Court\u2019s award to Karen of a portion of his PERS account. He also appeals the $75,000 awarded to Karen from the proceeds of the ordered sale of the Wylie Drive home and the denial of his claimed reimbursement of $13,635.20. We state the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\n<em>\u00b68 Did the District Court err in its application of the law regarding division of Dan\u2019s retirement account?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b69 Section 40-4-202, MCA, governs the distribution of a marital estate. The District Court is vested with broad discretion to apportion the marital estate in a manner equitable to each party under the circumstances. <em>In re Marriage of Swanson, </em>2004 MT 124, \u00b6 12, 321 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Mont. 250, 90 P.3d 418. We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Monroe v. Marsden, </em>2009 MT 137, \u00b6 20, 350 Mont. 327, 207 P.3d 320. \u201cAbsent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property and award of maintenance unless we identify an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re Marriage ofCrilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 10,329 Mont. 479, 124 P.3d 1151. Although the district court may equally divide the marital assets, an even distribution is not mandated by \u00a740-4-202, MCA. <em>In re Marriage of Harris, </em>2006 MT 63, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 368,132 P.3d 502. As we have stated previously, each case must be looked at individually, with an eye to its unique circumstances. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b610 This Court has long held that pension plans are part of the marital estate. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 21. The question is how to equitably divide such plans. This Court has noted that \u201csuch assets contain numerous contingencies, thereby avoiding categorical formulas.\u201d <em>Rolfe v. Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. 294,296, 766 P.2d 223,225 (1988). The District Court order contains the following division of Dan\u2019s PERS account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">Karen is entitled to receive a withdrawal of 50 percent of the marital portion of Dan\u2019s vested account balance in the State of Montana Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS) Defined Benefit Plan as of the date of separation, May 6, 2008, plus regular interest earned on that amount from May 6, 2008, until the date of withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b611 Dan contends that this means 50 percent, plus interest, of the marital portion of the $87,801.25 that the account would be worth if he were to liquidate it in its entirety today. Karen contends that she should have been awarded 50 percent of the marital portion of Dan\u2019s benefits, whatever they may turn out to be in the future. The amount in play given these varying interpretations is demonstrated by Dan\u2019s 2008 PERS annual statement, which placed his contributions at the time the document was generated at $60,254.69, but estimated the lifetime value of his plan starting at age 60 based upon these contributions at $874,620.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b612 We recognize two methods for establishing the value of pension plans: (1) the present value method (lump sum distribution); and (2) the time rule method (deferred distribution). <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 21. The present value method enables parties to determine and distribute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>value of the pension at the time of divorce in a lump sum. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 22. \u201cWith a defined benefit plan, courts usually use actuarial and investment data to help assess the appropriate value and then discount it to a present value.\u201d Susan J. Prather, <em>Comments, Characterization, Valuation, and Distribution of Pensions at Divorce, </em>15 J. Am. Acad. Matrim. Law. 443, 456 (1998). \u2018This method is preferred when the pension can be adequately valued and sufficient assets (either cash or property) exist in the marital estate to offset the present value of the non-employee spouse\u2019s portion of the pension.\u201d Prather, <em>Comments, Characterization, Valuation, and Distribution of Pensions at Divorce </em>at 455. Contrary to Dan\u2019s contention, there is no legal authority for using the amount paid in as of a particular date as this value. <em>In re Marriage ofSirucek, </em>219 Mont. 334,341,712 P.2d 769, 773 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b613 One drawback to using the present value method is that fit places the entire risk of forfeiture before maturity on the employee spouse.\u201d <em>Krafick v. Krafick, </em>663 A.2d 365, 374 (Conn. 1995). This is because a plan\u2019s reduced benefit formulation varies significantly due to individual circumstances such as early retirement or disability. <em>See Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. at 297,766 P.2d at 225-226. Another drawback of this method is that the \u201cnon-employee spouse may receive less if the present value is determined to be significantly lower than the value at actual retirement.\u201d Prather, <em>Comments, Characterization, Valuation, and Distribution of Pensions at Divorce </em>at 456. In other words, the amount of the employer and employee\u2019s future contributions to the retirement plan are a factor of continued employment and monthly salary, an amount that cannot be accurately forecasted. <em>See Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. at 297,766 P.2d at 225-226. \u201c[D]ue to various contingencies such as unreliable evidence, future contributions and other speculative factors, determining the present value of pension plans is difficult, thus courts apply the time rule method when the district court defers distribution of the marital portion of the pension until payout of the benefit.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 23.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, neither party submitted actuarial nor investment data in the case at bar, and thus present value distribution is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u00b614 Karen\u2019s briefing requests \u201c50 percent of the marital portion of Dan\u2019s benefits, whatever that may turn out to be in the future.\u201d It also states her belief that Tt]he district court cannot order a withdrawal from Dan\u2019s pension until Dan himself is eligible to receive such payments.\u201d To be sure, it is hard to imagine a scenario where an order to prematurely liquidate a vested pension with this many years of service, and thus incur a large penalty, would not constitute a substantial injustice to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b615 The time rule formula is \u201cused in situations in which the spouse entitled to a retirement benefit has not yet ended employment, so that the retirement benefit is not yet being received.\u201d <em>In re David, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201c\u2018[I]f the court concludes that because of uncertainties affecting the ... maturation of the pension that it should not attempt to divide the present value of pension rights, it can instead award each spouse an appropriate portion of each pension payment as it is paid.\u2019 <em>\u201dRolfe, </em>234 Mont. at 299, 766 P.2d at 226 (quoting <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>544 P.2d 561, 567 (Cal. 1976)). As such, the time rule affords the non-employee spouse \u201cincreases or accruals on his or her interest in the retirement plan because of the delay in receiving that interest.\u201d <em>Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. at 299, 766 P.2d at 226. We described the time rule method in <em>Rolfe, </em>whereby:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">[T]he marital interest is represented by a fraction, the numerator of which is the length of the employee\u2019s service during the marriage, and the denominator is the employee\u2019s total length of service. This fraction is then applied to each benefit payment, lump or periodic, to determine the portion earned during the marriage. Although the extent of the marital interest is determined as of the date of the dissolution, the benefit factors to be applied to the pension credits earned during the marriage are those in effect at retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\"><em>Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. at 298, 766 P.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b616  We find that the time rule method of valuation is appropriate in this case. Dan is continuing to contribute to the plan, and thus the benefit factors (age at retirement, salary and length of service) cannot be applied until retirement. This method does not require expert or actuarial evidence as Dan contends. Rather, as the District Court did here, a determination of the length of the employee\u2019s service during the marriage is all that is required. However, in using the language \u2018Vested account balance... as of the date of separation... until the date of withdrawal,\u201d the District Court has unnecessarily confused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>award, and has created, as this Court stated in <em>Swanson, </em>\u201ca hybrid approach clearly not supported by any Montana or other jurisdiction\u2019s case law.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 24. The District Court\u2019s conclusions of law were not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b617 To properly divide Dan\u2019s pension, the District Court must use the formula this Court adopted in <em>Rolfe </em>to establish the marital value of the pension plan and assign a percentage that Karen is entitled to at the time of payout. Following remand, the District Court will have the discretion to recalculate all remaining issues including the distribution of the Glacier County property.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b618 We reverse the order of the District Court and remand for a new distribution of the marital estate consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"AySt\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\"> State employees become members of the defined benefit plan on the first day of service unless they select membership in the defined contribution plan.
