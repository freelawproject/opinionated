The approved sentence extended to a bad conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for one year, forfeiture of $240.00 per month for 12 months and reduction to airman basic. In our initial decision, <em>United States v. Pickel, </em>3 M.J. 501 (A.F.C.M.R.1977), we set aside the findings of guilty of Specifications 2 and 6 of the Charge for lack of jurisdiction and reassessed the sentence to include a bad conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for ten months, forfeiture of $240.00 per month for ten months and reduction to airman basic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The net result of appellate action has been to reduce the original nine specifications to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the one remaining specification, we find appropriate only so much as provides for a bad conduct discharge and reduction to airman basic.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The findings of guilty of specification 1 and the Charge, and the sentence, as modified, are</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">FORAY, Judge, concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">HERMAN, Judge, absent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-14\">. On 12 July 1977, the Commander, Lowry Technical Training Center, Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, remitted forfeitures in excess of $130.00 per month for ten months. The accused was placed on excess leave on 1 October 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
