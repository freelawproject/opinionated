See <em>United States v. Frangoules, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 317, 52 C.M.R. 28, 1 M.J. 467 (1976); <em>United States v. Mosely, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 173, 51 C.M.R. 392, 1 M.J. 350 (1976); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 169, 51 C.M.R. 388, 1 M.J. 346 (1976); <em>United States v. Axley, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 84, 51 C.M.R. 257, 1 M.J. 265 (1976). Based upon this error, he sentenced appellant based on a maximum of 29 years confinement rather than a correct maximum of 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Appellant, before us, contends that his pleas of guilty were rendered improvident by reason of a misconception as to the maximum imposable sentence to confinement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The Court of Military Appeals has held that a plea of guilty may be improvident if it is predicated upon a substantial misunderstanding on the accused\u2019s part of the maximum punishment imposable. <em>United States v. Harden, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 76, 51 C.M.R. 249, 1 M.J. 258 (1976); <em>United States v. Bowers, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 5, 51 C.M.R. 5, 1 M.J. 200 (1975); <em>United States v. Towns, </em>22 U.S.C.M.A. 600, 48 C.M.R. 224 (1974). However, that Court has not prescribed a \u201cfixed formula by which to determine the magnitude of difference in punishment that would warrant vacating a plea of guilty as improvident.\u201d The Court\u2019s approach has been to apply an elastic standard which can produce different results in seemingly similar cases. <em>Harden, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Looking to the entire record of trial we find that appellant\u2019s overriding concern expressed in his unsworn presentencing testimony was with the prospect of completing his enlistment and ultimately receiving an honorable discharge and not with confinement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find no reason to believe that appellant would not have entered into his pretrial agreement and pled guilty pursuant thereto had he known the proper maximum period of confinement. Furthermore, the limitations upon the sentence the convening authority was permitted to approve, further reduce the impact of appellant\u2019s misapprehension of the maximum allowable confinement. In any event, because appellant was sentenced under such a misapprehension by the trial judge, we will reassess.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">The findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>above-indicated error and the entire record, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Judge DeFORD concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. As this case was tried before 2 July 1976, the decision in <em>United States v. Courtney, </em>23 U.S.C.M.A. 280, 51 C.M.R. 796, 1 M.J. 438 (1976) is not applicable. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>3 M.J. 101 (CMA 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. Any question as to the period of suspension was resolved when the convening authority approved only so much of the sentence as provides for a dishonorable discharge, confinement at hard labor for 24 months, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\">. Chief Judge Fletcher concurring in <em>Harden, supra, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. at page 78, 51 C.M.R. at page 251, 1 M.J. at page 260, views a miscalculation of the maximum period of confinement which approaches 100 percent as \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-14\">. This conclusion is supported by the following questions by trial defense counsel and appellant\u2019s answers thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">\u201cQ: Whatever punishment you receive in this case what\u2019s your most important goal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At-\">A: To continue active service, sir. I\u2019d very much like to stay in the Army, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">Q: Do you want to get an honorable discharge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-17\">A: Very much so, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-18\">Q: Is that the most important thing to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKT\">A: It\u2019s the most right now, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-19\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-20\">Q: Have you got anything else you would like to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-21\">A: Just that I\u2019d like to continue my service in the Army, sir, that I would really like an honorable discharge and stay in the Army.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b593-6\">COOK, Senior Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASa\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">I do not concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">I find that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was predicated on a substantial misunderstanding as to the maximum punishment to which he was subjected and therefore would hold that his plea was improvident. <em>United States v. Harden, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 76, 51 C.M.R. 249, 1 M.J. 258 (1976). While an inquiry posed to appellant by the judge at trial might have elicited a response clearly indicating that appellant was willing to plead guilty regardless of the ultimate decision as to the legal maximum sentence (see <em>United States v. Frangoules, </em>24 U.S.C.M.A. 318, 52 C.M.R. 29, 1 M.J. 467 (1976); <em>United States v. Harden, supra; United States v. Kleinhans, </em>14 U.S.C.M.A. 496, 34 C.M.R. 276 (1964)), no such colloquy occurred in this case. The exchange between counsel and appellant quoted by the majority in footnote four is not, in my view, of sufficient preciseness and clarity to permit me to conclude that appellant would have waived his constitutional right to plead not guilty had he known the actual maximum confinement was less than half of that which he had been informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Consequently, I would reverse and authorize a rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
