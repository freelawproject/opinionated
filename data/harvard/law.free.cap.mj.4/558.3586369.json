Upon initial review, the convening authority approved the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">The appellant has submitted two assignments of error. The first assignment of error has been duly considered and is deemed to be without merit. The second assignment of error is meritorious for the reasons hereafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">The operative facts with which we are concerned are that during the sentencing portion of the trial, the defense called Sergeant First Class Smith to testify in extenuation and mitigation of punishment. Sergeant Smith had known and worked with the appellant for approximately three years. The sergeant described the appellant\u2019s duty performance as above average. He further stated that he knew the appellant well, considered him a personal friend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>and described the appellant\u2019s personality and character as resulting in the appellant being a \u201cbeautiful person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The following colloquy occurred on cross-examination of the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cQ. When you say that he\u2019s a beautiful person, you\u2019re of course, aware of the fact that he already has two Article 15s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">A. When I spoke of him as a beautiful person, I was speaking from a personality of a friendship fellowship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">Q. Are you aware that he got a divorce decree, or was divorced on 26 November 1975?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">Q. And that he continued to collect HOLA and COLA for better than a year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">ADC. Your Honor, I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">MJ. Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-12\">Q. What duty capacity do you know Specialist Andrades?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">A. From his or mine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-14\">Q. From your duty capacity. Were you his supervisor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-15\">A. I was a shift leader on the opposite shift; in other words, he didn\u2019t work directly under my supervision, and when I was speaking of observing him, it was like in the messhall on both shifts you get a chance to observe both shifts, so I was speaking of observing him from his working ability and my job knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-16\">TC. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-17\">ADC. Nothing further, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">The foregoing colloquy demonstrates that the trial counsel\u2019s question attempted to inject an alleged prior act of misconduct into the trial in an effort to impeach or otherwise damage the appellant\u2019s character witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">Although the military judge sustained the trial defense counsel\u2019s objection to the question, he did not see fit to admonish the court members to disregard the question and not further consider-the information derived therefrom in their consideration of an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">Military practice follows the general rule that evidence of other offenses or acts of misconduct of the accused is not admissible as tending to prove his guilt, for ordinarily this evidence would be useful only for the purpose of raising an inference that the accused has a disposition to do acts of the kind charged or criminal acts in general.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-23\">There are seven recognized exceptions to the general rule which permit uncharged misconduct to be introduced into evidence subject to appropriate instructions which limit the court\u2019s consideration of such evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-24\">Suffice to say that none of the seven exceptions are applicable in these circumstances. Accordingly, the military judge was correct in sustaining the objection to the improper question by the trial counsel. However, that act does not necessarily resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-25\">The test is whether it can be said that the mere mention of the alleged misconduct, under the circumstances of the particular case, actually influenced the sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-26\">Here, the appellant had previously completed 12 years, 4 months and 21 days of honorable service. The evidence admitted at trial indicated that he was an above average worker in his assigned MOS and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>enjoyed the respect of his peers. He had suffered some minor difficulties in the past and had experienced a divorce which resulted in extensive indebtedness. In addition, he had served in Vietnam and had been awarded a Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, Air Medal, Good Conduct Medal, The Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry as well as other service medals.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The court in its wisdom, saw fit to only sentence the appellant to a bad-conduct discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This Court cannot subjectively penetrate the deliberations of the court members and determine that the improper statement played no part in their assessment of a fair and impartial sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In view of the jury\u2019s sentence, it would seem possible that the improper question could have supplied information which may have swayed the court in determining that it was appropriate to give the sentence adjudged.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Accordingly, we cannot say with any degree of certainty that the receipt of the improper information did not influence the court in its verdict on sentence. We will resolve our doubt in the appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The finding of guilty is affirmed. The sentence is set aside. A rehearing on the sentence may be ordered by the same or a different convening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Senior Judge COOK and Judge DRIBBEN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-19\">.
