While we were unpersuaded that appellant\u2019s guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt, we are not able to assert from this record of trial that appellant \u201cdid not commit any of the acts charged\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513(a)(2) before a certificate can issue. Nor could we hold that appellant \u201cdid not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution\u201d which is another statutory prerequisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Consequently, the Petition for a Certificate of Innocence is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-23\"> <em>Forrest v.
