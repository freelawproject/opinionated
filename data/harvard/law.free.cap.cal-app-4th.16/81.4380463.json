We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Plaintiff and appellant Jerry Ann Richaud filed a medical malpractice action against defendant and respondent W. Kenneth Jennings, M.D., on or about January 16, 1990. Respondent answered the complaint on or about March 21, 1990, and trial of the matter was set for August 26, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On or about June 17, 1991, respondent served appellant with a demand for exchange of expert witness information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The demand identified July 5, 1991, as the date for exchange of such information. On July 5, appellant served respondent with appellant\u2019s \u201cDesignation of Expert Witnesses\u201d listing three experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">On or about July 12, 1991, the law office of Greenblatt &amp; Associates substituted in as attorney of record for appellant in place of the law office of Stephen R. Wolfson.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">On August 9, appellant filed a motion requesting a 60-day continuance of the August 26 trial date. Appellant\u2019s written motion stated in part: \u201cThis motion is made ... on the grounds that the new trial counsel requires additional time in which to prepare for the trial. Former counsel is medically unable to participate as trial counsel in this matter and new counsel requires the time to prepare for trial.\u201d The 15th day before the August 26 trial date fell on August 11, a Sunday. Discovery pertaining to expert witnesses was therefore permitted as a matter of right up to and including a date not later than August 12, 1991.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">On August 15 appellant notified respondent by letter that one of appellant\u2019s three designated experts, Dr. Dennis Ainbinder, \u201cwill be unable to testify as an expert witness\u201d in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">On August 16, appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance was heard by the Honorable Arthur E. Wallace. No court reporter was present for this hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The parties appear to agree, however, that Judge Wallace requested an additional declaration from appellant, additional points and authorities from one or both of the parties, and took the matter under submission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">On August 28, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance of the August 26 trial date. The court\u2019s ruling stated: \u201cGrant Motion - Cont Trial to 10/15/91\u201d and on the next line \u201cDiscovery Plan Approved &amp; Ordered to Be Complied With.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">On or about September 16, 1991, respondent\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to the court in which he pointed out that no discovery plan had been submitted. The letter requested a clarification of the court\u2019s August 28 order and stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cMy primary concern is whether or not the court\u2019s order regarding discovery was in any way intended to affect the status of Plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses. Plaintiff originally designated three expert witnesses, Dr. Carlos Robles, Dr. Dennis Ainbinder, an orthopedist, and Dr. Robert E. Morrow, also an orthopedist. When we attempted to take the depositions of Drs. Ainbinder and Morrow, the Plaintiff withdrew those gentlemen as experts. In the supplemental declaration in support of Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a continuance of the trial, Plaintiffs counsel stated that, as of August 20,1991, he had contacted two experts who were willing to review Plaintiffs medical records and schedule an examination of her. As of this date, however, Plaintiff has not made any motion to augment his expert witness list, which we believe to be required by [Code of Civil Procedure] \u00a7 2034(k).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201cConsequently, I request the court\u2019s clarification of the order dated August 28, 1991, regarding the alleged discovery plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">On September 19, the court issued a \u201cCorrected Minute Order\u201d which stated: \u201cNo Discovery Plan Has Been Submitted in Reforance [sic] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the Motion to Continue and Reforance [szc] to the Same in the Cts Minute Order of 08/28/91 Was in error. All Discovery Is Closed Except Experts Who Are Allowed to Be Designated Late, If Any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On or about October 4 appellant personally served respondent with a document entitled \u201cSupplemental Designation of Expert Witnesses\u201d in which appellant stated that she intended to call Dr. Patrick S. Zaccalini as an expert witness at trial. On October 16, respondent filed a written objection to appellant\u2019s supplemental designation and argued that discovery was closed, that appellant had failed to obtain a court order permitting her to augment her list of expert witnesses, and that the court\u2019s September 19 order (quoted in full above) did not allow for the unilateral supplemental designation of an expert witness without a prior court order permitting such a supplemental designation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Respondent also made a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude from the trial any expert testimony by Dr. Zaccalini.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Also on October 16, appellant filed a motion to disqualify respondent\u2019s counsel, Dennis Thelen. The motion contended that Attorney Thelen had previously represented one of plaintiff\u2019s experts, Dr. Carlos J. Robles, and that Thelen had learned from Robles \u201cconfidential information which is highly prejudicial to Plaintiff Jerry Ann Richaud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify attorney Thelen and granted respondent\u2019s motion to exclude from the trial any testimony of Dr. Zaccalini.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The next day appellant\u2019s attorney stated that \u201cthe court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Zaccalini makes it impossible for plaintiff Jerry Anne <em>[sic] </em>Richaud to prove her case at this time.\u201d He stated his belief that \u201cit\u2019s incumbent upon a plaintiff to prove that a doctor was negligent\u201d and that \u201c[wjithout expert testimony we cannot determine whether any or all of the matters failed to measure up to the criteria to determine medical malpractice . . . .\u201d He also stated: \u201c. . . as long as the plaintiff acknowledges that it cannot win the case because it cannot meet its burden of proof, then it would be wasteful of court time to require the plaintiff to undergo a probably unsuccessful court trial merely to obtain an appealable judgment. H] Therefore, we have decided to consent to facilitate an appeal. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The court stated: \u201cIn other words, it\u2019s your position that all would happen, you would put on your case, you would rest, Mr. Thelen would make a motion for directed verdict and you would not be able to respond except to acquiesce basically based on the evidence you could marshal without Dr. Zaccalini?\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201cThat would be correct. Without Dr. Zaccalini we would be unable to meet our burden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Respondent\u2019s counsel then stated, \u201cat this time I would make a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 581(d) to have the plaintiff\u2019s case dismissed.\u201d After some discussion about whether Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (d) was the appropriate authority to use in this situation, the court dismissed appellant\u2019s action, stating: \u201cWell, it seems to me that 581(d) is probably the code section which is the closest to what we have here because when the plaintiff abandons it now, there is a connotation to abandonment, but in reality what you have said on the record is I have to abandon in the sense that I cannot go forward because if I go forward, all that\u2019s going to happen is I\u2019m going to run up against the wall two miles down the road. And I\u2019m going to dismiss it based upon your statement that you cannot prove your case to the point where you can get it to the jury based upon the unavailability of a designated orthopedic specialist.\u201d Judgment was entered in favor of respondent Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Appellant\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Appellant contends that (1) the trial court erred in granting respondent\u2019s motion to exclude any expert witness testimony from Dr. Zaccalini, and (2) the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to recuse attorney Thelen as respondent\u2019s attorney. Respondent argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct, and further contends that appellant \u201cabandoned\u201d her case after receiving rulings adverse to her on these motions and therefore cannot now appeal her adverse judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Appealability<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The Exclusion of Dr. Zaccalini\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 2034 governs discovery pertaining to expert witnesses in civil actions. Both parties agree that appellant did not list Dr. Zaccalini on appellant\u2019s expert witness designation served on July 5, and both agree that court permission was required for either party to augment its expert witness list after that date,  Appellant contends, however, that the court\u2019s September 19, 1991, order, quoted above, granted her the required permission and that she could therefore designate an additional expert at any time. Respondent counters that the words \u201call discovery is closed except experts who are allowed to be designated late, if any,\u201d meant that all discovery was closed unless a party obtained, sometime after the court\u2019s September 19 order, permission pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivision (k), to augment that party\u2019s expert witness, and that if such permission was obtained, then discovery as to that augmented expert witness could be conducted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>There is no doubt as to which meaning Judge Wallace intended when he issued his September 19 order because at the October 16 hearing before the Honorable Roger D. Randall, Judge Randall arranged a \u201cspeaker phone intercom discussion with Judge Wallace\u201d with the parties present and without objection from any party, and Judge Wallace stated that the meaning attributed by respondent to the September 19 order was the meaning that was intended when the order was made. In spite of that, appellant still insists on this appeal that the meaning appellant\u2019s attorney says he attributed to the September 19 order is the correct meaning, and that Judge Randall\u2019s granting of respondent\u2019s motion to exclude expert testimony from Dr. Zaccalini \u201coverruled the binding order of September 19, 1991.\u201d Respondent still argues that the interpretation of the September 19 order expressly confirmed by Judge Wallace was the correct interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The more important question, however, is not which interpretation of Judge Wallace\u2019s September 19 order was intended by Judge Wallace. The more important question is whether the court ruled correctly in excluding any expert testimony from Dr. Zaccalini. Subdivision (j) of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cExcept as provided in subdivisions (k), <em>(l), </em>and (m), on objection of any party who has made a complete and timely compliance with subdivision (f), the trial court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201c(1) List that witness as an expert under subdivision (f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201c(2) Submit an expert witness declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201c(3) Produce reports and writings of expert witnesses under subdivision (g).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201c(4) Make that expert available for a deposition under subdivision (i).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Respondent\u2019s objection to appellant\u2019s \u201csupplemental\u201d designation of Dr. Zaccalini relied on subpart (1) of subdivision (j) of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034. That is, respondent contends that appellant \u201cunreasonably failed to . . . list that witness as an expert under subdivision (f).\u201d Subdivision (f) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201c(f) All parties who have appeared in the action shall exchange information concerning expert witnesses in writing <em>on or before the date of exchange specified in the demand. </em>The exchange of information may occur at a meeting of the attorneys for the parties involved or by a mailing on or before the date of exchange.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u201c(1) The exchange of expert witness information shall include either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201c(A) A list setting forth the name and address of any person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201c(B) A statement that the party does not presently intend to offer the testimony of any expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201c(2) If any witness on the list is an expert as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), the exchange shall also include or be accompanied by an expert witness declaration signed only by the attorney for the party designating the expert, or by that party if that party has no attorney. This declaration shall be under penalty of perjury and shall contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201c(A) A brief narrative statement of the qualifications of each expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">\u201c(B) A brief narrative statement of the general substance of the testimony that the expert is expected to give.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">\u201c(C) A representation that the expert has agreed to testify at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">\u201c(D) A representation that the expert will be sufficiently familiar with the pending action to submit to a meaningful oral deposition- concerning the specific testimony, including any opinion and its basis, that the expert is expected to give at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">\u201c(E) A statement of the expert\u2019s hourly and daily fee for providing deposition testimony.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034, subd. (f), italics added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">If a party\u2019s designated expert witness were to become unavailable after expert witness information had been exchanged, it is reasonable that the party would want to replace the unavailable expert with another expert. Let us take, for example, the hypothetical situation of a party who timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>designates expert No. 1, only to have expert No. 1 die sometime after the designation but before the trial. In such a situation the party could not be said to have \u201cunreasonably\u201d failed to list the replacement expert (expert No. 2) on that party\u2019s previously exchanged expert witness list. This is because the party had no reason to believe that expert No. 2 would be needed until after expert witness information had been exchanged, i.e., until expert No. 1 died. Subdivision (j) appears to contain no express provision for exclusion of testimony of an expert witness offered by a party who has unreasonably failed to move under subdivision (k) to augment that party\u2019s expert witness list with a new expert.  Nevertheless, it seems clear that a purpose of section 2034 is to require a litigating party to reveal expert witness information to the other parties at a time that is not so late in the pretrial stage that expert witness discovery might interfere with other trial preparation, except in unusual circumstances. This is usually 50 days before the initial trial date. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2034, subd. (c).) Furthermore, the very purpose of subdivision (k) is to provide a procedure for augmentation of a party\u2019s expert witness list when for some good reason an expert was not listed on a party\u2019s original expert witness list. In our hypothetical, it would be anomalous to conclude that because expert No. 2 was not needed at the time expert witness information was exchanged, and therefore was not included on the party\u2019s original expert witness list, that party could then simply show up at trial with expert No. 2, announce that expert No. 1 is dead, and insist on calling expert No. 2 as a replacement witness without having first sought to augment that party\u2019s expert witness list to include expert No. 2. One apparent reason for this is that the opportunity to depose the expert is dependent on the inclusion of the expert in the witness list. Since the adverse party ordinarily has a right to depose the opponent\u2019s expert and that right is contingent upon listing the expert under the code, failure to properly list the expert would affect deposition rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The spirit of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, though apparently not the letter of subdivision (j) itself, implies that a party who wishes to call at trial an expert who was not designated when expert witness information was exchanged and who is intended to take the place of a previously designated but now unavailable expert, must <em>make </em>a motion under subdivision (k) to augment that party\u2019s expert witness list to include the new expert.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The party cannot do nothing and then insist that the replacement expert can be called at trial on the ground that the party\u2019s failure to list the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>replacement expert when expert witness information was exchanged was not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Nor can the party comply with the statute by unilaterally, without leave of court and at any time the party chooses, simply serving a so-called \u201csupplemental\u201d expert witness designation listing the new replacement expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The present case involves yet an additional circumstance, however. That is the court\u2019s September 19 order stating that \u201cAll Discovery Is Closed Except Experts Who Are Allowed to Be Designated Late, If Any.\u201d After Judge Randall and the two attorneys obtained Judge Wallace\u2019s clarification that the September 19 order was not intended to relieve appellant of her obligation to make a motion to augment, Judge Randall entertained argument and then stated: \u201cThe Court: All right. Obviously there was a remedy available and there was a remedy available even after September 19 and that would have been to seek relief pursuant to the statute. That hasn\u2019t been\u2014it seems the in limine is well taken and it is granted with regard to Dr. Zaccalini.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Judge Randall found no Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivision (k) motion had been made. He concluded and we agree that the appropriate remedy under the statute was the making of a motion under subdivision (k). Appellant did not do this. Since the alleged reason is a misconstruction of Judge Wallace\u2019s order, this failure can, perhaps, be understood for the period of time up to October 16. However, at the time the issue was raised before Judge Randall in the <em>in limine </em>motion, it was apparent that appellant had misconstrued Judge Wallace\u2019s order or, at least, had been found to have misconstrued it. Therefore, at that juncture, accepting Judge Randall\u2019s conclusion, the appropriate course would have been to ask for relief under subdivision (k). Had this been done, appellant would have called upon Judge Randall to exercise his discretion under the statute. Appellant did not do so. Further, the record does not contain any indication that the court would have been unwilling to entertain such a motion. As our interpretation of the relevant code provisions indicates, we see no authority for Judge Randall to act outside the provisions of subdivision (k) in allowing the testimony of Dr. Zaccalini.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Appellant wants this court to reverse Judge Randall for failure to allow Dr. Zaccalini to testify. We have concluded that in order to utilize Dr. Zaccalini as an expert, appellant must move to augment her expert witness list under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivision (k). Judge Randall found no subdivision (k) motion had been made. However, making such a motion was never precluded. Judge Randall cannot be faulted for failing to do what he wasn\u2019t asked to do. Under the circumstances of this case, appellant did not pursue the course of action that might have provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>her with relief. As we have discussed, a replacement expert should not be permitted to testify, over objection, when the party seeking to call the replacement expert has failed to move to augment that party\u2019s expert witness list to include the replacement expert. Such an augmentation motion, even at the date and time involved in this case, would allow the opponent to explain the prejudice created, allow the proponent to demonstrate good cause for any delay and, most importantly, allow the court to minimize any continuances and disruption of the litigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

This motion shall be made a sufficient time in advance of the time limit for the completion of discovery under Section 2024 to permit the deposition of any expert to whom the motion relates to be taken within that time limit.

See also subdivision (d) of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, which states: \u201cThe party demanding an exchange of information concerning expert trial witnesses shall serve the demand on all parties who have appeared in the action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b88-5\">This appears to be the import of the opening phrase of subdivision (j), which states \u201cExcept as provided in subdivisions (k), (Z) and (m).\u201d Neither party contends that subdivisions (Z) or (m) have any relevance to this case. Nothing in subdivisions (j) or (k), however, expressly states that the testimony of a replacement expert will be excluded if the party seeking to use that replacement expert has not sought leave pursuant to subdivision (k) to augment that party\u2019s expert witness list to include the replacement expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In light of our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding testimony was correct under the circumstances, it is unnecessary for us to reach final issue concerning the appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
