Ill (Danny), resides with his mother, Lori P., and his stepfather, Craig P. (respondent). After appellant did not visit, contact or otherwise communicate with Danny for more than two years, respondent filed a petition to free Danny from appellant\u2019s custody and control pursuant to Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(1), which permits termination of parental rights when \u201c[t]he child has been left ... by one parent in the care and custody of the other parent for a period of one year . . . without communication from the parent. . . with the intent on the part of the parent... to abandon the child . . . .\u201d (Further section references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise specified.) Respondent filed the petition to terminate parental rights so he could adopt Danny. (\u00a7 227.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">At the hearing on respondent\u2019s petition, appellant acknowledged his failure to communicate with his son but claimed any effort to do so would have been futile due to interference by Lori. Appellant also alleged he was unable to visit Danny in person because appellant had become disabled and could not afford to travel from his home in the State of Washington to Danny\u2019s home in Redding, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that appellant left Danny in Lori\u2019s custody for a period of one year without any communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>from appellant, and that appellant\u2019s claim Lori interfered with Ms efforts to contact Danny was not persuasive. The court then interpreted section 232, subdivision (a)(1) to require \u201cthe intent to abandon for the statutory period . . . and not an intent to permanently abandon.\u201d The court stated its interpretation of the statute was \u201cimportant in tMs case\u201d because, although there was sufficient evidence appellant intended \u2018to entirely sever the parental relationsMp and avoid all obligations growing out of it during [the one-year] period,\u201d the evidence was \u201cnot sufficiently clear and convincing . . . that [appellant] intended to <em>permanently </em>desert or abandon Ms cMld.\u201d (Italics in original.) Judgment was entered freeing Danny from appellant\u2019s custody and control, and tMs appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In the published portion of tMs opinion, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the judgment must be reversed because the trial court construed section 232 to require intent to abandon for the statutory period only. As we shall explain, appellant\u2019s assertion that the section requires an intent to abandon permanently is not supported by the purpose and language of section 232 as a whole and would result in absurd consequences not intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In the unpublished part of tMs opimon, we disagree with appellant\u2019s claims that the judgment is not supported by substantial evidence of intent to abandon and that Ms due process right to notice of the proceedings was violated. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Section 232 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) An action may be brought for the purpose of having any cMld under the age of 18 years declared free from the custody and control of either or both of Ms or her parents when the cMld comes within any of the following descriptions: [][] (1) The cMld has been left ... by one parent in the care and custody of the other parent for a period of one year . . . without communication from the parent. . . , with the intent on the part of the parent ... to abandon the cMld. The failure ... to commumcate shall be presumptive evidence of the intent to abandon. If the parent or parents have made only token efforts to . . . communicate with the cMld, the court may declare the cMld abandoned by the parent or parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Appellant does not quarrel with the plain language of the statute, wMch provides that to terminate parental rights under section 232, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>(a)(1), the parent must have had the requisite intent during the statutory period of one year. <em>(In re Randi D. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 624, 629 [257 Cal.Rptr. 421]; <em>In re Brittany H. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 533, 550 [243 Cal.Rptr. 763].) Rather, the question presented in this case is what is required to establish an intent to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">According to appellant, section 232 requires that \u201can intent to <em>permanently </em>abandon must be found by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, appellant claims the statute requires an intent to abandon the parent-child relationship forever, i.e., with the intent of never again claiming a parental right to resume the relationship some time in the future. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\u201c[A] court is to construe a statute \u2018 \u201cso as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 681 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191].) \u201cIn addressing this issue we begin, as always, with the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 73 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373].) \u201cUnder familiar rules of construction, words in a statute must be given the meaning they bear in ordinary usage [citation]; the meaning of the enactment may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible [citation].\u201d <em>(Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 84, 91 [255 Cal.Rptr. 670, 767 P.2d 1148].) Moreover, \u201cevery word and phrase of a statute should be given significance in order to effect the legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Steinberg </em>v. <em>Amplica, Inc. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1198, 1205 [233 Cal.Rptr. 249, 729 P.2d 683].) \u201cIn attempting to ascertain legislative intent when construing a statute we presume that the Legislature did not intend absurd results. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Head </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 223, 232 [228 Cal.Rptr. 184, 721 P.2d 65].) \u201cAccordingly, if a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, we must adopt the reasonable meaning and reject that which would lead to an unjust and absurd result.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Catelli </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1434, 1448 [278 Cal.Rptr. 452].)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The definition of \u201cabandonment\u201d most frequently employed by appellate opinions (\u201can actual desertion, accompanied with an intention to entirely sever, so far as it is possible to do so, the parental relation and throw off all obligations growing out of the same\u201d) does not explicitly state whether the parent must intend to sever the parent-child relation permanently or whether an intent to sever the relationship during the statutory period is sufficient. (See <em>Adoption of Michael D. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 122, 136 [256 Cal.Rptr. 884]; <em>Brittany H., supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 549; <em>Guardianship of Snowball </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 240, 243 [104 P. 444].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>To resolve the ambiguity, appellant suggests the word \u201cabandon\u201d in section 232 should be given the meaning it bears in ordinary usage, which he claims requires a \u201cpermanent intention\u201d to forsake or desert. Appellant\u2019s argument finds superficial support in <em>In re Cattalini </em>(1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 662 [165 P.2d 250], where this court interpreted the word \u201cabandon\u201d as it appeared in section 232\u2019s predecessor statute, Welfare and Institutions Code former section 701. Quoting <em>In re Cordy </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 150, 153 [146 P. 534], <em>Cattalini </em>applied the definition found in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary: \u201c \u2018To relinquish or give up <em>with the intent of never again resuming or claiming </em>one\u2018s rights or interests in; to give up absolutely; to forsake entirely; to renounce utterly; to relinquish all connection with or concern in; to desert, as a person to whom one is bound by a special relation of allegiance or fidelity; to quit; to forsake.\u2019 \u201d (72 Cal.App.2d at p. 669, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Cattalini </em>does not control the present case for two reasons. First, the <em>Cattalini </em>court\u2019s adoption of the highlighted definition was dictum because the father did not claim, as appellant does here, that he intended to forsake his child for only a limited time. There, the father \u201cat all times . . . kept insisting that he had no intention of giving up his children.\u201d (72 Cal.App.2d at p. 668.) Second, construing section 232 to require an intent to abandon permanently is not supported by the purpose and language of section 232 in its entirety and would result in absurd consequences not intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The word \u201cabandon\u201d must be construed in context with the language of the statute as a whole to give significance to every portion thereof. (Cf. <em>Steinberg, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1205.) As pertinent to this case, section 232 authorizes the termination of parental rights when a child has been left by one parent in the care and custody of the other parent for a period of one year without communication and with the intent to abandon the child. By using the general term \u201cabandon\u201d (\u201cintent on the part of the parent... to abandon the child\u201d) in conjunction with a specific period of time (one year during which the parent failed to communicate with the child), it appears the Legislature meant that an intent to abandon the child <em>during that period of time, </em>rather than an intent to abandon the child permanently, is sufficient to satisfy the statute. (\u00a7 3534 [particular expressions qualify those which are general]; cf. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1159-1160 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">This interpretation is consistent with the function of section 232. The Legislature has declared that the purpose of this section and other statutes governing the termination of parental rights is \u201cto serve the welfare and best interests of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>home when those conditions are otherwise missing from his or her life.\u201d (\u00a7 232.6; see <em>Brittany H., supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 548; <em>In re Raymond H. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 556, 564 [221 Cal.Rptr. 165].) To this end, the Legislature has directed that proceedings to terminate parental rights \u201cshall be determined as expeditiously as possible\u201d (\u00a7 232.3) and that section 232 \u201cshall be liberally construed to serve and protect the interests and welfare of the child.\u201d (\u00a7 232.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">As the trial court astutely observed, a child\u2019s interest in obtaining the stability and security of an adoptive home would be defeated if the intent to abandon requirement of section 232 were interpreted to \u201callow an absent parent to totally forsake and desert his [or her] child for years at a time without fear of [losing] parental rights simply because he [or she] had the intent to reestablish the parent-child relationship at some indefinite time in the future.\u201d The trial court further noted that appellant\u2019s interpretation \u201cwould provide Civil Code Section 232 immunity to the parent who decides, without notice to the custodial parent or minor, to fulfill his [or her] lifelong ambition of a seven year around the world sailing expedition with the intent to avoid all support obligations and communication with the child for that period, but with the specific intent to resume the relationship at the termination of the voyage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Under appellant\u2019s definition, parents could abandon their child yet deny the child the stability and security of an adoptive home merely by planning to resume relations with the child when he or she nears adulthood. If both parents assumed such a posture, the child effectively would be compelled to endure a childhood without any parents at all. The Legislature could not have intended such an absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">To the contrary, it is apparent the Legislature has determined that the state\u2019s interest in the welfare of children justifies the termination of parental rights when a parent fails to communicate with his or her child for at least one year with the intent to abandon the child during that period, even though the parent desires to eventually reestablish the parent-child relationship. In other words, a child\u2019s need for a permanent and stable home cannot be postponed for an indefinite period merely because the absent parent may envision renewing contact with the child sometime in the distant future. (Cf. <em>In re Christina A. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1073, 1080 [261 Cal.Rptr. 903]; <em>In re Debra M. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1038 [234 Cal.Rptr. 739] [\u201cThe reality is that childhood is brief; it does not wait while a parent rehabilitates himself or herself. The nuturing required must be given by someone, at the time the child needs it, not when the parent is ready to give it.\u201d]; see also <em>In re Rikki D. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1632 [278 Cal.Rptr. 565] [\u201cChildren should not be required to wait until their parents grow up.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Simply stated, a child cannot be abandoned and then put \u201con hold\u201d for a parent\u2019s whim to reunite. Children continue to develop, and the Legislature has appropriately determined a child needs a secure and stable home for that development. Consistent with the statutory purpose to serve the welfare and best interests of children by expeditiously providing a child with an opportunity for the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions otherwise are missing from the child\u2019s life (\u00a7\u00a7 232.3, 232.6), we conclude that section 232\u2019s phrase \u201cintent ... to abandon the child\u201d does not require an intent to abandon permanently. Rather, an intent to abandon for the statutory period is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Appellant disagrees, claiming an intent to abandon permanently is required by the rationale of cases which recognize the uniqueness of the connection between parent and child and hold that parenting is a fundamental right. (Citing <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248 [77 L.Ed.2d 614, 103 S.Ct. 2985]; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745 [71 L Ed 2d 599, 102 S.Ct. 1388]; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 645 [31 L.Ed.2d 551, 92 S.Ct. 1208]; <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216]; <em>In re Elise K. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 138 [187 Cal.Rptr. 483, 654 P.2d 253]; <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514].)  Appellant concedes \u201cno case appears to rest on point\u201d but argues that, \u201cbecause the interest to be terminated is one of the fundamental rights accorded the highest protection under the federal constitution,\u201d section 232 \u201cmust be interpreted strictly\u201d to require that \u201can intent to permanently abandon\u201d be shown by clear and convincing evidence. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u201cA parent\u2019s interest in the care, custody and companionship of a child is a \u2018liberty\u2019 to be ranked among \u2018the most basic of civil rights.\u2019 [Citations.] Hence, the parenting right may not be interfered with in the absence of a \u2018compelling state interest.\u2019 [Citation.] This means that section 232 ... is subject to a strict standard of judicial review under which the severance of the parental relationship can be upheld only if it is necessary to the legislative purpose of the statute\u2014the welfare of the child [citations].\u201d <em>(In re David B. </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 184, 192-193 [154 Cal.Rptr. 63], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">As noted, a requirement that the parent intend to abandon the child permanently would compel many forsaken children to endure a childhood bereft of both the absent biological parent and the possibility of securing an adoptive parent. The welfare of the child requires that such result be avoided. (\u00a7\u00a7 232.5, 232.6.) An interpretation of section 232 which permits severance of the parental relationship when a parent fails to communicate with his or her child for one year with the intent to abandon the child during that period does not offend substantive due process because it is narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest in the welfare of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Appellant next cites <em>In re Norma M. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 110 [143 Cal.Rptr. 412] for the proposition that a statute may not be construed liberally in a manner which overlooks clear statutory language. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 115.) However, this principle has no application here because of the competing meanings to which the term \u201cabandon\u201d is susceptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Appellant also cites <em>In re Baby Boy S. </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 925 [240 Cal.Rptr. 60], which cautions that sections 232.5 and 232.6 should not be used to \u201csubordinate\u201d or diminish section 232\u2019s requirement that the parent intend to abandon the child. (194 Cal.App.3d at p. 933.) Thus, a court should not use the device of liberal construction to find an intent to abandon where no such intent exists, simply because it appears the child\u2019s welfare and interests would best be served by adoption. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, our rejection of appellant\u2019s assertion that intent to abandon must be permanent does not mean intent to abandon need not be proved. Nor does it mean that the parent, rather than the petitioner, must prove the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Rather, our construction of section 232 means the petitioner must prove intent to abandon for the statutory period, which is consistent with the section\u2019s purpose of timely facilitating the creation of a new parental relationship and \u201cproviding the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions are otherwise missing from [the child\u2019s] life.\u201d (\u00a7 232.6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Davis, Acting P.
