Pursuant to these orders, the public guardian was surcharged in whole or in part for the bond fee which was charged by the public guardian and deposited in the county treasury in the individual estates under Probate Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>section 2942, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In disallowing the fees, the judge first held the statute violated the equal protection clause by \u201cselecting a particular class of persons for a species of taxation and no rational basis supports such classification.\u201d The court cited <em>Department of Mental Hygiene </em>v. <em>Kirchner </em>(1960) 60 Cal.2d 716, 722 [36 Cal.Rptr. 488, 388 P.2d 720, 20 A.L.R.3d 353], as authority for its rulings. The court later changed its position; it disallowed the bond fees because the public guardian had \u201cnot met his fiduciary duty of showing his use of estate assets for his benefit should be approved by the court. The estate is being asked to bear a claimed, general cost of government, without any benefit or value shown to the conservatee\u2019s estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Is Probate Code Section 2942, Subdivision (c) Constitutional?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellant public guardian contends the trial court erred by disallowing or reducing the bond fees because it acted in clear disregard of the mandate of Probate Code section 2942.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Constitutionality.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Respondents point out the first seven guardianship cases were lacking in proof as to the basis for the bond fee claim and argue the court\u2019s rejection of the fee was thus justified under the equal protection doctrine. \u201cWithout proof and without justification or proof of the claim the court was bound in its role to review and reject such an unproven claim.\u201d This argument reflects the trial court\u2019s first ruling. The trial court later changed its reasons for denying the bond fees solely relying on the fact the. estate was being asked to bear a cost of government that the conservator had not proven to be a cost to the estate. The public guardian asked the trial court to take judicial notice of the copy of his official bond for all guardianship estates, which showed the bond was still set at $20,000 and the fee was $100 per year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondents then argue in the alternative the statute is unconstitutional because the bond fee constitutes a tax on the poorest and most poorly situated of citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>California courts have held a statute should be construed whenever possible so as to preserve its constitutionality. (Dyna-Med, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) In <em>Estate of Getty </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 455 [191 Cal.Rptr. 897, 40 A.L.R.4th 1175], the court pointed out that neither the probate court nor the appellate court may freely depart from any \u201clegislative design.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 460.) That court set out the rules of statutory construction upon which we rely.  When construing a statute, we adhere to the fundamental rule that a court \u201c \u2018 . . \u2018should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] \u201cAn equally basic rule of statutory construction is, however, that courts are bound to give effect to statutes according to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u201d [Citations.] Although a court may properly rely on extrinsic aids, it should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the Legislature. [Citations.] \u201cIf the words of the statute are clear, the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Respondents do not satisfactorily explain how the statute is constitutionally infirm. They summarily state the bond fees, if not tempered by the court\u2019s discretion, are manifestly unconstitutional taxes. The only authority cited for this argument is <em>Department of Mental Hygiene </em>v. <em>Kirchner, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 716. <em>Kirchner </em>is inapposite. That case involved the attempt of the state to recover the cost of care, support, and maintenance of a woman\u2019s mentally ill mother who was committed to a state institution. The court ruled that holding parents, children or a spouse liable for such costs arbitrarily shifted the cost of maintaining a patient at a state institution from the state and the patient\u2019s estate to a relative not obligated for the support of the patient. The court determined this to be an invalid class discrimination in violation of equal protection guaranties. That case stands for the proposition that it is unconstitutional to impose liability upon one person for the support of another <em>not obligated </em>for her care in a state institution. <em>Kirchner </em>does not apply to the problem at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">There is no question in the instant case of a particular person or group being singled out arbitrarily, discriminatorily or without a \u201crational relationship\u201d to a legitimate government purpose, implicating the statute\u2019s constitutionality. (See <em>Village of Belle Terre </em>v. <em>Boraas </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 1, 8 [39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>L.Ed.2d 797, 803-804, 94 S.Ct. 1536].) The most indigent citizens (those receiving Social Security benefits) were exempted; thus, it is not true, as respondents allege, that the poorest citizens are required to pay the bond fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The Law Revision Commission comments to Probate Code section 2942 are helpful in determining the legislative intent. \u201cThe official bond of the public guardian <em>and the liability of the county </em>for the public guardian stand in place of the ordinary bond of a guardian or conservator. Since the public guardian\u2019s bond and liability are for the benefit and protection of the ward or conservatee and persons interested in the estate of the ward or conservatee, it is proper that these persons, rather than the public should bear the cost.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proposed law allows a bond fee as a claim against the estate of the ward or conservatee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This amount is remitted to the county treasury to offset the public expenditure for the official bond <em>and other public liability of the </em>county.\u201d (19 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (Dec. 1987) pp. 711-712, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">This comment illustrates the Legislature made a considered decision involving policy matters. In enacting Probate Code section 2942, it considered various factors including the expenses of the public guardian and the clerk, the cost of the public guardian\u2019s official bond and the county\u2019s exposure to potential liability for misdeeds by the public guardian. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.2.) Thus, even though the county\u2019s cost of \u201cdoing business\u201d is disproportionately greater than the cost of the official bond, the Legislature showed a rational basis for allowing the public guardian the $25 (plus <em>lA </em>percent) fee in each guardianship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Before an act or an ordinance will be declared unconstitutional, its unconstitutionality must appear clearly and unmistakably. The legislative power must be upheld unless it is manifestly abused so as to infringe on constitutional guaranties. <em>(Rees </em>v. <em>Layton </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 815, 822 [86 Cal.Rptr. 268].)  In our view, respondents have failed to show manifest abuse in the statutory scheme for the public guardian\u2019s claim for bond fees. As appellant has argued, the statute passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\n<em>Trial court\u2019s discretion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Respondents argue that the trial court correctly exercised its discretion by reducing the bond fee and surcharging the public guardian. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>in Probate Code section 2942, subdivision (c), the Legislature has not provided for discretion to the trial court for allowing or disallowing the bond fee, in contrast to the preceding subdivisions regarding compensation, where discretion clearly rests in the court to grant reasonable fees. For example, subdivision (a) allows a claim for \u201creasonable\u201d expenses incurred in the execution of the guardianship or conservatorship, and subdivision (b) allows compensation for services of the public guardian and the attorney and for the filing and processing services of the county clerk, <em>\u201cin the amount the court determines is just and </em>reasonable.\u201d If the Legislature had intended subdivision (c) of Probate Code section 2942 to be applied in the discretion of the trial court, it surely would have said so, as it had in the preceding subdivisions. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The trial court attempted below to determine a just and reasonable amount for the public guardian\u2019s claim for a bond fee. The court decided in the Burness case that $10 would be an equitable allocation for the cost of business and stated that to try to figure it out beyond that would be too cumbersome to pursue further. The legislative prescription of a flat fee eliminates the problem expressed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We hold, therefore, that the plain language of the statute directs the court to allow the public guardian the bond fee and does not commit the decision to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Furthermore, Probate Code section 2942, subdivision (c) admits of no constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The judgments are reversed, and the matters are remanded to the trial court to settle the various accounts in accord with the directions of Probate Code section 2942, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Stone (W.
