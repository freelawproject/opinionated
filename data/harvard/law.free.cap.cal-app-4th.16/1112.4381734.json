J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Defendant was charged with grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. I)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but convicted of petty theft (\u00a7 488)\u2014ordinarily a misdemeanor offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   However, defendant received a felony sentence pursuant to section 666 because he had prior convictions for theft-related offenses for which he had served prison terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant contends he was improperly convicted of a non-lesser-included offense and the evidence was insufficient. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude defendant was properly convicted and sentenced to prison for petty theft with a prior theft-related conviction and incarceration as enumerated in section 666 and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Defendant was charged with grand theft in violation of section 487, subdivision 1. The information also alleged defendant had served four prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>prison terms for convictions of two of the theft-related offenses listed in section 666: two robbery convictions (\u00a7 211) and two petty theft with a prior convictions. (\u00a7 666).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each allegation of a prior conviction referred specifically to section 667.5, subdivision (b) which mandates enhanced sentencing based on prior prison terms served for felonies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was also a special allegation of six prior convictions within the meaning of section 1203, subdivision (e)(4) which, if admitted or found true, would preclude a grant of probation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Defendant waived his right to a jury trial on the issue of his guilt or innocence and as to the alleged priors. Defendant made no request for a separate trial on the issue of the prior convictions and prison term enhancements. During trial, defendant admitted the two robbery and two petty theft with a prior convictions as alleged in the information. In addition, there was documentary evidence before the court, certified copies of records of the Department of Corrections, which showed defendant had been sentenced to prison as a result of three prior robbery convictions (case Nos. C40676, A457454, and A452115) and two prior petty theft with a prior convictions (case Nos. CR12702 and 44660). At the conclusion of the evidence, Superior Court Judge Victor T. Barrera found defendant guilty of petty theft. He further found true the allegations of prior theft-related convictions and incarcerations. Defense counsel timely objected on the grounds petty theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>with a prior was not a lesser and necessarily included offense of grand theft. Defense counsel did not claim he was surprised by the finding of guilt of petty theft with a prior. Defendant was sentenced to prison pursuant to section 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Defendant argues he could not be convicted of petty theft with a prior because it was not a lesser and necessarily included offense of grand theft. This argument assumes, incorrectly, that the prior theft-related conviction and incarceration requirement of section 666 is an element of an offense. Our Supreme Court has recently held the prior conviction and incarceration requirement of section 666 is a sentencing factor and not an element of an offense. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bouzas, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pages 478-479, the court held: \u201cSection 666 is\u2014and has been since 1872\u2014part of title 16 of the Penal Code, which is directed primarily to sentencing and punishment matters, to the exclusion of statutes defining substantive crimes [citation]. This supports our conclusion that the Legislature has long intended that section 666 establishes a penalty, not a substantive \u2018offense.\u2019 [$ The language of section 666 affirms this view. It is structured to enhance the punishment for violation of other defined crimes and not to define an offense in the first instance. It simply refers to other substantive offenses defined elsewhere in the Penal and Vehicle Codes and provides that if a defendant has previously been convicted of and imprisoned for any of these theft-related offenses, and thereafter commits petty theft (defined in section 484), the defendant is subject to punishment enhanced over that which would apply following a \u2018first time\u2019 petty theft conviction, [f] In other words, a charge under section 666 merely puts a defendant on notice (see \u00a7 969 [prior convictions must be alleged in ttie information]) that if he is convicted of the substantive offense and if the prior conviction and incarceration allegation of section 666 is admitted or found true, he faces enhanced punishment at the time of sentencing. We conclude that, on its face, section 666 is a sentence-enhancing statute, not a substantive \u2018offense\u2019 statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Because the prior conviction and incarceration requirement of section 666 is not an element of an offense, the relevant question is not whether petty theft with a prior is a lesser and necessarily included offense of grand theft\u2014the crime with which defendant was charged. Rather, the question is whether petty theft is a lesser and necessarily included offense of grand theft. The answer to that question is, indisputably, yes. <em>(Gomez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 640, 643-647 [328 P.2d 976]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McElroy </em>(1897) 116 Cal. 583, 584, 587 [48 P. 718].) Therefore, when the court found defendant had committed a petty theft, as distinguished from a grand theft, it convicted him of a lesser included offense of that charged in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>This brings us to the question whether defendant was placed on notice he was subject to the provisions of section 666.  Our Supreme Court has defined a defendant\u2019s due process right to notice as follows: \u201c \u2018No principle of procedural due process is more clearly established than that notice of the specific charge, and a chance to be heard in a trial of the issues raised by that charge, if desired, are among the constitutional rights of every accused in a criminal proceeding in all courts, state or federal.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018A criminal defendant must be given fair notice of the charges against him in order that he may have a reasonable opportunity properly to prepare a defense and avoid unfair surprise at trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toro </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 966, 973 [254 Cal.Rptr. 811, 766 P.2d 577].)  There is no question defendant was on notice he could be convicted of petty theft as a lesser included offense. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that an accusatory pleading provides notice of the specific offense charged and also of necessarily included offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toro, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 973; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lohbauer </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 364, 368-369 [173 Cal.Rptr. 453, 627 P.2d 183]; <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 233 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345].) Therefore, the charge of grand theft against defendant necessarily provided notice he could be convicted of petty theft.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Further, \u201ca valid accusatory pleading need not specify by number the statute under which the accused is being charged. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 818, 826 [239 Cal.Rptr. 307, 740 P.2d 419]; \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960.) It is the specific factual allegations of a pleading which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>determine what offenses are charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 826.) An accusatory pleading must likewise allege each fact required for imposition of an enhanced term. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 194, 208 [249 Cal.Rptr. 850, 757 P.2d 1013]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 835, fn. 12 [210 Cal.Rptr.623, 694 P.2d 736]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haskin </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1434; 1439-1440 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) In the case of <em>In re Mitchell </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 667, 669-670, 671 [16 Cal.Rptr. 281, 365 P.2d 177], a defendant charged with petty theft, a misdemeanor, and with having previously been convicted of a felony, was found guilty of petty theft with a prior. He was then sentenced to state prison pursuant to section 667.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The information had not specifically alleged the defendant was subject to the provisions of section 667. The defendant argued he had not been on notice he could be convicted of a felony. The Supreme Court disagreed: \u201cWith clarity, [the information] charges petty theft with a prior felony conviction, the very elements necessary to constitute a violation of section 667, a felony. [Defendant] could not possibly have been misled.\u201d (56 Cal.2d at p. 670.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Franco </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 535, 538-539 [84 Cal.Rptr. 513], the defendant was charged with petty theft as well as with a prior conviction of and incarceration for petty theft. The information had not specifically alleged the defendant was subject to the provisions of section 666. The defendant admitted the prior, was found guilty of petty theft, and was sentenced to state prison pursuant to section 666. The defendant argued he was not on notice the charged offense could be elevated to a felony because of his admission of the prior conviction. The Court of Appeal disagreed, citing <em>In re Mitchell, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at pages 669-670. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Franco, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 538-539.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We hold defendant was on notice he was subject to the provisions of section 666. Defendant was charged with grand theft, a lesser included offense of which is petty theft. Defendant was on notice he could be found guilty of petty theft. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toro, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 973; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lohbauer, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 368-369; <em>In re Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 233.) He was also charged with prior convictions and incarcerations for offenses enumerated in section 666. Thus, the information alleged, as a factual matter, all of the elements necessary for the imposition of punishment pursuant to section 666. Defendant could not have been misled by the absence of a specific reference to section 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>IV.

In <em>Wolcott, </em>the Supreme Court held that a special allegation could not be considered in determining a lesser included offense. In <em>Wolcott, </em>the court concluded \u201cthat an allegation of firearm use under section 12022.5 should not be considered in determining [a] lesser included offense.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Toro, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 972; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 610, 616 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 252]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Delahoussaye </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1, 10 [261 Cal.Rptr. 287]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheldon </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 935, 961-962 [258 Cal.Rptr. 242, 771 P.2d 1330].) In those cases, the courts noted that in determining whether an offense was necessarily included, an element of the greater offense could not be inferred from the special allegation. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolcott, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at pages 98-102, the court concluded that assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)) was not a lesser included offense of a robbery charge (\u00a7 211) with a special allegation that the defendant used a firearm in the commission of the robbery. The Supreme Court determined that the section 12022.5 allegation could not be considered in determining whether assault with a deadly weapon was a lesser included offense of robbery. (34 Cal.3d at p. 101.) The offense of which defendant has been convicted in the present case is petty theft. Our Supreme Court in <em>Bouzas </em>held that section 666 \u201cis a sentence-enhancing statute, not a substantive \u2018offense\u2019 statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bouzas, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 479.) The substantive offense of which defendant was convicted in the present case was petty theft, a lesser included offense of the charge of grand theft which was on the face of the information. The notice element of the lesser offense has not been provided by the special enhancement allegations. The notice was provided by the charged offense of grand theft. Accordingly, <em>Wolcott </em>and its progeny are not the controlling authority in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Section 667 then provided: \u201c \u2018Every person who, having been convicted of any felony either in this State or elsewhere, and having served a term therefor in any penal institution, commits petty theft after such conviction, is punishable therefor by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the State prison not exceeding five years.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Mitchell, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at p. 668, fn. 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
