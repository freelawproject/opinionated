THE CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY, PROSECUTOR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b606-7\">Submitted February 19, 1901</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Algk\">Decided June 10, 1901.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b606-8\">1.

The \u201cjudgment,\u201d so called, returned in this case does not show the charge against the defendant, or that the magistrate found the defendant guilty of any offence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-10\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b606-11\">Before Justices Gummere and Fort.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-12\">For the defendants, <em>James C. Connolly.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-13\">For the prosecutor, <em>John L. Conover.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b606-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b606-15\">Fort, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0G\">This writ brings up a conviction of the defendant founded upon a complaint for the violation of section 187 of the code of general ordinances of the city of Elizabeth, adopted January 24th, 1895.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">The charge in the complaint is for \u201cobstructing Broadway, between Front and Third streets, in said city, by placing a train of freight and coal cars thereon,\u201d for the whole of Sunday, the 8th day of July, 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">The record returned shows no legal - conviction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">The conviction fails to set out any of the requisites to make it good. Proceedings in a police court of a city, without a jury, on a complaint for the violation of a city ordinance, are of a summary nature, and the conviction, as stated and signed by the magistrate, must contain everything to show a legal conviction. <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Bayonne, </em>30 <em>Vroom </em>128.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>It is the same in cases under the Disorderly-act. <em>Preusser </em>v. Cass, 25 <em>Vroom </em>532.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The testimony sent up in this case was evidently taken stenographically, and at the end of it (evidently a note of the stenographer) appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cThe court found the defendant guilty of obstructing Broadway with railroad cars, between Front and Third streets, on July eighth, nineteen hundred, and imposed a fine of twenty-five dollars, in accordance with section 188 of the -code of general ordinances of the city of Elizabeth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">This is, of course, of no legal force whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">At another part of the return the following appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">\u201cjudgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\u201cAug. 17th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">\u201cCity of Elizabeth in the case of violation of city ordinance, section 187, code of general ordinances, section aforesaid, on hearing the evidence of plaintiff and defendant, held the Central railroad guilty, by obstructing said Broadway, by allowing cars to stand on the said, on Broadway, on the 8th day of July, nineteen hundred, imposed fine of $25.00 (twenty-five dollars). Penalty for violation of said ordinance, under section one hundred and eighty-eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">\u201cOwen P. Mahon,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">\n<em>\u201cPolice Justice.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-15\">\u201cAugust 17th, 1900.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">This is not sufficient under the cases above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">The conviction, as signed by the justice, must embody the complaint, showing the offence charged, or at least so. substantially as to clearly show the offence with which the defendant was charged, the names of the witnesses and sufficient of the evidence to show the offence was committed and of what offence the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">In this \u201cjudgment,\u201d so called, above set out, no recital of what the complaint against the defendant was appears at all. All it can be said to state on that subject is \u201cCity of Elizabeth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>in case of violation of city ordinance, section 187, code of general ordinances, section aforesaid.\u201d What this means it would be difficult to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">That it does not recite any charge against the New Jersey Central railroad is clear. Nor is there anything in the record sent up showing that the magistrate found the defendant guilty of any offence, unless the statement of the stenographer, above referred to, can be so considered, but that, of course, has no force whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The conviction is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
