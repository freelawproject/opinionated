To a declaration averring communication by the defendant to the proprietor of a newspaper for publication therein of a defamatory statement of and concerning the plaintiff, and its consequent publication in such newspaper, the defendant pleaded (1) a release, under seal, to the proprietor of the newspaper, and (2) accord and satisfaction with such proprietor in the publication in the newspaper of a retraction of the defamatory statement. On a joint demurrer to these <em>pleas </em>\u2014 Held, that the first presented a bar to the action, and that therefore it was unnecessary to consider the other.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">On demurrer to pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">The plaintiff, in his declaration, alleges that the defendant \u201cwillfully stated or transmitted on, &amp;c., * * * to John Alfred Potter, editor, proprietor and publisher of a newspaper published, &amp;c., * * * known as the \u2018Cranford Chronicle,\u2019 for publication therein, a libelous, false, slanderous and defamatory story or statement of and concerning the plaintiff, and thereby secured the actual publication of the same in said newspaper in the issue of March 30th, 1900.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\">Then follows the alleged defamatory publication, with averments of its meaning and the claim of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-9\">The defendant, besides the general issue, pleads specially (1) a release, under seal, by the plaintiff to Potter, and (2) an accord and satisfaction between the plaintiff and Potter in the publication in the \u201cCranford Chronicle\u201d of a \u201cfull and complete retraction of the alleged libelous and defamatory matter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-10\">Against these pleas the plaintiff interposes a general demurrer. \u2022 '</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-11\">Before Depue, Chief Justice, and Justices Dixon, Collins and Hendrickson.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-12\">For the plaintiff, <em>Bruce &amp; Runyon.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-13\">For the defendant, <em>Robert Carey.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b471-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b471-15\">Collins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1EC\">The claim in the brief of counsel for the defendant, that the declaration does not show a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>against the defendant, is not well founded. The case made is one of a joint tort in the publication of the alleged libel in the \u201cCranford Chronicle\u201d on the date mentioned, the inspiration coming from the defendant and the newspaper being issued by Potter. It is expressly averred that the defamatory matter was communicated for the purpose of its publication in that newspaper. The pleas, therefore, are fairly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In case of joint tort-feasance satisfaction by anyone liable discharges the claim for damages. The injured person is legally entitled to but one satisfaction. This has been the law from very early times <em>(Co. Litt. </em>232a, \u00a7 376; <em>Cocke </em>v. <em>Jennor, Hob. </em>66), and is well established in this court. <em>Spurr </em>v. <em>North Hudson County Railway </em>Co., 27 <em>Vroom </em>346. If the defendant be considered merely as the instigator of Potter\u2019s tort, the case is not different. <em>Bird </em>v. Randall, 3 <em>Burr. </em>1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">A release under seal implies consideration. Hence, the plea of release in this case is an absolute bar to the action. The demurrer being addressed to the pleas jointly cannot stand, as one is good. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Winslow, </em>6 <em>Vroom </em>437, 444. Therefore we have not considered the other plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
