There was no park tax in 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The tax for lamps in both years was levied under authority of an act authorizing street lighting districts <em>(Gen. Slat., p. </em>3669, \u00a7 449, <em>et seq.) </em>and'a supplement thereto. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1896, <em>p. </em>132. Both these acts were upheld in this court in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>31 <em>Vroom </em>384.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The tax for roads was levied under the authority of \u201cAn act concerning public roads and parks and creating boards for the control and management of the same.\u201d <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2951, \u00a7 619, <em>el seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The scheme of this act is almost identical with that of the Lamp act. The objections urged against this act, on constitutional grounds, are the same as those considered and overruled in the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Howell, supra, </em>and for the same reasons that the Lamp act in that case was held to be constitutional the Road act is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The tax for park in 1897 is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">The taxes for lamps and roads in both years, 1897. and 1898, are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">The prosecutor is entitled to costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
