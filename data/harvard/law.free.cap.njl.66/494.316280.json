The giving of a power of attorney to confess judgment is such a waiver.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-12\">5. A confessed judgment against a married woman will, upon proper proofs, be opened to admit of an application for a feigned issue to settle the question of her ability to make the contract upon which the judgment was confessed, and the question of usury may be litigated upon such issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-13\">On rule to open a judgment entered by virtue of a warrant of attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-14\">The agreed facts are that on the 21st day of February, 1898, the defendant was the owner of real estate in Atlantic City, and on that day executed a mortgage to the plaintiff, in which her husband joined, to secure to the plaintiff a certain sum of money evidenced by a bond with warrant to confess judgment and a promissory note. The conditions of the mortgage and of the bond are precisely the same, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>exact language is incorporated in the state of the case. The note matured on' the 21st day of May, 1898, and was renewed on August 21st, 1898, and was protested at maturity for non-payment. The bond under which the judgment now sought to be set aside was entered, was signed by the defendant only, but the promissory note by both the defendant and her husband. After the execution and delivery of the bond, mortgage and note, the mortgaged premises were sold by the defendant and her husband to one Hinchman and thereafter the mortgage held by the plaintiff was foreclosed and the premises purchased by him. Judgment for the deficiency was entered by 'confession, without summons and without notice to the defendant on the 3d day of November, A. d. 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">The following reasons are assigned for vacating and setting aside the judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\"><em>First. </em>No summons was issued in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\"><em>Second. </em>The suit should have been on the note -and not on the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-8\"><em>Third. </em>There was no warrant to-enter the judgment by confession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>The bond and note sued upon were given by defendant, a married woman, without consideration, to secure the debt of another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>Usury was charged and no opportunity given to show it by way of defence.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-11\">Before Justices Van Syckel, Garrison and Garrets on.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-12\">For the plaintiff, <em>S. Cameron Hinkle.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-13\">For the defendant, <em>Clarence L. Cole.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b533-15\">Garrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFz\">The reasons assigned for setting aside this judgment fall into two groups. The first, second and third reasons raise a question of procedure; the fourth and fifth reasons go to the merits. The procedure was correct; it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that pointed out by the act of 1881. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2112. \u00a7 47. Suit on the bond accompanying a mortgage after the foreclosure of the mortgage is authorized by that statute. The fact that a note had also been given for the same debt does not take away the right of suit upon the bond given by this act. The practice upon such suits of empowering an attorney to appear and confess judgment is part of the common law. 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>397.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">A married woman may make such a warrant of attorney. <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Shreve, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>94.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The right to have a suit commenced by process is a personal privilege that may be waived by the debtor. . The statute of 1881 does not alter the common law in this respect. That act was passed for the better protection of the debtor\u2019s property and not to secure any object of public policy. <em>Hellyer </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>24 <em>Vroom </em>141.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The judgment will not be set aside as improvidentlv entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The fourth reason alleges a fact that, if true, avoids not only the warrant of attorney, but the bond as well, viz., that the contract is one of suretyship by a married woman. The testimony shows that there is ground for such a contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">To afford the judgment debtor an opportunity to apply for a feigned issue that shall raise the question of fact upon which her liability rests the judgment will be opened. The question of usury may at the same time be litigated. The costs will abide the result. The application for a feigned issue must be made at or before the next term, or the defendant will take nothing by her rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
