The action was brought upon a verbal promise, upon the part of the defendant, made to the plaintiff, that if he (the plaintiff) would join as surety in a bond, given by the defendant\u2019s son Jacob to one Morehouse, to secure the payment of a debt of said son\u2019s to Morehouse, and should afterward be compelled to pay anj money in consequence of such obligation, he (the defendant) would repa3 him.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">The plaintiff had a verdict; and the question certified is whether the promise sued upon is valid and enforceable against the defendant, or whether it is not rather such a special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person as the statute of frauds <em>{Gen. Stat., p. </em>1603, \u00a7 5) declares shall not, unless evidenced by writing, be the subject of an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">At the term at which this case was argued we had occasion to consider, in the case of <em>Warren v. Abbett, </em>36 <em>Vroom </em>99, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the question whether a promise by one person to indemnify another for becoming an accommodation endorser for a third, is a promise to \u201canswer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another.\u201d The conclusion reached was that, under the previous adjudications of our courts, such a promise was an original undertaking, and not within the statute of frauds; and that, consequently, it would support an action although not in writing. The view expressed in the case cited must control in the determination of that now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Circuit Court is advised that the verbal promise of the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff for becoming surety upon the bond of the former\u2019s son Jacob was a valid and enforceable agreement, and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment upon his verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
