It seems utterly without excuse. <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Bayonne, </em>30 <em>Vroom </em>128; <em>Preusser </em>v. <em>Cass, </em>25 <em>Id. </em>532; <em>Elizabeth </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., post p. </em>568.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The conviction is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
