The defendant now applies to have set off against this judgment one which he holds against the plaintiff. That he would ordinarily be entitled to this relief is conceded; the only question argued being whether the attorney of the plaintiff has a claim upon the plaintiff\u2019s judgment for his taxable costs and court charges which is entitled to be preferred to the defendant\u2019s right to offset the judgment held by him against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">In the case of <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Mackay, 25 Vroom </em>319, this court considered the relative rights of the attorney of the plaintiff and those of the defendant, in a case similar to that now before us, and held that the attorney\u2019s claim was paramount, and that the right of the defendant to offset a judgment held by him against the plaintiff must be subordinated to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">As it appears from the agreed upon facts that the costs of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney exceed the amount of the judgment, the defendant\u2019s motion to offset must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
