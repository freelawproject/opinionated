L. </em>1898, <em>p. </em>794) makes it a misdemeanor to sell, offer to sell or expose for sale \u201cany spirituous, vinous or malt, or any intoxicating liquors\u201d on Sunday. On the principles of the common law, a person who engaged in such practices habitually in any building would be guilty of keeping a disorderly house <em>(State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 <em>Vroom </em>102; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>State, </em>13 <em>Id. </em>145). but by section 74 of our Criminal Procedure act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1898, <em>p. </em>866), in all such cases the indictment is required to be, \u201cin form, for the sale of intoxicating liquors contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The averments of this indictment clearly indicate conduct on the part of the defendant in violation of the prohibition created by the application of the common law principle to said section 68, and comply with the direction of said section&gt; 74 as to form, so far as the words of those statutes seem to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">But to support his first objection the defendant relies on the decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>152, where, under a statute forbidding the sale of \u201cany wine, gin, whiskey, cider spirits, brandy, or other ardent spirits,\u201d an indictment charging the sale of \u201cardent spirits\u201d was deemed not specific enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">This decision has, in more recent years, been regarded as laying down too stringent a rule <em>(Sparks </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>11 <em>Vroom </em>487; <em>State </em>v. <em>Powder Manufacturing Co., </em>21 <em>Id. </em>75), and was probably controlled by the precise collocation of words in the statute. The legislature had particularized many kinds of ardent spirits used as a beverage, and then had added \u201cother ardent spirits\u201d to include only such others as were used in like manner, while in the indictment before the court the words \u201cardent spirits/'' standing alone, might signify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ardent spirits not so used, and thus charge an act not for-hidden by the statute. On that ground it might properly be held that the pleader must specify the kind of ardent spirits intended, so that the defendant and the court would perceive that a violation of the law was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">But there is nothing in that rule to condemn the present indictment, for the very particulars mentioned in the statute are here specified, and no doubt can arise as to the identity of their meaning in the law and in the accusation. Therefore, without considering whether, under said section 74, a description of the article sold as \u201cintoxicating liquors\u201d might not be deemed sufficiently particular, we think the present specification is adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The other objection of the defendant is that the indictment is double, in charging sales, &amp;c., on Sunday, and sales, &amp;c., contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">This is not duplicity!, for the acts which are charged to be contrary to law are those charged to have been committed on Sunday. The habitual sales, &amp;c., on Sunday constitute the .single offence alleged. But even if the indictment were double, the fault was cured by the plea of guilty. 10 <em>Enoycl. PI. &amp; Pr. </em>539.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">In the three cases, State <em>v. </em>Peter J. Kelly, State <em>v. </em>John J. Keefe, and State <em>v. </em>Henry Felden, the records and assignments of error are the same as in State <em>v. </em>Farnum, and for the same reasons the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
