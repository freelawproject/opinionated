An officer appointed by the common council of the city of Newark, under the power conferred by section 21 of the city charter, is appointed for a term determinable upon the council declaring his office vacant, or upon the appointment of his successor and his entry upon the duties of the office.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-12\">2. Such a person so appointed holds his office for a term fixed by law, and is not within the case of <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>32 <em>Vroom </em>620.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-13\">3. The common council has no power to fix a term in a resolution differing from that fixed by the city charter, and if it attempts to do so and the official so appointed files an acceptance of such appointment it does not create a contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-14\">4.

Whether such a construction is to be given to that decision it will not he necessary for us to determine in this case, as we think the term of the prosecutor here was fixed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The power in the common council to appoint the prosecutors is founded upon the twenty-first section of the city charter, these appointments being made under the power conferred by that section wherein the common council is authorized to appoint subordinate officers \u201cfor the better ordering and governing of the said city and the carrying into effect the powers and duties conferred and imposed upon the common council by the city charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">By this section, under which these appointments only can be made, it is expressly provided for what term an appointee under it may hold, viz., \u201cshall continue in office\u201d until the office for which he shall be appointed shall be declared vacant or until another person shall be appointed to succeed him and shall enter upon the duties of his office.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1857, <em>p. </em>128, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">This fixed, by law, the term of the prosecutors until their office should be declared vacant or a successor be appointed and enter upon his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The record before us shows the termination of the office of the prosecutors, by both of the acts which, under the express provisions of the city charter, would end it. The fact that the common council attempted to fix a term for the positions to which the prosecutors were appointed different from that which the city charter fixes, is of no consequence. Such a resolution is of no force as against the express provisions of the city charter. ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The writ is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
