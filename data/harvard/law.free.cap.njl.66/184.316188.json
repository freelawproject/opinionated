Nothing has been done to give effect to it. It cannot take effect until signed by the mayor, or passed over his veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">It is not invalid, but only ineffective, for lack of the mayor\u2019s signature, or vote of the common council over his veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">Let the <em>certiorari </em>be dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
