He paid his fare and proceeded on towards George street to the opera house, where the cars come together. He requested a transfer from the conductor for Throop avenue. The conductor handed him a transfer, and as he approached George street the conductor came to him and said, \u201cMr. Hayter, get out here and take the first ear coming from Metuchen.\u201d Mr. Hayter alighted and stood on the opera house corner, and in a few minutes the Metuchen car came along and turned into George street, going towards Throop avenue. The plaintiff boarded the car and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>handed his transfer to the conductor, and the conductor looked at it and said, \u201cThat ticket is no good,\u201d and went into the trolley office, and came back and rang the bell and the car started on. They went as far as the post-office, and the conductor alighted and delivered some packages and came back and continued the journey, and after they had gone about two blocks further, about to the police station, the car was stopped again. Before, however, they got to the police station, when the ear was first stopped at the traction company\u2019s office, the conductor said, \u201cThis ticket is no good.\u201d The plaintiff said, \u201c.Don\u2019t this car go to Throop avenue ?\u201d and the conductor said, \u201cYes.\u201d Then the plaintiff said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I ride to it?\u201d The conductor made some reply, but gave no satisfaction as to why the plaintiff could not ride that far. When they got to the police station the car stopped, and the conductor said, \u201cAre you going to get off?\u201d and Mr. Hayter started to say something to him when he was taken by the arm by the conductor and roughly pulled out on the pavement and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">At the trial a verdict was found for the plaintiff, with an assessment of damages of $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We think the plaintiff was lawfully on this car; that his ejection by the conductor was a wrong, and that the rule to show cause should be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
