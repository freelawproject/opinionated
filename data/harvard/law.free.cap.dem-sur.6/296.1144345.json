Nugent, ancillary executor of decedent\u2019s will, Anne Farquharson and another, infant specific legatees, objected to the charge of $3,046.32, being amount of \u201c collateral inheritance \u201d tax, with interest, assessed and paid by the executor to the city comptroller, on June 9th, 1887, so far as the same was a charge upon two fifths of the specific legacy bequeathed to Mrs. Lydia D. Farquharson and her four children, on the ground that the legacy was not taxable because testator, at the time of his death, was not a resident of, nor domiciled within the State of New York, but was then a resident of, and domiciled within the State of Pennsylvania, where his will was probated, and letters testamentary therein issued; <em>\u201c </em>wherefore said tax was erroneously paid by said ancillary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>executor, and is not a charge upon these infants\u2019 share thereof, and the sp- 9 should be recovered by said ancillary execr' \u201e as provided x v \u00a7 12 of said act.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-4\">Wyllys Benedict, <em>for ancillary executor.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-5\">A.

The tax was assessed and fixed by the Surrogate on June 9th, 1887, and was on that day paid by the executor. Six days theretofore, he had procured from all persons interested in the legacy, including Mrs. Farquharson, as guardian of these infant objectors, a consent that the tax be paid. Under these circumstances, the special guardian\u2019s claim, that the executor should be charged with two fifths of the total payment, must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The legacy here in question was a specific legacy, and, although the bond bequeathed was sold and converted into money by the accounting party, with the approval and by the direction of the legatees, I must disallow his claim to commissions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
