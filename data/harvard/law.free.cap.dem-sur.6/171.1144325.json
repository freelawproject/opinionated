Kissam, having died in the latter part of the year 1886, and prior to the time when the amendatory act took effect\u201d; and asked that the proceedings be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-5\">Jas.

If the order is not the basis of the decision, then it seems to conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeals in the case of Nash v. White\u2019s Bank of Buffalo (105 N. <em>Y., </em>243). On the strength of the Court of Appeals case, the Surrogate of Niagara county has recently decided that the effect of the act of 1887 was to defeat the collection of a tax, under the act of 1885, due before the passage of the act of 1887, on a bequest to an adopted child.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">I shall, for the present, overrule the objection of the executor in this case, and deny the motion to dismiss this proceeding, but as I understand, the Attorney General has directed the District Attorney of Niagara county to appeal from the last mentioned decision, I think proceedings in this matter should be stayed, pending the determination of that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Objection overruled, and motion to dismiss denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
