Certain preliminary objections are made, on behalf of the witness, to the manner in which the question of her alleged contumacy is now brought before the court. It' seems unnecessary, however, to pass upon these objections, in view of the conclusions I have reached upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The question, which the witness refused to answer, was the following : \u201c Please look at the paper which I now show you, the first entries of which are under date February 14th, 1882, and say whether it is a copy of your account with the Pacific Bank in this city.\u201d To this question counsel for the executrix objected, whereupon counsel for the contestant stated, as appears by the stenographer\u2019s minutes, that he wished an answer to the question \u201cfor the purpose of laying a foundation for attempting to prove that a portion of the rents of Lawrence Odell\u2019s\u201d <em>(i. </em>e., the decedent\u2019s) \u201c property went into the private account of Mary J. Odell\u201d\u2014meaning Mary J. Odell, the witness, who is also the executrix of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">It appears that the decedent died in March, 1886. Whether, during the four years next preceding his death, the executrix had or had not collected moneys belonging to him is not material to any issue properly raised by the account and the objections thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">This motion must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
