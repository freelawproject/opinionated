Laney, administrator of decedent\u2019s estate. Decedent, the accounting party and one Barker, in February, 1883, executed an agreement of partnership providing that the same should continue for seven years, and not be dissolved by the death of any partner, but be carried on by the survivors, and the sum of f2,000, be annually deducted from the deceased partner\u2019s share of the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-10\">The administrator, on filing his account, assumed the validity of the agreement, according to which the partnership would continue until 1890, and that he was entitled to retain the decedent\u2019s money in the business, and account for the net income only, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>deducting $2,000 per annum. To this the widow and children objected, contending that the death terminated the partnership, and that, eighteen months having expired since the death, the principal and income should be distributed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-4\">H. L. Barker, <em>and </em>Theo. Bacon, <em>for administrator.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-5\">J. <em>&amp; </em>Q. Van Voorhis, <em>for widow.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-6\">F. M. Goff, <em>special guardian.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-7\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"APD\">The principal question in this proceeding is whether or not the care, custody, management and control of an <em>intestate\u2019s </em>property can be given for a number of years after his death to such decedent\u2019s surviving partners, by a clause in the co-partnership agreement providing that the death of a member of the firm shall not work its dissolution, but that the partnership business shall nevertheless continue and be conducted by the survivors until a day specified in said agreement. The time during which, under this present agreement, the intestate\u2019s personal representatives will be excluded from all power over his personalty is about three years.</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">I am inclined to answer the above question in the negative. If a man wishes to direct the control and management of his estate after death, he can do so, within certain prescribed limits by making his will, according to law. If he dies intestate, he is held to prefer to have his estate managed and settled according to the statutes governing the distribution of intestates\u2019 estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>On this subject, Church, Ch. J., says, in Ross v. Hardin (79 N. <em>Y., </em>91): \u201cIt is very clear, I think, that a person cannot by contract supersede, or contravene, the laws in respect to the management and devolution of property in case of intestacy. The statute has provided a mode of doing this by will, but the requirements of the statute must be complied with.\u201d In Nat. Bank of Newburgh v. Bigler (83 <em>N. Y., </em>57), the Court of Appeals, while declining to decide as to the scope or validity of such a provision, says: \u201c The contract was certainly intended, in some degree, to supplant and modify the legal rules which restrain the action of the survivor.\u201d See, also, Gilman v. McArdle (65 <em>How. Hr., </em>337). Some of the text book writers assert that such an agreement is valid, but, so far as I have been able to discover, they are not supported by the decision of any court on a case in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Furthermore, the effect of this agreement, if valid, is to suspend the absolute ownership of the larger part of the decedent\u2019s personal property for a definite period of time, in a way which would be void if attempted to be done by will (Stewart v. Hamilton, 37 <em>Hun, </em>19, 21; Moore v. Moore, 47 <em>Barb., </em>257, 260). If such an agreement is valid for three years after death, it must be equally so for one hundred years, and thus by partnership agreements, appearing valid on their face, the whole law relating to wills and trusts could be circumvented and rendered practically of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">While I do not agree with the referee, as to some of his conclusions in the proceeding, I think the re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>suit at which he arrives is fair and just, and therefore confirm his report.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
