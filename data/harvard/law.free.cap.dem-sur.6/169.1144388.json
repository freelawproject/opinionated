John Schwartz and another, next of kin of decedent, appeared as contestants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-12\">Henry Fuehrer, <em>for petitioner:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-13\">The testatrix had a right to provide in her will that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>:a reasonable amount should be expended by the executors for masses for the repose of the soul.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-4\">The amount directed to be expended for that purpose does not exceed the amount limited by statute which can be bequeathed to religious societies (the estate being something over $3,000), nor will the person who objects to that clause of the will be benefited by the invalidation of that part of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">In judging of this part of the will the Surrogate has :a right to take into consideration all the circumstances \u25a0of the case, the fact that decedent left no children, that the estate is amply sufficient and that there is not a particle of evidence on the part of the contestant, that the provision of the will in question is an <em>improper </em>one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-6\">Edward P. Schell, <em>for next of kin :</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-7\">The direction for masses is void. The case at bar is stronger than that of Holland v. Alcock (108 N. <em>Y., </em>312), for, in that case, there was a direction that the</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\">masses should be offered in a Roman Catholic church to be selected by the executors while here no beneficiary of any kind is named; no defined or ascertainable living person, or even corporation, has or ever can have any temporal interest in the bequest; and the court says that even if a specified church had been named, a different question would arise. Cites, also, Gilman v. McArdle (99 N. <em>Y., </em>451); Power v. Cassidy (79 <em>id., </em>602); Prichard v.
