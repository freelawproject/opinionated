The earlier of these instruments contains, among other things, the provisions following :</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\"><em>First. </em>A bequest, to the husband of the testatrix, of certain jewelry and wearing apparel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\"><em>Second. </em>A bequest thus worded: \u201cI give to my said husband the sum of $1,700 absolutely. This sum he gave to me, and I do not consider it a part of my estate. I also give to my said husband the sum of $2,000 absolutely.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\"><em>Third. </em>A bequest, in its fourth article, of the sum of $8,000 to \u201cits executors,\u201d in trust for the following use and purpose : \u201c That they shall loan out or invest the same and collect and receive the interest and income thereof, and shall, from time to time, as said interest and income shall be received, pay all of said interest' <em>and income </em>to my said husband, James S. Flagg, so long as he shall live. Upon his death, I give said principal sum of $8,000 to my child or children, and lawful issue of deceased child or children of mine living at the decease of my said husband.....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The will further directs, by its sixth article, that, in the event that the husband of the testatrix shall be living at the time when her son Herbert shall attain his majority, her executors shall take the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>$10,000 from out the share of the principal of her estate then held in trust -by -them for her child\u2019s benefit, and shall invest the same, and collect and receive the interest and income thereof, and pay all of said interest and income semi-annually to her husband as long as he shall live. The principal sum of $10,000 is given, upon the death of the husband, to the child or children and the lawful issue of any deceased child or children of the testatrix who shall be then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The codicil to this will contains a provision which is the subject of the present controversy. It is as follows : \u201c I hereby revoke any bequest <em>of money or interest of money </em>made in my last will and testament to my husband James H. Flagg, <em>excepting </em>the interest at 6 per cent, of $10,000 during his lifetime, and the sum of $2,000 which, as I have stated in my will I consider a gift from him, and therefore do not include in my estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">I am satisfied that it was the intention of the testatrix, in using the words following the word <em>\u201c </em>excepting,\u201d to take out of the operation of the revocation provision, and to sanction anew as effective dispositions, two of the gifts which she understood to have been bequeathed by her will. Neither of these gifts is described in the codicil with absolute precision, but I cannot doubt that, in using the words \u201cinterest at 6 per cent, of $10,000 during his lifetime,\u201d she intended to refer to the bequest of \u201c the interest and income of $10,000\u201d which the will gives her husband in case he shall be living when her son Herbert shall come of age. The codicil does not undertake to revoke <em>all </em>the provisions of the will for Mr. Flagg\u2019s benefit. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>revokes all <em>except </em>the one above indicated and the one which bequeaths the legacy of $2.000. The contention, that the language in dispute was intended to operate as a revocation <em>in toto, </em>and that the words following the word \u201cexcepting\u201d are effective as a new and substantial bequest, seems to me utterly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Although the guardian of the infant gave security upon his appointment and qualification in Kings county, he must execute and deposit a bond, in pursuance of \u00a7 2746 of the Code of Civil Procedure, before he can obtain possession of his ward\u2019s estate (Rieck v. Fish, 1 <em>Dem., </em>75).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
