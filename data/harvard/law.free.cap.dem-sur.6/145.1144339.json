Woolsey, <em>deceased.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-8\">The exemption from taxation, extended by the \u201cact to tax gifts, legacies,\u201d etc. (L. 1885, ch. 483), to a devise or bequest in favor of the \u201c husband of a daughter\u201d is unaffected by the circumstance of the death of the latter occurring before that of the testator, her parent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-9\">In the proceedings for a judicial settlement of executors\u2019 account, Frances W. McGarvey, infant legatee and devisee under the will, filed an objection, showing that the executors had paid a legacy of $10,000 to Edward McGarvey, widower of a deceased daughter of testator, without deduction of legacy tax, and contending that the executors should be personally charged with, and required to pay the tax with interest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-10\">Herry Major, <em>special guardian.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b165-11\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay6\">I think that the legacy to Edward McGarvey is not subject to the collateral inheritance tax. The statute exempts the husband of a daughter. It is true the wife of McGarvey died before the testator, but I think this does not affect the matter. The legislature may have had in view more than the benefit accruing to the wife of the legatee by this exemption. The children of a deceased daughter may have been considered as favored by the exemption, from this tax, of a legacy to their father.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
