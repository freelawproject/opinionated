The petition for revocation of probate omits one party necessary to be brought in under the Code \u2014namely, the petitioner\u2019s own wife, who is named in the will as a legatee. It is now too late to remedy this defect. Although the case presented by the petitioner for revocation on . this application appeals strongly to the sympathy of the court, still the jurisdiction in this regard being purely statutory, nothing remains but to dismiss the petition (see 2 <em>dem., </em>313 <em>; </em>95 <em>N. Y., </em>256; 1 <em>Dem., </em>387).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The petitioner for revocation of probate having made a motion for a rehearing of the application to dismiss his proceedings, which was denied, asked leave to amend the petition by bringing in the uncited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>party,\u2014which was granted on July 12th, 1888, the following opinion being given :</p>\n<author id=\"b468-5\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"AOR\">This is an application to amend the petition heretofore filed herein, and being a proceeding to revoke the probate of the will of decedent, is objected to on the ground that a new party cannot be brought in after the period limited for the commencement of the proceeding has expired. The will was admitted to probate on the 8th day of April, 1887, and the petition for revocation was filed April 5th, 1888, and citation issued thereon, returnable May 31st, 1888. The petition filed herein has initiated this proceeding (Matter of Gouraud, 95 N. <em>Y., </em>256). Section 2517 Code of Civil Procedure, which was the subject of consideration in the case of Fountain v. Carter (2 <em>Dem., </em>313), I regard as inapplicable in the particular in which it requires the service of the citation within sixty days, as herein mentioned. That requirement I consider as entirely confined to the cases of persons who have actually been made parties to the proceeding, and to whom the citation has been issued. The person omitted here is not such a party. I shall, therefore, grant the prayer of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">[Note.\u2014The history of \u00a7 2517 of the Code of Civil Procedure is of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Section 74 of the (old) Code oe Procedure declared : <em>\u201c </em>Civil <em>actions </em>can only <em>be commenced </em>within the periods prescribed in this title,\u201d etc. The caption of the Title, in which that section occurred, was: <em>\u201cTime </em>of <em>commencing </em>civil actions.\u201d In nearly every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>section, from \u00a7 <em>73 </em>to \u00a7 98 (the old statute of limitations), occurred a phrase, involving the words \u201caction\u201d and \u201c commence,\u201d and which was employed in declaring the <em>time </em>within which such <em>commencement </em>must be effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Thus the inquiry inevitably <em>arose\u2014\u201cwhen </em>is an <em>action </em>deemed to have been <em>commenced, </em>so as to stop the running of the statute of limitations?\u201d or \u201cwhat is the <em>commencement </em>of an <em>action, </em>within the meaning of the foregoing provisions <em>limiting </em>the <em>time </em>for the <em>commencement </em>thereof?\u201d The answer to this inquiry, which was twofold or in the alternative, was contained in the same title, and embodied in the two sentences of \u00a7 99, viz.: (1) \u201cAn <em>action </em>is <em>commenced </em>as to each defendant when the summons is served on him,\u201d etc.; and (2) \u201cAn attempt to <em>commence </em>an <em>action </em>is deemed equivalent to the <em>commencement </em>thereof, <em>within the meaning of this title, </em>when the summons is delivered.....to the sheriff,\u201d etc. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The commissioners to revise the statutes, appointed in 1870, reproduced in substance these provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure. In chapter 4 (the present statute of limitations), section 380 declares: \u201c The following <em>actions </em>must be <em>commenced </em>within the following periods,\u201d etc.; section 388 provides that an <em>action </em>not elsewhere limited <em>must he commenced </em>within ten years; and the words \u201caction\u201d and \u201ccommence,\u201d as in the former Code, occur repeatedly in the chapter. Hence the same inquiry arises here, as above noted in the former statute ; and the answer is contained in \u00a7\u00a7 398 and 399 of the present Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>which are reproductions of the two sentences of the old section 99 <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Section 398 says: \u201cAn <em>action </em>is <em>commenced </em>against a defendant, within the meaning of any provision OF THIS ACT WHICH LIMITS THE TIME FOR COMMENCING an action, when the summons is served on him,\u201d etc.; and section 399 says: \u201c An attempt to <em>commence </em>an <em>action, </em>in a court of record, is equivalent to the <em>commencement </em>thereof, within The meaning of each PROVISION OF THIS ACT WHICH LIMITS THE TIME FOR commencing an action, when the summons is delivered. .... to the sheriff,\u201d etc. That is to say, the running of the statute, upon an accrued cause of action, may be stopped in either of two ways, viz.: (1) <em>commencing </em>an action, in the ordinary sense of the term, to wit, by service of process; or (2) by a sort of constructive <em>commencement, </em>or attempt to commence\u2014consisting of a delivery of process to the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The point urged is that the only <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of \u00a7 399 is the assumed existence of other sections, in the Code (such as \u00a7 380, <em>supra), </em>which say in so many words: \u201c <em>an action </em>for such or such a purpose, must be <em>commenced within </em>such or such \u25a0 a <em>time; </em>\u201d the whole gist of the section (399) being its <em>reference </em>to the words \u201c commencement of an action,\u201d occurring in the other sections, and the <em>permission </em>which it contains to translate <em>those words </em>in the liberal manner above described.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">In framing \u00a7 399, the commissioners added a clause requiring a plaintiff, who desires to make a delivery of the summons to a sheriff equivalent to a commence-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>merit of the action, to serve, or commence advertisement against, his defendant within sixty days, etc. (see Throop\u2019s annotated Code, \u00a7 399, note). Thus far, as regards actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Next, as to special proceedings. The old Code had little to say on this subject. After startling the reader by announcing (\u00a7\u00a7 2, 3) that \u201c an action is an ordinary proceeding,\u201d while \u201c every other remedy is a special proceeding,\u201d\u2014that is to say, the distinction between an <em>action </em>and a <em>special proceeding </em>is, that the former is \u201c ordinary,\u201d and the latter extraordinary (which is equally untrue and absurd)\u2014it proceeded to expend all its reforming energy on the newly created .\u201c civil action,\u201d and left the laws regulating the numerous special proceedings scattered through the revised statutes and the session laws, uncollated and unrevised.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">It was an essential feature of the plan of the Commissioners of 1870, to bring this latter mass of statutory regulations into the Procedure act, unify the practice therein, and assimilate it, where feasible, to the practice in civil actions. Probably no branch of practice was more confused, uncertain and diverse in the source of its regulations, than that appertaining to Surrogates\u2019 courts; and more labor was expended on chapter 18 than on any equal bulk of matter in any other part of the Code. Every remedy which can be invoked in those courts is a special proceeding. A new provision was inserted (\u00a7 2516), establishing the rule that the uniform mode of commencement is by \u201c the <em>serviced </em>a citation.\u201d <em>In analogy to </em>\u00a7 399, a new section (\u00a72517) was inserted, providing that \u201cThe presenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tion of a petition is deemed the commencement of a special proceeding, <em>within the meaning of any provision of this act which limits the time for the commencement </em>thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Here the presentation of the petition is the equivalent of the delivery of the summons to the sheriff in an <em>action; </em>and a like safeguard was added, that, in order to entitle a petitioner thus to <em>translate </em>the words of any section, which required him to <em>\u201ccommence a special proceeding </em>\u201d within a specified time, he must serve, or begin advertisement against, a respondent within sixty days, etc. -</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">It was, doubtless, a part of the plan of the Revision, that there should be found, scattered through chapter \u2022 18, provisions identical with \u00a7 380, declaring <em>within what time </em>various special proceedings \u201c <em>must he commenced \u201d; </em>upon which sections, accordingly, section 2517 would operate by way of reference. But in the many re-castings, additions and emendations to which the chapter was subjected, from the time of the Commissioners\u2019 First Draft, to September 1st, 1880, when the chapter became law, such sections or expressions, if any, disappeared, and section 2517</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Jacet (ingens) litore truncus,</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Avulsumque humeris caput, et sine nomine corpus!</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">From one end of the chapter to the other, no section containing the language: \u201c A special proceeding for (a purpose stated) must be <em>commenced </em>within (a time <em>specified),\u201d\u2014\u201cthe meaning of </em>\u201d <em>which language </em>it is the sole function of \u00a7 2517 to explain,\u2014occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">It was not to be wondered that the courts, in Pryer v. Clapp (1 <em>Dem., </em>387), and Fountain v. Carter (2 <em>id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>313), proceeded upon the reasonable and generous assumption that this section meant something, and accordingly enlisted it in the service of explaining \u201cthe meaning of\u201d \u00a7 2648, wherein is absolutely nothing to be explained. The latter section requires a person seeking revocation of probate of a will to present his petition within a year from the probate. If he <em>does this, </em>he need pay no further attention to time <em>limitations; </em>if he <em>fails to do this, </em>his remedy is barred. To assume or announce that \u00a7 2648 is a provision \u201c which limits the time for the commencement of a special proceeding,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2517, and thus subject the petitioner under the former section to the necessity of observing the sixty days\u2019 clause of the latter, or lose his remedy, is the result of a confusion of ideas. Judge Earl shows, in 95 <em>N. Y., </em>on pages 261, 262, that under \u00a7 2648, a party who has <em>presented his petition </em>within the year specified\u2014which is all that he is directed to do\u2014need not do something else in order to save his remedy; also that, when the petition has been filed, the court has enough power, in respect of forcing the proceeding to a copclusion, to obviate the direful results, depicted in 28 <em>Hun, </em>on page 563, arising from waiting \u201c ten years before suing out a citation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We thus arrive at a conclusion not only consistent with, but necessarily involved in the <em>dictum </em>in Matter of Gouraud (95 <em>N. Y., </em>supra),\u2014that \u00a7 2517 and \u00a7 2648 have no relation to each other.\u2014Rep.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
