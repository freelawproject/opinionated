Are those legacies liable to the tax ? in other words, does the \u00a7500 proviso above quoted relate to the <em>entire </em>\u201c estate \u201d of a testator, or does it relate rather to the <em>particular \u201c </em>estate \u201d which is conferred by such testator\u2019s bounty upon his legatee or devisee ?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Of these two interpretations, the former seems most consistent with certain portions of the statute in question, and the latter with certain other portions, but taking the act as a whole I am of the opinion that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>whatever may be the extent of a testator\u2019s possessions, such of his bequests and devises as are of less value than $500 are not subject to tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The title of the statute here under consideration is \u201cAn act to tax gifts, legacies and collateral inheritances,\u201d and this title is well chosen to indicate in general terms the purpose declared by the legislature in the body of the statute. The tax is not imposed upon a testator\u2019s entire \u201c estate \u201d as such; it is imposed, under certain circumstances, upon each and every passing or devolution, of property ordered by his will in favor of each and every beneficiary not within the excepted classes. The burden of this tax rests upon such beneficiary, and not upon the general estate of his testator; apart, therefore, from any critical examination of the somewhat obscure phraseology of the statute, it would seem probable that the legislature intended that the exemption should apply, not to such general estate, but to the legacies and devises which, save for such exemption, would be subject to tax. There is, surely, little reasonableness in a scheme that would relieve from taxation the taker of a $400 bequest, parcel of a $450 estate, but would deny such relief to the taker of a like bequest, parcel of an estate of more considerable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The contention that the proviso relates to the several parcels of property passing to a testator\u2019s beneficiaries, rather than to the entire property of the testator himself, finds support in the circumstance that the estate exempted is not an estate <em>which is of less value </em>than $500, but \u201c an estate which may be <em>valued </em>at a less sum than $500.\u201d Valued by whom? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The answer to this question is found I think in \u00a7 13, which directs the appointment of appraisers \u201cto fix the value of property of persons whose <em>estates </em>shall be subject to the payment of such tax;\u201d and, as has been stated already, the estates of decedents are not, as an entirety, subject to tax at all. The valuation referred to in \u00a7 1 is thus discovered to be the valuation' of appraisers, which appraisers are not called upon under the act to value any portion of a decedent\u2019s estate except portions passing to persons of the taxable class.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">It may be added that, if the proviso to \u00a7 1 was intended to effect any other purpose than the relief from taxation of the recipients of small bequests, devises and distributive shares, it must have been intended to relieve persons upon whom the law casts the labor of assessing and collecting the tax, from performing that labor in cases where only a petty revenue would result to the State. But how far is that object effected by the proviso here in question, assuming that its word \u201c estate \u201d means the estate of the decedent ? If a testator leaving property of the value of $500, or upwards, gives all of it except a single dollar\u2019s worth to persons exempt from the tax, and gives that dollar\u2019s worth to a person not exempt, the machinery of the statute must be set in operation to collect the five cents to which the State is in such a case entitled. Herein lies an argument against any interpretation of the proviso except an interpretation that would involve the freedom from taxation of the three legacies of $400 each in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">I hold that those legacies are not taxable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
