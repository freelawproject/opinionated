I think that similar provision should be made for the compensation of special guardian Spelissy for his services in behalf of other infants.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">It has never been the practice of this court to make any allowance to a special guardian for his counsel fees and the application made for such an allowance in the case at bar must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">I have signed and settled a decree admitting the testator\u2019s will to probate and directing the issuance of letters testamentary to the executor. I have adopted and signed the findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed by proponent\u2019s counsel as the \u201c decision in writing\u201d contemplated by Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2545 (Matter of Hoyt, 5 <em>Dem., </em>284).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
