It is, however, contended that probate should be denied because the signature of the testatrix is not at \u201c the end\u201d of the instrument, as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Upon examination of the alleged will, it appears that the signatures of the witnesses are below the signature of the decedent, and that, underneath them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>all; appear the words: \u201c William Wolff to be executor. Witness Dr. Harris, Mrs. Abrahamson and Mr. Goldberg.\u201d When this was written, or by whom it was written, the testimony does not clearly disclose. There is no appointment of an executor in the body of the instrument, and if in fact the words above quoted were inserted before execution, they must be considered as a part of a pretended testamentary paper, which is invalid for the reason insisted upon by the contestant\u2019s counsel. If, on the other hand, the words in question were not upon the paper at the time it was signed and published, its validity has not been destroyed by their subsequent insertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Further evidence may be offered in this regard, before the final determination of this controversy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
