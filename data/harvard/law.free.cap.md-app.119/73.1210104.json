On appeal, appellant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">I. Does the issue of merger of offenses have any bearing on whether [appellant] is entitled to a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">II. Did the circuit court properly conclude that [appellant] is not entitled to a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">On 2 August 1996, appellant\u2019s van collided with Charlotte Shook\u2019s parked car. Although Shook\u2019s car was damaged, appellant left the scene without endeavoring to determine the extent of the damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was charged with violating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u00a7 20-105(a), (b), and (c) of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code Annotated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his demand for a jury trial pursuant to CJP \u00a7 4-302, was denied. Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Circuit Court for Allegany County, seeking review of the district court\u2019s decision. After the circuit court affirmed the decision of the district court, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The first issue raised on appeal was not raised in either the district or the circuit court. Although appellant challenges the State\u2019s having charged him with three violations of \u00a7 20-105, we decline to address the issue. Rule 8-131(a) provides in relevant part: \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d In <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 188, 638 A.2d 107 (1994), the Court of Appeals said, \u201cIt is clear from the plain language of Rule 8-131(a) that an appellate court\u2019s review of arguments not raised at the trial level is discretionary, not mandatory.\u201d Since this issue was not raised in the trial courts, we consider it neither necessary nor desirable to be considered on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We agree with the circuit court that appellant\u2019s demand for a jury trial was properly denied by the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CJP \u00a7 4-302(e)(2) provides in relevant part that \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>less the penalty for <em>the offense </em>with which defendant is charged permits imprisonment for a period in excess of 90 days, a defendant is not entitled to a jury trial in a criminal case.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 4-302(e)(2) (1995)(emphasis added). According to appellant, this language is ambiguous. Thus, he believes we should apply the rule of lenity and adopt his position. In appellant\u2019s view, use of the phrase \u201cthe offense\u201d makes it unclear whether charges should be considered individually or in the aggregate. Appellant believes the General Assembly should have preceded \u201coffense\u201d with \u201can\u201d rather than \u201cthe\u201d had it intended to preclude the aggregation of charges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention\u201d and \u201cthe language of the statute itself is the primary source of this intent.\u201d <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188 (1990). \u201cThe words used in a statute are to be given \u2018their ordinary and popularly understood meaning, absent a manifest contrary legislative intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klingenberg v. Klingenberg, </em>342 Md. 315, 327, 675 A.2d 551 (1996) (quoting <em>In re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. 515, 520, 471 A.2d 313 (1984)). The intent of the General Assembly in enacting \u00a7 4-302(e)(2) is clear from its language. While appellant emphasizes \u201cthe,\u201d we believe \u201coffense\u201d to be the controlling word. In our view, as \u201coffense\u201d is used in the singular, the intent of the General Assembly in enacting \u00a7 4-302(e)(2) is that each charge be considered separately. Had the General Assembly intended to the contrary, it could have simply added an \u201cs\u201d to \u201coffense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While \u00a7 4-302(e)(2) may have been inartfully drafted, we believe its language so clearly demonstrates the intent of the General Assembly, we see no need to delve into its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-16\">. Fortunately for Ms. Shook, she observed from her front porch the entire episode. When appellant failed to stop, she contacted the police who eventually apprehended appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. Section 20-105 creates three separate duties for motorists who damage unattended property: (1) the motorist must stop at the scene; (2) the motorist must attempt to locate the owner of the unattended property; and (3) if unable to do so, a written notice must be left on the property for the owner. One convicted of violating \u00a7 20-105 is subject to a fine of $500 or imprisonment for not more than two (2) months or both. Md.Code Ann., Transp.II, \u00a7 27-101 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">. The circuit court relied on the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Lewis v. U.S., </em>518 U.S. 322, 116 S.Ct. 2163, 135 L.Ed.2d 590 (1996). Although we find it to be instructive, <em>Lewis </em>deals with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>is not here an issue. Consequently, we will affirm on other grounds the decision of the circuit court. <em>Pope v. School Commissioners, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 665 A.2d 713 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. Appellant concedes that making offense plural would have been the clearest way for the legislature to demonstrate its intention to allow aggregation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
