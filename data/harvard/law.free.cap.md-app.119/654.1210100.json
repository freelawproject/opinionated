MURPHY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWg\">(retired) Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Appellee, Alonzo Barber, was indicted on October 10, 1995, on three counts of attempted first degree murder and related offenses by a grand jury sitting in Prince George\u2019s County. On the date set for trial, Barber failed to appear and his case was postponed. Eventually, a new trial date was set; however, it was beyond the 180-day limit imposed by Maryland Rule 4-271(a) and Maryland Code (1957,1996 RepLVol.), Article 27, \u00a7 591 and no hearing was held before the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee for a determination of good cause to postpone the case beyond that deadline. Barber subsequently moved to dismiss the case against him for a violation of the Rule and statute. That motion was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>and the case against Barber was dismissed. It is from that order which the State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">On October 19, 1995, defense counsel entered her appearance in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Before this Court, the State and Barber agree that the 180-day time period in which Barber was to be brought to trial expired on April 16,1996. By notice dated February 1,1996, the motions hearing was scheduled for April 4, 1996, and trial was scheduled for April 8, both before Judge Vincent J. Femia. The motions hearing was held as scheduled; however, the hearing was continued to the trial date. On April 8, 1996, Barber failed to appear for trial. Defense counsel informed Judge Femia that Barber was not present, but that he was prepared to go to trial the following day. Judge Femia ordered that Barber\u2019s bond be revoked and a bench warrant be issued. Judge Femia also admonished the State\u2019s Attorney that the 180-day period would soon lapse. Defense counsel then indicated that she was starting another trial that morning and Judge Femia stated that he was beginning a trial the following day. No new trial date was set. The bench warrant was issued on April 10,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">On April 11, 1996, Barber appeared before Judge Femia with counsel who stated that Barber had come to court on April 8, but had been misinformed that his case was continued. Counsel requested that the bench warrant be quashed. Judge Femia set aside the bond forfeiture and recalled the bench warrant. He also noted that the case would have to be reset through the chambers of Judge William D. Missouri, the County Administrative Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">On May 2, 1996, a new trial date of June 13, 1996, was set. On June 12, 1996, Barber filed a motion to dismiss as the new trial date had been set beyond the 180-day limit without a good cause hearing by the administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee. A hearing on Barber\u2019s motion was held before Judge Michele D. Hotten on June 13, 1996. At that hearing, the State\u2019s Attorney argued that she had not been notified when Barber appeared in court on April 11, 1996, to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>bench warrant quashed. The State\u2019s Attorney claimed that she had learned of Barber\u2019s appearance on that date some two weeks later when she received notification from the clerk\u2019s office that the bench warrant had been quashed. The State\u2019s Attorney explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">Basically, the case did come up for trial on the 8th, and the Defendant wasn\u2019t there. He received a bench warrant because of that. Apparently, he did come back to court at another time, but when that happened the State was not notified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">According to [DEFENSE COUNSEL], there was no one from the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office in the courtroom when Mr. Barber and her and Judge Femia met on the 11th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">In fact, the only way I found out about this case was the assignment office \u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t the assignment office, it was the clerk\u2019s office sent us the pink sheets they usually send when the bench warrant is quashed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">I received it about two weeks after April the 11th and, of course, the <em>Hicks </em>date<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> was passed by then. At that point I realized \u2014 because I was wondering how was it that the bench warrant was quashed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">I realized the Defendant\u2019s <em>Hicks </em>date was passed. I went to the assignment office and I asked them how is it you let the case go past <em>Hicks </em>when the bench warrant was quashed. They informed me at that time they had no idea that the case had even come back up. They had no idea the Defendant\u2019s bench warrant had been quashed, and for some reason they did not have the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">When they inquired further, apparently they never got the daily sheet or whatever it is that comes from the courtroom directing them to set the case, so they didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Now, clearly we are in a quandary. What do we do? The case is clearly past <em>Hicks, </em>there has clearly been no good cause hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Defense counsel disputed the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s lack of knowledge, stating that at the hearing before Judge Femia on April 11, 1996, \u201cthere was a member of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office there who does normally what we term the miscellaneous docket. It was not [the State\u2019s Attorney prosecuting this case.] [The State\u2019s Attorney prosecuting this case] was called and advised. She told me that she never got that message.\u201d Judge Hotten then granted appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The State contends that Judge Hotten erred in granting Barber\u2019s motion as his case was scheduled and called within the 180-day limit, but could not be conducted due to Barber\u2019s failure to appear. The State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">By failing to appear on his scheduled trial date, Barber compelled that his trial ... be postponed and necessitated the rescheduling of trial beyond the <em>Hicks </em>date of April 16, 1996. Because it was Barber alone who prevented his trial from being conducted in compliance with the statute and Rule, Barber was not entitled to dismissal of the charges when his trial was required to be postponed and rescheduled as a result of his failure to appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The State also claims that <em>Simms v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 204, 574 A.2d 12, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 68, 580 A.2d 1077 (1990), is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Barber counters that <em>Simms </em>ignores numerous holdings of the Court of Appeals that every postponement must be granted by the administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee and must be supported by good cause. Barber also sets forth two grounds that he believes distinguish his case from <em>Simms: </em>(1) there was no proof that the State was prepared to go forward with trial on April 8 and was prevented from doing so only by the constitutional prohibition of trying Barber in <em>absentia; </em>and (2) he had not fled the State, but was only late for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Under Maryland Rule 4-271(a) and Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL), Art. 27, \u00a7 591,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he State must bring a criminal defendant to trial no later than 180 days after the earlier of the first appearance of the defendant in circuit court or the appearance of his counsel.\u201d <em>Tapscott v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 109, 122, 664 A.2d 42 (1995), <em>aff'd, </em>343 Md. 650, 684 A.2d 439 (1996). The 180-day limit contained in Rule 4-271 is mandatory and dismissal of the criminal charges is the appropriate sanction for violation of that time period unless the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee, \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d extends the trial date beyond the 180-day limit. <em>State v. Brown, </em>307 Md. 651, 657, 516 A.2d 965 (1986); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 318, 403 A.2d 356 (1979). \u201c \u2018The critical order by the administrative judge, for purposes of the dismissal sanction, is the order having the effect of extending the trial date beyond 180 days.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Parker, </em>347 Md. 533, 539, 702 A.2d 217, 219 (1995) (quoting <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 428, 470 A.2d 1269 (1984)). \u201cThe determination as to what constitutes a good cause, warranting an extension of the trial date beyond the [180-day] limit, is a discretionary one, which \u2018... carries a presumption of validity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marks v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 269, 277, 578 A.2d 828 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 502, 583 A.2d 275 (1991) (quoting <em>State v. Green, </em>54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Md.App. 260, 266, 458 A.2d 487 (1983), <em>aff'd, </em>299 Md. 72, 472 A.2d 472 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Despite Barber\u2019s attempts to distinguish his case, we believe <em>Simms, </em>83 Md.App. 204, 574 A.2d 12, is directly on point. In that case, trial was scheduled within the 180-day limit and the State was prepared to proceed to trial, however, Simms failed to appear. The State\u2019s Attorney informed the trial court that Simms was suspected of having fled to North Carolina. The trial court issued a bench warrant and revoked his bond. The case was continued without a new trial date. Simms was subsequently located in the Baltimore City Jail and trial was reset for a date beyond the 180-day limit. On the date set for trial, defense counsel requested a postponement, which was granted. Simms subsequently filed a motion to dismiss for violation of Rule 4-271. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On appeal, this Court affirmed the decision of the trial court, stating that the trial court\u2019s issuance of a bench warrant upon Simm\u2019s failure to appear was the proper procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 574 A.2d 12. We also rejected Simms\u2019 argument that a continuance should have been sought from the county administrative judge when he failed to appear for trial. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">We see no \u201cexpertise\u201d that an administrative judge would have to offer in this situation. As the State points out, the process of asking the administrative judge for a postponement is intended as a safeguard because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cit is the administrative judge who has an overall view of the court\u2019s business, who is responsible \u2018for the administration of the court,\u2019 who assigns trial judges, who \u2018supervisees] the assignment of actions for trial,\u2019 who supervises the court personnel involved in the assignment of cases, and who received reports from such personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cConsequently, the administrative judge is ordinarily in a much better position than another judge of the trial court, or an appellate court, to make the judgment as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>whether good cause for the postponement of a criminal case exists.\u201d (Footnotes omitted). (Brackets in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtEr\"><em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 453-54 [470 A.2d 1269] (1984). Such a procedure, generally required for postponements, would have no real value here, since a new date could not be set until appellant\u2019s whereabouts were known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><em>Simms, </em>83 Md.App. at 210, 574 A.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the present case, on the date originally set for trial, which was within the 180-day limit, defense counsel informed Judge Femia that she was starting another trial that morning. There is no comment from the State\u2019s Attorney that she was not prepared to go forward. In addition, there is simply no indication in the record that Barber was merely late for trial. Defense counsel informed Judge Femia that Barber had contacted her office and indicated that he was prepared to go to trial the following day and stated that Barber was not present. As a result of Barber\u2019s conduct, the case was reset beyond the 180-day limit, but it was done without a good cause determination by the administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee. As in <em>Simms, </em>a new trial date could not be set until Barber\u2019s whereabouts were established and referring the case to the administrative judge or his designee would have been of no value. In such a situation, dismissal is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
