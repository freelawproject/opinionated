Brothers, Inc. t/a The Turf Inn (The Turf Inn), appellee. We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The Turf Inn is a restaurant and bar located in Baltimore County. The Board had previously issued a Class B (restaurant) beer, wine, and liquor license for the premises. The Turf Inn sent a letter dated March 16, 1995, to the Board, requesting permission to build a 1,200 square foot deck for dining, which was to be attached to its existing building. The Board advised The Turf Inn to file an application. The Turf Inn sent another letter to the Board, dated March 24, 1995, enclosing a plat showing the existing building, parking, and the proposed deck. The stated purpose of the deck was for \u201clight dining and/or crabs along with an outside smoking area.\u201d Pursuant to the Board\u2019s local rules, The Turf Inn filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>an application dated April 21, 1995, in which it applied for permission to increase the licensed premises by the addition of a \u201c1,200 square foot outside deck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The Board held a hearing on May 22, 1995, and at the conclusion of the hearing, approved \u201cthis plan.\u201d At the hearing, the following colloquy occurred between Anthony J. DiPaolo, one of the individual licensees, and the licensees\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">Q. What exactly do you intend to do with this deck space? I understand the panel has a copy of the plans that you have drawn for this project. What exactly do you want to do on this deck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">A. It\u2019s mainly for light fare dining and possibly crabs on the weekend. That\u2019s primarily it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">Q. Also, do you want to use it as an outside smoke area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">A. That\u2019s when it first came up, because of the smoke ban I thought was going to go into effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">Q. And you\u2019re here to petition this Board because you\u2019d like to serve alcohol on that deck throughout \u2014 like you do throughout the restaurant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">Q. What is your percentage of food revenues to alcohol revenues?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">A. Eighty percent food, 20 percent liquor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">Q. Do you expect it will be the same on the deck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">A. Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">Q. How do you expect to deliver alcohol onto the increased space onto the deck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-16\">A. We are going to have two servers along with a couple bus boys, and possibly somebody on the deck to watch and maintain the deck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-17\">Q. You have to bring alcohol from the existing bar to the deck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-18\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Q. Do you expect you might have a small service bar on the deck?<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">A. It depends on our customer demand. We were thinking probably having a frozen drink cart possibly coming out. That\u2019s about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">There were no additional questions or comments by the Board at the hearing with respect to the method of serving alcohol on the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Several months later, the Board received a complaint that (1) The Turf Inn had constructed a deck 400 square feet larger than had been requested on its plans as approved,(2) had installed a permanent bar on the deck, and (3) was offering live music after 11:00 p.m. The Board conducted a hearing on August 19, 1996, for The Turf Inn to show cause why it was not in violation of Article 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 and 10-403 and the Board\u2019s local rules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board ordered that the permanent bar on the deck (not depicted on the previously approved plans) be removed, that no live music be offered on the deck after 11:00 p.m., and that the 400 square foot addition be removed or, in the alternative, that The Turf Inn pay a fine of $400. The Turf Inn paid the fine, agreed to the restriction on live music, but appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County that portion of the Board\u2019s order requiring removal of the deck bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">By memorandum and order dated March 18, 1997, the circuit court reversed the decision of the Board requiring removal of the bar on the ground that the order exceeded the Board\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The parties present one question which, as rephrased by us, inquires whether the circuit court erred in reversing that portion of the Board\u2019s order requiring removal of the outside bar on the ground that the Board exceeded its statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The standard of review is governed by Md. Ann.Code Art. 2B, \u00a7 16-101(e), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">(l)(i) Upon the hearing of such appeal, the action of the local licensing board shall be presumed by the court to be proper and to best serve the public interest. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner to show that the decision complained of was against the public interest and that the local licensing board\u2019s discretion in rendering its decision was not honestly and fairly exercised, or that such decision was arbitrary, or procured by fraud, or unsupported by any substantial evidence, or was unreasonable, or that such decision was beyond the powers of the local licensing board, and was illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s decision is the same as that of the circuit court. If the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and if it committed no error of law, we must reverse the circuit court and affirm the Board\u2019s decision. If the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, or if it did commit an error of law, we must affirm the circuit court. <em>See </em>Art. 2B, \u00a7 16-101(e)(4) (insofar as Baltimore County is concerned, the court may only affirm, reverse, or modify the action of the licensing board).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Both parties to this appeal rely on the following trilogy of cases: <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City v. Fells Point Cafe, </em>344 Md. 120, 685 A.2d 772 (1996); <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City v. Hollywood Productions, Inc., </em>344 Md. 2, 684 A.2d 837 (1996); and <em>Sullivan v. Board of License Commissioners for Prince </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>George\u2019s County, </em>293 Md. 113, 442 A.2d 558 (1982). Appellee asserts that the cited cases stand for the general proposition that the penalties liquor boards may impose on licensees for noncompliance with lawful requirements are limited to those set forth in Article 2B, namely, monetary fines, license suspension, and license revocation. The Board does not disagree with that general proposition but points out that a different result follows when a licensee consents to a restriction. It argues that this case falls within that exception. The Turf Inn acknowledges the exception but counters by asserting that it did not consent to the restriction in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We look to the record to resolve that dispute, but first we review the applicable law. Article 2B regulates and controls \u201cthe manufacture, sale, distribution, transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages within this State and the transportation and distribution of alcoholic beverages into and out of this State.... \u201d Art. 2B, \u00a7 l-101(a)(l). The various boards of liquor license commissioners (liquor boards) are empowered to adopt and enforce regulations to further the purpose of the statute. <em>See </em>Art. 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 l-101(a)(2), l-101(b), and \u00a7 16-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>Hollywood, </em>one of the issues before the Court of Appeals was whether the liquor board exceeded its authority in restricting the hours of lawful operation of the licensee\u2019s nightclub because its patrons, after exiting the licensed premises, were disturbing the peace of the surrounding residential neighborhood. Although the sanction was not expressly authorized by statute, the liquor board contended that it fell within the scope of the board\u2019s general regulatory authority. 344 Md. at 10, 684 A.2d 837. In answering that contention, the Court first noted that none of the provisions in Article 2B specifically applicable to Baltimore City contained an express or implied grant of authority to the Baltimore City Liquor Board to restrict or modify the specific hours of operation permitted by the statute for the type of license involved. <em>See </em>Art. 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 ll-302(b)(2), ll-303(d)(2) and ll-503(a). The Court contrasted the provisions applicable to Baltimore City with the provisions applicable to Prince George\u2019s County and noted that the Prince George\u2019s County board was given ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>press authority by the General Assembly to change the closing hour and reduce the hours of sale of any licensee after receipt of a complaint and a hearing. The Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">Article 2B also sets forth with particularity the potential penalties that may result from a licensee\u2019s noncompliance with the restrictions and requirements of the article. In general, there appear to be three sanctions to which the General Assembly intends the liquor boards to resort in the appropriate circumstance: monetary fines, license suspension, and license revocation. All liquor boards have the authority, pursuant to \u00a7 10-401, to revoke or suspend a license upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events. In addition, Article 2B prescribes various monetary penalties that may be imposed. For example, where a violation constitutes cause for license suspension, the Baltimore City Liquor Board may fine a licensee not more than $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for any subsequent offense, while the Carroll County and Caroline County liquor boards may impose fines not in excess of $2,000 and $2,500, respectively. \u00a7 16-507(d),(h),(g). Furthermore, while in Carroll County, the imposition of a fine is an alternative to license suspension under this provision, Caroline County authorities may impose a fine in conjunction with license suspension. \u00a7 16-597(h),(g). There are also specific enforcement tools available to different jurisdictions under Article 2B. For example, the liquor boards in certain counties and Baltimore City have the power to issue summonses for witnesses to testify at authorized hearings and inquiries, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16^10; while in Calvert County, the liquor board must inspect licensed premises every three months, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16-402.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">As these provisions illustrate, Article 2B precisely establishes the sanctions available to a liquor board in responding to a licensee\u2019s misconduct. Such an elaborate statutory scheme suggests a specific, rather than broad, delegation of authority to the liquor boards and contradicts the notion that restrictions, penalties, and sanctions may be fashioned on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis. An exception, of course, exists where the licensee consents and agrees to a reasonable restriction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>as discussed in the decision of this Court in <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners v. Fells Point Cafe, Inc., </em>344 Md. 120, 685 A.2d 772 (1996). In the instant case, however, there was no agreement between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\"><em>Hollywood, </em>344 Md. at 14-15, 684 A.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In <em>Hollywood, </em>the violation, as found by the liquor board, was of a rule requiring licensees to avoid disturbing the peace, health, and welfare of the community. There was no challenge to the power of the Board to find such a violation, but the challenge was to the sanction imposed. In response to complaints, the liquor board for Baltimore City ordered the licensee to close on Sundays at 7:00 p.m. The sanction imposed was not expressly authorized by statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court and held that the Board exceeded its power in imposing the sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">In <em>Fells Point Cafe, </em>as part of their effort to obtain approval for the transfer of a liquor license, the licensees agreed with the Fells Point Homeowners Association to certain restrictions on the operation of their business in exchange for the Association\u2019s agreement not to oppose the transfer. Certain of those restrictions limited the licensees\u2019 operations in ways otherwise allowed by provisions of Article 2B. The Baltimore City Liquor Board granted the application subject to the restrictions contained in that agreement. Subsequently, the board held a hearing to determine if the restrictions had been violated. It found that they had and imposed additional restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The Court of Appeals stated that it is reasonable to infer that the General Assembly did not intend all liquor boards to have the power to place restrictions on a license as an enforcement mechanism because it did not so state in Article 2B. The Court went on to hold, however, that a liquor board may impose restrictions on a license with the uncoerced consent of the licensees. The Court noted that such power is not itself without restriction and left the determination of its parameters to another day. It did state that a liquor board (1) may not use its power to grant or transfer a license or to coerce acceptance of restrictions, and (2) that all restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>agreed to are not necessarily valid. In the case before the Court, Fells Point Cafe conceded that the restrictions were voluntary, and the reasonableness of the restrictions was not an issue. 344 Md. at 141, 685 A.2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"Alj\">In the third case, <em>Sullivan, </em>the Court of Appeals had before it the question of whether the Board of License Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County had acted within its authority in denying a licensee\u2019s application to construct and operate a drive-in window for the sale of packaged alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises. In <em>Sullivan, </em>the licensee had a license to sell packaged alcoholic beverages but had applied for permission to expand its premises, including the addition of a drive-in window. The Prince George\u2019s County Liquor Board approved the expansion but denied the request for a drive-in window based on a finding that it would be harmful to the health and welfare of the community. After affirmance by the circuit court, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. The Court pointed out that then Article 2B, \u00a7 38(a)(5) permitted the Prince George\u2019s County Board to adopt rules concerning alterations and additions to licensed premises, and the Board had in fact adopted such a rule. The Court, while recognizing the legitimate authority of the liquor board to regulate alterations or additions to the licensed premises, stated that drive-in windows are not inherently detrimental. Consequently, they may be prohibited only if necessary to protect the peace, safety, and welfare of the community. The Court remanded the case to the liquor board, because it was not clear if the liquor board had denied the request on that basis or in the belief that it could prohibit drive-in windows as a board policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In the case before us, the construction of a permanent bar was not reflected in the correspondence with the Board, in the application, or on the plans. The only evidence with respect to The Turf Inn\u2019s intention as to the manner of serving alcoholic beverages on the proposed deck was. in response to its attorney\u2019s questions at the May 22, 1995 hearing. When asked if there was an intent to have a small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>service bar, one of The Turf Inn\u2019s licensees answered that it depended on customer demand, but they were thinking about a frozen drink cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">It is clear, therefore, that there was never a request by The Turf Inn to the Board to approve the construction of a permanent bar on the deck, and the Board never had to consider, nor did it consider, such a request. Thus, we do not have before us an express consent to a restriction imposed by the Board, which could be specifically enforced even though not within the Board\u2019s express list of available sanctions, as was the case in <em>Fells Point Cafe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The Board contends that The Turf Inn conceded at the August 19, 1996, hearing that, at the May 22, 1995 hearing, it \u201cconsented to voluntary restrictions concerning the service of alcohol on the outdoor deck.\u201d The transcript of the 1996 hearing reveals the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Q. (Turf Inn\u2019s Counsel)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">Could you go in with your plans and things leading up to the first hearing where you asked for a deck and you presented plans, discussed the plans, and why they changed somewhere along the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">A. (Turf Inn\u2019s Representative)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">Originally we requested a thirty by forty deck because of finances, and that\u2019s what we went ahead and did. And as my brother testified, we weren\u2019t a hundred percent sure exactly what we were going to do. We were going to wait and see how it worked out with the customers and all that. And we were going to possibly, like my brother said, have a frozen drink cart or service bar area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">And it just ended up that the Health Department came in and said if you\u2019re going to have any kind of, you know, service bar area out here, you have to have a sink, you have to have proper drainage. And so we went ahead and built the sink with the proper drainage, had the soda guns out there as the Health Department\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">THE CHAIRMAN: Didn\u2019t you think about the Liquor Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>[TURF INN\u2019S REPRESENTATIVE]: Well, we thought it was the \u2014 basically the idea that had to be approved. We didn\u2019t think each detail had to be approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">THE CHAIRMAN: You thought you could go in there, request one size deck, get it in there, and put whatever size you wanted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Then you decided you may have a little drink cart going back and forth and because you\u2019ve got the bar three or four feet inside the door, and you decided to put a big bar up there without notifying the Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">[TURF INN\u2019S REPRESENTATIVE]: No, sir. We thought that we\u2019d put the service bar up there. It\u2019s not that big a bar. And we thought the concept was that we could have booze out there and it was okay, you know, as the Liquor Board approved booze being served out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">And we thought that, you know, that was what really had to be approved, and that, you know, the size of the service bar was basically, you know, irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u2022i' \u25a0f'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Q. On the service bar, there was testimony previously they were going to put something out there to serve the customers there. You said the Health Department required you to do what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">A. Basically, yes, the Health Department required for us to have hot and cold running water, proper drainage. THE CHAIRMAN: The little cart with the frozen drink cart, did the Health Department make you do that? THE WITNESS: I was under the impression we had asked for a possible service bar or a cart. Maybe he didn\u2019t say service bar, but that was our intention, to have a cart or a service bar area so the waitresses could get their drinks and such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">Q. Did you try the less formal setup without the sink and the plumbing that you eventually built? How did it evolve from just a little informal thing to what you say the Health Department required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>A. Because as you\u2019re getting through, all the inspectors have to come out and, in effect, see it\u2019s up to par. And when the Health Department said the service bar needed to have a sink, I needed to have proper running hot and cold water\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">Q. So you were following the Health Department requirements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Q. But you didn\u2019t come back and ask the Liquor Board for this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">Q. Is that just an oversight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">A. No doubt about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">Q. Did you intentionally do this just to thwart the regulations and the rules that require you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. We have gone through all the steps that were required. And we weren\u2019t trying to get around anything. You know, we were trying to go through the proper channels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">We just weren\u2019t \u2014 when we were building, we just weren\u2019t a hundred percent sure what we wanted to do ourselves as we were building it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">We cannot read a concession by appellee into that colloquy. To the contrary, we infer just the opposite. Consequently, we discuss the general powers of the Board in the absence of a consensual restriction on a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Article 2B and the restrictions, regulations, provisions, and penalties contained therein are declared to be for the \u201cprotection, health, welfare and safety of this State.\u201d Art. 2B, \u00a7 1-101(a)(3). Liquor boards are generally empowered to administer and enforce its provisions. Art. 2B, \u00a7 l-101(a)(2). Certain provisions in Article 2B grant general powers to all liquor boards, and other provisions grant specific powers that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. One of the general powers granted to the boards is the general power to adopt reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>able rules and regulations necessary to discharge their duties under Article 2B. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">While Article 2B does not expressly grant the Board the power to regulate an alteration or expansion of licensed premises as was true for the Prince George\u2019s County board in <em>Sullivan, </em>the Turf Inn does not challenge the power of the Board to do so. In addition, the power to regulate an alteration or addition to premises exercised by the Board in this case is not inconsistent with express statutory provisions as was the case in <em>Hollywood. </em>Consequently, the Board\u2019s right to regulate the alteration or addition to premises rests on the general power to protect the public health, welfare, and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Similar to the drive-in window in <em>Sullivan, </em>the existence of an outside bar is not inherently detrimental. It may be detrimental only if such a finding is supported by evidence that it is inconsistent with the health, welfare, and safety of the people of this State. The Board, therefore, would not have the power to prohibit the construction of an outside bar, simply as a matter of Board policy without an appropriate finding, either as a restriction on the grant of authority to expand the premises, had it been requested, or as a matter of enforcement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The violation found by the Board in this case was that The Turf Inn engaged in an activity without permission. There was no other finding. There was not an agreed restriction which would permit specific enforcement as in <em>Fells Point Cafe; </em>the issue was never addressed. The power of the Board to find a violation is not challenged. Assuming the Board had the general power to find a violation of Rule 15, the question then turns to the nature of the available sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">As part of its enforcement power, the Board may impose a fine, suspend a license, or revoke a license. It may suspend or revoke a license only if there is cause for suspension or revocation under the alcoholic beverage laws and the rules and regulations affecting Baltimore County. A license may be suspended or revoked for any cause necessary to promote the peace or safety of the community. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-401 and 16-507(e). Pursuant to \u00a7 16-507(e), the Board could impose a fine not exceeding $2,000 on finding a violation but could not suspend or revoke the license absent a finding in accordance with the above statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In summary, had permission for an outside permanent bar been requested, the Board would have had the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>impose that restriction, absent express consent, only if evidence supported a finding that it was not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. There was no express consent which might have been capable of specific enforcement. With respect to the violation of the Board\u2019s rule for going beyond the scope of the permission requested and granted, the Board had the power to impose a fine and had the power to suspend or revoke the license upon an appropriate finding. There was no finding by the Board other than the fact that The Turf Inn constructed a permanent outside bar without permission. The Board has no power to order removal of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">HARRELL, J., files a concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">1.

With respect to alterations or additions to licensed premises, we note that the provision in Article 2B applicable to Baltimore County differs from that applicable to Prince George\u2019s County. Article 2B \u00a7 15-112(f)(2) applies to Baltimore County and, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN9\">In Baltimore County, in addition to the other powers and duties conferred on them, the Board of License Commissioners may prescribe rules and regulations ... concerning the granting and the date of issuing licenses when the actual use of the license is to be deferred until the completion of construction work or alterations on the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Article 2B \u00a7 8-217(a)(4) applies to Prince George\u2019s County and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">In Prince George's County, in addition to the other powers and duties conferred upon them, the Board of License Commissioners may prescribe rules and regulations concerning the granting and the date of issuing licenses when the actual use of the license is to be deferred until the completion of construction work or alteration on the premis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>es; and further, said Board may prescribe rules and regulations concerning alterations and additions to any licensed premises and the use thereof; the provisions hereof shall not be construed to prevent the issuance, or renewal, of a license previously issued, or authorized for issuance, where the premises licensed or to be licensed are under construction or the alterations to made therein are in progress. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">By examining the two statutes, it is clear that although the State has conferred to Prince George's County the express authority to regulate alterations to licensed premises, it has not adopted a similar provision for Baltimore County. The express authority conferred on the Prince George\u2019s County board, however, is not without limits. As determined in <em>Sullivan, </em>Prince George's County can prohibit alterations or additions to licensed premises only if necessary to protect the peace, safety, and welfare of the community. <em>Sullivan, </em>293 Md. at 118-119, 442 A.2d 558; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 l-101(a)(3). Since a finding of harm must be made in Prince George\u2019s County, then common sense dictates that a similar finding must also be made in Baltimore County because the power of its Board to regulate alterations and additions to licensed premises is contained in the general power to regulate and not expressly provided for by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b348-6\">HARRELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Although I agree with my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the circuit court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed, I write separately solely because I do not accept their intermediate reasoning that the licensees\u2019 testimony regarding the extent of the proposed alteration of the licensed premises did not amount to a consensual restriction (maj. op. at 319, 705 A.2d at 22) of the type discussed in <em>Fells Point Cafe. See Fells Point Cafe, </em>344 Md. at 137-41, 685 A.2d 772. I believe the majority strays in its analysis when it focuses, for purposes of deciding this point, on the highlighted testimony from the 16 August 1996 show cause violation hearing, rather than on the 22 May 1995 hearing regarding the scope of the original request to alter the licensed premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Appellee conceded at oral argument that Local Rule 15, for present purposes, is a lawfully enacted requirement. It does not take extensive inquiry into the legislative intent of Art. 2B or Local Rule 15 to divine that the general public health, safety, and welfare (and the specific implications related thereto of regulating the manner and place of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages) are served by requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>licensees to submit for consideration and approval their specific plans proposing to alter the size of the licensed premises and/or the operational modalities for the purveying of alcoholic beverages as defined previously when the license was issued, transferred, or renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">A failure to recognize and honor this regulatory linkage could impair a local board\u2019s ability to enforce Art. 2B. For example, in the present case, if the licensees were not required to obtain prior Board approval before installing the deck and placing it in service, alcohol might be served to minors on the deck, which deck area could be argued not to be a part of the licensed premises theoretically and, thus, as off-premise activity, beyond Board regulation. The need for specificity and accountability regarding premises modification situations seems obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Turning to the relevant testimony of the licensee before the Board on 22 May 1995, although understandably \u201cflexible\u201d from a businessperson\u2019s perspective, I view it, when taken together with the actual plans submitted with the application, as amounting to the <em>equivalent </em>of a consensual limitation on the licensees\u2019 method of purveying alcohol to patrons on the proposed deck. As such, the majority errs in not concluding likewise. Had the majority reached the conclusion I reach on this score, its analysis thereafter should have been directed to determining whether the consensual restriction was of a kind contemplated by <em>Fells Point Cafe </em>as possibly not valid. <em>See Fells Point Cafe, </em>344 Md. at 141, 685 A.2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In further support of my view that the instant case qualifies as the <em>equivalent </em>of a consensual restriction, I point out that Mr. DiPaola\u2019s equivocal testimony of 22 May 1995 regarding the proposed methods of dispensing alcohol to deck patrons in no sense can be construed as amending the actual plans which were the basis of the licensees\u2019 application and the Board\u2019s express approval. The best that can be said about his testimony regarding the possibility of a \u201csmall service bar\u201d on the deck is that the potential for such depended on future interpretation of then unknown \u201ccustomer demand,\u201d a consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ation that inherently mixes subjective and objective factors. For the present, however, alcohol service to deck patrons was to be from the existing interior bar or a mobile frozen drink cart. Hence, the plans for which approval was sought depicted no permanent deck bar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These inducements, dangled by the licensees and their attorney before the Board, are an uncoerced proffer similar to the consensual restrictions discussed in <em>Fells Point Cafe. </em>It is of no consequence that the Board, in approving \u201cthis plan,\u201d did not express its reliance, or right to rely, on the licensee\u2019s testimony by conditioning its approval expressly with a relevant negative restriction, limitation, or condition (e.g., licensees may not have a permanent service bar on the deck). The Board approved a \u201cplan\u201d with no fixed service bar on the deck because none was proposed. Read together with the testimony of 22 May 1995, the \u201cplan\u201d is thus the functional <em>equivalent </em>of a consensual restriction within the meaning of <em>Fells Point Cafe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">I hasten to add that, nonetheless, I reach the same result as the majority and the circuit court because I believe the Court of Appeals, in interpreting the legislative intent of Art. 2B, has held clearly that local boards, unless granted powers therein to the contrary, may only enforce violations of Art. 2B and/or the validly enacted local rules through fines, suspension of licenses, or revocation of licenses. <em>See Hollywood Productions, </em>344 Md. at 15, 684 A.2d 837; <em>Fells Point Cafe, </em>344 Md. at 136-37, 685 A.2d 772.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\">. It seems obvious to me that the location and number of points of alcohol dispensation on a licensed premises implicate questions that have an impact upon the control of alcohol service to patrons, some of whom may become inebriants or may be minors. This is quintessentially the stuff of which Art. 2B speaks in many of its provisions. Licensees, as well as the Board, should have a reason to care about this as it complicates their oversight responsibilities for their employees who dispense alcoholic beverages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
