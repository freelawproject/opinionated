Lennon, violated provisions of the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance when he represented clients who had business before the county agency of which he was a member. Appellee then filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, claiming, among other things, that appellant erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of the Ethics Ordinance. On October 29, 1996, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Lerner, J.) granted summary judgment in favor of appellant, and dismissed appellee\u2019s claims with prejudice. On appellee\u2019s motion for reconsideration, however, the court reversed itself and granted summary judgment in favor of Lennon, finding, as a matter of law, that he did not violate the Ethics Ordinance. We must decide three issues in this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">1. Whether the Ethics Commission, an administrative agency, is precluded as a matter of law from appealing the trial court\u2019s ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>2. Whether appellee\u2019s voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct and subsequent resignation from the administrative agency render the case moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">3. Whether the lower court was legally correct in concluding that appellee did not violate the Ethics Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">With respect to the preliminary issues, we find that a live controversy exists and that the Ethics Commission has standing to maintain the appeal. As to the merits, we find that the lower court erred in concluding that appellee did not violate the Ethics Ordinance and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">This case addresses a delicate and important issue in the \u00e1rea of conflicts of interest. Specifically, we are asked to decide when, if ever, it is permissible for an attorney simultaneously to represent a client and serve on a local administrative body, when the client has business before that administrative body. Appellee, Robert Lennon, was a member of the Carroll County Planning and Zoning Commission (Planning Commission) from January 1994 to May 1997. During those same years, Lennon also maintained a private law practice in Carroll County, specializing in the area of real property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Beginning in late 1994, in his capacity as a private attorney, Lennon represented Samuel and Linda Battaglia (the Battaglias) in connection with a parcel of real property owned by the Battaglias in Carroll County. Specifically, Lennon prepared an \u201coff-conveyance\u201d application for the Battaglia property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While there is some question as to when the representation ceased, the parties do not dispute that an attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>relationship existed between Lennon and the Battaglias with respect to the off-conveyance application. Around the same time in 1994, the Battaglias sought to amend the Carroll County Water and Sewerage Master Plan to extend water and sewer service to their property. Although Lennon did not provide any legal services to the Battaglias with respect to the water and sewer request, that request is, nevertheless, an important aspect of the case because it falls under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission, the agency on which Lennon sat at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">On December 21, 1994, the Battaglias\u2019 request to extend water service came before the Planning Commission for the first time. Lennon recused himself from the proceedings and took no part in the consideration of the request. On March 6, 1995, Lennon filed the Battaglias\u2019 off-conveyance application with the Department of Permits and Regulations. The application was approved on March 9, 1995, and in April Lennon prepared the necessary deeds for the Battaglias\u2019 off-conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The key date that eventually gave rise to the Ethics Commission\u2019s inquiry is March 21, 1995, on which the Planning Commission met and voted on the Battaglias\u2019 proposed amendments to the water and sewer plan. At this meeting, according to the record, Lennon \u201cparticipated in the discussion of the ... Battaglia plan, moved for approval of the Battaglia plan, and voted to approve the Battaglia plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">By letter dated April 8, 1996, the Carroll County Ethics Commission notified Lennon that his representation of the Battaglias may have constituted a violation of the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 3.a, 3.e, and 3.d. The Ethics Commission wrote that it was considering \u201cwhether [Lennon\u2019s] legal representation of clients with business before the Planning Commission ... may constitute a violation of [the Ethics Ordinance],\u201d and invited a written response from Lennon. Lennon\u2019s response a month later did not directly address the merits of the Ethics Commission\u2019s inquiry, but rather attacked the validity of the Ethics Ordinance and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201clack of substantive or procedural due process\u201d provided for by the Ordinance. On May 15, 1996, the Ethics Commission heard oral comments from Lennon.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On July 10,1996, the Ethics Commission issued a memorandum opinion, finding that Lennon violated \u00a7\u00a7 3.c and 3.d of the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance by handling the Battaglias\u2019 off-conveyance application while the Battaglias\u2019 water and sewer request was before the Planning Commission, and by handling off-conveyance applications for the Battaglias and other clients. The ethics law provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">SECTION 3 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Carroll County officials and employees who are subject to this Ordinance shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">* * * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">c. be employed by a business entity that: has or is negotiating a contract of more than $3,500.00 with the County or is regulated by their agency; except as exempted by this Commission pursuant to Section 6 of this Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">d. hold any outside employment relationship that would impair impartiality or independence of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">The Ethics Commission found that \u201cMr. Lennon, as a private attorney, was clearly employed by the Battaglias and the Battaglias, insofar as the extension of water service to their property is concerned, were regulated by the Commission of which Mr. Lennon is a member.\u201d In addition, the Ethics Commission found that Lennon\u2019s handling of off-conveyance applications for the Battaglias and a \u201cnumber of [other] clients,\u201d while not as \u201cblatant\u201d as his involvement in the Battaglias\u2019 water and sewerage proposal, \u201cnevertheless constitute^] outside employment in violation of \u00a7 3.c____\u201d In reaching the second finding, the Ethics Commission reasoned that, although off-conveyance applications are initially filed with the Bureau of Development Review, rather than the Planning Commission, \u201crecords reflect that off-conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>applications do occasionally give rise to issues which are determined by the Planning &amp; Zoning Commission.\u201d The Ethics Commission added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">The fact that a particular application for an off-conveyance is not likely to come before the Planning Commission does not negate the fact that the applicant is regulated by the agency of which Mr. Lennon is a member. Moreover, the fact that the application is considered in the first instance by the Bureau of Development Review does not change the authority of the Planning Commission over the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The Ethics Commission directed Lennon to refrain from any such representation in the future, but took no further action. Later that month, however, the Carroll County Commissioners held a hearing concerning Lennon\u2019s conduct in which they determined that Lennon\u2019s actions constituted \u201cmalfeasance in office\u201d and removed Lennon from the Planning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Lennon then brought an action against the Ethics Commission and the County Commissioners in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, which was later transferred to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The Ethics Commission moved to dismiss Lennon\u2019s suit. The trial court granted the Ethics Commission\u2019s motion, and dismissed Lennon\u2019s claims with prejudice. Lennon then filed a motion to amend the judgment of the trial court, which the court granted in November 1996. The court heard argument on the merits and granted summary judgment in favor of Lennon, thereby reversing the Ethics Commission\u2019s finding that Lennon violated the Ethics Ordinance. The trial court granted Lennon declaratory relief, finding \u201cno violation of Carroll County Ethics Law No. 37,\u201d and enjoined the County Commissioners from \u201cinterfering with [Lennon\u2019s] duties as a member of the Planning Commission of Carroll County for the balance of his term.\u201d Lennon subsequently resigned from the Planning Commission on May 20, 1997. The Ethics Commission noted this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We must first decide whether a live controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>still exists and, if so, whether the Ethics Commission is entitled to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Lennon first argues that the appeal should be dismissed because the case is now moot. Specifically, Lennon says that the assurance he made to the Carroll County Commissioners to \u201crefrain from such outside employment in the future,\u201d coupled with his subsequent resignation from the Planning Commission, moots the original controversy between the parties. Appeals may indeed be dismissed for mootness under Md. Rule 8-602(a)(10). The Court of Appeals has articulated the test for mootness as whether \u201ca case presents a controversy between the parties for which, by way of resolution, the court can fashion an effective remedy.\u201d <em>Adkins v. State, </em>324 Md. 641, 646, 598 A.2d 194, 197 (1991) (citing <em>Robinson v. Lee, </em>317 Md. 371, 375, 564 A.2d 395, 397 (1989)); <em>Attorney General v. Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749, 752 (1979). Unlike the Article III constitutional constraints on the federal courts, however, our mootness doctrine is based entirely on prudential considerations. <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 296-97, 380 A.2d 12, 22 (1977); See also <em>State v. Peterson, </em>315 Md. 73, 82, 553 A.2d 672, 677 (1989) (\u201c[T]here is no <em>constitutional </em>prohibition which bars [our courts] from expressing its views on the merits of a case which becomes moot during appellate proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added)). As a result, we may decide a case, even though it is moot, \u201cwhere there is an imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern____\u201d <em>Anne Arundel County School Bus, </em>286 Md. at 328, 407 A.2d 749. Moreover, there are other exceptions to the mootness doctrine that allow a court to pass on questions that may, technically, be moot, such as, where one party voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>withdraws from the challenged conduct. For the reasons discussed below, we find that a live controversy exists and, therefore, hold that this case is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In arguing that this case is moot, Lennon overlooks the critical distinction between the two remedies he requested in his lawsuit: an injunction and a declaratory judgment. The distinction is obvious in the definitions of the two forms of relief. Injunctive relief is relief \u201cprohibiting someone from doing some specified act or commanding someone to undo some wrong or injury ... [generally it is a preventive and protective remedy, <em>aimed at future acts, </em>and it is not intended to redress past wrongs.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 784 (6th ed.1990) (emphasis added). Declaratory relief, by contrast, is a \u201cremedy for the determination of a justiciable controversy where the plaintiff is in doubt as to his legal rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. The Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 3-409(a) (1973), provides that a court may grant a declaratory judgment ... \u201cif it will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding, and if: (1) An actual controversy exists between the parties ... [and] (3) A party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege and this is challenged or denied by an adversary party, who also has or asserts a concrete interest in it.\u201d Interpreting the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, the Supreme Court has stated that <em>\u201cdifferent considerations </em>enter into a federal court\u2019s decision as to declaratory relief, on the one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other.\u201d <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 469, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1221, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974) (quoting <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 166, 93 S.Ct. 705, 733, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973) (citations omitted) (emphasis in <em>Stejfel </em>)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of this difference, the Court noted that, while a resolution between the parties may moot the claim for injunctive relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>courts have a \u201cduty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction.\u201d <em>Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. 241, 254, 88 S.Ct. 391, 399, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967); <em>see Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, </em>416 U.S. 115, 121, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 1697, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><em>Super Tire </em>involved a labor dispute in which the employers of the striking workers brought an action for injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that the regulations according benefits to the striking workers were invalid because they interfered with the policy of free collective bargaining. Before the case was tried, the labor dispute was settled, and the strike ended. The District Court heard the case on the merits, rejecting the mootness claim. The Third Circuit remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss for mootness. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that, \u201ceven though the case for an <em>injunction </em>dissolved with the subsequent settlement of the strike and the strikers\u2019 return to work, the parties to the principal controversy ... may still retain sufficient interests and injury as to justify the award of <em>declaratory relief.\u201d Super Tire, </em>416 U.S. at 121-22, 94 S.Ct. at 1698 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Likewise, in the case at bar, the principal controversy as to whether Lennon\u2019s activities fall within the ambit of the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance is very much \u201calive\u201d and in need of resolution. There is no doubt that Lennon\u2019s claim for <em>injunctive relief </em>became moot upon Lennon\u2019s resignation from the Planning Commission on May 20, 1997, prior to pur consideration. Lennon could not further violate the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance if he was no longer a member of the Carroll County Planning Commission. Indeed, as between Lennon and the Ethics Commission, the trial court did not even grant injunctive relief because Lennon had already assured the Ethics Commission that he would refrain from the challenged conduct. In reversing the Ethics Commission\u2019s opinion, however, the trial court granted declaratory relief in favor of Lennon, finding that he did not violate \u00a7\u00a7 3.c or 3.d of the Ethics Ordinance. That finding is still very much in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Again, the key question is whether, \u201cat the time [the case] is before the court, ... there is [still] an existing controversy between the parties ...,\u201d <em>Anne Arundel School Bus, </em>286 Md. at 327, 407 A.2d 749, and whether the parties continue to assert adverse legal positions in which they maintain a concrete interest. Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 3-409(a)(3). Plainly, the Ethics Commission has a concrete interest in the resolution of the instant litigation. The Ethics Commission is endowed with the power to \u201cprocess and make determinations as to complaints filed by any person alleging violations of [the Ethics Ordinance].\u201d Carroll County Ordinance No.37 \u00a7 2(c). The Ethics Commission has been aggrieved by the lower court\u2019s decision in this case, particularly since the lower court\u2019s summary reversal of the agency\u2019s decision provides very little in the way of interpretive guidance. We find, therefore, that the Commission\u2019s ability to carry out its statutory obligations would be hampered without the benefit of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Moreover, even if we were to find that this case is moot, which we do not, we would decide the issue on the merits because it \u201cinvolves matters of public importance that are likely to recur if not decided now.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel County Professional Firefighters Association v. Anne Arundel County, </em>114 Md.App. 446, 455, 690 A.2d 549, 553 (1997). Although moot cases should be decided only in \u201crare instances,\u201d <em>Reyes, </em>281 Md. at 297, 380 A.2d 12, this case meets all of the requisites for decision. As the Court of Appeals has consistently held, appellate courts may decide moot cases</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">if the public interest clearly will be hurt if the question is not immediately decided, if the matter involved is likely to recur frequently, and its recurrence will involve a relationship between the government and its citizens, or a duty of government, and upon any recurrence, the same difficulty which prevented the appeal at hand from being heard in time is likely again to prevent a decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>Mercy Hospital, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 563, 510 A.2d 562, 565 (1986) (quoting <em>Lloyd v. Supervisors of Election, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>We can think of few issues more important than the public\u2019s confidence in government officials. In ferreting out alleged ethical violations, the Carroll County Ethics Commission performs an essential public function. The issue is perhaps even more acute when it occurs, as in this case, at the local government level, where the government and its citizens have greater contact with one another. Particularly in the smaller counties of our State, attorneys regularly serve on local government agencies in the same jurisdiction in which they practice. Consequently, the question regarding the extent to which attorneys may simultaneously \u201cwear the hat\u201d of both attorney and government official is bound to recur frequently, and attorneys who find themselves in this situation are entitled to know what conduct is in accordance with the statutory provisions. In addition, as we stated above, the Ethics Commission, whose obligation it is to \u201cprocess and make determinations as to ... alleg[ed] violations of the [the Ethics Ordinance],\u201d would be disabled in its efforts to carry out its obligation were the lower court\u2019s ruling insulated from appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Finally, we cannot accept Lennon\u2019s argument that his voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct serves to moot the case. If that were so, appellate review could consistently be foreclosed in cases like this as long as the putative violator resigns from his position or even simply promises to refrain from the challenged conduct. Indeed, the Supreme Court has consistently held that \u201cvoluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a [court] of its power to determine the legality of the practice.\u201d <em>City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 283, 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 1074, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982); <em>United States v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ly, even assuming that the case is moot, we will decide this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The next preliminary issue is whether the Carroll County Ethics Commission is entitled, as a matter of law, to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision. Lennon argues that the Ethics Commission\u2019s enabling statute does not give the Commission the power to appeal and it is \u201c \u2018well established\u2019 in Maryland that an administrative agency acting in a quasi-judicial capacity cannot take an appeal in the absence of statutory authority.\u201d Lennon relies on <em>Board of Zoning Appeals v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 199 A. 540 (1938) and <em>Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Peco, </em>234 Md. 200, 198 A.2d 273 (1964). The Ethics Commission does not dispute that certain quasi-judicial agencies are precluded from taking appeals, but argues that the Ethics Commission, because of its broad executive powers, is not a quasi-judicial agency. We agree with the Ethics Commission and hold, as a matter of law, that it has standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In <em>McKinney, </em>174 Md. at 558, 199 A. 540, the Court found that the Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore City was a quasi-judicial agency, existing by virtue of statute, whose primary responsibility was hearing and deciding appeals from the Buildings Engineer. The Court further found that the Board of Zoning Appeals had \u201cno executive duties ... and it formulate[d] no policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 199 A. 540. Rather, the Board\u2019s function was \u201cmerely to find facts, to apply to those facts rules of law prescribed by the legislature, and to announce the result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 199 A. 540. The Court concluded that since the Board</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">has no interest [in the case] different from that which any judicial or <em>quasi </em>judicial agency would have, which is to decide the cases coming before it fairly and impartially, is in no sense aggrieved by the [lower court\u2019s decision], and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>no statutory right of appeal, it had no power to take this appeal, and the appeal must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 564,199 A. 540. (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Some twenty-five years later, <em>McKinney </em>was reaffirmed in <em>Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Peco, </em>234 Md. 200, 198 A.2d 273 (1964). There, the Court found that the Maryland Board of Pharmacy, because it merely acted on the pharmacy permit applications submitted before it, was a quasi-judicial agency as defined by <em>McKinney, </em>and thus could not appeal an adverse trial court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Just one year ago, however, the Court of Appeals stated, in no uncertain terms, the limitations of the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine, in holding that the Board of Liquor License Commissioners had standing to appeal an adverse circuit court ruling. <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City v. Hollywood Productions, Inc., </em>344 Md. 2, 684 A.2d 837 (1996). The Court noted that \u201cthe functions of certain agencies are so aligned with <em>interpreting and enforcing </em>the State\u2019s policies that the rationale of the <em>McKinney </em>doctrine simply does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 684 A.2d 837 (citing <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 746, 501 A.2d 48, 56 (1985)) (emphasis ours). \u201cIn determining whether the <em>McKinney </em>limitation on the right to appeal is applicable to [a particular] agency,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201cwe consider characteristics such as the authority to adopt rules, investigate complaints, prosecute violators, and issue orders in furtherance of the public interest----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 684 A.2d 837.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With those considerations as our framework, we now decide whether the Ethics Commission has standing to appeal. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The Carroll County Ethics Commission, established by statute in 1982, is composed of three members who are appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>by the Carroll County Commissioners. Carroll County, Md. Ordinance \u00a7 37-82 (1982). The Ethics Commission has the authority to \u201cprocess and make determinations as to complaints [of alleged ethical violations],\u201d and \u201cissue a cease and desist order against any person found to be in violation of [the Ethics Ordinance] and seek enforcement of this order in the Circuit Court for Carroll County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 2(c),7(a). The Ethics Commission therefore possesses the executive, investigatory and prosecutive functions that remove it from the limitations imposed by the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine. <em>See Hollywood Productions, </em>344 Md. at 9-10, 684 A.2d 837. Further, and perhaps more important, the Ethics Commission has the responsibility of protecting the public\u2019s confidence in government by prosecuting the ethical transgressions of government officials. It is almost axiomatic, then, that the Ethics Commission is an agency that \u201crepresents the interests of the public and the State in carrying out their duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 684 A.2d 837. Accordingly, we hold that the Ethics Commission has standing to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We now consider the issue on the merits, namely, whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee, Robert Lennon, finding that he did not violate the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance. We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment to determine whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 43, 656 A.2d 307, 311 (1995). We find that the trial court erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of the Ethics Ordinance and, accordingly, reverse that court\u2019s opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">As we noted, the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>SECTION 3 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">Carroll County officials and employees who are subject to this Ordinance shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">c. Be employed by a business entity that: has or is negotiating a contract of more than $3,500.00 with the County or is regulated by their agency; except as exempted by the Commission pursuant to Section 6 of this Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The Ethics Commission contends that Lennon provided private legal services to Samuel and Linda Battaglia in connection with an off-conveyance (subdivision) application for a parcel of property owned by the Battaglias in Carroll County; that, the attorney-client relationship commenced in late 1994, and continued, at least, through April 1995, when Lennon completed the necessary deeds for the Battaglia real estate; that, during the period in which Lennon represented the Battaglias, the Battaglias also had a proposal to extend water and sewer service to their property; that the water and sewer proposal was before the Planning Commission, and that Lennon was a member of that Commission at the time; and that, on March 21, 1995, the date on which the Battaglia proposal came up for consideration and vote before the Planning Commission, Lennon \u201cparticipated in the discussion of the ... Battaglia plan, moved for approval of the Battaglia plan, and voted to approve the Battaglia plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">We agree with the Ethics Commission that there are essentially three elements that must be satisfied to establish a violation of \u00a7 3.c of the Ethics Ordinance:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>(1) The individual must be a Carroll County official subject to the Ordinance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">(2) The Carroll County official must be employed by a business entity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">(3) The employing business entity must be regulated by the official\u2019s agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The parties do not dispute that Lennon, as a member of the Carroll County Planning Commission, was a county official subject to the Ethics Ordinance, nor do they dispute that Lennon\u2019s legal representation of the Battaglias constituted \u201cemploy[ment] by a business entity\u201d as defined by the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, the point upon which the parties disagree is the third prong, namely, whether the employing business entity, the Battaglias, was regulated by Lennon\u2019s agency, the Planning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">In analyzing this aspect of the case, we believe the trial court seriously misinterpreted the statute. Indeed, by framing the \u201ccentral issue\u201d as \u201cwhether the Planning Commission regulates \u2018off-conveyance applications,\u201d\u2019 the lower court\u2019s analysis was flawed from the outset, as Lennon\u2019s actions with respect to the off-conveyance applications were only one part of the Ethics Commission\u2019s inquiry. The better analysis, and the one undertaken by the Ethics Commission, is to consider, separately, two distinct but related aspects of Lennon\u2019s activities as they relate to his membership on the Planning Commission: his involvement in the Battaglias\u2019 proposal to extend water and sewer service, <em>as well as </em>his handling of off-conveyance applications. We examine these two issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Lennon\u2019s first contact with the Battaglias came in late 1994, when the couple requested the attorney\u2019s services in preparing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>an off-conveyance application. At around the same time, on December 20, 1994, the Battaglias\u2019 proposal to extend water and sewer service came before the Planning Commission for preliminary consideration. Lennon recused himself from this meeting and took no part in the consideration of the Battaglia proposal. On March 6, 1995, he resumed his work on the Battaglia off-conveyance, filing the necessary application with the Department of Permits and Regulations. The application was approved on March 9,1995, and in April Lennon prepared the necessary deeds for the off-conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The critical date, however, was March 21, 1995. On that occasion, the Planning Commission met for final consideration and vote on the Battaglias\u2019 proposal to extend water and sewer service to their property. This time, Lennon, the Battaglias\u2019 attorney for their off-conveyance application, not only participated in the discussion of the Battaglia plan, but also \u201cmoved for approval of the Battaglia plan, and voted to approve the Battaglia plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Ethics Commission found that Lennon\u2019s participation at this meeting constituted a violation of \u00a7 3.c of the Ethics Ordinance because, at the time of the meeting, Lennon\u2019s clients were \u201cregulated by the Commission of which Lennon [was] a member.\u201d The trial court summarily reversed this finding, without so much as attempting to ascertain the meaning of the term \u201cregulate\u201d as used in the statute. We find that the plain meaning of the term \u201cregulate\u201d supports the conclusion reached by the Ethics Commission and, therefore, reverse the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Since the term \u201cregulate\u201d is not defined in either the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance, or the analogous state conflicts of interest provision, see Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 15-501(a)(2)(v) (1995), we must give the term its \u201cplain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. v. Director of Finance, </em>343 Md. 567, 578, 683 A.2d 512 (1996); <em>Antwerpen Dodge, Ltd. v. Herb Gordon Auto World, </em>117 Md.App. 290, 699 A.2d 1209, 1219 (1997). \u201cRegulate\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>la: to govern or direct according to rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">lb: to bring under control of law or constituted authority; Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, 985 (10th ed.1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We conclude that the Battaglias were, in fact, regulated by the Planning Commission. Although Lennon correctly notes that both the County Commissioners and the State Department of the Environment have supervisory authority over County water and sewerage plans, <em>see </em>Md.Code. Ann., Envir., \u00a7\u00a7 9-503, 9-507 (1989), there is no doubt that the Planning Commission plays a critical role in the regulatory scheme. While it by no means guarantees ultimate approval, a favorable recommendation by the Planning Commission surely increases the likelihood that a proposal will be adopted by governing authorities. In addition to the above-quoted \u201cplain meaning\u201d definition, our appraisal of the term \u201cregulate\u201d is informed by the Court of Appeals\u2019 instructive analysis in <em>Mount Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Co. v. Frankfort Marine Accident and Plate Glass Ins. Co., </em>111 Md. 561, 75 A. 105 (1909). There the Court held that a statute that purports to regulate an activity is better understood as \u201ccarry[ing] into effective operation a scheme,\u201d rather than providing for \u201ctotal abolition\u201d of the activity. <em>Mount Vernon, </em>at 567, 75 A. 105 (quoting <em>Whitman v. State, </em>80 Md. 410, 416, 31 A. 325 (1895)) (emphasis ours). We find that reasoning persuasive and conclude that the term \u201cregulate\u201d is broad enough to encompass the kind of advisory authority that the Planning Commission possesses in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Lennon argues, however, that his participation in the March 21 meeting is not a violation of the Ethics Ordinance because the water and sewer proposal was unrelated to the off-conveyance, the matter on which he represented the Battaglias as an attorney. We find no merit in this argument. The Ethics Ordinance\u2019s prohibition on outside employment is categorical. There is no limitation that the outside employment be related in any way to the matter that is before the county agency, so long as the <em>employer </em>is regulated by the agency. Indeed, Lennon\u2019s participation in voting on the Bat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>taglia water and sewer proposal would have been just as unethical had he represented the Battaglias on an unrelated personal injury action. The fact that Lennon was employed by the Battaglias as their attorney and participated, in his capacity as a public official, in approving his clients\u2019 proposal, is sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Lennon also argues that there was no violation because the Planning Commission\u2019s vote was merely an \u201c \u2018up or down vote\u2019 on a single issue which had been recommended and approved by every other body, department, or agency which had considered it.\u201d Again, we disagree. It is immaterial that other subordinate agencies had already approved the Battaglia plan; the plan still required the final approval of the Planning Commission, and Lennon played a significant role in that approval. As the Ethics Commission correctly noted in its brief in opposition to summary judgment, \u201c[t]he Ordinance does not except from its operation non-controversial or routine matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Finally, Lennon argues that he was no longer the Battaglias\u2019 attorney on March 21,1995, the day on which he participated in the Planning Commission meeting. The trial court apparently agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">This Court further finds that the employment relationship between the Plaintiff and the Battaglia\u2019s [sic] was concluded before the March 21, 1995 Planning Commission meeting. In fact, the Battaglia\u2019s [sic] were no longer Plaintiffs clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">We find nothing in the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Lennon filed the Battaglias\u2019 off-conveyance application on March 6, 1995, the application was approved on March 9, 1995, and Lennon notified the Battaglias of the approval on March 13, 1995. Then, in April 1995, just two weeks after the Planning Commission meeting, Lennon prepared the necessary deeds for the Battaglias\u2019 property. Lennon would have us believe that he was acting as the Battaglias\u2019 attorney on March 6, March 9, and March 13, and in the early part of April, but somehow not on March 21. In the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of any persuasive evidence to the contrary, we must be guided by common sense, and assume that Lennon was the Battaglias\u2019 attorney throughout the two-month span.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The only evidence to which Lennon directs us in support of his position is the \u201cexpert\u201d testimony of Charles O. Fisher, Sr. Mr. Fisher testified before the County Commissioners that \u201canother very important aspect of what I\u2019ve heard today is that ... the employment of Mr. Lennon in [the Battaglia matter] terminated on at least the 13th day of March, and they were no longer his clients.\u201d Lennon\u2019s representation to this Court that Mr. Fisher testified as an expert witness is not supported by the record of this case. Although the lower court did note that \u201cMr. Fisher <em>has been </em>qualified as an expert witness on legal matters\u201d before various courts in Maryland (emphasis ours), there is no indication that he testified as an expert in this case. In any event, the proceedings before the County Commissioners are not part of the record, and Lennon concedes that this argument \u201cwas not presented directly to the Appellant Ethics Commission.\u201d We, therefore, reject the testimony of Mr. Fisher as it relates to this issue. Finding no other support for Lennon\u2019s position, we view the trial court\u2019s finding as clearly erroneous, and conclude that Lennon was, in fact, employed by the Battaglias on March 21,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Turning our attention to the second aspect of the Ethics Commission\u2019s inquiry, we conclude that Lennon violated the Ethics Ordinance by handling off-conveyance applications on behalf of the Battaglias and other private clients. As he argued with respect to the water and sewer proposal, Lennon\u2019s defense to the off-conveyance applications is that they are not regulated by the Planning Commission. He argues that those \u201coff-conveyances which do not involve a new street or a planned public project ... are reviewed and acted upon by a completely different agency; [t]hus, in no sense are those applicants \u2018regulated\u2019 by the Commission on which Mr. Lennon served.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Rather, our review of the record reveals that off-conveyance applications are evaluated by the Planning Commission in the regular course of business. Indeed, the minutes from the December 20, 1994 Planning Commission meeting show that the Planning Commission considered and approved an off-conveyance application for the \u201cOsbourne property.\u201d The minutes also indicate that Lennon was the Osbournes\u2019 attorney for their off-conveyance application, though Lennon did recuse himself as he had previously done when the Battaglia water and sewer proposal was considered. In defending his representation of the Osbourne application, Lennon argues that \u201c[he] had no reason to anticipate a conflict with a proposed street at the time of his representation of the Osbournes or knew [sic] that the subject would be on a Planning Commission agenda.\u201d In effect, Lennon is engrafting a <em>scienter </em>requirement into the statute. That is, because he <em>knew </em>that the Battaglia off-conveyance did not involve a planned street or public project he could handle that application and that, because he <em>did not know </em>that the Osbourne application did involve a planned street, he cannot be held accountable for handling that application. We reject that proposition. The Ethics Ordinance does not contain a <em>scienter </em>requirement, and violations of the Ordinance should not turn on the subtle distinctions that Lennon proposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the Maryland Public Ethics Law, from which the Carroll County Ethics Ordinance was derived, was to ensure that \u201c ... the people maintain[ ] the highest trust in their government officials and employees,\u201d and to assure the \u201cimpartiality and independent judgment of those officials and employees.\u201d Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 15-101(a). Further, the Legislature intended that the ethical provisions be \u201cliberally construed to accomplish this purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15-101(e). In view of the Legislature\u2019s clear intent in this area, we conclude that Lennon, then a Carroll County official, violated the Ethics Ordinance when he handled off-conveyance applications for the Battaglias and the Osbournes, as both the Battaglias and the Osbournes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>business entities subject to regulation by the Planning Commission, the agency on which Lennon sat.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Again, it is not necessary that the Planning Commission review every off-conveyance application. Rather, the fact that the Planning Commission possesses the authority to review the off-conveyance applications and does, in fact, review certain applications is enough to render Lennon\u2019s outside employment improper.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF ENTERING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT, CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">APPELLEE TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-11\">.
