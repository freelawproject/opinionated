The trial court (Leasure, J., presiding) concluded that the forfeiture did violate Tennant\u2019s right. We agree with the trial judge and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Tennant owned a business in Howard County called Maryland Car Care, Inc. His entire income during all periods here relevant was derived from that corporation. In August 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Tennant purchased the Corvette that is the subject of this case with income from the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Tennant became addicted to cocaine and heroin in June 1995. Tennant\u2019s girlfriend, Kimberly Houck,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was employed as the bookkeeper for Maryland Car Care, Inc. Ms. Houck also was addicted to cocaine and heroin. Between June 1995 and January 1996, she purchased at least some of the drugs that she used from Rodney Smith (Smith) and Smith\u2019s wife, Yvonne Jackson (Jackson). Between June 28, 1995, and the latter part of January 1996, Ms. Houck wrote numerous checks to either Smith or Jackson. The payor of these checks was Maryland Car Care, Inc. The checks bore the signature of Tennant but, according to Tennant\u2019s later testimony, he neither signed the checks nor authorized anyone to sign them on his behalf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On January 24, 1996, Tennant attended a Board of Directors meeting of a family-owned corporation at which he threatened to commit suicide. The family notified the police to be on the lookout for Tennant, who was driving a purple Corvette. Shortly thereafter, Officer Guy Williams, of the Howard County Police Department, saw Tennant pull into the driveway to his home. Tennant emerged from the Corvette and was confronted by Officer Williams who asked for his license and registration. Tennant stepped back into his Corvette and opened a console to retrieve the registration card. When he did so, Officer Williams noticed a home-made crack pipe inside the console. Tennant was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia. He was then searched. In his pants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>pocket the police found a baggie and a small box. Police suspected that both items contained cocaine. Later tests confirmed that the small box contained .05 grams of cocaine, but the baggie taken from appellant\u2019s pocket contained 2.2 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Tennant pled not guilty to the criminal charges of possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of controlled dangerous substances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was found guilty of both charges in the District Court for Howard County. The findings of guilt were stricken, however, and he was given a disposition of probation before judgment pursuant to Article 27, section 641A, of the Maryland Annotated Code (1957,1992 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tennant was placed on three years active probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Approximately six weeks after his arrest on the drug charges, Howard County filed a \u201cComplaint to Acquire a Motor Vehicle.\u201d In the Complaint, the County alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Tennant\u2019s 1994 Corvette was subject to forfeiture to the County pursuant to Article 27, section 297(b)(4),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the vehicle \u201cwas used or intended to be used to facilitate the transportation of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, and controlled paraphernalia, in violation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A trial in the forfeiture case was held in the Circuit Court for Howard County on October 21, 1996. At the trial, very few facts were in dispute. Tennant admitted that on the day of his arrest he did possess both heroin and cocaine together with a crack pipe. Tennant, who was called by the County as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>an adverse witness, testified that he could not remember if he had used drugs on the day of his arrest. He admitted, however, that he probably had consumed drugs that day because, as of that date, he had a severe drug addiction. He was unable to say for sure if other persons had used drugs while in the 1994 Corvette, but he conceded that Ms. Houck could have done so, possibly \u201ctwo, three, [or] four [times].\u201d Tennant testified that he could not think of anyone other than Ms. Houck who may have used drugs in his Corvette.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">During the course of his testimony, Tennant invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions regarding the identity of his drug supplier(s), whether Ms. Houck ever procured drugs for him, whether Smith ever procured drugs for him, or whether he used the crack pipe found in his car on the day of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The parties agreed at trial that the Corvette had a value of approximately $20,000. It was also agreed that Tennant owned a 1988 Ford pick-up truck and a Datsun 300Z in addition to the Corvette.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Tennant argues that the forfeiture of his Corvette, under the circumstances of this case, would violate the excessive fines prohibition set forth in Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 25 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Excessive bail, fines and punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted, by the Courts of Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The trial judge, relying on the test set forth in <em>Aravanis v. Somerset County, </em>339 Md. 644, 665, 664 A.2d 888 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1115, 116 S.Ct. 916, 133 L.Ed.2d 846 (1996), ruled that the excessive fines provision in Article 25 prevented her from awarding Howard County title to Tennant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">Both this Court and the Court of Special Appeals, when reviewing a case tried without a jury, must \u201creview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(c) (1995 Repl.Vol.). The Court must \u201cnot set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous,\u201d and must \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and decide not whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusions of fact were correct, but only whether they were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><em>Urban Site Venture II Ltd. Partnership v. Levering Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>340 Md. 223, 229-30, 665 A.2d 1062 (1995) (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">There are four basic legal propositions that must be kept in mind whenever a forfeiture action is before the Court. First, a forfeiture action is a civil <em>in rem </em>proceeding subject to an \u201cexcessive fines\u201d analysis. <em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 651, 664 A.2d 888. Second, forfeitures are not favored in the law and should be avoided whenever possible. <em>State ex rel. Frederick City Police Dept. v. One Toyota Pick-Up Truck, </em>334 Md. 359, 375, 639 A.2d 641 (1994). Third, the burden of proof necessary to sustain a forfeiture, is that of a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blue Bird Cab Co., </em>263 Md. 655, 659, 284 A.2d 203 (1971). Fourth, Article 25 of the Declaration of Rights is, \u201ctextually and historically, substantially identical to the Eighth Amendment\u201d to the United States Constitution and thus \u201cshould be interpreted coextensively with the excessive fines provision of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 656-57, 664 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">In <em>Aravanis, </em>the petitioner, George Aravanis, owned a farm in Somerset County, Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 646, 664 A.2d 888. He used the farm as part of a marijuana distribution enterprise. <em>Id. </em>The police received word of Mr. Aravanis\u2019s illicit activities, searched the farm, and found approximately two pounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of marijuana within a gas barbeque grill located outside his house. They also found marijuana plants growing near the house and drug paraphernalia in Mr. Aravanis\u2019s possession. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 664 A.2d 888. Aravanis pled guilty to one count of possession of a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity to indicate an attempt to manufacture, distribute, or dispense (the marijuana) as prohibited by Article 27, section 286. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Aravanis, </em>Somerset County sought forfeiture of Mr. Aravanis\u2019s real property due to Aravanis\u2019s violation of Maryland\u2019s drug laws. The trial judge concluded that Aravanis\u2019s farm was used in connection with the distributing of marijuana and that, because no statutory exceptions applied, the court had no discretion to do anything except order forfeiture of the farm. Aravanis challenged the forfeiture as an excessive fine under both the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The <em>Aravanis </em>Court reversed the trial court and held that, upon remand, the court should analyze whether Article 25 barred the forfeiture. <em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 657, 664 A.2d 888. The trial court was directed to apply two separate tests to determine whether forfeiture of Aravanis\u2019s property constituted an \u201cexcessive fine\u201d within the meaning of Article 25. The first is commonly called the \u201cinstrumentality test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657-58, 664 A.2d 888. The instrumentality test, among other things, inquires as to whether \u201cthe relationship of the property to the offense ... [is] close enough to render the property, under traditional standards, \u2018guilty\u2019 and hence forfeitable.\u201d <em>Austin v. United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 628, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 2815, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring). The second is the \u201cproportionality\u201d test, which compares the enormity of the loss to the owner with the gravity, scope, and duration of the illegal activity, and the degree of the owner\u2019s culpability. <em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 665, 664 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">A. The Instrumentality Test</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Chief Judge Robert Bell, writing for the Court in <em>Aravanis, </em>recognized that one of the most important cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>articulating the factors to be applied when utilizing the instrumentality test was <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>36 F.3d 358 (4th Cir.1994). Judge Bell said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><em>Chandler </em>presents a forceful and well articulated defense of the instrumentality test. The court formulated a three part test for determining the excessiveness of an <em>in rem </em>forfeiture under the Eighth Amendment. That test \u201cconsiders (1) the nexus between the offense and the property and the extent of the property\u2019s role in the offense, (2) the role and culpability of the owner, and (3) the possibility of separating offending property that can readily be separated from the remainder.\u201d 36 F.3d at 365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 661, 664 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The <em>Aravanis </em>Court later made it clear that on remand the trial court should use the three factors set forth in <em>Chandler </em>when applying the instrumentality test to the facts of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 664 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">1. The Nexus Prong</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">A court should first attempt to measure \u201cthe strength and extent of the nexus between the property and the offense.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>36 F.3d at 365. In assessing this factor, a court looks at five items, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">(1) the extent to which the use of the property was deliberate and planned or merely incidental and fortuitous; (2) the property\u2019s importance to the success of the illegal activity; (3) how long the property was used and the spatial extent of its use; (4) whether the illegal use was isolated or repetitive; and (5) the purpose for acquiring, maintaining or using the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\"><em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 661, 664 A.2d 888 (citing <em>Chandler, </em>36 F.3d at 365).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>found that the vehicle was being used to transport Tennant home from a Board of Directors\u2019 meeting, but that the vehicle was not \u201cdeliberately\u201d being used to \u201ctransport controlled dangerous substances.\u201d In Judge Leasure\u2019s words: \u201cThe testimony and evidence did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>not show ... that the subject vehicle had anything other than a <em>de minimis </em>role regarding the offenses of which [defendant was convicted.\u201d The court noted that the vehicle was acquired by Tennant prior to the date he developed a drug habit and thus, implicitly, the court was of the view that the vehicle was not purchased for purposes connected with the transportation of drugs or drug paraphernalia. The trial judge concluded that the nexus between the Corvette and the offenses charged was so insubstantial that it failed to justify the forfeiture of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">2. Owner Culpability Prong</p>\n<p id=\"Av6\">As to the second prong of the instrumentality test (the role and culpability of the owners), the trial court\u2019s only comment was that the owner admitted his guilt as to the offenses charged in the forfeiture petition. This factor simply \u201cgives recognition to the fact that the forfeiture statute is a punitive statute and that the person punished is the owner of the property.\u201d <em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 661, 664 A.2d 888 (citing <em>Chandler, </em>36 F.3d at 364). In regard to the property owner\u2019s culpability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Proof of the relevant factors in a forfeiture case is not limited to a particular offense charged. Proof of the duration and extent of the course of criminal activity and its nexus to the property may be appropriate, and the State may well wish to show the extent of profit to the owner from this course of conduct because that fact bears on the question of how much the owner actually loses by the forfeiture. Profits from the illegal activity may be shown by direct evidence, or indirectly through a showing of net worth of the owner and the absence of other known or demonstrable sources of income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 665 n. 16, 664 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In the case at hand, there was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which it could be inferred that Tennant sold drugs or had any connection with the drugs other than as a user. Moreover, there was no indication that Tennant had a prior criminal record. Tennant did not profit by his connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tion with drugs. Instead, the uncontroverted evidence showed that he, like most drug addicts, paid a heavy financial price for his failure to say \u201cno\u201d to drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">3. Possibility of Separating Property</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The third prong of the instrumentality test (the possibility of separating offending property from the remainder) had no applicability to this case. Obviously, there was no possibility of dividing the Corvette into \u201coffending\u201d and \u201cnon-offending\u201d parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Weighing the three factors, the trial judge ultimately opined, \u201c[T]he application of the instrumentality test to the underlying facts of this case does not support forfeiture of the subject vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">B. The Proportionality Test</p>\n<p id=\"AtU\">Proportionality, as that term is used here, does not include the necessity to compare forfeiture laws or practices of other jurisdictions \u2014 it means simply that there must be a comparison of the extent of the loss to the relevant factors involved, including the gravity and extent of the illegal activity, <em>the nexus between that conduct and the subject property, </em>and the extent of involvement of the owner \u2014 all to determine whether the \u201cfine\u201d is out of all reasonable proportion to the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\"><em>Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 665, 664 A.2d 888 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">As can be seen, the proportionality test also includes a nexus prong, which has been already discussed. This test also requires the trial judge to compare the extent of the loss to the property owner with (1) the gravity and extent of the illegal activity and (2) the extent of the involvement of the owner. Judge Leasure carefully examined both these factors. She found that the canceled checks from Tennant\u2019s business payable to Smith and Jackson only supported the inference that \u201csubstantial funds were expended to support ... Tennant\u2019s and/or his girlfriend\u2019s drug habits.\u201d As to the gravity of the offense, the court stressed that Tennant was not a distributor or manufacturer of illegal drugs. Moreover, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>trial court\u2019s view, the value of the Corvette greatly exceeded the value of the drugs and drug paraphernalia that Tennant possessed when he was arrested. Lastly, the court found that the Corvette was not \u201csubstantially\u201d used for \u201cillegal purposes.\u201d She opined that forfeiture of the $20,000 vehicle was \u201cout of all reasonable proportion to the relevant factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">C. Appellant\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Howard County makes four arguments in support of its contention that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed: (1) the trial court erred in not drawing an adverse inference from Tennant\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment; (2) appellant had the burden of proof to show that forfeiture amounted to an excessive f\u00edne but failed to meet that burden; (3) the principles of <em>Aravanis </em>and <em>Austin, supra, </em>are inapplicable to cases involving forfeiture of personal property; and (4) assuming the <em>Aravanis </em>test is applicable, the trial court \u201cunduly limited itself to the excessive fines cases without considering the facts of the ... [subject] case or the statutory basis for [the] forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Appellant says in its brief,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">The lower court compounded its error by refusing to consider the effect of Douglas Tennant\u2019s repeated assertion of the Fifth Amendment to questions about his drug use, the source of his drugs and the cars used in transporting and use of those drugs.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> By the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege, an adverse inference is drawn and the [claimant is precluded from introducing evidence to challenge that inference. See <em>Whitaker v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 368, 514 A.2d 4 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>First of. all, <em>Whitaker </em>does not hold, as appellant implies, that an adverse inference <em>must </em>be drawn merely because a witness invokes his or her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See Whitaker, </em>307 Md. at 385-87, 514 A.2d 4. The inference is merely permitted. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the trial judge did not \u201crefuse\u201d to consider the effect of Tennant\u2019s invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination. Trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it correctly. <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 273, 619 A.2d 105 (1993). For obvious reasons, trial judges are not required to spell out every step used in their reasoning process to reach legal or factual conclusions. <em>See Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 356, 664 A.2d 453 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Because a claim that forfeiture is an excessive fine is an affirmative defense, we agree with appellant\u2019s argument that appellee had the burden of proving excessiveness by a preponderance of evidence. <em>See United States v. 152 Char-Nor Manor Boulevard, Chestertown, Md., </em>922 F.Supp. 1064, 1071-72 (D.Md., 1996), <em>aff'd, </em>114 F.3d 1178 (4th Cir.1997). This does not help appellant, however, because, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Tennant, he met that initial burden by his testimony, coupled with the stipulation that the Corvette was worth approximately $20,000, and by appellant\u2019s own evidence, which supplied proof that would support the inference that the cocaine mentioned in the forfeiture petition was of minuscule value.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellant says in its brief that \u201c[this] case does not involve an attempt to forfeit real property. In a strict sense, the principles of <em>Aravanis </em>and <em>Austin </em>are not applicable.\u201d Significantly, appellant fails to say why those cases are inapplicable or why the fact that the subject case does not involve real property is relevant. We hold that the principles set forth in <em>Aravanis </em>and <em>Austin </em>are applicable to cases, such as this one, dealing with personal property. Similarly, in <em>Thompson v. Grindle, </em>113 Md.App. 477, 688 A.2d 466, <em>cert. granted, </em>346 Md. 28, 694 A.2d 951, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>348 Md. 198, 702 A.2d 1272 (1997), we applied Aravanis\u2019s excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>fines analysis to the forfeiture of a motor vehicle and other personal property. <em>Id. </em>at 485-86, 688 A.2d 466.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">Lastly, appellant contends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">Notwithstanding [the inapplicability of <em>Aravanis </em>and <em>Austin </em>] ... the Court below unduly limited itself to the analysis of the excessive fines cases without considering the facts of this case, or the statutory basis for forfeiture (the seized asset, a car, facilitated the transportation of drugs). In so doing, it implicitly ruled that possession of controlled dangerous substances in a car can never be a basis for forfeiture, contrary to both statutory and existing case law. It is only in rare situations that forfeiture will be excessive in a constitutional sense. See <em>United States v. Wild, </em>47 F.3d 669 (4th Cir.1995), interpreting <em>in personam </em>criminal forfeiture, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Although it is true that the trial judge focused her attention on precedent dealing with the issue of excessive fines, this was understandable because that was the precise issue to be decided. The <em>Aravanis </em>case was authority that the trial court was bound to follow when interpreting and applying Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In applying the <em>Aravanis </em>test, the trial court explicitly recognized that the County had a statutory basis for the forfeiture of the vehicle and implicitly found that the County had established that statutory right. In fact, an \u201cexcessive fines\u201d analysis is only necessary after the court finds that the sovereign has the statutory right to exact a \u201cfine.\u201d The question the trial court addressed was whether enforcement of the forfeiture statute, under the circumstances of this case, violated a higher law, i.e., Article 25. In answering this question, the trial judge, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, did consider in detail \u201cthe facts of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the lower court clearly did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201cimplicitly rule[ ] that possession of controlled dangerous substances in a car can never be a basis for forfeiture.\u201d She applied the tests set forth in <em>Amvanis </em>and simply ruled that forfeiture was not warranted under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Wild, </em>47 F.3d at 675, is misplaced. In <em>Wild, </em>the Court refused to apply the instrumentality test set forth in <em>Chandler, swpra, </em>because, unlike <em>Chandler, </em>the case dealt with a fine imposed as part of a criminal prosecution, i.e., an <em>in personam </em>criminal forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(2) and (3). <em>Wild, </em>47 F.3d at 675. Fines imposed in criminal forfeiture cases \u201care the equivalent of monetary punishment assessed against criminal defendants for the commission of some offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677. In contrast, the case at hand deals with a civil <em>in rem </em>proceeding where \u201c[forfeitures are not favored.\u201d <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. State, </em>258 Md. 192, 199, 265 A.2d 748 (1970) (quoting 36 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Forfeitures and Penalties </em>\u00a7 8 (1968), and 3 J. Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7\u00a7 603-06 (3d ed. 1943)). Unlike the <em>Wild </em>Court, we are obliged to apply the <em>Chandler </em>test. <em>See Aravanis, </em>339 Md. at 658, 664 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The instrumentality test requires us to consider whether the relationship of Tennant\u2019s 1994 Corvette to the offenses committed by Tennant is close enough to render the property \u201cguilty.\u201d The vehicle was purchased by Tennant by use of funds legitimately obtained, and he made no illicit profit by use of the Corvette. As in <em>Thompson, supra, </em>in which the police found a \u201csmall amount of cocaine and marijuana\u201d in the pocket of a vehicle owner\u2019s shirt at the time of arrest, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Md.App. at 481, 688 A.2d 466, the relationship between the drugs mentioned in the forfeiture petition and Tennant\u2019s Corvette was \u201cincidental and fortuitous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 688 A.2d 466. This situation contrasts sharply from one where the vehicle owner uses the vehicle to distribute drugs or uses the vehicle as a place from which to make drug sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Giving deference as we must to the factual findings of the trial judge, Md.Rule 8-131(c), we hold that the trial judge was not clearly erroneous when she applied the instrumentality test and found, in effect, that the vehicle was \u201cnot guilty.\u201d As for the proportionality test, it is significant that the drugs possessed by Tennant were in small enough quantities that he was not charged with possession with intent to distribute. He was charged, instead, with two relatively minor misdemeanors. Ultimately his convictions were stricken, and a sentence of probation before verdict imposed. In the grand scheme of things, Tennant\u2019s crime was not grave; the value of Tennant\u2019s car was great, and it is likely that the County coveted the car for that reason.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court was not clearly erroneous in holding that the forfeiture of the $20,000 vehicle was \u201cout of all reasonable proportion\u201d when compared to \u201cthe relevant factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COST TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">. Ms. Houck is erroneously referred to as \"Kimberly Haught\u201d in the trial transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">. The total of the checks payable to either Smith or Jackson from Maryland Car Care's account was over $250,000. Tennant testified at the forfeiture hearing that he knew that some of the checks were signed, without his permission or consent, by Ms. Houck. As to the remainder, he testified that these too were signed without his permission, but he was unsure as to the identity of the person who signed them. He did note that Ms. Houck had access to a signature stamp bearing his (Tennant\u2019s) name during the relevant time period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">. The record does not show whether the controlled dangerous substance he was charged with possessing was cocaine or heroin or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. All references to statutes in this opinion are to Article 27, Maryland Annotated Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. The County also alleged that the Corvette had been purchased with proceeds from the sale of drugs. The County abandoned this theory at the end of the forfeiture hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b126-10\">. Due to the fact that Howard County had not received the test results from the drug lab as of March 5, 1996, the County did not allege in its forfeiture Complaint that the Corvette was used to facilitate the transportation of heroin. Drug tests were not performed until May 29, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[7]\">\n<p id=\"b133-11\">7. Appellant does not say what inferences it wanted the trial judge to draw from the refusal to answer questions about \"his drug use or the source of his drugs.\u201d Tennant admitted he was a heavy drug user. Given that admission, the source of his drugs would appear to be irrelevant in applying either the instrumentality or the proportionality test. Tennant did not refuse to answer any question \"regarding the cars\u201d he used in transporting the drugs he purchased; instead, he refused, on Fifth Amendment grounds, to answer questions as to whether he had used drugs while in the Corvette.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">. Appellant points to no fact that the trial court failed, to consider other than the fact that exhibits introduced by appellant showed the quantities of drugs found on Tennant\u2019s person. The trial judge said in her opinion that \"there was no testimony presented regarding the quantity of drugs in [djefendant [sic] possession at the time of his offense.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>While technically there was no testimony, there was <em>evidence </em>as to the quantity of drugs. Drug reports introduced by appellant showed that Tennant possessed 2.2 grams of heroin and .05 grams of cocaine. There was no direct evidence as to the value of the drugs. Appellant fails to point out in its brief how the trial court\u2019s lapse in overlooking the quantity of drugs might have made any difference in applying either the instrumentality or proportionality test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. That the County's decision to seek forfeiture was probably based on its eagerness to acquire a valuable car rather than on other factors can be inferred from the fact that the County filed its forfeiture complaint before it received test results of the controlled dangerous substance found on appellant's person and thus before it knew what, if any, drugs were transported in the Corvette.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
