MURPHY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Al7\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">This case presents one question: Does money earned by working overtime constitute \u201cactual income\u201d for purposes of determining child support payments under Maryland Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol., 1996 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 12-201(c) of the Family Law Article? We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Denise and Joseph Brown divorced on February 7, 1986. Full custody was awarded to Mrs. Brown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Appellant), and Mr. Brown (Appellee) was ordered to pay child support for the couple\u2019s two children. Ten years later, Appellant sought an increase in child support \u2014 she was receiving $150.00 per week at that time \u2014 to help defray the cost of sending the children to private schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">At a hearing in August of 1996 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Appellee testified that he had been working as a tractor-trailer driver about 60 hours a week during the previous seven or eight years and about 50 hours a week when he and Appellant separated. Appellee contended that his child support obligations should be calculated on a 40-hour work week and not include the extra hours on the job for which he received time-and-a-half pay. The trial court agreed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">We have had a Court of Appeals opinion having to do with alimony that indicated it had to be forty hours. We have not had a Court of Appeals opinion dealing with child support. I\u2019m convinced that when the appellate court gets around to it they will say child support is forty hours a week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The court ordered Appellee\u2019s weekly child support payments increased to $162.50. According to Appellant, had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>court included Appellee\u2019s substantial overtime earnings as \u201cactual income\u201d under the statute, that weekly figure would have risen to $228.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Court of Appeals opinion on alimony to which the trial court referred is <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 614 A.2d 590 (1992), which interpreted Title 11 of the Family Law Article, specifically \u00a7 11-106, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">(a) <em>Court to make determination. </em>\u2014 (1) The court shall determine the amount of and the period for an award of alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">(b) <em>Required considerations. </em>\u2014 In making the determination, the court shall consider all the factors necessary for a fair and equitable award, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">(1) the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">(2) the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(3) the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">(4) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">(5) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">(6) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">(7) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-15\">(8) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-16\">(9) the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-17\">(10) any agreement between the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-18\">(11) the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>(i) all income and assets, including property that does not produce income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">(ii) any award made under \u00a7\u00a7 8-205 and 8-208 of this article;<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">(iii) the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">(iv) the right of each party to receive retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">In <em>Tracey, </em>Mr. Tracey wanted money his ex-wife earned in a part-time, second job at McDonald\u2019s to be considered when the trial court determined an award of alimony. The extra job, he contended, obviated the need for alimony. The trial court had found that Mrs. Tracey\u2019s part-time job was \u201ctemporary work, in the nature of a stop-gap\u201d between the couple\u2019s \u201cfinal separation and the resolution of their financial affairs upon divorce.\u201d <em>Tracey v. Tracey, supra, </em>328 Md. at 389, 614 A.2d at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In holding that the trial court need not have considered Mrs. Tracey\u2019s part-time employment in determining her eligibility for alimony, the Court of Appeals said that \u201cincome\u201d in \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(ll)(i) meant remuneration \u201cfrom regular, full-time employment, <em>i.e., </em>money earned during the normal work week as is appropriate to a given occupation.\u201d It observed, 328 Md. at 389, 614 A.2d at 595:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">An undiscriminating inclusion of all income from part-time work held in addition to primary employment may well exaggerate the means available to one spouse, or the other, over the long term. Part-time work is often tenuous in prospect and short in duration. To include such income as a matter of course may ultimately result in a false picture of a party\u2019s economic self-sufficiency or security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The case now before us focuses on Title 12 (Child Support) of the Family Law Article, which, in part, pertains to a parent\u2019s current income for purposes of fixing the amount of the child support obligation. The title uses the term \u201cactual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>income,\u201d which \u201cmeans income from any source.\u201d Section 12-201(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u201cActual income\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">(i) salaries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(ii) wages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(iii) commissions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">(iv) bonuses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">(v) dividend income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">(vi) pension income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">(vii) interest income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">(viii) trust income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">(ix) annuity income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">(x) Social Security benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-15\">(xi) workers\u2019 compensation benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-16\">(xii) unemployment insurance benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-17\">(xiii) disability insurance benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-18\">(xiv) alimony or maintenance received; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-19\">(xv) expense reimbursements or in-kind payments received by a parent in the course of employment, self-employment, or operation of a business to the extent the reimbursements or payments reduce the parent\u2019s personal living expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-20\">Section 12-201(e)(3). Depending on the circumstances of a given case, the court may also consider severance pay, capital gains, gifts, or prizes as actual income. Section 12-201(c)(4). The statute does not specifically mention overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-21\">Although \u201cwages\u201d is not defined in the Family Law Article, the Labor and Employment Article \u2014 Maryland Code (1991 RepLVol.) \u2014 contains three definitions of \u201cwage.\u201d First, \u00a7 3-301(c)(1) defines \u201cwage\u201d as \u201call compensation for employment.\u201d A variation appears in \u00a7 3-401(e): \u201c \u2018Wage\u2019 means all compensation that is due to an employee for employment.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 3 \u2014 501(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-22\"><em>Wage. </em>\u2014 (1) \u2018Wage\u201d means all compensation that is due to an employee for employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>(2) \u201cWage\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">(i) a bonus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">(ii) a commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">(iii) a fringe benefit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">(iv) any other remuneration promised for service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u201cThe proper starting point in the interpretation of any statute is the plain language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Tapscott v. State, </em>343 Md. 650, 657, 684 A.2d 439, 442 (1996). Since overtime pay constitutes \u201ccompensation due to an employee for employment,\u201d it is clearly \u201cwages\u201d under \u00a7 12-201 (c)(3) of the Family Law Article. Therefore, overtime pay is to be considered as actual income when a court fashions an appropriate award of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">This result is in harmony with decisions from a number of other jurisdictions. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Smith, </em>631 So.2d 252, 254-55 (Ala.Civ.App.1993); <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>487 N.W.2d 331, 333-34 (Iowa 1992); <em>Rexroad v. Rexroad, </em>186 W.Va. 696, 414 S.E.2d 457, 459-460 (1992). Appellee notes that the Court of Appeals in <em>Tracey v. Tracey, supra, </em>328 Md. at 390, 614 A.2d at 595, quoted part of a Nebraska Supreme Court <em>decision </em>\u2014 Stuczynski <em>v. Stuczynski, </em>238 Neb. 368, 471 N.W.2d 122, 126 (1991) \u2014 which held that a husband\u2019s income from two jobs could not be used for alimony and child support purposes despite statutory guidelines mandating consideration of income from all sources. Yet even <em>Stuczynski </em>supports the result we reach in the case at bar, as the Nebraska court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">We believe it is appropriate to consider overtime wages in setting child support and alimony payments if the overtime is a regular part of the employment and the employee can actually expect to earn regularly a certain amount of income for working overtime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">471 N.W.2d at 126. See also, <em>Lebrato v. Lebrato, </em>3 Neb.App. 505, 529 N.W.2d 90, 97-98 (1995) (applying <em>Stuczynski, </em>court approves use of overtime income in child support calculations, noting that overtime was a regular part of father\u2019s earnings for at least four years). In fact, <em>Tracey </em>specifically noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Mr. Tracey \u201cearned, with overtime, $57,973.25 in wages\u201d during 1989. 328 Md. at 382, 614 A.2d. at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Decisions that bring overtime pay into child support calculations stress that this additional income must not be speculative or uncertain. Rather, the overtime must be a regular part of the parent\u2019s employment. <em>See, </em>\u201cConsideration of Obligated Spouse\u2019s Earnings from Overtime or \u2018Second Job\u2019 Held in Addition to Regular Full-Time Employment in Fixing Alimony or Child Support Awards,\u201d 17 A.L.R.5th 143, \u00a7 3 (1994); <em>Smith v. Smith, supra, </em>631 So.2d at 255 (trial court abused its discretion \u201cin determining the father\u2019s child support obligation without considering his substantial and continuing \u2018overtime\u2019 income, which based upon the evidence in this case is neither speculative nor uncertain.\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>487 N.W.2d at 334 (\u201cLarry\u2019s overtime has been consistent, will be consistent, and is somewhat voluntary. His overtime pay is not an anomaly or speculative.\u201d); <em>Justis v. Justis, </em>384 N.W.2d 885, 890-91 (Minn.App.1986) (father\u2019s \u201covertime has been a regular, steady source of income for the past several years.\u201d); <em>Rexroad v. Rexroad, supra, </em>414 S.E.2d at 459 (\u201cOther jurisdictions that have had occasion to consider overtime pay have concluded that where it is obtained with some degree of regularity, it should be considered in determining the total employment earnings for purposes of both alimony and child support.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Appellee in the case now before us has consistently worked substantial overtime for more than seven years. Even before he and his wife separated, he averaged 50 hours a week on the job. Therefore, his current overtime income, averaged on a monthly basis, is to be considered when calculating his child support obligation. If circumstances change, and Appellee no longer earns at the level he has over the years, he can seek a modification of the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
