The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that deductions, taken in 1984 and 1985 by a manufacturer of the Agent Orange chemical defoliant based on a settlement of claims brought by Vietnam veterans for injuries allegedly arising from exposure to Agent Orange, were improper. Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus) and subsidiaries sought relief in the Court of Federal Claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That court, after granting partial summary judgment, then dismissed pursuant to a joint stipulation of the parties the complaint seeking a refund of taxes paid in the 1974 and 1975 taxable years based on a carry back of the 1984 and 1985 deductions. Slip op., No. 4-89 T (Ct.Fed.Cl. Sept. 3, 1992). We vacate and remand for farther proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">The events that led to this appeal are somewhat convoluted, and require that they be given in considerable detail in order to make the issues understandable. Maxus and its subsidiaries (the Group) are an affiliated group of corporations which files its tax returns on a consolidated basis. Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Corporation (Diamond) is a member of the Group. During the Viet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>nam War era, Diamond was a manufacturer of the Agent Orange chemical defoliant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The Group reports its income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting. In 1984 and 1985, respectively, the Group reported deductions of $23,254,217 and $85,200. These amounts reflected expenses which had allegedly accrued to Diamond in 1984 and 1985 through an agreement it had entered into in 1984. In that agreement, Diamond settled class action claims brought against it and other class action defendants in 1979 by Vietnam veterans alleging injuries arising from exposure to Agent Orange.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to that settlement agreement, Diamond agreed to contribute $21,667,347 (out of a total of $180,000,000) to a court administered settlement fund established by Judge Weinstein of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York. <em>In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, </em>597 F.Supp. 740 (E.D.N.Y.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>818 F.2d 145 (2d Cir.1987), ce<em>rt. denied sub nom. Pinkey v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>484 U.S. 1004, 108 S.Ct. 695, 98 L.Ed.2d 648 (1988). Pursuant to court order, Diamond was not required to immediately transfer the prescribed amount. Instead, it was allowed to transfer the prescribed amount plus accrued interest within 10 days of the date the court approved the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Diamond was required to transfer, by July 2, 1984, a letter of credit, bond, or other acceptable instrument sufficient to secure its payment of the prescribed amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">To fulfill its obligation of securing the prescribed payment, Diamond executed on July 2, 1984 with Mellon Bank (Mellon) an irrevocable standby letter of credit in favor of the clerk of the court, the designated custodian of the settlement fund. The amount secured by the letter was $22,807,372, and the expiration date of the letter was September 14, 1984. In that letter, Mellon undertook to meet Diamond\u2019s obligations with respect to the settlement fund in the event of Diamond\u2019s default. In addition, the letter obligated Diamond to repay Mellon any amount Mellon expended pursuant to the letter. To secure Diamond\u2019s repayment obligations, the letter provided Mellon with a security interest in, a lien on, and a right of set-off against Diamond\u2019s deposit accounts with Mellon. The amount secured by the letter was subsequently increased to $23,630,800 during 1984 to reflect the accrual of interest. In addition, the expiration date was extended to January 15, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">The settlement agreement provided that any class action defendant, who in its discretion believed that the number of plaintiffs who had opted out of the class was substantial, could withdraw from the agreement no later than 20 days before the date of the first public hearing scheduled for the purpose of certifying the class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. On June 11, 1984, the court scheduled such a hearing for August 8,1984. Thus, the deadline for a defendant to withdraw from the agreement became July 19, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">On January 7, 1985, the court issued an order approving the settlement agreement. Consequently, Diamond\u2019s payment obligation to the fund became due within 10 days of this date. In satisfaction of this obligation, Diamond, on January 14, 1985, paid $23,339,417 to the fund. The increase relative to the original $21,667,347 figure reflected the interest that had accrued since the date of the settlement agreement. The $23,254,217 deduction taken in 1984 represented that portion of the total of $23,339,417 which allegedly accrued in 1984; the $85,200 deduction taken in 1985 represented the residual portion of the total which allegedly accrued in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">On June 2, 1987, the Group filed with the IRS refund claims for the 1972-1975 taxable years. The claims for the 1974 and 1975 years were based in part on carrying back, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 172(b)(l)(I)-(j) (1988), the $23,254,217 and $85,200 deductions the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>Group had reported in 1984 and 1985.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On October 26, 1988, and April 14, 1989, respectively, the IRS denied the refund claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">In the action that gave rise to this appeal, the Group, on January 4, 1989, filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the United States asserting its refund claims for the 1972-1975 taxable years. On October 2, 1990, the parties filed with the court a set of stipulated facts. One such stipulated fact which is at issue in this appeal is the stipulation that the letter of credit issued by Mellon was \u201ccollateralized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">On February 21, 1991, the government filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that the Group was not entitled as a matter of law to the portions of the 1974 and 1975 refund claims which arose from the $23,254,217 and $85,200 deductions taken in 1984 and 1985 respectively. On July 11,1991, the court issued an opinion granting the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In its opinion, the court first analyzed whether the deductions were proper on the basis of the execution on July 2, 1984 of the letter of credit. At that time, under applicable law, an accrual basis taxpayer was allowed to deduct expenses incurred in satisfaction of a contested liability provided (1) the taxpayer transferred money or property in satisfaction of the contested liability, (2) the transfer was beyond the control of the taxpayer, and (3) but for the fact that the liability was contested, the liability of the taxpayer was fixed. The court concluded that the execution of the letter of credit did not meet these requirements for two reasons. First, according to the court, the letter of credit was not, contrary to the parties\u2019 stipulation, fully collateralized; thus, any purported \u201ctransfer\u201d arising from that event was not beyond the control of Diamond. Second, but for the fact the liability was contested, Diamond\u2019s liability was not fixed on July 2nd because it had until July 19, 1984 to withdraw from the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">The court next analyzed whether the extin-guishment on July 19, 1984 of Diamond\u2019s option to withdraw from the settlement agreement provided the necessary basis for the deductions. The court concluded it did not because by that date, the applicable law had changed. As the trial court saw it, under the law then in effect, an accrual basis taxpayer could not deduct an expense in relation to a contested tort liability prior to the date when disbursement was made to the individual tort claimants unless payment was made to a \u201cdesignated\u201d settlement fund. Since the fund in question is not a \u201cdesignated\u201d fund<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, and since the individual claimants of that fund were not paid by the date in question, the extinguishment of Diamond\u2019s option to withdraw from the settlement agreement likewise did not support the deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">The parties then reached a settlement on the remaining issues in the case. Specifically, the government granted the portion of the Group\u2019s 1974-1975 refund claims that were based on deductions other than those at issue in this appeal, and it granted in their entirety the Group\u2019s 1972-1973 refund claims. Accordingly, the parties, on June 30, 1992, filed with the trial court a stipulation dismissing with prejudice all the remaining claims in the Group\u2019s complaint except one: The Group\u2019s claims were dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice \u201cas to any adjustments to carrybacks from other taxable years.\u201d According to undisputed evidence submitted by the Group\u2019s counsel of record, the exception was included at the government\u2019s insistence to protect it in the event it was later determined that the net operating loss carrybacks which formed the basis of the reftmds it had granted had been erroneously computed. In that event, the government wanted to be able to recover the refunds from the Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">On July 21, 1992, the court entered judgment dismissing the Group\u2019s complaint, but without specifying that certain claims were dismissed with prejudice and others were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>dismissed without prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties then filed on August 4,1992 a joint motion to amend the judgment. The motion was la-belled as a Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RUSCFC) 60(a) motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to the joint motion, the court, on September 3, 1992, entered an amended judgment which reflected the court\u2019s July 11, 1991 order, as well as the distinction set out in the joint stipulation. The Group then filed on September 22, 1992, a notice of appeal to this court. The government filed a cross-appeal alleging that the Group\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, and thus that this court lacks jurisdiction over the Group\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">We first address the jurisdictional issue. The government argues that the August 4, 1992 joint motion to amend the July 21, 1992 judgment did not seek any substantive change in that judgment. Thus, the government further argues, it was properly characterized as a RUSCFC 60(a) motion which, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) (1992)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (made applicable to the' Court of Federal Claims by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2522 (1988)), did not toll the time for filing an appeal. Since the 60 day period prescribed by Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(1) for filing the appeal thus had expired by the time the Group filed its notice of appeal, argues the government, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">The Group, by contrast, argues that the August 4, 1992 joint motion to amend did seek a substantive change in the July 21, 1992 judgment and thus is properly characterized as RUSCFC 59(d) motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the Group further argues, pursuant to Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(4) (1992), that motion tolled the running of the time for filing an appeal until September 3, 1992, the date of the amended judgment. Since the notice of appeal was filed within 60 days of that date, argues the Group, this court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">The Group is correct. The universal rule is that, regardless of its label, any motion made within ten days of entry of judgment which seeks a substantive change in the judgment will be considered a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. <em>Beverly Hills Fan Co. v. Royal Sovereign Corp., </em>21 F.3d 1558, 1562, 30 USPQ2d 1001, 1004 (Fed.Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>6A James W. Moore et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 59.12[1], at 59-265 (2d ed. 1994). The legal standard for determining whether a change is \u201csubstantive\u201d is a practical one\u2014 whether the motion seeks a revision which disturbs or revises legal rights and obligations that were settled by the previous judgment. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>684 F.2d 691, 693 (10th Cir.1982) (citing <em>F.T.C. v. Minne</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number><em>apolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., </em>344 U.S. 206, 212, 73 S.Ct. 245, 249, 97 L.Ed. 245 (1952)). Included are revisions which seek to resolve genuine ambiguities in the prior judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">The parties\u2019 joint motion to amend met this standard. It was filed within ten days of the entry of judgment (excluding intervening Saturdays and Sundays pursuant to RUSCFC 6(a)). And it sought (and obtained) changes in the substantive rights of the parties. The July 21, 1992 judgment (which was effective at the time the motion was filed) is silent on the question of whether the dismissal was with prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-5\">Pursuant to the opinion of July 11,1991, and the stipulation for partial dismissal filed June 30, 1992,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-6\">IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this date, pursuant to Rule 58, that the complaint is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Under RUSCFC 41(a)(2), which applies to <em>voluntary </em>dismissals made upon order of the court, the effect of the order was to dismiss the complaint <em>without prejudice. </em>RUSCFC 41(a)(2) provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.\u201d RUSCFC 41(a)(2). The government, however, argues that a different rule, RUSCFC 41(b), is governing. Unlike RUSCFC 41(a)(2), RUSCFC 41(b) provides that, unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, the dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits, i.e., a dismissal <em>with prejudice. </em>But by its terms, RUSCFC 41(b) is limited to <em>involuntary </em>dismissals, and though the result more nearly approximates the result intended by the joint stipulation, RUSCFC 41(b) is inapplicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">The motion, then, functioned to amend the judgment to conform it to the court\u2019s July 11, 1991 order, and to the parties\u2019 joint stipulation, i.e., to provide that, subject to one exception, all of the Group\u2019s claims for the 1972-1975 taxable years were dismissed <em>with </em>prejudice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The full text of the amended judgment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-12\">Pursuant to the court\u2019s order of September 1, 1992, granting the August 4, 1992, joint motion to amend judgment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-13\">IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this date, pursuant to Rule 58, that the complaint is dismissed <em>with prejudice except that the complaint is dismissed without prejudice as to any adjustments to carrybacks from other taxable years. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">This was a significant substantive change to the rights of the parties under the order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the motion is properly characterized as a RUSCFC 59(d) motion, and pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) (1992), the time to appeal did not begin to run until September 3, 1992. Accordingly, the Group\u2019s notice of appeal filed on September 22nd was timely filed, and this court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\">Our conclusion here is supported by the Advisory Committee Notes accompanying Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). There, it is stated that Rule 59(e) was added to care for a situation such as that arising in <em>Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>146 F.2d 321 (8th Cir.1944). That case involved a motion to amend a judgment (dismissing without prejudice the plaintiffs claims) to indicate that the claims were dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">It is also supported by <em>Willie v. Continental Oil Co., </em>746 F.2d 1041 (5th Cir.1984), <em>vacated and taken en banc, </em>760 F.2d 87 (5th Cir.1985), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>784 F.2d 706 (5th Cir.1986) <em>(en banc). </em>That case involved a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>amend a judgment to conform it to a pre-trial stipulation between the parties. The amendment related to the apportionment of damages between two co-defendants. The original panel concluded that the motion was a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion and not a Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. However, that decision was subsequently vacated and taken <em>en banc. </em>760 F.2d 87 (5th Cir.1985). The <em>en banc </em>court concluded that the motion was in fact a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. 784 F.2d 706, 707 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The government disagrees with this characterization of the motion. Citing <em>BBCA Inc. v. United States, </em>954 F.2d 1429 (8th Cir.1992), and <em>St. Paul Fire, supra, </em>it argues that the motion merely sought to make explicit what had been implicit under applicable law, and thus is properly characterized as a RUSCFC 60(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">We are not persuaded. <em>BBCA </em>involved a motion which sought to amend a prior judgment dismissing the plaintiffs claims, to indicate that the dismissal was with prejudice. As here, the judgment was silent on the point. However, the fundamental difference between that case and the present is that, under applicable law, the judgment already amounted to a dismissal with prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The ease is thus inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\"><em>St. Paul Fire </em>involved a document (whose status as a motion was questionable) which sought to incorporate into a judgment the essential terms of the court\u2019s underlying memorandum and order. The purpose apparently was to preclude a reading on appeal of the legal basis for the judgment broader than that set forth in the memorandum and order. 684 F.2d 691, 694. Unlike the motion in the present case, the document was unnecessary because the legal basis for the judgment was readily ascertainable from the record on appeal, which included the memorandum and order. <em>Id. </em>Thus, that case as well is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude we have jurisdiction over the appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">The Group\u2019s principal argument on the merits is that the Court of Federal Claims erred in concluding, contrary to the parties\u2019 stipulation, that the letter of credit executed on July 2,1984 in favor of the clerk of the court was not fully \u201ccollateralized.\u201d According to the Group, if the letter of credit is characterized consistently with the parties\u2019 stipulation, under the authority of <em>Chem Aero, Inc. v. United States, </em>694 F.2d 196 (9th Cir.1982) the execution of that letter constitutes a transfer of money and property in satisfaction of a contested liability within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f) (1982)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (current version at I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f) (1988)) and the implementing regulation, Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.461-2(e)(l) (1984)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>. Thus, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>the Group, the 1984 deduction was proper.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">The <em>government, by </em>contrast, <em>argues </em>that the character of the letter of credit is immaterial for purposes of this appeal. According to the government, even if the letter of credit is considered to have been fully collateral-ized, the Group would not be entitled to a deduction under I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f). That is so, argues the government, because the Group\u2019s liability to the fund did not become fixed but for the fact that the asserted liability was being contested, as required by the terms of the statute, until July 19, 1984, when Diamond\u2019s option to withdraw from the settlement agreement expired. By that time, however, I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h) had been enacted, and I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f) had been modified to indicate it was subject to the other. Under I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h), argues the government, the 1984 deduction was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The government is correct. The general rule is that an accrual method taxpayer may not deduct an expense until satisfaction of the \u201call events\u201d test has occurred. S.Rep. No. 830, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 100 (1964), <em>reprinted in </em>1964 U.S.C.C.AN. 1673, 1773. Under the \u201call events\u201d test, the taxpayer cannot deduct an expense until all the events have occurred that fix the amount and fact of the underlying liability. <em>United States v. Consolidated Edison Co., </em>366 U.S. 380, 385, 81 S.Ct. 1326, 1329, 6 L.Ed.2d 356 (1961) (citing <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>269 U.S. 422, 441, 46 S.Ct. 131, 134, 70 L.Ed. 347 (1926)). In the case of a contested liability, that cannot occur until the contest has been finally resolved. <em>Consolidated Edison, </em>366 U.S. at 386-87, 81 S.Ct. at 1330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f) was enacted in 1964 to allow a deduction prior to this time in the case of a taxpayer who transfers beyond his control money or property in satisfaction of the contested liability. S.Rep. No. 830, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 243 (1964), <em>reprinted in </em>1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1673, 1913. However, by its terms, I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f) only allows for a deduction when \u201cbut for the fact that the asserted liability is contested\u201d, paragraph (4), \u00a7 461(f), a deduction would be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer, i.e., the \u201call events\u201d test would be met. That requirement was not met here until July 19, 1984, when Diamond\u2019s option to withdraw from the settlement agreement expired.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> By that time, however, I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h) had been enacted, and paragraph (4) of I.R.C. \u00a7 461(f) had been amended to indicate it was subject to I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-369, \u00a7 91(a), 98 Stat. 494, 598-600 (1984) (codified at I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h) (1988))<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>. I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h) embodies an \u201ceconomic performance\u201d test, according to which an accrual method taxpayer may not deduct an expense prior to the time when \u201ceconomic performance\u201d occurs in relation to the expense. With respect to a tort liability, the statute defines economic performance as occurring when the payments are made as required by the liability of the taxpayer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>(1) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-5\">For purposes of this title, in determining whether an amount has been incurred with respect to any item during any taxable year, the all events test shall not be treated as met any earlier than when economic performance with respect to such item occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">(2) Time when economic performance occurs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the time when economic performance occurs shall be determined under the following principles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">(C) [T]ort liabilities of the taxpayer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">If the liability of the taxpayer requires a payment to another person and ... arises out of any tort, economic performance occurs as the payments to such person are made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Here, regardless of the character of the letter of credit, its execution in 1984 did not' constitute a \u201cpayment\u201d under the statute, i.e., that event did not constitute \u201ceconomic performance\u201d since no money or its equivalent was actually paid out to anyone.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, we agree with the Court of Federal Claims that the 1984 deduction of $23,254,217 was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">The Group next focuses on Diamond\u2019s January 14, 1985 cash payment of $23,339,-417 to the fund. According to the Group, that payment entitles it to a deduction of the amount of the payment in 1985. The Court of Federal Claims, however, concluded that subsequent to July 18, 1984, in the case of a payment made in satisfaction of a tort liability, I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h) with one exception only allows for a deduction when the payment has been disbursed to the individual claimants; the sole exception being payments to a \u201cdesignated\u201d settlement fund as defined by I.R.C. \u00a7 468B (1988).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-20\">According to the Group, this conclusion is in error because the January 14,1985 payment satisfies the literal terms of I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h), and I.R.C. \u00a7 468B has no applicability to this ease. The Group is correct. As we have said, absent extraordinary circumstances, the language of a statute, provided it is clear and fits the case, is conclusive. <em>See VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., </em>917 F.2d 1574, 1579-80, 16 USPQ2d 1614, 1618 (Fed.Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 922, 111 S.Ct. 1315, 113 L.Ed.2d 248 (1991) (citing <em>Sullivan v. Stroop, </em>496 U.S. 478, 482, 110 S.Ct. 2499, 2502-03, 110 L.Ed.2d 438 (1990); <em>K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 1817-18, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988); <em>Bethesda Hospital Assoc. v. Bowen, </em>485 U.S. 399, 403, 108 S.Ct. 1255, 1258, 99 L.Ed.2d 460 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-21\">By January 14, 1985, the date of the payment in question, Diamond\u2019s liability to the individual claimants had been superseded by or merged with Diamond\u2019s liability to the settlement fund. This is established by the terms of the settlement agreement. According to 115:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-22\">Defendants ... are not, and in the future shall not be, subject to liability or expense of any kind to any member of the Class in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>respect of any claim arising out of the subject matter of the Complaint, except as to their obligations to make payments pursuant to this Agreement. Claims against the Fund shall be the exclusive remedy of all Class members against the defendants ..., and all members of the Class are forever barred from instituting or maintaining any action against any of the defendants ... arising out of or relating to, or in the future arising out of or relating to, the subject matter of the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">Thus, the January 14, 1985 payment was made to the \u201cperson\u201d required by Diamond\u2019s liability in accordance with the language of \u00a7 461(h).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Group is correct that it is entitled to a deduction in 1985 of $23,339,417.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The Court of Federal Claim\u2019s conclusion, that I.R.C. \u00a7 468B defines the sole basis upon which a payment to a settlement fund in satisfaction of a liability is immediately deductible, is incorrect. By its terms, I.R.C. \u00a7 468B does not apply to \u201cany contested liability of the taxpayer within the meaning of section 461(f).\u201d <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 468B(e). Since the settlement in this case is of a contested liability within the express terms of \u00a7 461(f), the provisions of \u00a7 468B on their face are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The underlying tort liability of Diamond remained contested until 1988, because that is when the petition for certiorari to review the underlying fairness of the settlement agreement was denied. <em>See Pinkney v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>484 U.S. 1004, 108 S.Ct. 695, 98 L.Ed.2d 648 (1988). This conclusion is supported by \u00b6 13 of the settlement agreement which provides \u201c[t]he settlement ... shall become effective only when the judgment ... dismissing ... plaintiffs\u2019 claims ... becomes final and is no longer subject to appeal or review.\u201d It is also consistent with the general rule that a contested tax liability is not final while an appeal of the underlying judgment is pending before a higher tribunal. <em>See Richmond Hosiery Mills v. United States, </em>305 F.2d 840, 843-14 (Ct.Cl.1962); <em>Lepman Bros. Co. v. Commissioner, </em>45 B.T.A. 793, 798 (1941); <em>North Am. Coal Corp. v.

No. 98-861, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 876 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1445, 1564.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">According to the government, Congress clearly had in mind the distinction between payment to a trustee and payment to the individual claimants, and thus did not intend to allow a deduction until payment to the individual claimants had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">We cannot agree. The legislative history supports our interpretation of the statute. Prior to the enactment of I.R.C. \u00a7 461(h), Congress was concerned that under the rules then in effect, according to which an accrual method taxpayer was permitted to deduct expenses attributable to activities to be performed in the future, deductions were overstated through failure to take into account the time value of money. H.R.Conf.R. No. 98-861, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 1254 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 697, 917. Congress enacted the \u201ceconomic performance\u201d test to take this factor into account. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the legislative history of I.R.C. \u00a7 468B evinces Congress\u2019 intention that negative inferences not be drawn from the enactment of that section about the tax treatment under the law then in effect of payments to a settlement fund in satisfaction of a <em>contested </em>liability. S.Rep. No. 99-313, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 926 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986-3 C.B. (Vol. 3) at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">In the present case, the Group\u2019s liability was effectively discharged upon the January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>14,1985 payment to the fund of $23,339,417.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, a conclusion that the payment is deductible does take account of the time value of money. The contrary conclusion \u2014 whereby the Group could not deduct the payment until it had been disbursed to the individual claimants \u2014 would ignore this factor; the Group would not be able to take a deduction even though its liability had effectively been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The passage cited by the government is not to the contrary. The type of trust referred to in that passage is distinguishable from the arrangement that is at issue in this ease. In some cases the taxpayer\u2019s payment to a trust might not discharge that party\u2019s liability to the individual claimants under the trust, and thus would not constitute \u2018economic performance\u2019. In the present case, in which Diamond\u2019s liability to the individual claimants was merged with or superseded by its liability to the fund, Diamond\u2019s payment to the fund did discharge its liability to the individual claimants, and thus did constitute \u2018economic performance\u2019.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">The decision of the Court of Federal Claims is <em>vacated </em>and the case is <em>remanded </em>for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">Costs in favor of the Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">.

The dissent\u2019s point \u2014 that the motion to amend was not substantive because it did not substan- \u00b0 tively impact any rights over which the court had jurisdiction \u2014 is incorrect. For one thing, the joint stipulation was only a stipulation for <em>partial </em>dismissal. Thus, the filing of that document was not effective in divesting under RUSCFC 41(a)(1)(B) the court of jurisdiction over any of the Group\u2019s claims. By its terms, RUSCFC 41(a)(1)(B) only applies to a stipulation dismissing of an entire <em>action. </em>For another, the July 21, 1992 judgment was issued in- response to the joint stipulation agreed to by the parties, and thus is best characterized as a voluntary dismissal. Since a voluntary dismissal is without prejudice, <em>see </em>RUSCFC 41(a)(2), the motion proposed substantive changes in the rights of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">.

In view of our resolution of the jurisdictional issue on the ground that the joint motion to amend tolled the time for filing the appeal, we need not reach the Group's alternative argument that the time period was tolled due to \"exceptional circumstances,\" i.e., its reliance on a notice in the amended judgment that the time to appeal was 60 days from the date of the amended judgment. Nor do we need to address the government\u2019s argument that the portion of the motion seeking to dismiss without prejudice the Group\u2019s claims in relation to adjustments to car-rybacks from other taxable years was redundant in light of I.R.C. \u00a7 6511 (d)(2)(B)(iii) (1988).

In addition, as is clear from the rule, the dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise indicated in the stipulation. The stipulation here clearly provides that the dismissal is <em>with prejudice </em>except it is without prejudice as to the carrybacks. Thus the dismissal was effective and final as of June 30, 1992, the date it was filed in the CFC and the prejudice of the dismissal was as indicated in the stipulation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">The filing of a stipulation for dismissal deprives the court of jurisdiction over the matter stipulated. <em>See Kokkonen v.

Because the CFC had no jurisdiction over the claims dismissed by the stipulation, the judgment entered by the court on July 21, 1992, had no effect on those claims. <em>See In the Matter of West Texas Marketing Corp., </em>12 F.3d 497, 501 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cwhen the parties voluntarily agreed to a dismissal, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(h) ..., any further actions by the court were superfluous. Therefore, the dismissal order entered by the bankruptcy court is rendered irrelevant to the question of the finality of the judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted)); <em>In re Wolf, </em>842 F.2d at 466 (a judge is without authority to later alter a voluntary dismissal without prejudice to transform it into a dismissal with prejudice); <em>McCall-Bey v. Franzen, </em>777 F.2d 1178, 1185 (7th Cir.1985) (if the parties\u2019 stipulation had been filed before the judge\u2019s order, that order would have been a nullity). However, the July 21, 1992 judgment did make final the partial summary judgment granted in favor of the United States pursuant to the CFC\u2019s July 11 opinion. This, and not the claims dismissed by stipulation, was the only substantive action affected. The merits of the summary judgment thus became final, and the time for filing a notice of appeal began to run, on July 21, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">Pursuant to a motion filed by the parties on August 4, 1992, the court \u201camended\u201d its July 21, 1992, judgment to conform to language used in the stipulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the CFC\u2019s actions could have no effect on the claims finally dismissed by the stipulation, this amendment had no substantive effect at all. <em>See Kokkonen </em>511 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1675.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The amendment did not relate to the summary judgment issue and so had no effect there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The amendment did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>not have, and in fact could not have had, any substantive effect on the rights of the parties. Therefore, it did not extend the time for filing an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Because Maxus did not file a notice of appeal until September 22, 1992, one day after the expiration of the time limit, the notice was untimely and this court has no jurisdiction to reach the merits. <em>See Budi-nich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 203, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 1722, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988) (the time limit for filing an appeal set out in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1) is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-18\">. Maxus seeks to challenge the merits of this decision in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1032-19\">. The CFC rule provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-20\">(1) By Plaintiff; by Stipulation____ an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff <em>without order of court ... </em>(B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all the parties who have appeared in the action. <em>Unless otherwise stated in </em>the notice of dismissal or <em>stipulation, </em>the dismissal is without prejudice.... (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">. An oral stipulation made in open court may also be effective under the rule if the parties' agreement to the dismissal is clear. <em>See </em>Moore's at H 41.02[2] n. 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">. The \u201cJoint Motion to Amend Judgment\u201d was clearly directed only to the claims that were the subject of the stipulation. The motion reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-10\">Pursuant to RUSCC 60(a), the parties move to amend the July 21, 1992 judgment entered in the above-captioned case. The judgment states: \u201cthat the complaint is dismissed.\u201d The July 21, 1992 judgment does not indicate whether the complaint is dismissed with or without prejudice, and does not conform to the language contained in the parties' stipulation for partial dismissal. The parties respectfully submit that the lack of conformity between the July 21, 1992 judgment and the parties' stipulation was the result of an oversight or omission on the part of the Clerk. Pursuant to RUSCC 60(a), the July 21, 1992 judgment should be amended by adding immediately after the words \"complaint is dismissed,\u201d the additional words \u201cwith prejudice except that the complaint is dismissed without prejudice as to any adjustments to carrybacks from other taxable years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-16\">As the motion focused only on the stipulated claims, and the claims subject to the July 11, 1991 opinion which were expressly excluded from the stipulation were not even mentioned by the parties\u2019 motion, or by the court in its amended judgment, the amendment was clearly not intended to, and did not affect those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1033-17\">. The Supreme Court recognizes that some circuits have held that a case dismissed by stipulation may be reopened by a party by reason of a breach of the agreement that was the basis for the dismissal by a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). This exception to the general rule that the court lacks jurisdiction after stipulation obviously is not applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1033-18\">. Even if the motion to amend and the amended judgment could somehow be interpreted as directed also to the claims that were the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>the July 11 opinion, these claims were dismissed <em>involuntarily </em>in response to the government\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The government is therefore correct that Rule 41(b) applies, at least as to those claims, and an unspecified dismissal in those circumstances acts as a final adjudication on the merits, i.e. is <em>with prejudice. </em>The July 21, 1992 order thus acted as a dismissal with prejudice as to the only claims over which the court had jurisdiction and, if anything, the amended judgment was redundant as to those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
