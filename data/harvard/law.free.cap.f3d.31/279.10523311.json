Boyd appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his pro se and in forma pauperis \u00a7 1983 complaint. We affirm as to two defendants based on the doctrine of absolute immunity, and as to the remaining defendants based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">On January 8, 1981, John L. Boyd (Boyd) and his cousin, Johnny B. Boyd, were charged with the murder of Bobby Rogers. In 1981, Boyd was tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The evidence showed that Boyd\u2019s cousin fired the fatal shot and that Boyd struck the victim with an axe handle. Before the trial of Boyd\u2019s cousin in 1984, new evidence was discovered that supported Boyd\u2019s contention that he and his cousin had acted in self-defense. This evidence was admitted at the trial of Boyd\u2019s cousin, and he was convicted of the lesser offense of manslaughter and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Boyd petitioned for habeas corpus based on the newly discovered evidence, and in 1989 the federal district court granted Boyd\u2019s petition and ordered a new trial. We reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, reasoning that newly discovered evidence pertaining to the guilt or innocence of a state prisoner cannot support federal habeas corpus relief. <em>Boyd v. Puckett, </em>905 F.2d 895 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 988, 111 S.Ct. 526, 112 L.Ed.2d 537 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">On August 6, 1991, Boyd used a form designed for prisoner complaints concerning conditions of confinement to file an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in federal district court alleging <em>inter alia </em>that Judge Neal Biggers (a state judge at the time of the events at issue here), Prosecutor John Young, Ronald Windsor (Boyd\u2019s court-appointed counsel), Sheriff Edwin Coleman and Investigator Larry Brinkley conspired to violate his constitutional rights by causing him to be convicted and sentenced more severely than his cousin. In the blank left for requested relief, Boyd asked for $10,000 in compensatory damages, $10,000 in punitive damages, $10,000 in mental anguish damages, and \u201cany other relief this Court deems proper and adequate[ ] in the foregoing matter.\u201d The ease was referred to a magistrate judge. On January 12, 1993, the magistrate judge held a Spears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing to determine whether a non-frivolous basis for Boyd\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action existed. At the <em>Spears </em>hearing, Boyd stated that by filing this suit he was seeking to attack the constitutionality of his state court conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">In a written report filed on January 21, 1993, the magistrate judge recommended that Boyd\u2019s claim be dismissed with prejudice. The magistrate judge concluded that Judge Biggers and Prosecutor Young were absolutely immune from suit under \u00a7 1983 for the conduct alleged by Boyd, that Boyd\u2019s defense attorney was not a state actor for \u00a7 1983 purposes, and that Boyd\u2019s allegations against Sheriff Coleman and Investigator Brinkley were merely conelusory and failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. The magistrate judge also advised Boyd to exhaust his state remedies if he wished to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance against his defense counsel. On June 18,1993, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety and entered final judgment dismissing Boyd\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Although the district court did not expressly state that Boyd\u2019s claims were \u201cfrivolous\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), we treat the court\u2019s determination as a \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal because the court dismissed his complaint with prejudice prior to service. <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1985). Dismissal of an in forma pauperis complaint is appropriate if the district court determines that it is frivolous, i.e., that \u201cit lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). A complaint is legally frivolous if it is premised on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 109 S.Ct. at 1833. We review a district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1734, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">A. HECK V. HUMPHREY</p>\n<p id=\"ADZ\">We first consider the impact of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), decided during the pendency of this appeal, on the instant case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For reasons that will be explained in Part III.B, <em>infra, </em>we limit our discussion of <em>Heck </em>to the dismissal of Boyd\u2019s claims against Windsor, Sheriff Coleman, and Investigator Brinkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The facts of <em>Heck </em>are strikingly similar to those presented in the instant case. The \u00a7 1983 plaintiff in that case, Roy Heck, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Indiana state court and sentenced to a fifteen-year term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2368. He filed his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit in federal court while his appeal from his conviction was pending in the Indiana courts, alleging that he had been the victim of a conspiracy by county prosecutors and a police investigator to destroy exculpatory evidence and to use an illegal voice identification procedure at his trial. <em>Id. </em>The district court dismissed Heck\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action because the issues raised in that action directly implicated the legality of Heck\u2019s confinement. <em>Id. </em>While Heck\u2019s appeal to the Seventh Circuit was pending, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed his conviction. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Heck\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action, following the rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APO\">[i]f, regardless of the relief sought, the [\u00a7 1983] plaintiff is challenging the legality of his conviction, so that if he won his ease the state would be obliged to release him even if he hadn\u2019t sought that relief, the suit is classified as an application for habeas corpus and the plaintiff must exhaust his state remedies, on pain of dismissal if he fails to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-13\"><em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>997 F.2d 355, 357 (7th Cir.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">Although the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment in <em>Heck, </em>it rejected the analysis employed by the Seventh Circuit and by our court in eases such as <em>Fulford v. Klein, </em>529 F.2d 377 (5th Cir.1976), <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 342 (5th Cir.1977) (en banc) (per curiam), and <em>Meadows v. Evans, </em>529 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.1976), <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 345 (5th Cir.1977) (en banc) (per curiam), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>434 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 517, 54 L.Ed.2d 457 (1977). The Court adhered to its \u201cteaching that \u00a7 1983 contains no exhaustion requirement beyond what Congress has provided.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2370. The Court agreed, however, that Heck could not proceed with his \u00a7 1983 action. Using the common law tort of malicious prosecution as an analogy to aid in interpretation of \u00a7 1983, the Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-18\">in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. As the Court remarked a little later in the opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">We do not engraft an exhaustion requirement upon \u00a7 1983, but rather deny the existence of a cause of action. Even a prisoner who has fully exhausted available state remedies has no cause of action under \u00a7 1983 unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed, expunged, invalidated, or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus.... [A] \u00a7 1983 cause of action for damages attributable to an unconstitutional conviction or sentence does not accrue until the conviction or sentence has been invalidated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\"><em>Id., </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2373-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Although the <em>Heck </em>Court rejected part of the reasoning underlying the <em>FulfordJMead-ows </em>doctrine, the analysis required by <em>Heck </em>is similar in certain respects to the analysis we have long used in this circuit when a state prisoner brings a \u00a7 1983 action in federal district court. Under <em>Heck, </em>when a state prisoner brings a \u00a7 1983 action seeking damages, the trial court must first ascertain whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the \u00a7 1983 action would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. If it would, the prisoner must show that his conviction has been \u201creversed, expunged, invalidated, or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus,\u201d <em>id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2373, in order to state a claim. Dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) is appropriate, <em>post-Heck, </em>because the plaintiffs action has been shown to be legally frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">The validity of Boyd\u2019s conviction and sentence has yet to be undermined; we proceed to evaluate the claims raised in his \u00a7 1983 action to determine whether they challenge the constitutionality of his conviction or sentence. We conclude that they do. Some of his allegations amount to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. If proved, these claims would call Boyd\u2019s conviction into question under cases such as <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Liberally construed, his complaint also alleges that Sheriff Coleman and Investigator Brinkley violated Boyd\u2019s rights by withholding exculpatory evidence obtained during the investigation of Bobby Rogers\u2019 murder. If proved, these claims would call Boyd\u2019s conviction into question under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and its progeny. Indeed, Boyd stated, \u201cMy main thing about this here, I really wasn\u2019t trying to sue nobody about this here. I don\u2019t want nothing, money or nothing. I mostly want my freedom.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that all of his claims come within the ambit of <em>Heck </em>and are therefore frivolous under \u00a7 1915(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">The only remaining question is whether the district court properly dismissed the complaint <em>with prejudice </em>as to Windsor, Sheriff Coleman, and Investigator Brinkley. We note that the district court in <em>Heck </em>dismissed Heck\u2019s complaint <em>without prejudice, Heck, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2368; the Seventh Circuit affirmed that judgment; and the Supreme Court affirmed the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment. The question whether the logic of <em>Heck, </em>as distinguished from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>result, would permit dismissal <em>with 'prejudice </em>of a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence has been settled, albeit without discussion, by another panel of this court in <em>Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26 (5th Cir.1994). The <em>Stephenson </em>panel applied <em>Heck </em>to a federal prisoner who had brought a Bivens<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> action asserting a myriad of alleged constitutional violations in connection with his conviction. <em>Id., </em>28 F.3d at 26-27. The district court had adhered to <em>pre-Heck </em>practice, holding the suit in abeyance pending exhaustion of Stephenson\u2019s post-conviction remedies. <em>Id., </em>28 F.3d at 27. The panel held that <em>Heck </em>applies to <em>Bivens </em>actions just as it does to \u00a7 1983 actions, vacated the order holding the suit in abeyance, and remanded the case for dismissal with prejudice. <em>Id., </em>28 F.3d at 27-28. Given <em>Stephenson\u2019s, </em>interpretation of <em>Heck, </em>we must affirm the \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal with prejudice of Boyd\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as to Windsor, Coleman, and Brinkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">B. Absolute Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">From the foregoing discussion, it appears that we could also affirm the dismissal of Boyd\u2019s claims against Judge Biggers and Prosecutor Young under <em>Heck. </em>We believe, however, that it remains appropriate for district courts to consider the possible applicability of the doctrine of absolute immunity, as did the magistrate judge in the instant case, as a threshold matter in making a \u00a7 1915(d) determination. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe essence of absolute immunity is its possessor\u2019s entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2814-15, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). Thus, the Court has described immunity as a threshold question, to be resolved as early in the proceedings as possible. <em>See Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 231-33, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (\u201cOne of the purposes of immunity, absolute or qualified, is to spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability, but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long drawn out lawsuit.\u201d). Because absolute immunity is properly viewed as <em>\u201cimmunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability,\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. at 2815, it is appropriate for the district courts to resolve the question of absolute immunity before reaching the <em>Heck </em>analysis when feasible. If a defendant is dismissed on absolute immunity grounds, it becomes clear that the \u00a7 1983 plaintiff will never have a claim against that defendant based on the particular facts alleged, even if the plaintiff is a state prisoner who eventually satisfies the precondition to a valid \u00a7 1983 claim under <em>Heck. </em>We believe this approach best serves the purposes underlying the absolute immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Turning to the instant case, we find that Boyd\u2019s allegations regarding Judge Biggers and Prosecutor Young are somewhat confusing, but when his complaint is taken in conjunction with his statements at his <em>Spears </em>hearing, it appears that Boyd was simply contending that he was not guilty of murder and that Biggers and Young should have prevented his wrongful conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Judicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions. <em>Graves v. Hampton, </em>1 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1993). The alleged magnitude of the judge\u2019s errors or the mendacity of his acts is irrelevant. <em>Young v. Biggers, </em>938 F.2d 565, 569 n. 5 (5th Cir.1991). Judicial immunity can be overcome only by showing that the actions complained of were nonjudicial in nature or by showing that the actions were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, -, 112 S.Ct. 286, 288, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>see Forrester v. White, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>484 U.S. 219, 220-21, 108 S.Ct. 538, 540-41, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988) (holding that a state judge\u2019s dismissal of a subordinate court employee is not a judicial act entitled to absolute immunity). A judge\u2019s acts are judicial in nature if they are \u201c \u2018normally performed by a judge\u2019 \u201d and the parties affected \u201c \u2018dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mireles, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 288 (quoting <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 362, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1107, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)). Boyd does not complain of any actions taken by Judge Biggers that were nonjudicial in nature, and his claims against Judge Biggers were therefore properly dismissed with prejudice as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Criminal prosecutors also enjoy absolute immunity from claims for damages asserted under \u00a7 1983 for actions taken in the presentation of the state\u2019s case. <em>Graves, </em>1 F.3d at 318. As the Supreme court recently reaffirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">[A]cts undertaken by the prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role as an advocate for the State, are entitled to the protections of absolute immunity. Those acts must include the professional evaluation of the evidence assembled by the police and appropriate preparation for its presentation at trial ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\"><em>Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 2615, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993). Prosecutorial immunity applies to the prosecutor\u2019s actions in initiating the-prosecution and in carrying the case through the judicial process. <em>Graves, </em>1 F.3d at 318. This broad immunity applies even if the prosecutor is accused of knowingly using perjured testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 318 n. 9; <em>see also Brummett v. Camble, </em>946 F.2d 1178, 1181 (5th Cir.1991) (concluding that state prosecutors were absolutely immune from a \u00a7 1983 action predicated on malicious prosecution), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2323, 119 L.Ed.2d 241 (1992); <em>Ashelman v. Pope, </em>793 F.2d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir.1986) (en banc) (\u201c[A] conspiracy between judge and prosecutor to predetermine the outcome of a judicial proceeding, while clearly improper, nevertheless does not pierce the immunity extended to judges and prosecutors.\u201d). Boyd alleges no facts against Prosecutor Young that would destroy Young\u2019s absolute immunity, and his claims against Young were therefore properly dismissed with prejudice as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\">. <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\">. The Supreme Court applied its decision in <em>Heck </em>to the litigants in that case. Thus, under <em>James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, </em>501 U.S. 529, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991), we must apply <em>Heck </em>retroactively to the litigants in the instant case. <em>Luce v. First Equip. Leasing Corp. (In re Luce), </em>960 F.2d 1277, 1281 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\">. This circuit has long followed the same rule that the Seventh Circuit applied in <em>Heck. </em>Interpreting the Supreme Court's opinions in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), and <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), we concluded that \u201chabeas corpus is the exclusive initial cause of action where the basis of the claim goes to the constitutionality of the state court conviction.\u201d <em>Fulford v. Klein, </em>529 F.2d 377, 381 (5th Cir.1976), <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 342 (5th Cir.1977) (en banc) (per curiam); <em>see also Meadows v. Evans, </em>529 F.2d 385, 386 (5th Cir.1976), <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 345 (5th Cir.1977) (en banc) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 517, 54 L.Ed.2d 457 (1977). We have strictly applied the <em>Ful-ford/Meadows </em>doctrine, instructing the district courts not to address the merits of \u00a7 1983 claims that must first be exhausted through habeas challenges \"even if it plainly appearfs] that [the] \u00a7 1983 claims would be foreclosed as a matter of law.\" <em>Williams v. Dallas County Comm\u2019rs, </em>689 F.2d 1212, 1215 n. 2 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 935, 103 S.Ct. 2102, 77 L.Ed.2d 309 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">. It could be argued that Boyd amended his \u00a7 1983 complaint at the <em>Spears </em>hearing to request the relief of immediate or speedier release from his incarceration. This is the very practice held impermissible by the Court in <em>Preiser; </em>as the Court held, \u201cwhen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 500, 93 S.Ct. at 1841. As a result, placing such an interpretation on Boyd\u2019s statement at the hearing would not change our conclusion: Boyd's \u00a7 1983 action must be dismissed because his claim would then be cognizable only in habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\">. <em>Bivens v.
