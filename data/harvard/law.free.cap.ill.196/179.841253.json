Upon the death of a person intestate, leaving assets in different States, the administration in the domicile of the deceased is the principal administration through which, in contemplation of law, assets are to be distributed in payment of debts, while the administrations in other States are ancillary, and are granted in order to reduce the assets in such States to money.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-11\" pgmap=\"179\">4.

In the absence of a statutory provision it is the duty of an ancillary administrator to collect the assets and reduce them to money and transmit the same to the principal administrator, although he may, under certain circumstances, pay claims probated there and transmit the balance to the principal administrator; but if the estate is insolvent the ancillary administrator has no right to pay resident claimants, or persons who have filed their claims there, more than their pro rata share of the whole estate.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-12\" pgmap=\"179\">5.

If certain creditors of an insolvent dying in Illinois file their claims in the ancillary administration in Missouri and the assets there are divided among them pro rata, it is proper for the court, in ordering distribution in Illinois among creditors of the same class, to direct that the creditors of such class who did not share in the Missouri assets be paid the same per cent received by the others from the Missouri assets, before distributing the remainder pro rata among all.</headnotes><history data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b179-13\" pgmap=\"179\">Ramsay v.

Ramsay died on November 11,1894, residing in Clinton county, this State. His son, E. P. Ramsay, was appointed administrator by the county court of that \"county on the 17th o\u00ed said month. A large number of claims were presented and allowed against the estate, aggregating $183,854.70. Among those claims was one in favor of Julia D. Ramsay, the widow of Rufus N., for $18,931.72, and another in favor pf G. VanHoorebeke for $2020.42. Decedent owned a large amount of real and personal property in this State and also one city lot in St. Louis, Missouri. On the 8th of March, 1895, an administrator was appointed by the probate court of St. Louis in conformity with the laws of that State, it being there provided by statute that a non-resident of the State of. Missouri could not administer upon an estate there. The claims of Mrs. Ramsay and VanHoorebeke were probated and allowed in the St. Louis county court, and through a proceeding by the administrator there to sell real estate to pay debts Mrs. Ramsay received $2561.51 and VanHoorebeke $278.03, being a pro rata payment of 12.44 per cent upon their respective claims. At the time that order of distribution was entered, appellee, the resident administrator, appeared in the St. Louis probate court and asked that the money in the hands of the administrator there be transmitted to him for distribution under direction of the probate court of Clinton, county, but the request was denied. On the 25th of June, 1900, he presented a partial settlement of his administration to the probate court of Clinton county, charging himself with the two items paid to appellants in Missouri and taking credit for the same as having been paid upon their claims. This report showed the assets of the estate on that date, including said claims, amounted to $131,810.42, and that the total liabilities of the estate to seventh-class claimants, including those of appellants, amounted to $183,-854.70. On this report he asked for an order of distribution. Appellants appeared and filed objections, but the court ordered the administrator to pay fifty cents on the dollar upon all claims of the seventh class except those of the appellants, as to which he was directed to deduct the amounts received from the Missouri administrator and pay them fifty cents on the dollar upon the remainder of their claims. Prom that order they took separate appeals to the circuit court of Clinton county, where, by stipulation, they were consolidated and heard on an agreed statement of facts. The circuit court modified the order of the county court, and directed the appellee to pay all claimants, except appellants, 12.44 per cent on their claims, being the amount which they had already received, thus making all other claimants equal with them, and to then distribute the balance in his hands ratably among all claimants of the seventh class. Upon writ of error from the Appellate Court for the Fourth District the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed. Prom that judgment of affirmance this appeal is prosecuted.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\" pgmap=\"181\">It is admitted by all parties that the estate of Rufus N.

The proposition is so manifestly unjust to other creditors of the insolvent estate that it should be sustained only in obedience to strict and imperative requirements of the law. The general policy of the law in all jurisdictions, so far as we are aware, is, that all the property of a deceased insolvent debtor not set apart for the widow or minor children shall become assets in the hands of his administrator for the payment, pro rata, of all his debts according to classification, no matter where the assets may be found or the creditors reside. In Dawes v. Head, 3 Pick. 128, it was said by Parker, Judge: \u201cWe cannot think that in any civilized country advantage ought to be taken of the accidental circumstances of property being found within its territory which may be reduced to possession by the aid of its courts and law, to sequester the whole for the use of its own subjects or citizens, and where it shall be known that all the estate and effects of the deceased are insufficient to pay his just debts. Such a doctrine would be derogatory to the character of any government.\u201d The above quoted sections 263 and 264 of the Missouri statute, as well as other sections of that statute, clearly recognize this just and equitable rule. Our statute provides, that \u201cwhen the estate is insufficient to pay the whole of the demands, the demands in any one class shall be paid pro rata, whether the same are due by judgment, writing obligatory or otherwise, except as otherwise provided.\u201d (1 Starr &amp; Cur. chap. 3, sec. 71.) Unless, therefore, appellants have shown that their claims are in some way exceptions to the general rule, the judgment of the circuit court is right and should be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b186-5\" pgmap=\"186\">It seems to be thought by appellants\u2019 counsel that they ar\u00e9 entitled to a preference over other creditors, as to the Missouri assets, on the principle that in the settlement of insolvent estates a creditor shall be allowed to prove his whole debt without regard to any collateral security he may hold, and be entitled to ,a dividend on the whole claim so allowed,\u2014citing Furness v. Union Nat. Bank, 147 Ill. 570, First Nat. Bank of Peoria v. Commercial Nat. Bank, 151 id. 308, Levy v. Chicago Nat. Bank, 158 id. 88, and cases from other jurisdictions holding the same rule. No argument seems necessary to show that the doctrine of these cases can have no application to the question at issue. How can it be said that the Missouri property was in any sense a collateral security for appellants\u2019 claims, or that it was a fund open to them for the payment of their debts rather than those of all other creditors? At the time of the death of Ramsay he owned the property free from any lien whatever in their favor, and it was liable for the payment of all his debts.</p> <p id=\"b187-4\" pgmap=\"187\">It is further contended that appellants are entitled to a preference over other creditors in that property because of some superior diligence on their part. No reason or authority is cited in support of this contention, and none, we think, can be It was undoubtedly the right of all the creditors of Rufus N. Ramsay to have the Missouri estate, as well as his Illinois property, converted into money and applied in payment of his debts, and it was the duty of the resident administrator to see that that purpose was accomplished. Being a non-resident of the State of Missouri, and therefore disqualified by the statute of that State from taking letters of administration himself, it was his duty to procure administration in the name of a resident. It was undoubtedly also the privilege of any creditor to cause such administration. It was also proper for Illinois creditors to file their claims and have them allowed in the probate court of St. Louis and to cause the real estate there tobe sold for the payment of the debts of Rufus N. Ramsay, but not for the payment of the claims probated there, alone, because by the express provisions of the statute of that State, the estate being insolvent, the property found in Missouri was to be so disposed of that all his creditors there and elsewhere should receive an equal share, in proportion to their respective debts. There was no occasion for diligence upon the part of creditors in filing their claims there. They each had a right to rely upon the Missouri statute for protection against the claim now made by appellants.</p> <p id=\"b187-5\" pgmap=\"187(73) 188(272)\">Upon the death of a person intestate, leaving assets in different States or countries, the administration in the domicile of the deceased is the principal administration through which, in contemplation of law, assets are tolbe distributed in payment of his debts. (Young v. Wittenmyre, 123 Ill. 303.) Administration in other States or jurisdictions must be held in order to collect the debts and reduce the assets into money, which are known as ancillary or auxiliary administrations. In the absence of statutory provision it is the duty of the auxiliary administrators to collect the assets, reduce them to money and transmit them to the principal administrator, or they may, under certain circumstances, pay claims probated there, transmitting only what remains in their hands to the principal administrator. Where, however, the estate is insolvent, it has been held, and we think with reason and justice, that the auxiliary administrator has no right to pay resident claimants, or those who have filed their claims there, more than their pro rata share of the whole estate. (Dawes v. Head, supra; Davis v. Easty, 8 Pick. 475; Minor v. Austin, 45 Iowa, 221; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 434.) Manifestly, under section 263 of the Missouri statute, the administrator there had no right to pay these appellants more than their proportionate part of the whole assets, taking into account all seventh-class \u201ccreditors there and elsewhere,\u201d even though the property in that State had sold for enough t\u00f3 pay them in full, and, as we have said, every \u201ccreditor there or elsewhere\u201d had a right to rely upon his performing his duty under that statute. He might have complied with the request of appellee, and after paying the small claims of resident creditors transmitted the balance of the fund in his hands for distribution. However, his refusal to do so, and the refusal of the St. Louis probate court to order him to do so, did not render it impracticable to still give effect to said section 263 and the provisions of our own statute, above quoted.</p> <p id=\"b188-5\" pgmap=\"188(83) 189(14)\">It is to be observed that these appellants are not content with what the Missouri court gave them, but come into the probate court of Clinton county and demand that they shall be allowed to participate in the assets in the hands of the appellee, the resident administrator. Having done so, we entertain no doubt that the latter court had the power, and that it was its duty, to require them to account for that which they had received under the Missouri administration, and to order a distribution pro rata among all the seventh-class creditors.-</p> <p id=\"b189-4\" pgmap=\"189\">The judgment of the circuit court to that effect was right, and was properly affirmed by the Appellate Court.</p> <p id=\"b189-5\" pgmap=\"189\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
