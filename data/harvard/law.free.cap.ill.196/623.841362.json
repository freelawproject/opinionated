M. Lane, a non-resident of Cass county; that $500 thereof belonged to one John T. Walton; that $2500 thereof belonged to one Milton McClure; that the two last named persons resided in Cass county, and that the notes and mortgages owned by them, respectively, had been assessed for taxation in Cass county for the year 1901, and that the board of review raised the assessment of appellant $84,400, not because it was of the opinion said notes and mortgages belonged to appellant on April 1, 1901, but because he refused to disclose to said board the names of the persons to whom he had sold and transferred the same. The circuit court found the issues in favor of the appellee and entered a decree dismissing the bill.</p> <p id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625(311) 626(17)\">The board of review had no right to punish the appellant by raising his assessment for his refusal to disclose to it the names of the persons to whom he had sold and transferred said notes and mortgages. Neither had it the right to assess to appellant, for 1901, property of which he was not the owner on April 1 of that year. There is no law authorizing a board of review to impose a penalty upon a mortgagee who declines to disclose to it the name of his assignee, where the mortgage has been sold and transferred in good faith before April 1, by raising his assessment to an amount equal to the amount of the said mortgagee; neither has it the right to assess one man\u2019s property to another, and when such an assessment is made the same is made without authority of law, and a tax based upon such assessment will be enjoined. (Irvin v. New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago Railroad Co. 94 Ill. 105; Searing v. Heavysides, 106 id. 85; Allwood v. Cowen, Ill id. 481.) In Irvin v. New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago Railroad Co. supra, property belonging to the Illinois Central Railroad Company was assessed to the Mississippi Central Railroad Company. A bill was filed to enjoin the collection of the tax, and it was held the assessment was made without authority of law, and the court enjoined the collection of the tax. In Searing v. Heavysides, supra, certain grain was assessed as the property of complainant but in which he had no interest, and it was held the tax levied on such assessment was levied without warrant of law, and the court restrained the collection of the tax. In Allwood v. Cowen, supra, it is said (p. 486): \u201cThe court has had frequent occasion to declare that chancery has jurisdiction to enjoin the collection of a tax when it is levied without authority of law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b626-4\" pgmap=\"626\">The decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court with directions to enter a decree enjoining the collection of said tax.</p> <p id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">. Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">Magruder, C. J., and Wilkin, J., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
