This court there held that the proceeding was under and in pursuance of a rule of practice not unlawful, and that it would not by <em>mandamus </em>compel the court below to do an act lying entirely within its discretion. In our opinion that case rales this, and the <em>mandamus </em>must be refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
