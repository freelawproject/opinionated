No one, having a reasonable ground to believe in the existence of a fact without any to doubt it, is bound to push his inquiries as to the fact, so as to discover the truth, before, without responsibility, he can state its existence, in a negotiation. His statement of it, however false, can never be fraudulent without an intention to deceive.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b9-10\">2. Where the seller of a claim against a third person, represented to its buyer, the debtor to be <em>\u201c </em>perfectly good,\u201d and that \u201c there would be no difficulty in getting the money\u201d if judgment was recovered against him; that he was \u201c abundantly good, very wealthy and had a great deal of property;\u201d and the evidence showed that such seller had reason to believe such statements true, and none to the contrary, and that until a short time before such representations were made, the debtor was generally reputed to be solvent, and any difficulty in his pecuniary condition was only known to a few confidential friends, counsel and employees; <em>Held, </em>that such seller was not liable for the falsity of such statements, because he did not exercise the ordinary care of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>prudent man, in endeavoring to ascertain the truth of such statements before he made them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b10-5\">3. No recovery can be had in such a case, where-the complaint does not allege that such representations were made for some purpose. Their mere falsity, without some deception practiced or intended, is no ground of action. It is only where a party negotiating a transaction undertakes in it to tell all he knows, that he is bound to do so, unless there is some relation of confidence between both parties. \u2022</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b10-6\">4. Representations by a seller, which merely extol the character of an article offered for sale, such as, in the case of a claim against a third person, that he is rich, has a great deal of property, is abundantly able to pay all claims against him, and can pay the claim if recovered, are to be expected by buyers, very usual, and too vague to be the basis of an action. If a buyer desires more, he should have the statement reduced to more certainty, or insist on a guaranty. Such statements, without some other concomitant circumstances or expressions, are mere expressions of opinion, for which a vendor is not responsible.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b10-7\">(Before Robertson, Ch.

On that day the defendant sold and assigned such contract to .the plaintiff, by an assignment in writing, with a covenant against any acts on his part impairing the claim. The plaintiff had previously been consulted, as an attorney, by the defendant, in reference to the legal validity of the claim, and had undertaken to prosecute it on shares, but subsequently proposed to purchase the claim outright, and himself drew the assignment. The consideration of'the purchase was $4338, part of which consisted of an indebtedness due from the defendant to some friends of the plaintiff, which the latter assumed, and the residue of- a small sum due to the plaintiff himself, which he discharged. After receiving the assignment, the plaintiff took steps to enforce the demand against <em>Stewart. </em>He established the claim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>recovered judgment upon it; but <em>Stewart </em>proved to be insolvent, and nothing was collected. The judgment was recovered in New York in June, 1862, and execution returned unsatisfied in December following. He also took proceedings in Michigan, which he discontinued upon recovering judgment in New York. <em>Stewart </em>died in Detroit in 1862 or 1863, where he had lived for the previous fifteen years; was insolvent at the time of his death; he had been secretly embarrassed for several years, and was probably ins'olvent at the date of the plaintiff\u2019s purchase. In January,. 1864, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover of the defendant $12,633, the amount of the judgment he had obtained against <em>Stewart, </em>upon the allegation that the defendant, on making the sale, had undertaken and pi\u2019omised that <em>Stewart </em>was \u201cgood, solvent and responsible.\u201d The case was referred, and upon the opening of the trial, the referee held that- the contract between the parties as contained in the written assignment, could not be enlarged by parol. The plaintiff then moved to amend by changing his cause of action to one. for fraud and deceit. The amendment was allowed under exception, and the words \u201c falsely and fraudulently,\u201d were then inserted in the complaint. The plaintiff proved that prior to his purchase of the claim the defendant \u201c represented and stated to him that <em>Stewart </em>was perfectly good,\u201d was \u201cvery rich and very wealthy,\u201d &amp;c. and that on the day of the assignment he said, after having signed it, \u201c if you get judgment you will have no difficulty in getting the money.\u201d There was no evidence that these statements were not made in good faith, or that the defendant had the slighest suspicion that <em>Stewart </em>was not wealthy. He offered but was not permitted to show that he had never heard any thing against his solvency. He was allowed to, and did, testify that at the time'of the transfer of the claim he believed Stewart^to be a \u201c man of wealth and position.\u201d This was not contradicted. The referee\u2019s finding on this point was <em>not </em>that the defendant knew his statements to be false, or did not believe them to be true, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>simply that he made them without exercising \u201c ordinary care and prudence to ascertain whether they could be made with truth or not.\u201d Upon this conclusion, he rescinded the arrangement, awarding to the plaintiff, not the amount claimed, but the amount he had paid with interest, and his expenses in prosecuting the demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-5\">' Judgment was entered' accordingly, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b12-6\"><em>S. P. Nash, </em>for the appellant, defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-7\">I. The decision of the referee obliterates all the distinctions between causes of action upon contract, and those which arise out of fraud or deceit. \u2022 It is without authority and utterly untenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-8\">1. Statements and representations may be so carelessly made, that the recklessness in making them may be evidence of fraud, and excuse <em>express </em>proof that they were made with knowledge of their falsity; but if they are not found as a matter of fact to have been fraudulently made, the party making them is not responsible for their truth, if by his contract he do not.undertake to be.' A purchaser may always exact a warranty; if he omit to do so, the rule is <em>eaveat emptor; </em>unless deceit is shown, which means dishonesty, not carelessness. In late cases, where a party making false representations has been held liable for the truth of them without express proof of <em>scienter; (see Mead </em>v. <em>Bunn, </em>32 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>275; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>21 <em>id. </em>238; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mayor of N. Y., </em>40 <em>Barb. </em>256; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Ward, 36 id. </em>377; <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>41 <em>id. </em>172; <em>Graloupeau </em>v. <em>Ketchum, </em>3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>175;) they were found to have been made fraudulently; but representations made innocently, are not a ground of action for fraud, though they turn out to be untrue. <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>31 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>518, 530. <em>Wakeman </em>v. <em>Dalley, </em>44 <em>Barb. </em>498. <em>Binnard </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>42 <em>id. </em>470.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-9\">2. The alleged misrepresentations were not assertions of <em>fact </em>as within the defendant\u2019s own knowledge; they were statements, which in their nature implied that the .party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>making them was governed by appearances. The public is continually imposed upon as to the supposed wealth of individuals ; to say of a man that he is <em>rich, </em>rarely implies that the speaker knows intimately about his affairs. The defendant had trusted <em>Stewart, </em>knew him as a man who lived luxuriously, and engaged in large business enterprises, and honestly assumed that he was wealthy. The plaintiff, himself, urged the purchase as a speculation, but, though disappointed in the profit of it, did not try to prove, that the defendant had been guilty of any intention to cheat him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-5\">II. The plaintiff claimed to be entitled to recover the full value of the demand against <em>Stewart </em>as a collectable demand. The referee, as if conscious that the action could not be sustained upon the ground of fraud, seems to have gone upon some theory of mutual mistake, and undertaken to rescind or reform the contract, by restoring to the plaintiff what he had paid, and directing an assignment to the defendant of the judgment against <em>Stewart. </em>But the action is not sustainable in any such view, any more than <em>as an action on the case for deceit, </em>which is the frame of the .complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-6\">1. The alleged deceit not having been established, the complaint should have been dismissed. The case was not tried as an action for equitable relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-7\">2. The case was not for rescission on the ground of mistake. This, too, is an equitable action and required evidence that the agreement, as reduced to writing, failed to express the contract of the parties. The plaintiff himself drew it, and did not pretend to testify that the defendant undertook to guaranty the collectability of the claim. He did covenant that the demand had not been impaired by any act of his, but nothing more. <em>(See Botsford </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>45 <em>Barb. </em>478; <em>Nevius </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>33 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>676.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-8\">3. To sustain an action at law, to get back money paid by mistake of fact, it is requisite that the mistake be one that totally avoids the payment, at the time it is made; as where money is paid to the wrong person, or the like. But this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>doctrine does not apply, where the mistake complained of is simply, that the party would not have paid so much, if he had known all the facts. <em>(See Price </em>v. <em>Neale, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1354; <em>Franklin Bank </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>3 <em>Wend. </em>69; <em>Id. </em>412; <em>Wheadon </em>v. <em>Olds, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>174; <em>Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Union Bank, </em>3 <em>Comst. </em>230.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-5\">4. To recover money paid by mistake, the party paying must act promptly after discovering the mistake. <em>(Canal Bank </em>v. <em>Bank of Albany, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>287. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>6 <em>id. </em>340.) Here the assignment to the plaintiff was in 1860. He brought this suit in 1864.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-6\">HI. The referee had no power to amend by changing the nature of the action. The decision, allowing such amendment, was therefore erroneous.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-7\">IV. The evidence was totally insufficient to warrant the findings of fact excepted to. The alleged representations were made before any proposition was pending to transfer the claim, and while the. plaintiff held it as defendant\u2019s attorney for the purpose of collection. The plaintiff, him- \u2022 self, proposed to purchase, and his letter shows conclusively that he took it at his own risk. The court will look into the evidence of the alleged representations, as it is that of the plaintiff himself, and his only ; upon his own statements it seems quite clear that the judgment cannot be sustained, without overthrowing principles as long settled as any in the law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-8\"><em>A. J. Vanderpoel, </em>for the respondent, plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-9\">I. The appellant is bound to make good his representations. It is immaterial whether he knew or did not know of Stewart\u2019s insolvency. He obtained money of the respondent by a representation, false in fact; and as the respondent relied entirely on these representations, the appellant cannot relieve himself from responsibility by setting up his ignorance in the matter. He professed to know Stewart\u2019s condition, obtained money on the assertion of his responsibility, and it was a fraud on the respondent, whatever the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>belief of the appellant in the matter was. If Stewart had been at the time what the appellant represented him, and by some means had become insolvent afterwards, then the appellant would have stood in a different position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-5\">II. The exceptions of the appellant to rulings on the trial, consisting of three; one to the referee\u2019s refusal to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on the closing of his evidence, and the others to the ruling out two questions proposed by the appellant, viz : \u201c When did you first hear (how early) any thing affecting Stewart\u2019s insolvency?\u201d \u201cHad you ever heard that his paper had been protested ?\u201d are not well taken. It is scarcely necessary to discuss these exceptions, especially after the appellant had been allowed to testify, that at the time of making the assignment to the respondent, he believed Stewart to be a man of wealth and position. That testimony was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-6\">III. As to the exceptions to the referee\u2019s findings of fact:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-7\">1. The fifth finding of the referee is well sustained by the evidence, not contradicted by the appellant; and so exceptions first and second fail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-8\">2. The seventh' finding is correct, and, of course, - the third exception bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-9\">3.. The fourth exception \u25a0 (to fourteenth finding) has no toundation to rest on, there being no evidence of any care or prudence on the part of the appellant to ascertain whether his representations were correct. And the omission to find what the plaintiff' <em>believed, </em>is only an omission on the part of the referee to claim a knowledge of the operations of another\u2019s mind. If any thing had- depended on the <em>belief of </em>a party who had professed, absolutely to <em>Jcnow, </em>then the utmost that would be required of a referee would be to find that <em>he had reason </em>to believe or disbelieve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-10\">4. The fifth objection was bad. 1st, because the respondent was bound to prosecute this claim to judgment; 2d, because there is no evidence that the insolvency of Stewart was known to the respondent till the return of the execution; 3d, because then he had a just claim to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>he has demanded in this action, payment by the appellant of the amount of the' judgment against Stewart, to entitle the appellant to an assignment of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">IV. The exception <em>(sixth) </em>to the referee\u2019s conclusions of law, is sufficiently answered by the evidence, that the appellant made the very strongest assertions of a matter as within his knowledge, and of which\" the respondent had no knowledge, which assertions were wholly false, and on these assertions obtained the respondent\u2019s money, and induced him to enter into a contract, involving, besides the money paid, much of labor, professional skill and responsibility. <em>(Mead </em>v. <em>Bunn, </em>32 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>280. 1 <em>Story on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 506, <em>et seq. Bennett </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>21 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>238. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>36 <em>Barb. </em>377, <em>see p. </em>385. <em>Galoupeau </em>v. <em>Ketchum, </em>3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>175. <em>McFaran </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>3 <em>Cranch. </em>280. <em>Hazard </em>v. <em>Irwin, 18 Pick. </em>95.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-6\">By the Court, Robertson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">The fraudulent representation on which the case depends, which was put at issue by the pleadings, was the assertion of the defendant that a Mr. Stewart, against whom he held the claim mentioned in the complaint, sold by him to the plaintiff, was \u201c wealthy and <em>abundantly responsible </em>for any judgment that might be recovered against him.\u201d The referee found that he had made a somewhat different representation, to wit, '\u201cthat Stewart was <em>perfectly good, </em>and if any judgment was recovered against him, there would be <em>no difficulty in recovering the money ;\u201d </em>also, that \u201che was <em>very rich, very wealthy.\u201d </em>And, again, on a subsequent occasion, when executing the assignment, the defendant, addressing the plaintiff, said: \u201cIf you can get a judgment you will have no difficulty in getting the money.\u201d The referee also found as fact, not only that such representations were <em>false in fact, </em>but that Stewart, when they were made, \u201cwas greatly embarrassed, in insolvent circumstances, and unable to pay his debts.\u201d Yet he also found that \u201c there was no evidence tending to show that the defendant knew them to be false,\u201d or that he \u201c did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>believe all that he uttered, touching the responsibility of Stewart.\u201d But, (by way of qualification of such previous findings,) that the defendant did not exercise ordinary care and prudence to ascertain whether they could be made \u201c <em>with truth.\u201d </em>Unless, therefore, the failure to exercise such prudence amounted in law to a fraud, the defendant' stands acquitted by the' report, of all fraud or evil intent, at least so far as his belief is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">Uncontradicted evidence in the case shows that the defendant had some reason to believe his statements of Stewart\u2019s means true. He had seen- his residence, with its furniture, ornaments and works of art,' his style of living in luxurious ease, maintaining horses and carriages. He also knew that he had lately received $150,000 for two steamers sold by himself for him. And there is no evidence in the case to show that he had any reason to suppose that insolvency lurked behind such a goodly outside show, or to doubt the reality of the wealth, it seemed to indicate. The referee therefore, having gone so far, should have gone farther and stated what there was in the caseto impose upon the defendant any duty of making further inquiries before he ventured to make the statement he did; but his report is silent as to the extent of the defendant\u2019s knowledge .of Stewart\u2019s affairs, the circumstances which should have prompted him to inquiry, the resources which lay open to him for investigating Stewart\u2019s condition in February, 1860, including the publicity or privacy of the real state of his affairs, which were proper elements of forming a judgment as to the propriety and success of further inquiry. The referee might, therefore, have gone further than he did, by finding not only that the defendant believed his statements to be true, but -had some reason to do so, and none to think the contrary: Yet he seems to have considered his finding of want <em>of proper eare and prudence </em>in the defendant in verifying his statements before he made them, as antagonistical to the beneficial effects of acquitting him of guilty knowledge of their falsity. This would not be its legal effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>unless a person who makes a statement of a fact connected with the subject of a sale, in general terms, founded upon what warranted a belief in his truth, is bound to set out upon a new investigation to discover whether it is accurately and literally true; in other words, whether he actually <em>warrants </em>it to be true. When a person trusts to a representation he trusts to the honesty of the party making it; if he wishes more he should require a warranty. If any circumstance of suspicion had come to the' defendant\u2019s knowledge tending to raise a doubt as to the truth of his general statement, he was bound either to disclose it or investigate it to its <em>source; </em>but there was no proof of any, in this ease. I am at a loss, however, to understand upon what principle, a party, having some reason to .believe a fact to exist and none to raise a doubt of its existence, is under any obligation to investigate further the proofs of its existence, before he can with safety venture to state that it exists, or his belief in it. If he has such reason, and none to the contrary, his statement can never be fraudulent, however false it may be. The ordinary business of life could never be carried on, if such responsibility rested on every man who made a statement of a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">But if the referee intended not only to find the insolvency of Stewart, but also supposed of inferred his condition to be either so publicly known, or with such inquiries as a man of ordinary prudence would make, likely to be discovered, it becomes necessary to sift the evidence as to such condition, its causes and its and their publicity, or secrecy, since the mere fact of embarrassments does not necessarily imply that insolvency could be discovered by ordinary inquiries in the face of the apparent possession of wealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Six witnesses living at the former residence of Stewart (Detroit) and far distant from the residence of the defendant, were examined respecting the actual and apparent pecuniary condition of the former. Four of them (Gray, Romeyn, Pond and Jerome) were practicing lawyers there, and all of them appear on different occasions to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>consulted by him professionally, and derived the far greater part of their knowledge of his affairs mainly, if not entirely, in consequence of the confidence necessarily reposed by him in such professional capacity. They .were allowed to give as evidence their opinions, derived from such information, of his insolvency at the time of making the representations in question, and three of them were permitted to add to them knowledge acquired afterwards. <em>Gray </em>only acquired \u201ca full and thorough knowledge of his debts and property\u201d in the early part of 1861. <em>Romeyn </em>(who was his counsel from 1858 to 1861,) gave some details of some suits against him in 1857 and 1858. <em>Pond </em>was retained by him in August, 1860, (until which time he had no special knowledge of his affairs,) to defend a suit against him, on a mortgage given in 1857. <em>Jerome looked into his affairs with him </em>in November, 1859. Gray, after testifying that \u201c Stewart, for a number of years, was <em>reputed to be a man of great </em>wealth, constantly engaged in extensive operations,\u201d owning \u201ca large <em>amount of property\u201d </em>and owing a large amount of debts; that <em>ufor many years </em>after \u201d he \u201c first knew him (1847) <em>his credit was good, and he was generally deemed good and responsible,\u201d </em>stated, that <em>\u201ca short time before </em>1860 his credit began to fail in general estimation.\u201d <em>Romeyn, </em>after describing him to be, in 1858, \u201c a man <em>controlling large resources, but in bad credit, not paying his paper at maturity </em>and constantly embarrassed,\u201d stated that his <em>\u201c </em>dwelling house was mortgaged prior to 1860,\u201d and that in May, 1860, \u201c he executed a chattel mortgage on <em>his household furniture, plate, pictures, \u00bf\u2022e. </em>to secure * * more than $20,000.\u201d He further stated that Stewart\u2019s paper had been \u201cunder protest for large amounts; in 1857 he was sued * * in a case where some $10,000 was recovered; * * early in 1858, there were suits against him on commercial paper.\u201d <em>Pond, </em>after-stating that \u201c up to about the year 1859, Mr. Stewart was <em>reputed to be wealthy, </em>and was engaged in large business transactions,\u201d added, \u201cin the <em>latter part of the year </em>1859, he became much embarrassed in his pecuniary circumstances. His paper was dishonored and suits were brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>against him thereon, and his circumstances continued to grow worse, till the time of his death.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that his \u201c knowledge of Mr. Stewart\u2019s affairs, <em>before the summer of </em>186.0, was very general and derived from\u201d others. <em>Jerome </em>thought Stewart was <em>\u201cin bad credit </em>in February, 1860, and for a <em>considerable while before.\u201d </em>Mr. Ward,' (apparently an intimate friend) who was constantly consulted by Stewart respecting his affairs, previous to February, 1860, after saying of him, \u201c he was then a man of large business operations, but in poor credit,\u201d added that he \u201c pledged all his available property as collateral security.\u201d Stewart\u2019s confidential clerk, (Sanger,) who was also manager of a bank, of which the former was the principal owner, after stating him to be a \u201c large borrower of money, who did not meet his paper promptly or pay his employees, or for improvements made on his property, to a large amount,\u201d admitted that <em>prior to </em>1860, \u201che had large amounts of property in his hands,\u201d although heavily encumbered, and \u201c of which he had never paid all the purchase money.\u201d But he further testified that suits were constantly brought against him on overdue paper of his,\u201d and that he was \u201cconstantly living * * on borrowing money from one man to pay another.\u201d An execution levied upon his household furniture in 1858, was paid by his friends. This, with the testimony of the defendant already alluded to, constitutes all the evidence of Stewart\u2019s real and apparent condition in 1860, and all the means presented to a stranger for discovering the former, except the opinions of his counsel, already referred to (which are objectionable as evidence, in any aspect of them,) and testimony relating to dates after February, 1860. It, however, raises the question, with such external <em>indicia </em>of wealth and apparently continuous prosperity for several years, what means might, could or would any ordinarily prudent man have adopted, if any, to have ascertained its reality, before he asserted it, on the sale of a claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">In answering such question, it is proper to notice of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>property by the evidence, Stewart appeared to be the owner about February, 1860. He occupied a well appointed dwelling house, (his own, although mortgaged,) containing furniture and .works of art, on which, in May subsequently he was able to borrow $20,000,. the whole fully sufficient, unless encumbered, to pay the claim of the plaintiff. He had either towards the end of 1858 or in 1859, received $150,000 for the steamers sold for him by the defendant. He owned the property mentioned in the complaint, in this state. He was \u201c chief owner \u201d of \u201c The Peninsula Bank.\u201d According to his confidential clerk, (Sanger,) \u201c he had <em>considerable amounts of property </em>in his hands.\u201d According to Gray \u201che owned a <em>large amount of property.\u201d </em>And according to Romeyn, in 1858, \u201c he <em>controlled large resources.\u201d </em>He lived expensively, and kept horses for his private use. \u25a0 His credit, as stated by Mr. Gray, for <em>many years </em>after his first acquaintance with him, (in 1847,) was <em>good, </em>\u201che was <em>generally </em>deemed <em>good and responsible.\u201d \u201c He was reputed to be wealthy, </em>(Pond states,) up to 1859.\u201d It was at the end of that year, his inextricable embarrassment seems to have begun. \u201cHis credit,\u201d according to Gray, \u201cbegan to fail a <em>short time </em>before 1860, \u201c <em>in general estimation.\u201d </em>It was not, however, until 1861, the latter discovered Stewart\u2019s <em>insolvency. </em>His furniture seems to have remained unencumbered until May, 1860. The time when <em>\u201che became much </em>embarrassed in his pecuniary circumstances\u201d from which onward they gradually grew worse, is also fixed by Mr. Pond' as being \u201c <em>the latter part of </em>1859.\u201d The same witness, however, admits that he was not sued for a mortgage given in 1857, until three years after it was given, (August, I860,) and three suits against Stewart, which are the only ones he specifies, were not brought until the spring, and in April and September of that year respectively. . Although urged to make an assignment in February, 1860, by his friend and adviser, Ward, he r\u00e9fused to do so. Mr. Jerome, who in November, 1859, on a thorough examination, had found his assets to fall $200,000 short of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>his liabilities, merely says vaguely and in general terms: \u201cIn February, 1860, he was <em>not a man of </em>wealth, and had not been <em>for many months previous </em>thereto. He was in <em>had credit </em>then, and had been so for <em>a considerable while.\u201d </em>Even Romeyn only fixes his <em>\u201copen and avowed insolvency\u201d </em>as occurring \u201c subsequent \u201d to February, 1860, although he says \u201c the causes which resulted in \u201d it \u201c existed then,\u201d and he apparently traces them back to 1857 and 1858, when he admits \u201c he controlled large resources,\u201d although ' \u201c in <em>bad creditf </em>not paying his paper at maturity and constantly embarrassed.\u201d This hardly coincides with the testimony of Gray arid Pond, -and can only be explained by the possibly more intimate knowledge of his affairs by Romeyn, and his occasional temporary difficulty of 'meeting engagements, which was subsequently overcome. He appears to have always commanded the confidence of his friends, either by his means or his capacity to redeem his affairs from temporary difficulty. They paid the execution on his furniture in 1858. As Sanger describes him, he was \u201ca large borrower of money,\u201d \u201che was constantly borrowing from \u25a0one man to pay another;\u201d and as Romeyn says, \u201che controlled large resources.\u201d This accounts for keeping up his credit until 1860. He did not even then, apparently, dis-pair of being able to recuperate, as he' refused to make an assignment, and his creditors do not seem to have attacked him until April, 1860. The suits in 1857 and 1858, spoken of by Romeyn, must have been disposed of before 1860, or else lasted until after February of that year. At all events they did not interfere with the credit of Stewart as testified to by Gray and Pond. \u25a0 But even if the defendant had discovered by diligent inquiiy, all the embarrassments of his debtor prior to 1860, he would not necessarily be bound to conclude he was not <em>wealthy </em>or <em>able to pay his claim. </em>Many a man in active business, who not only holds a large amount of property, but is actually wealthy, may, at least in this country, have it encumbered; be largely in debt, occasionally fail in his engagements and frequently borrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>large sums from his friends. Still more, who are reputed to be wealthy under such circumstances, but not in reality so, frequently rise by the chances of commerce, from such a state of tottering.equilibrium to stable fortunes. The true condition of the latter is rarely suspected, except by friends or those dealing with them. If not suspected, it is still more rarely discovered except by the u\u00fctiring vigilance of some constant spy or enemy.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">It is very evident that- ordinary inquiries at Stewart\u2019s place of residence, (Detroit,) would only have elicited the facts publicly known and already mentioned, of his possession of property, being in debt and borrowing money, and that his credit was good until 1860; whether he could have ascertained the change in the latter is .problematical, since the witnesses do not state how public the knowledge of his embarrassment was. I presume it would not be contended that the defendant was bound to examine the records of the courts of the state of New York, where Stewart did not reside, or even of Michigan where he did, to ascertain what suits had been brought against him,.or their fate, or have gone to all the notaries in the city of New York to have ascertained whether he had any commercial paper protested.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">It is somewhat singular that the only witnesses introduced to prove the hollowness of Stewart\u2019s appearance of wealth, were his four counsel, who had obtained their knowledge professionally; his friend, to whom in seeking his advice, he had laid bare his whole affairs; and his confidential clerk. I doubt very much whether, if the defendant had made inquiries of either, he would have been as successful as the plaintiff has been in procuring the required information. They probably would have been <em>then </em>loth to betray his confidence. No one of the external community, in which Stewart lived, has been produced, to show how much information could have been obtained by a resident of New York, by general inquiries in Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The report of the referee does not furnish us with any standard- or test of the ordinary care and prudence, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>he supposed the seller of an article ought to exercise in order to <em>ascertain </em>whether he could make any representation respecting it with truth; nor have I been able to discover that there was any thing peculiar in this case, which imposed the duty of inquiring into Stewart\u2019s responsibility upon the defendant, before he made the representation in question. The defendant did not undertake to give any details respecting Stewart\u2019s affairs; he merely states a general conclusion, that he was rich; and that the plaintiff would get his money if he recovered judgment against him. It is impossible to ascertain, what efforts the referee supposed the defendant ought to have made, in exercising ordinary care and prudence to ascertain Stewart\u2019s real condition, although only bound to exercise such diligence as was ordinary. \"With seeming outward solidity up to the very time of the representation, the hollowness of the prosperity of Stewart was known only .to a few confidential friends, employees and counsel, and not suspected by any of the public, until very shortly before such representation. It is, therefore, rather puzzling to know where the defendant should have begun his inquiries to verify his statement. The knowledge already possessed by the defendant, was such as <em>ordinary prudence </em>might have been satisfied with. I cannot, therefore, come to any other conclusion on the evidence, than that there were no inquiries, which a person of mere <em>ordinary </em>prudence would have been likely to make that would, except by accident, have given the defendant any more information than he had, and therefore, that if he had then, for the first time, obtained that information, he had obtained enough to warrant his making the representation he did, and there was no evidence to show that a man of <em>ordinary </em>prudence would require more. The finding of the referee, if he means to say the defendant could have discovered the untruth of his statement by the exercise of <em>ordinary </em>prudence, I therefore consider as unsupported by evidence as it is by probabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>If, however, the referee held that there was any obligation on the defendant merely to make further inquiries without regard to their result, before he made the representation he did, he being warranted in, or having some reason for making it, from what he knew, it was a mistake of law. If there was any thing suspicious in what he knew, as I have said,' he was bound to disclose it or investigate the justice or injustice of his suspicion, but not otherwise. There is neither reason nor authority for any such doctrine, nor was it contended for on the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The report of the referee finds in the alternative, that either the next day after the defendant received the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 17th of February, 1860, offering to buy the claim in question, (18th,) \u201c <em>or in a previous interview, </em>proposed to the plaintiff that he should take such claim,\u201d and \u201c at the same time or times represented to the plaintiff that <em>Stewart was -perfectly good, and if a judgment was recovered against Mm, there would he no difficulty in recovering the money, </em>and in the same representations stated, \u201c <em>Stewart is very </em>rich\u2014very wealthy,\u201d and also at the time of executing the transfer of such claim, stated, \u201c If you can get judgment, there will be no difficulty in getting the money.\u201d And also that \u201cthe plaintiff relied upon such representations, and was <em>thereby </em>induced to agree to discharge the indebtedness of the defendant, and accept \u201c such transfer as a consideration therefor.\u201d. The referee, therefore, either meant to acknowledge an inability to determine which event preceded the other, the writing of the plaintiff\u2019s letter or the making of the representations as found by him, or considered their sequence in order of time immaterial. I think, however, it will be found so material, whether such representations were made before or after such letter was written, that it becomes proper to examine the evidence in relation to it. The plaintiff, on his direct examination, (as a witness for himself,) stated that the negotiations for the transfer had been made <em>some days </em>before \u201cit was executed, and although on such direct-examination he stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>defendant \u201d proposed 44 that he should take the claim against Stewart on the terms subsequently agreed to, he acknowledged that he could not \u201ctell what the commencement was,\u201d and on his cross-examination declared his inability \u201cto say from which party the suggestion ' came.\u201d The plaintiff had previously agreed to prosecute the claim on shares, as the defendant\u2019s counsel. He further testified that he became satisfied in their \u201c consultations,\u201d that the claim was a good one, oh the facts' as stated by the defendant. The latter represented to him \u201c that Stewart was perfectly good, and that if a judgment could be recovered against him there would be no difficulty in collecting the money.\u201d He remembered the defendant\u2019s expressions; they \u201c were very emphatic.\u201d The latter \u201c said <em>much more </em>to the same purport.\u201d The plaintiff, however, \u201c didn\u2019t remember .the exact language.\u201d The defendant said that Stewart was abundantly good, very wealthy, and had <em>a great deal of property. </em>He repeatedly made use of this at the time of the assignment. On the plaintiff\u2019s.cross-examination, however, he thought 44 <em>the conversation he had detailed, took place on the execution of the assignment.\u201d </em>On being asked to <em>state all that he recollected was said on that </em>occasion, he answered \u201c <em>1 am unable to state with distinctness more than this; </em>I think <em>on executing the </em>agreement, on laying down the pen, the defendant said, <em>if you get judgment you will have no difficulty in getting the money.\u201d </em>A witness for the plaintiff (Gilmore) stated he heard \u201c about the time of the sale and assignment \u201d in question, 44 <em>and just previous,\u201d one or two conversations </em>between the parties, in regard to the wealth and solvency of Stewart. The defendant said he 44 was wealthy, very rich,\u201d and if44 the plaintiff got judgment against him, he would be sure of the money.\u201d This testimony is perfectly consistent with the fact that the defendant made such statements to the plaintiff, before the latter agreed to prosecute the claim in question on shares, and, as he says, during their <em>consultations, </em>which is highly probable from their relations. If that be so, it is hardly probable that the defendant found it necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to reiterate such mere general assertions of Stewart\u2019s wealth in order to induce the plaintiff to purchase the claim. According to such testimony of the plaintiff, however, the whole representations are reduced to a single remark made by the defendant after executing the assignment, that the <em>plaintiff would get his money, if Tie \u25a0 got a judgment. </em>The defendant, in <em>Ms </em>testimony denies ever making any proposition to the plaintiff to take the claim on his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s letter, however, of the 17th of February, 1860, contains in itself intrinsic evidence that it constituted all the negotiation, that was made for the sale afterwards concluded. The plaintiff' first speaks therein of the suggestion as coming from a third person (Dr. Patton) that he should buy the claim, as something entirely novel, and gives the reasons urged by such third party why it was advantageous for the defendant to sell the claim, to which the plaintiff' had assented; but declined risking any thing beyond his own claim, and had thereupon merely informed Dr. Patton of his previous arrangement with the defendant. He expresses his own contentment with that, but proposes to take the claim <em>ufor the </em>$3806 balance\u201d and make an arrangement with \u201c the parties,\u201d so as to have their claims contained, in the amount the defendant had discharged. He further therein expresses his desire to see the defendant if disposed to make the transfer on those terms, on that day, as 11 <em>the parties wished to leave </em>\u201d <em>that night, </em>but begs to be considered as not soliciting the transfer. One of those parties was the witness Gilmore. The plaintiff drew the assignment ; it was executed at his office the next day after such letter was sent. Nothing was said in such letter of any previous negotiation. No inquiry was made as to Stewart\u2019s responsibility. The plaintiff made an unconditional offer and it was accepted and carried out next day, probably as early as possible, in order to allow the holders of claims against the defendant to leave. Any representations made by the latter, which induced the plaintiff to adhere to his offer, if he was desirous of withdrawing it, must have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>made between writing that letter and receiving the assignment, but there is no proof of any. The only one distinctly testified to, is that made by the defendant when he laid \u25a0 down the pen after signing it. The idea of a negotiation lasting several days is thus dispelled. \"Whatever impression the plaintiff had of Stewart\u2019s responsibility derived from representations of the defendant in regard to it, was undoubtedly derived from statements made before the first arrangement, to prosecute on joint account. It is very true, that if they tended to deceive the plaintiff, the defendant was bound, if he knew he was laboring under a false impression therefrom, to undeceive him when he proposed to sell to him. But he did not. The offer came from the plaintiff undoubtedly relying on his previous impression, but not on any derived from new representations. The prophetic statement that \u201c <em>if he got judgment he would get his money \u201d </em>is not a representation of an existing fact, and the evidence does not warrant the referee\u2019s finding that during any negotiation for the sale the defendant represented that Stewart was <em>abundantly able </em>to satisfy any claini against him. Both the allegations in the complaint, and findings in the report, either that the defendant made the representation to the plaintiff therein set forth, when he proposed to sell his claim to him, or that he ever proposed to sell it to him, are thus not only unproved, but disproved. And if the case turned upon that, it would render the judgment erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">There is also no allegation in the complaint, nor is it found by the referee, in his report, that the defendant made any of the misrepresentations therein stated for any particular purpose. A general charge of making them fraudulently was inserted in the complaint on the trial before the referee, where no opportunity was offered of compelling the plaintiff to make his complaint more definite and certain and point out the particular purpose intended to be answered by such deceit. In this case, the only deceit which could be inferred to have been intended to be practiced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defendant, in making any of the representations proved, if made by him fraudulently, must have been to induce the plaintiff to engage to prosecute the claim on shares. But if he afterwards made a new agreement with the plaintiff knowing that the latter was still laboring under the deception practiced, the fraud would have consisted principally in not undeceiving him. And it may be well doubted whether the effect of such representations, even if false and fraudulent, made Without reference to any purchase, could render the latter void.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The case, however, was-relieved from any embarrassment arising from the findings of the referee by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the course of argument adopted by him. He claimed the responsibility of the defendant as resting upon his false representation of a fact which he professed to know; and his obtaining value on the faith of its being true. There is, however, not a particle of evidence in the case, that the defendant <em>professed that he knew, </em>what he asserted to be a fact, to be so, unless its mere assertion is equivalent thereto. There is a vast difference, however, between the two. If a man asserts a fact not necessarily within his own knowledge, he simply avers that he knows facts sufficient to induce any one of ordinary understanding to believe that it is so. When he asserts that he knows it, he means to say that the occurrence or existence of that fact has been made known to his senses, and it excludes all inferences from mere hearsay or circumstantial evidence of it. When any one dealing in an article undertakes to say what he knows respecting it, he is bound to disclose exactly what he knows, or becomes responsible, if what he states is not true. But that is upon the ground of presumed fraud. The defendant is, however, hot liable, upon any such ground.'</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The present action is for damages for a fraudulent representation, to which the plaintiff changed it, by his amendment before the referee; he cannot, therefore, recover for the mere falsity of the statement alone. The motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>dismiss the complaint on the trial was based upon the want of proof of any fraud. Mere falsity without fraud, forms no ground of recovery. <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>31 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>518, 530. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Covell, </em>8 <em>John. </em>24. <em>Wakeman </em>v. <em>Dalley, </em>44 <em>Barb. </em>498. <em>Binnard </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>42 <em>id. </em>470. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Clark\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>69. <em>Tryon </em>v. <em>Whitmarsh, </em>1 <em>Metc. </em>1. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>4 <em>id. </em>151.) The language used in some cases, such as <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Bunn, </em>(32 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>Rep. </em>275;) <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>(21 <em>id. </em>238;) <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mayor of New York, &amp;c. </em>(40 <em>Barb. </em>256;) C<em>raig </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>(36 <em>id. 377;) Yates </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>(41 <em>id. </em>172,) and <em>Galoupeau </em>v. <em>Ketchum, </em>(3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>175,) where all allusion to fraud is omitted, must be understood as being merely directed against other objections, because fraud was established in all such cases, and its absence was not made an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The representations too, on whose falsity the plaintiff relies, were evidently of that general kind, which consists of extolling the character of articles a vendor has to sell, as in this case, that the person against whom the claim existed, that was sold, \u201c was wealthy, was rich, had a great deal of property,\u201d was \u201cabundantly able to pay all claims\u201d and \u201c could pay the claim if recovered.\u201d It is what every buyer must expect, and if he desire any more special information he should catechise the seller as to the grounds of his belief, or insist on a guaranty. It is in form an expression of mere opinion, and not a representation for which the vendor should be held responsible. The plaintiff perhaps incautiously relied on the defendant\u2019s means of information as more extensive than it was, or his conclusions being sounder than they were; but there is no evidence to charge the plaintiff' with fraud. The claim was not utterly-worthless; there was a <em>spes recuperandi, </em>however small.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">I think the judgment should be reversed, and anew trial had, without costs to either party,- the order of reference to be vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
