In January, 1865, one Zingsen consigned certain goods to the defendant. The terms upon which the goods were consigned were, according to Zingsen, that if the defendant sold the goods at as great a profit as he represented that he had sold one case, he (Zingsen) would give him $500; but according to the defendant they were that he, the defendant, was to have a commission of five per \"cent on the sales, and Zingsen guarantied that the commission would amount to at least $500 in the first year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">Between January, 1865, and April 21, 1865, the defendant sold, at auction, a small bill of the goods, amounting to $300, and made advances to Zingsen, upon the goods, as follows: February 6, $500; March 30, $500; April 5, $700; April 21, $400. On the 21st April, Zingsen and the defendant having each become dissatisfied, they, stated the account between them, and the defendant agreed to take $250 for his commissions, disbursements and interest on his advances. The account thus stated showed a balance of $2050 in favor of the defendant, due May 21, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-9\">The defendant swears that he agreed to take the $250 only on condition that it was paid that'day, and stated that if he waited until the next day he should charge $500. The plaintiff, who negotiated the settlement between Zing-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sen and the defendant, swears that the defendant, in order to settle the matter, agreed to make up his account due on the 21st of May at so much, and put it down in pencil. The stated account was put in evidence, and omitting the heading, except the date, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">1865. \u201cApril 21st, 1865.

No express agreement was made between the plaintiff and defendant as to commissions, compensation or interest on advances. Under this consignment the defendant proceeded until the 12th of August to make sales at private sale and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>also at auction, under the plaintiff\u2019s directions, and received the proceeds of the sales, and made an advance of $230 to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-4\">On the 12th of August the defendant made out the following account:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">1865.

The defendant refused to deliver them unless he was paid $380. Thereupon the plaintiff brought this action of claim and delivery. The defendant, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>several denials of the allegations in the complaint, sets up a lien on the goods, to the amount of $380 and interest from August 12, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">The judge charged the jury, among other things, \u201cIf you find that $250 (referring to that sum in the stated account) was full compensation, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d To which the defendant excepted. He also charged: \u201c If you find the agreement was that $250 should be received as full compensation, and also find that the' plaintiff demanded an account of the defendant, and offered to pay him all he was entitled to, that is sufficient.\u201d To which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed the value of the property at $3500. A motion for a new trial was made, and denied, and judgment was then entered, on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">The defendant appealed from the order denying his motion for a new trial, and also from the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-8\"><em>John J. Townsend, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-9\">I. The verdict is wrong, because the defendant was entitled to more than $130, which was tendered after August 12, 1865.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-10\">II. Upon the evidence, a verdict for the defendant was possible. Under the charge, a verdict for the defendant was impossible. At folio 78 it was charged,' \u201c if the agreement was to take $250 as compensation, you will say so.\u201d At folio 82, \u201c if you find the agreement was that $250 should be received as full compensation, that is sufficient.\u201d At folio 84, \u201c if you find there was an agreement to receive $250 as full compensation, that ends it.\u201d As the agreement to accept $250, 21st May, 1865, is an undisputed fact, and consistent with the defendant\u2019s claim for compensation afterwards earned, and to interest afterwards accruing, the charge in the particulars here excepted to is equivalent to a direction to the jury to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-11\">IH. The statement of facts presents the evidence in regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>to the original agreement between Peine and\" Zingsen. Peine claimed that he was to have at the least $500 per annum, Zingsen claiming that he said, \u201c I could give you that if you go on in that way.\u201d Neither claims that the right to receive $500 depends on a sale of all the goods. It was so charged. The defendant was entitled to have the original agreement properly submitted to the jury, for all his rights depend upon subsequent modifications of that agreement. It could aid the jury in estimating the value of his subsequent services.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-4\">IV. The defendant was entitled to have the value of his services, and of the use of his money after 21st April, 1865,</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-5\">. estimated. He made that request. The charge refused this and fixed a limit not to be passed, to wit, 21st April, 1865. This was in effect directing a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-6\">V. The charge from folio 79-to 81, it is claimed, was even more injurious to the defendant. At folio 79, the court stated, \u201cthere is no evidence of any services after 21st of April, 1865.\u201d A juror interposed: \u201c I understand that the $250 was for services up to that time\u2014and Mr. Heins, after he took a transfer, &amp;e., left the goods in possession of Mr. Peine.\u201d The court: \u201cNot at all,\u201d &amp;c., and proceeded to state, in effect, that in April the defendant agreed to retain the goods until August, to send them to auction from time to time,' (without compensation,) pay himself and hand over the balance to the plaintiff; at all events, that he did nothing for which he would be entitled to charge. It will be vain to look for any evidence of such an agreement. It was to accept a certain sum on 21st May, 1865. An indefinite future was not then provided for. The juror was right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">\u25a0 VI. To this very emphatic limitation of time, 21st April, 1865, is the submission to the jury of the value of the defendant\u2019s services to be referred. As at folio 82\u2014\u201c What is a fair compensation to the defendant,\u201d &amp;c. And at folio 84\u2014 \u201cIt is simply-a question what'his services and advances are worth.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-8\">VH. The charge at folio 83, \u201c that nothing was earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>by the defendant by way of commission, except on the $78.75,\u201d must have misled the jury, and made them believe that the defendant\u2019s claims to any important sum were without foundation. &amp;</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">Yin. The charge that, \u201c under the agreement the goods ought to have been sold without sending them to auction,\u201d must have misled the jury. \u2022 As the agreement is the entire compact, the jury must have been induced to think that the defendant violated it when he sold goods at auction. But he was directed to sell at auction, in writing, May 3, 1865, and all those sales wer'e authorized by the plaintiff.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">IX. The charge, \u201cNor is the defendant entitled to $500 by virtue of carrying out the original agreement;\u201d and at folio 77\u2014\u201cI understand the condition of that agreement to be that the goods were sold in the ordinary way by the defendent,\u201d is wrong, because it was not claimed by either party that there was any such condition, and whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to the sum specified, he is entitled to have the agreement properly presented to the jury, as a part of the history of the case\u2014as an agreement modified but not violated\u2014and useful at least to aid in forming an estimate of the value of his services.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">X. The case was presented to the jury as if the defendant had agreed on 21st April, 1865, to make no charge in any event in the future. This is very plainly a misconception of the case, and very injurious to him. There could be no motive in making such an agreement; if he were not paid on 21st May, 1865, it was uncertain when he would be, or how much the single item of interest would amount to, irrespective of commissions, labor, storage, &amp;e.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-8\"><em>0. Bairibridge Smith, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-9\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aio\">There is not the slightest evidence upon which a verdict finding either that the $250 was full compensation or was agreed to be received as such, could be based. On-the contrary it is clear that the $250 was adjusted and agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>upon as full compensation for all disbursements and commissions made and earned up to April 21, and for interest on advances up to a period not extending beyond May 21st, only. Upon this there is no conflict of testimony. Therefore the instructions excepted to were erroneous. They were instructions that the jury might find certain facts to be established, to support which there was not only no evidence, but which were controverted by all the evidence in the case, and that upon the finding and facts they should render a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">'But although these instructions are erroneous, still they \u2022 would not call for a new trial if the court clearly saw that they could not by any possibility have prejudiced.the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">If the evidence fails to show that the defendant has a lien for disbursements made, or commissions earned, since the 21st of April, or for interest on advances, accruing since May 21st, for an amount exceeding the sum tendered, he is not prejudiced. The evidence shows that since the 21st of April some sales were made upon which a commission would be chargeable. True there is no proof either of what the customary rate of commission is, or of any express agreement as to commissions or compensation, or of the value of the service. I do not, however, consider it necessary that such proof should have been given, since any commission on these sales, no matter how small, would increase the amount for which the defendant had a lien, beyond the sum of $130 tendered. It is not, however, necessary to decide this point, for the interest accruing on the advances. subsequent to May 21st, in whatever way the same maybe calculated, with reference to the application of moneys received from sales of goods, increases the amount for which the defendant has a lien, considerably above the sum tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Robertson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au0\">The jury were permitted on the trial of this action to speculate on the value of the defendant\u2019s services in making advances upon the goods placed in his hands for sale; storing and bestowing labor upon them, without any evidence on which to act; for the defendant furnished no evidence of the value of such services rendered, either to Zingsen'or the plaintiff; preferring to rest his claim solely on the special contract made between himself and the former, when the goods were originally placed in his hands, as having been carried out by him fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">There was no conflict between Zingsen and the defendant, in their testimony, as to the terms of such original understanding between them. The latter testified that the former agreed \u201c to guaranty him $500 the first year, which\u201d \u201che was to pay if the defendant did <em>not make that amount at jive per cent commission.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The former did not deny this, but on the contrary admitted that he told the defendant that if he could sell all the goods as he had sold one case, he \u201c could afford to give him $500.\u201d This clearly did not make the defendant\u2019s compensation depend upon the amount of his actual sales, for under such an arrangement, if he sold any article, however insignificant, he was to be entitled to his $500, provided he continued his exertions to sell; nor did it restrict him as to the mode of effecting the sale, or require him personally to make the sales, provided they were effected through his instrumentality. Such an understanding amounted, therefore, to an undertaking by the defendant to use his best efforts to sell such goods as Zingsen should consign to him for sale during a year, and a promise by Zingsen, if he did so, to pay him $500, and as much more as five per cent on the amount of goods actually sold by him should exceed that sum. Five per cent on the value of the goods first delivered to him would only have been $325. Such an agreement did not deprive the defendant of the lien to which he was entitled upon the goods in his hands, for the amount of such compensation, the moment he entered upon his duties as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Zingsen\u2019s factor. . It is true such an agreement made with a clerk or salesman in the employ of Zingsen, while he retained possession of the goods, would create no lien; but he parted with the possession to.the defendant, as <em>his factor, </em>to employ all the facilities he possessed for making a sale, and subsequently procured advances from him thereon. There was no pretext on the trial that the defendant did not perform his part of the contract, nor was his testimony contradicted in regard to the unsaleability of the goods being the cause \u00f3f his inability to perform it. No reason, therefore, is presented why he should not, and did not, retain such lien for his $500 until the 21st of April, 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">On the last mentioned day, the defendant gave Zingsen a statement of the amount due him, in which was included an item of $500 for \u201crent and salary.\u201d Zingsen did not object to this upon the ground that no goods had been sold, but immediately went to the plaintiff, who told the defendant they would give one-half of such sum if the defendant would give them \u201c the goods and a specified account of what he had done.\u201d \u201e The defendant replied (as he testified without contradiction) that he would do so <em>provided the amount due him was paid that day. </em>It was not so paid, and the goods remained in his hands, to be sold under special instructions from' the plaintiff instead of Zingsen. Many were sold before the 12th of August, when, after many requests, the defendant sent the plaintiff an account of the amount due; in which an item of $500 was again charged for \u201c rent, salary and <em>interest.\u201d </em>Up to that time the defendant had received no interest on any of his advances, amounting to $2200, beginning in February previous, although it continued to run on after, the 12th of April. From the testimony of the plaintiff it would seem, that the. defendant\u2019s claim for one-half of the $500 had not been adjusted but was still in dispute, and the plaintiff repudiated all connection with it. He acknowledged the justice of the defendant\u2019s claim for the other $250, by admitting that he owed a balance on the account, of $130. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>must have so acknowledged it, as being the sum agreed to be allowed on the 12th of April previous for <em>\u201c rent and salary\u201d </em>alone, and, at most, for <em>interest </em>to that date, and not as including subsequent interest, of which nothing was said. The defendant was entitled to that interest, which was considerable, and the plaintiff did not tender the amount, or offer to pay it. The defendant\u2019s lien for that, at all events, therefore, still remained unimpaired. There is no evidence before us to show any modification of the original contract, or any agreement by the defendant to accept $250 in full satisfaction of his claim <em>unconditionally. </em>The mere memorandum in pencil on the defendant\u2019s statement of the 12th April of <em>\u201c </em>due 12th May,\u201d which he testified was not in his handwriting, but which the plaintiff' and Zingsen testified they saw him write, amounts to nothing, without some evidence that it was the understanding of the parties; at all events, if it even established that the condition was that the amount should be paid at that date, neither of the other parties then paid it, and the defendant went on endeavor-? ing to. make sales, as he was bound to do, under his original agreement, in order to earn the stipulated compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">I do not see from the evidence, therefore, how the defendant lost his lien for his compensation of $500, or how his claim could only be a <em>quantum meruit, </em>without any evidence of what his services were worth, except the original agreement between the defendant and Zingsen. Nor do the sales at auction appear to have been a breach by the defendant of his agreement; he rendered his account to both Zingsen and the plaintiff of such sales, without objection, and the latter, by letter, on the 3d of May, 1868, even requested him to send some of the goods to the same auctioneer to sell, which he did, and their proceeds were included in his statement to the plaintiff in August.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The learned justice, however, before whom such action was tried, charged the jury, among other things, that the defendant \u201c was to receive $500 on a sale of <em>all the goods, </em>as \u25a0\u25a0a consideration for their sale and his services in the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>also \u2018that after the transfer of the goods to the plaintiff there was \u201c no evidence that there was any thing further done\u201d by the defendant to the goods \u201cf\u00f3r which he would be entitled to charge;\u201d also that \u201cnothing was earned by\u201d the defendant \u201cby way of commissions, except on\u201d a small amount of goods ($78.75) sold before such transfer; also that it was \u201csimply a question of what\u201d the defendant\u2019s \u201cservices and advances were worth, unless they found there was an agreement that he should receive $250 as full compensation,\u201d which, if they did, \u201cthat ended it;\u201d also that \u201c if they found $250 was full compensation, the plaintiff was entitled to recover;\u201d that the defendant was \u201c not entitled to $500 by virtue of carrying out of the original agreement. He was entitled * * to what his services were worth;\u201d also that he understood that the <em>condition </em>of the first agreement between Zingsen and the defendant was \u201c that the goods were <em>to be sold </em>in the ordinary way <em>by the defendant,\u201d </em>and that \u201c under the original agreement the goods ought to have been sold without sending them to auction.\u201d To each of which instructions separate exceptions were taken by the counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">These views of my learned associate are so diametrically opposite to those which I have before expressed that I am compelled, reluctantly, to differ from him. I cannot consider that an actual sale of all the goods was necessary to entitle the defendant to his compensation; or that under the \"original agreement he was bound to sell the goods himself; or that it was a mere question of what the defendant\u2019s services and advances were worth; or that an agreement to receive $250 as full compensation, ended the controversy; or that the plaintiff, without a tender of the interest due, was entitled to recover, if $250 was a full compensation. On the other hand, I cannot hut think that there was evidence in the case that something was done by the defendant after the transfer to the plaintiff, for which the former was entitled to charge; that something was earned by him besides five per cent on $78.75, and that he was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>$500 if he carried out the original agreement and did not agree to accept a less sum. I cannot, therefore, help coming to the conclusion that such instructions were erroneous, and that a new trial should therefore be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I therefore concur with my associate in thinking that the judgment should be reversed and a new trial had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
