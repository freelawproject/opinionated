An agreement or license, by tbe proprietor of a hotel, giving permission to another to occupy any portion of the public streets, as a stand for his coaches, is a nullity. Hotel proprietors have no right to the exclusive use of the streets in front of their premises; and any obstruction of them, in their free use, would be a public nuisance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-10\">2. The streets belong to the public at large,' for passage over them; no person has the right to obstruct such passage, by leaving coaches or other vehicles standing upon the highway. Hotel proprietors, having themselves no such right, can confer none upon others.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-11\">3. But up agreement by the proprietor of a hotel, with, and license to, another, allowing the latter to place the name of the hotel upon his coaches\u2014such arrangement to continue so long, only, as the parties are mutually \u201csatisfied\u201d\u2014 is a valid contract, which will subsist until terminated by a notice from either party. Continuing the use of such name, by the licensee, after the license has ceased, or is terminated, may be restrained by injunction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-12\">4. The proprietor of a hotel, and his licensee, may each claim the protection of the court for any violation of his individual rights by a third person; the pen- \u25a0 dency of a suit by such licensee, for the injury he has sustained, is no bar to an action by the hotel proprietor.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-14\">(Before Monell, J,, at Special Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdB\">November, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Motion for an injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-4\"><em>Edwin James </em>and <em>Thomas Dunphy, </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-5\"><em>A.

The defendant admits s.uch a notice was given before the commencement of this action. .</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">So far as the agreement or license gave permission to the defendant to occupy any portion of the public streets, as a stand for his coaches, it was a nullity. Hotel proprietors \u2022 have no exclusive right to the use of the streets ,in front of their premises; and any obstruction by them, in their free use, would be a public nuisance. The streets belong to the public at large for passage over them, and no person has the right to obstruct such passage, by leaving coaches or other vehicles standing upon the highway. And hotel proprietors having themselves no such right, of course can confer none upon others. '</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The agreement, however, and license to the defendant to place the words \u201c Prescott House \u201d upon his coaches, was a valid contract, which subsisted until it was terminated by notice. And the question is, whether continuing the use of such words, after the license had ceased, can be restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">I regard the question as settled by three cases, one of them in this court. <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Carlin, </em>3 <em>Mo. Law Rep. </em>360. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Henriques, </em>3 <em>Sandf. </em>725. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>7 <em>Cush. Mass. Rep. </em>322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">In the last case the proprietors of the Revere House authorized the plaintiff to keep coaches at certain railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>depots, to convey passengers to. such house, and to put on his coaches, and on the caps of his drivers, the words \u201c Revere House.\u201d A similar authority had been given to the defendant, but which had expired. It was held, that the plaintiff had the exclusive right to use the words \u201cRevere House,\u201d as indicating and holding himself out as having the patronage of that establishment for the conveyance of passengers, and that the use by the defendants of the same words for the purpose of falsely holding themselves out as having such patronage, was a. fraud upon the plaintiff, and a violation of his rights, for which he could maintain an action. And in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Henriques, (supra,) </em>under an analogous state of facts, this court restrained, by injunction, the defendant from using the words \u201cIrving House\u201d upon his coaches and the badges of his servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">These actions, it is true, were brought by persons holding contracts with the hotel proprietors. But Campbell, J., says, in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Henriques, </em>that the hotel proprietor might also have an injunction. The rights,of the proprietor and of his licensee are similar, though the injury is different, being confined to the loss of patronage to his coaches in the one case, and to the loss of patronage to his hotel in the other. Each, therefore, may claim the protection of the court for any violation of his individual rights. The pendency of the suit of Peppard &amp; Co. against this defendant is, therefore, no bar to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The cases to which I have referred, as well as <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>(12 <em>How. Pr. </em>77,) are an answer to the proposition of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the plaintiff must establish in a court of law that he has sustained injury, before he can invoke the aid or protection of a court of equity. \u2018 Indeed, courts of equity will always interfere to <em>prevent </em>wrongs; while courts of law can only give <em>redress after </em>the wrongs have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Upon an examination of the facts of this case as proven or admitted, and of the law applicable to such facts, my conclusion is that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>demanded in Ms complaint, and should have judgment accordingly, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The findings to be prepared by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and served on the defendant\u2019s attorney, with five days notice of settlement, before me.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
