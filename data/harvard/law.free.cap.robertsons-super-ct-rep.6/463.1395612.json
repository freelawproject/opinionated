The complaint was in the usual form for services rendered. The answer admits that there was justly due and \"owing the plaintiff the sum of $23,819.25, being a part of the plaintiff\u2019s account, and. sets up a general denial to the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-4\">The application was under section 244 of the Code, for an order directing the comptroller to pay over the amount admitted to be due by the answer. The defendants, notwithstanding the admission contained in their answer, claimed the benefit of section 10 of the city tax law, or tax levy, passed May 4, 1866, whereby it was enacted that \u201c no judgments in actions upon contract shall be entered, by default or otherwise, against the corporation, except upon proofs in open court that the amount sought to be recovered still remains unexpended in the treasury to the credit of the appropriation, to the specific object or purpose under the claim sued for as aforesaid,\u201d by any court, against the corporation ; also of section 28 of the charter of 1857, forbidding the common council incurring expenditures unless for previous appropriations. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied that his client\u2019s engagement with the corporation for such advertising was made, and the work performed, in the years 1864, 1865 and 1866, and before the tax levy was passed or became a law; therefore it (the law of May, 1866) could not act retrospectively as to contracts existing before the law was passed, it being repugnant to section 10, article 1, of the constitution of the United States. And that section 28 of the charter does not, and was not intended to apply to such cases as the plaintiff\u2019s,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-5\"><em>jRoger A.

Previous notice of all sales referred to in this section \u2022 shall be given under the direction of the comptroller in the newspapers employed by the corporation, and for thirty days in each of the daily newspapers so employed.\u201d So that it will be seen at once, that the charter makes such publication a part of the proceedings of the different boards. It will not be contended that because a clause in section 28 declares \u201c that no expense shall be incurred by any of the departments or officers thereof, whether the object of expenditure shall have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ordered by the common council or not, unless an appropriation shall .have been made covering such expense,\u201d the owners of the corporation newspapers who publish these proceedings, thereby making them valid, cannot obtain a reasonable compensation for their services. For the common council does not direct the proceedings to be published; the four sections of the charter I have just cited, absolutely order them to be published in the \u201c corporation newspapers,\u201d and therefore the charter incurs the expense, and not the boards of common council. Moreover, it declares that if the proceedings are not published, the whole shall be void. Indeed, if the construction claimed by the defense for section 28 be the correct one, the whole proceedings of our city government would come to a stand still; and all the sales for taxes and assessments that have taken place in this city for years past would be void. It is clear, therefore, that section 28 was intended by the legislature to prevent extravagant and useless expenditures by the boards, and was not intended to apply to matters of -this kind; and as an evidence of the fact that it was not so intended, the learned corporation counsel has cited no authorities showing that my views of the construction of this section are incorrect. On the contrary, I find him consenting to, or offering judgment against the corporation for certain amounts incurred for advertising, and the courts uniformly enter up judgments on such consents. On this question I, therefore, hold that, as the charter declares the corporation shall designate newspapers to publish their proceedings, and as said charter also provides that such proceedings, to make them legal and valid, must be published in such newspapers; and it being admitted that the <em>Daily News </em>was a corporation paper, it follows, as a matter of law, that Mr. Wood is entitled to recover a reasonable compensation for such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Sections 7, 37, 38 and 41, declare that such proceedings, to make them valid, must be published for a certain length of time. Now, the common council does not make the expenditure, but the charter directs it to be made. I think, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>therefore, on the first point there is hardly a reasonable doubt left against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In regard to the second point, I fully agree with the views entertained by the learned gentleman who represents the plaintiff in the action, in saying that the relief claimed should be granted. Section 10 of said tax law cannot affect the merits of this case, because the engagement was made and the work done before the law of 1866 took effect. The instant the contract with the plaintiff was completed and the work performed, the constitution of the land placed the rights under that contract forever beyond legislative control, and it was for that very purpose that the sagacious .men who framed the federal constitution introduced the 10th section of article one in that instrument. To say that Mr. Wood has performed his work, has fulfilled his obligations in all respects, and is entitled in all justice and in:. equity to his payment, yet that the law of the 4th May, 1866, has taken away his remedy by judgment, would be most preposterous. Any statute that takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing law, or creates a new obligation, or imposes new restrictions in respect to past transactions, must be deemed retrospective. Such was the rule laid down by Mr. Justice Story in <em>Society </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>(2 <em>Gal. </em>104.) In the case cited, that eminent jurist says: \u201c It is very obvious that the rights of a party under a contract may be destroyed by denying.a remedy, or may be seriously impaired by burdening the proceedings with new conditions so as to make the remedy worthless, and I am quite sure no one will insist for a moment that there is any material difference between a retrospective law declaring a particular obligation void, and one that takes away the remedy to enforce it. Indeed, it is the remedy that protectsx the rights and enforces the obligations \u00f3f all contracts, and it was for the protection of that remedy that the clause in the constitution, now under consideration, was mainly intended.\u201d In the case of <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>(1 <em>How. U. S. Rep. </em>608,) Mr. Justice Baldwin, in delivering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>unanimous opinion of the court, said: <em>\u201c </em>The obligations of a contract consist in its binding force on the party who makes it, and this depends on the laws in existence when it is made; they are necessarily referred to in all contracts, and forming a part of them as a measure of the obligation to perform them by the one party, and the right acquired by the other. There can be no other standard by which to ascertain the extent of either, than that which the terms of the contract indicate, according to their settled legal meaning when it became consummated; the law defines the duty and the right, and compels the one party to perform the thing contracted for, and gives the other the right to enforce the performance by the remedies in existence. If any subsequent law affects to diminish the duty, to impair the right, it necessarily bears on the obligation of the contract in favor of one party to the injury of the other; hence, any law which in its operation amounts to a denial or obstruction of the rights accruing by a contract, though professing to act only on the remedy, is directly obnoxious to the provision of the constitution.\u201d Now this very doctrine completely covers' the case at bar. Again, Chancellor Kent, (1 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>467, <em>n.,) </em>in discussing this question, lays down as a rule, that <em>\u201c </em>to take away by legislative acts the existing remedies for enforcing obligations of the contract so as to leave the creditor without redress, would be a mockery of justice, and repugnant to the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">It is, therefore, clear that all suspension by statute of remedies, or any part thereof, existing when the contract was made, is more or less impairing its obligation; and this clear rule of law was held in the case of <em>Green </em>v. Biddle, (8 <em>Wheat. </em>1.) In that case, Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the court, says that to deny any remedy under a contract, or by burdening the remedy with new conditions and restrictions, and so make it useless or hardly worth pursuing, is equally a violation of the 10th section of article one of the constitution. And Blackstone in his Commentaries, <em>(yol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>52,) says that the rem\u00e9dial part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>law is a necessary consequence of the declaratory; \u201c for,\u201d says the' learned commentator, \u201claws must be very vague and imperfect without a remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">But, apart from all other considerations, and looking at the language of the act, there is nothing therein that makes it applicable to. the case under consideration, and we ought, with the highest respect, to conclude that our lawmakers did not intend it should have a retrospective or injurious effect; because if the construction contended for be correct, then the legislature might just as well have said that claims similar to the plaintiff\u2019s might all be blotted out. This was held to be the true doctrine, in the case of <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Quackenboss, </em>(1 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>130;) also 1 Denio, 127, and in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>The Supervisors of Westchester County, </em>(4 <em>Barb. 70.) </em>In the last case Mr. Justice Barculo, in one of the ablest opinions in the books, makes this doctrine clear as day. Indeed, authorities sustaining my views are very numerous. I have simply cited a few of the leading cases. Moreover, if the principle contended for by the defendants\u2019 counsel in this respect has a single precedent to warrant it, I must say I have not been able to find it. It is quite true that Mr. Justice Gardiner, an able and a very learned man, in the case of <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Quaekenboss, </em>in a long dissenting opinion, endeavors to show that the current of authorities in our books is wrong on this subject; but it is quite clear to the mind of the common reader that in his efforts to do so he labors hard, and to very little effect. Moreover, the cases cited in his opinion do not touch the question under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">How stands the present case? 1. We have the amended charter of 1857, declaring that to make the proceedings of the common council legal and binding, they must be advertised for a certain specified time in the corporation newspapers. 2. We have the <em>Baily News </em>designated as one of such papers, with instructions that it should publish the proceedings of the different boards. Then we have the services performed in 1865 and 1866, and this action brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>for the recovery of such services before the law of May 4, 1866, was passed. Now, all this is admitted in the answer of the1 2345defendants; therefore it is clear, from my reasoning, that section 10 of the tax law, passed May 4, 1866, and passed after the plaintiff\u2019s rights had accrued and were vested, cahnot act retrospectively so as to affect the plaintiff\u2019s rights to recover in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Let an order be entered compelling the comptroller to pay the amount admitted to be due, and a reference be ordered to Enoch L. Lowe, Esq., to ascertain the justice of the balance of the claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
