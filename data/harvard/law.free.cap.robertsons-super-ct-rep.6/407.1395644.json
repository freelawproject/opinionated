The president of a railroad <em>corporation </em>being authorized to receive payment of stock subscriptions, received stock in a coal company, in payment of a subscription ; <em>Held </em>that his act was binding on the corporation, unless the corporation itself was incapable of receiving any thing but money; and this, notwithstanding the authority given to him may have been limited, in terms, to collections in money only.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b415-10\">4. Every corporation has, besides the powers expressly conferred by its charter, certain common law powers, which may be exercised in furtherance of the purposes of the corporation.

The defense was payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>It was proved that the subscription was made in July, 1866. The defendant testified that, about the 1st of November, one Degrauw, the president of the plaintiff\u2019s company, came on board the cars at Jamaica and asked the defendant if he would sell him coal stock. The defendant replied he would, upon one condition. That he owed the plaintiff $1000, and wanted to pay it for some time, and would sell the coal stock on that condition at the same price he paid for it\u2014$30 a share. Degrauw told the defendant to come to his office. The next day the defendant called at Degrauw\u2019s office, and transferred to Degrauw one hundred shares of the stock of the Mahony Coal Company, and received two acceptances of Degrauw of $1000 each, and the following written agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\">\u201cNew York, November 1, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">I hereby agree to deliver to William <em>A: </em>Lighthall, on the completion of the extension to Jamaica of the East New York and Jamaica Railroad Company, a certificate of stock of (20) twenty shares of the capital stock of said company. ' Aaron A. Degrauw.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">A witness for the defendant testified that at the time the coal stock was transferred, the defendant said to Degrauw, \u201cThis pays my subscription for one thousand dollarsand Degrauw said, \u201cYes, that is all right; when the stock is issued, I will give it to you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">Degrauw contradicted all this evidence; and there was much other conflicting evidence, as to whether Degrauw agreed to take the coal stock as payment for the subscription. Degrauw also testified that he, Mr. Black, and the secretary, were authorized by the plaintiff' to collect the stock subscriptions, but were never authorized to accept, in payment of the defendant\u2019s subscriptions, Mahony Coal Company stock; and the plaintiff\u2019s secretary and treasurer testified that the plaintiff never authorized any thing but cash to be taken for subscriptions to their capital stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to direct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>to find a verdict in its favor, on tfie grounds, among others, that the written agreement\" did not show any permission to accept the coal stock for the subscriptions; and that Degrauw had no power to accept the coal stock in payment of the subscriptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">The court refused the request, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">The court submitted the case to the jury, under instructions that if it was an agreement of Degrauw\u2019s to receive the coal stock as payment of the defendant\u2019s subscription to the capital stock of the plaintiff\u2019s company, he had a right, as president of such company, to accept other things besides money in payment of the subscriptions to their stock. That if the jury found that Degrauw agreed to receive the coal stock as payment of the defendant\u2019s subscription, they must discharge the defendant. To these instructions the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">The jury found for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">A motion for a new trial was .made upon the judge\u2019s minutes, and denied. Judgment upon the verdict was thereupon entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\">The plaintiff appealed from both judgment and order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-10\"><em>J.

Goodrich, </em>for the defendant, respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-12\">By the Court, Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGt\">The question which was submitted to the jury in this case was, whether Degrauw agreed with the defendant to receive the coal stock in payment for his subscription; and they were instructed that .if they so found, the agreement was binding upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">If it was proper to submit such question to the jury, their verdict cannot be disturbed. The evidence was conflicting, and therefore not open for review upon these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">But it is claimed that, notwithstanding Degrauw\u2019s agreement, the receipt of the coal stock by him was not payment to the plaintiff, for two reasons; first, because the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>had no power to receive any thing other than money in payment of subscriptions to its capital stock ; and, second, because Degrauw had no authority to receive it, or to bind the plaintiff by any agreement that it should be received in payment of the defendant\u2019s subscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Independently of the evidence furnished by 'the plaintiff, that Mr. Degrauw was expressly authorized by them to collect stock subscriptions, I think he had power to do so, by virtue of his office, as president of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Corporations cap act only by and through their agents; for, although in' law a person, and capable of exercising all the functions conferred upon it by law, a corporation is yet, as a corporate aggregation, incapable of exercising such functions otherwise than through its officers and agents. Hence the acts of such officers and agents, performed within the scope of their general official duties, are binding upon the corporation. Ordinarily, corporations do not differ from persons in the effect which is to be given to the acts of their agents. If the corporation has power, it may delegate such power; and it is only when prohibited by law, or the act is not incidental to the purposes of its incorporation, that it is <em>ultra vires, </em>and void. <em>(Sharp </em>v. <em>Mayor of New York, </em>40 <em>Barb. </em>256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Receiving payment of subscriptions to its capital stock was no more out of the line of the president\u2019s duty, than receiving payment of any other debt, and it cannot be pretended that such receipt, had it been in money, would not have bound the plaintiff, even although it never came to its possession. And the fact testified to by the secretary, that no one was authorized to receive any thing other than money, cannot impair the effect which must be*given to the payment made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In this case, however,- there was express authority given to the president of the company, and it therefore follows that his act is binding on the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff itself was incapable of receiving any thing but money; and that is so, notwithstanding the authority given to the presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>dent may have been limited, in terms, to collections in. money only. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Bank, </em>3 <em>Duer, </em>241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">It is a familiar principle, that the act of the agent, although in abuse or excess of authority, if within the general scope of the business he was employed to transact,' is binding upon his principal, as respects third persons, who, believing in the power of the agent, would sustain a loss if the act was not considered that of the principal. <em>Hope Mutual Life Insurance Company </em>v. Taylor, <em>2 Rob. </em>278.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">It remains then to be seen, whether the plaintiff had power to receive payment otherwise than in money, for subscriptions to its capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Every corporation has, besides the powers expressly conferred by its charter, certain common law powers, which may be exercised in furtherance of the purposes of the corporation. Such common law powers are the same as those possessed by individuals, and may be employed in the same manner, unless restricted by some positive or clearly implied prohibition of law. <em>(Barry </em>v. <em>Merch. Exch. Co., </em>1 <em>Sandf. Ch. </em>280. <em>DeGroff </em>v. <em>Am. Linen Thread Co., </em>21 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>124.) And the objection that an act of a corporation is <em>ultra vires </em>\u2018rests upon the absence of either express or implied power, and not upon the wrong use of it, especially where such wrong use may work injury to innocent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">These common law or implied powers in a corporation were fully recognized in <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>(15 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>9,) where it was held that a corporation had power to contract a debt, and give its time obligation for its payment. And in a later case, <em>(City Bank of Columbus </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>507,) the receipt by a corporation of its own stock in payment of a debt due to it was sustained, as being within the incidental powers of the corporation. The court there say, (Selden, J.,) \u201cI am not aware of any common law principle which forbids it, nor is it known to have been in contravention of any provision of the charter of the company.\u201d And in <em>Magee </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>(30 <em>Barb. </em>246,) a railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>corporation took the promissory notes of a subscriber in payment of his subscription for stock, and it was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">I have looked into the charter of the plaintiff\u2019s company, and also at the provisions of the Revised Statutes to which the charter is subject, and do not find any limitation to the ordinary implied powers of all corporations,.'nor any provision which, either in express terms or by necessary implication, defines the thing which the plaintiff shall receive in payment for debts due to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I do not think any question, whether receiving coal stock of another company was within the purposes of the plain- \u2022 tiff\u2019s corporation, is involved in the present case. If this was an action upon an executory contract, to compel the plaintiff to receive the stock in payment for the defendant\u2019s subscription, it might be said that dealing in such stock was foreign to the purposes of the company, and the contract therefore not within its implied p'owers. But in this case the contract was executed. The stock had been received by Degrauw in payment of the defendant\u2019s subscription, and, as has been seen, such receipt was the receipt of the plaintiff, and cannot now be rejected upon any plea of want of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">And although the plaintiff has not reaped the fruits of the transaction, it must, nevertheless, be concluded by the act of its agent, and not seek to inflict a wrong upon an innocent person who, believing in the competency of the agent to act on behalf of his principal, had dealt with him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">I am of opinion that the judgment and order appealed \u2022 from should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b420-8\">Garvin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
