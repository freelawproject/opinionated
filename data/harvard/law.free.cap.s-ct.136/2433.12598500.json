See \u00a7\u00a7 246-869-010(1)(a)-(e), (2). Four of these are narrow. See \u00a7 246-869-010(1)(a) (prescription is erroneous or has a known contraindication); \u00a7 246-869-010(1)(b) (national and state emergencies); \u00a7 246-869-010(1)(d) (potentially fraudulent prescriptions); \u00a7 246-869-010(1)(e) (drug is temporarily out of stock). A fifth exception is broader: Under subsection (c), pharmacies need not stock prescription medications that require specialized equipment or expertise, including the equipment or expertise needed to compound drugs. \u00a7 246-869-010(1)(c). And a sixth exception is very broad indeed: A pharmacy is not required to deliver a drug \"without payment of [its] usual and customary or contracted charge.\" \u00a7 246-869-010(2). This means, among other things, that a pharmacy need not fill a prescription for a Medicaid patient. In addition, as discussed below, the District Court found that there are many unwritten exceptions to the Delivery and Stocking Rules. See <em>infra,</em> at 2437 - 2438.</history>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-39\">* * *</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<opinion type=\"majority\"><p id=\"p-5\">The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.</p><p id=\"p-6\">Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.</p><p id=\"p-7\">This case is an ominous sign.</p><p id=\"p-8\">At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. There are strong reasons to doubt whether the regulations were adopted for-or that they actually serve-any legitimate purpose. And there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State. Yet the Ninth Circuit held that the regulations do not violate the First Amendment, and this Court does not deem the case worthy of our time. If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.</p><p id=\"p-9\">I</p><p id=\"p-10\">The Stormans family owns Ralph's Thriftway, a local grocery store and pharmacy in Olympia, Washington. Devout Christians, the Stormans seek to run their business in accordance with their religious beliefs. Among those beliefs is a conviction that life begins at conception and that preventing the uterine implantation of a fertilized egg is tantamount to abortion. Consequently, in order to avoid complicity in what they believe to be the taking of a life, Ralph's pharmacy does not stock emergency contraceptives, such as Plan B, that can \"inhibit implantation\" of a fertilized egg, 1 Supp. Excerpts of Record in Nos. 12-35221, 12-35223 (CA9), p. 1245 (SER). When customers come into the pharmacy with prescriptions for such drugs, Ralph's employees inform them that the pharmacy does not carry those products, and they refer the customers to another nearby pharmacy that does. The drugs are stocked by <em>more than 30 other pharmacies within five miles of Ralph's</em> . <em>Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d 925</extracted-citation>, 934 (W.D.Wash.2012) ; see SER 1293. These pharmacies include an Albertson's located 1.9 miles from Ralph's and a Rite-Aid located 2.3 miles away.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-11\">As explained by the 5 national and 33 state pharmacist associations that urge us to take this case, \"facilitated referral supports pharmacists' professionally recognized right of conscience\" \"without compromising patient care.\" Brief for National and State Pharmacists' Associations as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17. In addition to protecting rights of conscience, facilitated referral also serves more practical ends. Pharmacies can stock only a small fraction of the more than 6,000 FDA-approved drugs now available. Pharmacies of all stripes therefore \"refer patients to other pharmacies at least several times a day because a drug is not in stock.\"</p><p id=\"p-12\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2434\" href=\"#p2434\" id=\"p2434\">*2434</a><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d, at 934</extracted-citation>. Because of the practice of facilitated referrals, none of Ralph's customers has ever been denied timely access to emergency contraceptives. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\"> at 933</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-13\">Nevertheless, in 2007 the Washington State Board of Pharmacy (Board) issued rules mandating that pharmacies like Ralph's stock and sell contraceptives like Plan B. Under these regulations, a pharmacy may not \"refuse to deliver a drug or device to a patient because its owner objects to delivery on religious, moral, or other personal grounds.\" Brief in Opposition for Washington State Respondents 10. The dilemma this creates for the Stormans family and others like them is plain: Violate your sincerely held religious beliefs or get out of the pharmacy business.</p><p id=\"p-14\">Ralph's, joined by two pharmacists with similar beliefs who work at other pharmacies, contends that the regulations target religiously motivated conduct for disfavored treatment and thereby \"suppress religious belief or practice\" in violation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">508 U.S. 520</extracted-citation>, 523, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">124 L.Ed.2d 472</extracted-citation> (1993). After a 12-day trial, the District Court agreed and enjoined the regulations, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d 925</extracted-citation> (findings of fact and conclusions of law); <em>Stormans Inc. v.

Among other things, the District Court noted the following. When the Board began to consider new regulations, the Governor of the State \"sent a letter to the Board opposing referral for personal or conscientious reasons.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d, at 937</extracted-citation>. The State Human Rights Commission followed with \"a letter threatening Board members with personal liability if they passed a regulation permitting referral\" for religious or moral reasons. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em> at 938 ; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 374a-399a. And after the Board initially voted to adopt rules allowing referrals for reasons of conscience, the Governor not only sent another letter opposing the draft rules but \"publicly explained that she could remove the Board members\" if need be. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d, at 938</extracted-citation>. \"[T]his was the first instance in which a Governor had ever threatened the Board ... with removal.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\"> at 939</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-16\">The Board heeded the Governor's wishes. As Steven Saxe, the Board's executive director, explained at the time: \" '[T]he public, legislators and governor are telling us loud and clear that they expect the rule to protect the public from unwanted intervention based on the moral beliefs ... of a pharmacist.' \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> \" '[T]he moral issue IS the basis of the concern.' \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> Saxe, a primary drafter of the regulations, recognized that the task was \" 'to draft language to allow facilitating a referral for <em>only these non-moral or non-religious reasons</em> .' \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> He suggested that making an express \" 'statement that does not allow a pharmacist/pharmacy the right to refuse for moral or religious judgment' \" might be a \" 'clearer' \" way to \" 'leave intact the ability to decline to dispense ... for most <em>legitimate</em> examples raised; clinical, fraud, business, skill, etc.' \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> And in the end, that is what the Board did. While the regulations themselves do not expressly single out religiously motivated referrals, the Board's guidance accompanying the regulations does: \"The rule,\" it warns, \"does not allow a pharmacy to refer a patient to another pharmacy to avoid filling the prescription <em>due to moral or ethical</em> <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2435\" href=\"#p2435\" id=\"p2435\">*2435</a><em>objections</em> .\" SER 1248 (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-17\">Although the District Court found that the Board's intent was to target pharmacies that made referrals for religious or moral reasons, the court did not base its decision solely on that ground. Instead, the court considered the design of the regulations and concluded that they discriminated against religious objectors. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d, at 967-990</extracted-citation>. Not only do the rules expressly contain certain secular exceptions, but the court also found that in operation the Board allowed pharmacies to make referrals for many other secular reasons not set out in the rules. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\"> at 954-956, 970-971</extracted-citation>. The court concluded that \"the 'design of these [Regulations] accomplishes ... a religious gerrymander' \" capturing religiously motivated referrals and little else. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\"> at 984</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, supra,</em> at 535, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation> ; some internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p id=\"p-18\">The State appealed the District Court's decision, and the Ninth Circuit reversed. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">794 F.3d 1064</extracted-citation> (2015). Both in the Ninth Circuit and before this Court, the State defends the regulations as necessary to \"ensur[e] that its citizens have safe and timely access to their lawful and lawfully prescribed medications.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\"> at 1084</extracted-citation>. But the State has conceded that this is not really a problem. It <em>stipulated</em> that \"facilitated referrals do not pose a threat to timely access to lawfully prescribed medications,\" and indeed \"help assure timely access to lawfully prescribed medications ... includ[ing] Plan B.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 335a.</p><p id=\"p-19\">I believe that the constitutionality of what Washington has done merits further review. As I discuss below, Ralph's has made a strong case that the District Court got it right, and that the regulations here are improperly designed to stamp out religious objectors. The importance of this issue is underscored by the <em>38</em> national and state pharmacist associations that urge us to hear the case. The decision below, they tell us, \"upheld a radical departure from past regulation of the pharmacy industry\" that \"threatens to <em>reduce</em> patient access to medication by forcing some pharmacies-particularly small, independent ones that often survive by providing specialty services not provided elsewhere-to close.\" Brief for National and State Pharmacists' Associations as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4, 5. Given the important First Amendment interests at stake and the potentially sweeping ramifications of the decision below, I would grant certiorari.</p><p id=\"p-20\">II</p><p id=\"p-21\">The question presented in this case concerns the constitutionality of two rules adopted by the Washington State Pharmacy Board in 2007. The first rule, known as the Delivery Rule, requires pharmacies to \"deliver lawfully prescribed drugs or devices to patients and to distribute drugs and devices approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for restricted distribution by pharmacies.\" <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20246-869-010\">Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 246-869-010</extracted-citation>(1) (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2436\" href=\"#p2436\" id=\"p2436\">*2436</a>Delivery Rule works in tandem with a pre-existing rule, called the Stocking Rule, that requires pharmacies to stock a \"representative assortment of drugs in order to meet the pharmaceutical needs of its patients.\" \u00a7 246-869-150(1). The net result of these rules is that, so long as there is customer demand for emergency contraceptives, pharmacies like Ralph's must stock and dispense them regardless of any religious or moral objections that their owners may have.</p><p id=\"p-23\">The Board's second new rule, called the Pharmacist Responsibility Rule, governs individual pharmacists. \u00a7 246-863-095 (2010). The rule does not require any <em>individual pharmacist</em> to dispense medication in conflict with his or her beliefs. But because the Delivery Rule requires every <em>pharmacy</em> to dispense the medication, if a pharmacy wishes to employ a pharmacist who objects to dispensing a drug for religious reasons, the pharmacy must keep on duty at all times a second pharmacist who can dispense those drugs. We are told that few pharmacies are likely to be willing to bear this expense.

This case bears a distinct resemblance to <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye</em> .</p><p id=\"p-26\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2437\" href=\"#p2437\" id=\"p2437\">*2437</a>In <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,</em> there was strong evidence that the ordinances were adopted for the purpose of preventing religious services of the Santeria religion. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\"> at 534</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>. As noted, there is similar evidence of discriminatory intent here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-27\">Even if we disregard all evidence of intent and confine our consideration to the nature of the laws at issue in the two cases, the similarities are striking. In <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,</em> the challenged ordinances broadly prohibited the unnecessary or cruel killing of animals, but when all the statutory definitions and exemptions were taken into account, the laws did little more than prohibit the sacrifices carried out in Santeria services. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\"> at 535-538</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>. In addition, the ordinances restricted religious practice to a far greater extent than required to serve the municipality's asserted interests. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\"> at 538-539</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>. Here, Ralph's has made a strong showing that the challenged regulations are gerrymandered in a similar way. While requiring pharmacies to dispense all prescription medications for which there is demand, the regulations contain broad secular exceptions but none relating to religious or moral objections; the regulations are substantially underinclusive because they permit pharmacies to decline to fill prescriptions for financial reasons; and the regulations contemplate the closing of any pharmacy with religious objections to providing emergency contraceptives, regardless of the impact that will have on patients' access to medication.</p><p id=\"p-28\">A</p><p id=\"p-29\">Considering \"the effect of [the regulations] in [their] real operation,\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\"> at 535</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation> the District Court concluded that the burden they impose \"falls 'almost exclusively' on those with religious objections to dispensing Plan B,\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780146\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1172/\">844 F.Supp.2d, at 1188</extracted-citation>. The court found that \"the rules exempt pharmacies and pharmacists from stocking and delivering lawfully prescribed drugs for an almost unlimited variety of secular reasons, but fail to provide exemptions for reasons of conscience.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780146\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1172/\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> For example, the District Court found that a pharmacy may decline to stock a drug because the drug requires additional paperwork or patient monitoring, has a short shelf life, may attract <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2438\" href=\"#p2438\" id=\"p2438\">*2438</a>crime, requires simple compounding (a skill all pharmacists must learn), or falls outside the pharmacy's niche (<em>e.g.,</em> pediatrics, diabetes, or fertility). <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780146\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1172/\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780146\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1172/\"> at 1190</extracted-citation>. Additionally, the court found, a pharmacy can \"decline to accept Medicare or Medicaid or the patient's particular insurance, and on that basis, refuse to deliver a drug that is actually on the shelf.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780146\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1172/\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> As the District Court noted, such secular refusals \"inhibit patient access\" to medication no less than do religiously motivated facilitated referrals. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780146\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1172/\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> Allowing secular but not religious refusals is flatly inconsistent with <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye</em> . It \"devalues religious reasons\" for declining to dispense medications \"by judging them to be of lesser import than nonreligious reasons,\" thereby \"singl[ing] out\" religious practice \"for discriminatory treatment.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">508 U.S., at 537-538</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-30\">The Ninth Circuit did not dispute this logic. Instead, it held that the District Court committed clear error in finding that the regulations allow refusals for a host of secular reasons. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">794 F.3d, at 1080-1081</extracted-citation>. The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's finding that pharmacies <em>in fact</em> refuse to stock and deliver drugs for secular reasons, but it disputed the District Court's finding that the Board actually <em>permits</em> such refusals. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> I think it likely that the Court of Appeals failed to accord the District Court's findings appropriate deference. \"If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\" <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">470 U.S. 564</extracted-citation>, 573-574, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">105 S.Ct. 1504</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">84 L.Ed.2d 518</extracted-citation> (1985).</p><p id=\"p-31\">The District Court carefully laid out its rationale for finding that the regulations allow refusals for secular, but not religious, reasons. Secular refusals have been common, and commonly known, both before and after the regulations were issued, yet the Board has never enforced its regulations against such practices. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d, at 956, 960</extracted-citation>. Nor has the Board issued any guidance disapproving secular refusals or otherwise made an \"effort to curtail widespread referrals for business reasons.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\"> at 960</extracted-citation>. By contrast, the Board has specifically targeted religious objections. Upon issuing the regulations, the Board sent a guidance document to pharmacies warning that \"[t]he rule does not allow a pharmacy to refer a patient to another pharmacy to avoid filling the prescription <em>due to moral or ethical objections</em> .\" SER 1248 (emphasis added). The negative implication is obvious. Additionally, a Board spokesman-who was charged with answering pharmacists' inquiries about the rules' requirements-testified that, \"other than eliminating referral as an option for pharmacies which cannot stock Plan B for religious reasons, from a practical standpoint, nothing has changed after the enactment of these rules.\" <em>Id.,</em> at 356; see <em>id.,</em> at 295.</p><p id=\"p-32\">The Ninth Circuit disregarded the Board's failure to enforce its regulations against secular refusals on the ground that the Board does not pursue enforcement action unless it receives a complaint, and it has not received complaints against secular referrals. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">794 F.3d, at 1081</extracted-citation>. Putting aside the potential for abuse this system allows,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the point remains that the Board <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2439\" href=\"#p2439\" id=\"p2439\">*2439</a>tolerates widespread secular refusals while categorically declaring religious ones verboten. That supports the District Court's finding that the \"real operation\" of the regulations is to uniquely burden religiously motivated conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-33\">B</p><p id=\"p-34\">Even if the Ninth Circuit were correct to reject the District Court's finding that the Board condones many secular refusals, the Court of Appeals overlooked a basis for refusal that is written into the regulations themselves. \"Nothing in this section,\" the Delivery Rule states, \"requires pharmacies to deliver a drug or device without payment of their usual and customary or contracted charge.\" \u00a7 246-869-010(2) (2009). The Ninth Circuit thought this exception unremarkable, asserting that \" '[n]obody could seriously question a refusal to fill a prescription because the customer did not pay for it.' \" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">794 F.3d, at 1080</extracted-citation>. But as the District Court found-and the Ninth Circuit simply ignored-this exception extends well beyond denying service to customers who won't pay. It also allows a pharmacy to refuse to fill a prescription because it does not accept the patient's insurance or because it does not accept Medicaid or Medicare-regardless of the amount of payment it would receive. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">854 F.Supp.2d, at 955, 972-973</extracted-citation>. A pharmacy accordingly may deny <em>all</em> prescriptions to certain patients, many of whom (those on Medicaid) are particularly likely to lack ready means of traveling to another pharmacy. What is more, a pharmacy that refuses a patient's insurance does not even have to refer the patient to another pharmacy. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560770\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/854/925/#p934\"> at 973</extracted-citation>. This renders the regulations substantially underinclusive: They \"fail to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endangers\" the State's professed interest in ensuring timely access to medication \"in a similar or greater degree than\" religiously motivated facilitated referrals do. <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">508 U.S., at 543</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-35\">C</p><p id=\"p-36\">One last example. In adopting the rules, the Board recognized that some pharmacy owners might \"close rather than dispense medications that conflicts with their beliefs.\" App. to Brief in Opposition for Washington State Respondents 34a. Such closures would appear to inflict on customers a much greater disruption in access to medications than would allowing facilitated referrals: Shuttering pharmacies would make <em>all</em> of those pharmacies' customers find other sources for <em>all</em> of their medications, rather than have only some customers be referred to another pharmacy for a small handful of drugs. But the Board shrugged off this problem, asserting that it \"may ... be temporary\" because a religious objector may be replaced by \"a new operator who will comply <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"2440\" href=\"#p2440\" id=\"p2440\">*2440</a>with these rules.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em> I don't dispute that the market will often work to fill such openings, but it cannot reasonably be supposed that new pharmacies will appear overnight. The bottom line is clear: Washington would rather have no pharmacy than one that doesn't toe the line on abortifacient emergency contraceptives. Particularly given the State's stipulation that \"facilitated referrals do not pose a threat to timely access\" to such drugs, App. to Pet. for Cert. 335a, it is hard not to view its actions as exhibiting hostility toward religious objections.</p><p id=\"p-37\">IV</p><p id=\"p-38\">For these reasons and others, it seems to me likely that the Board's regulations are not neutral and generally applicable. Quite the contrary: The evidence relied upon by the District Court suggests that the regulations are targeted at religious conduct alone, to stamp out religiously motivated referrals while allowing referrals for secular reasons (whether by rule or by wink). If that is so, the regulations are invalid unless the State can prove that they are narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest. The Ninth Circuit did not reach this question, as it upheld the regulations under far less demanding rational-basis review. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286352\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1064/\">794 F.3d, at 1084</extracted-citation>. I will not try to answer here whether the regulations meet strict scrutiny, except to observe that the State's justification that the regulations advance its \"interest in ensuring that its citizens have safe and timely access to their lawful and lawfully prescribed medications,\" <em>ibid.,</em> seems awfully hard to square with the State's stipulation that \"facilitated referrals do <em>not</em> pose a threat to timely access to lawfully prescribed medications,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 335a (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-40\">\"The Free Exercise Clause commits government itself to religious tolerance, and upon even slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures.\" <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, supra,</em> at 547, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p523\">113 S.Ct. 2217</extracted-citation>. Ralph's has raised more than \"slight suspicion\" that the rules challenged here reflect antipathy toward religious beliefs that do not accord with the views of those holding the levers of government power. I would grant certiorari to ensure that Washington's novel and concededly unnecessary burden on religious objectors does not trample on fundamental rights.
