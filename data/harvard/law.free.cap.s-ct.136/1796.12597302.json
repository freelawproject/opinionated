After <em>Roper,</em> death sentences imposed on prisoners convicted of murders committed as minors were reduced to lesser sentences.</p><p id=\"p-11\">In the present case, petitioner committed a heinous murder in 1997 when he was 17 years old. See <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1798\" href=\"#p1798\" id=\"p1798\">*1798</a><extracted-citation case-ids=\"8319340\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/1037/#p1047\">955 So.2d 1037</extracted-citation>, 1047-1049 (Ala.Crim.App.2003). Wielding a knife and wearing a stocking mask to conceal his face, petitioner climbed through a window into the home of Melissa and Andrew Mills. Petitioner demanded money, but the Mills family had only $9 on hand. While petitioner remained in the Mills home with Melissa Mills and her three young children, Andrew Mills raced to an ATM and withdrew $375, the maximum amount available. Petitioner then demanded more money, so Andrew went to a nearby grocery store to cash a check. While holding her at knife point, petitioner raped Melissa Mills, who was four months pregnant, before stabbing her repeatedly in the neck, upper and lower chest, and back. The stab wounds pierced her liver and lungs, and she eventually succumbed.</p><p id=\"p-13\">A jury found petitioner guilty of murder and then proceeded to decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"8319340\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/1037/#p1047\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em> at 1048 ; see Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5-45 (1982). Under the Alabama law then in force, \"[t]he age of the defendant at the time of the crime\" was one of the statutory \"[m]itigating circumstances\" that the jury was required to consider. \u00a7 13A-5-51(7). The jury nevertheless concluded that petitioner's age did not warrant a sentence of less than death. After <em>Roper,</em> however, petitioner's sentence was commuted to life without parole. See <em>Ex parte Adams,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8319371\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/1106/\">955 So.2d 1106</extracted-citation> (Ala.2005).</p><p id=\"p-14\">In cases like this, it can be argued that the original sentencing jury fulfilled the individualized sentencing requirement that <em>Miller</em> subsequently imposed. In these cases, the sentencer necessarily rejected the argument that the defendant's youth and immaturity called for the lesser sentence of life imprisonment without parole. It can therefore be argued that such a sentencer would surely have felt that the defendant's youth and immaturity did not warrant an even lighter sentence that would have allowed the petitioner to be loosed on society at some time in the future. In short, it can be argued that the jury that sentenced petitioner to death already engaged in the very process mandated by <em>Miller</em> and concluded that petitioner was not a mere \" ' child' \" whose crimes reflected \" 'unfortunate yet transient immaturity,' \" <em>post,</em> at 1800 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in decision to grant, vacate, and remand), but was instead one of the rare minors who deserves life without parole.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-15\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1799\" href=\"#p1799\" id=\"p1799\">*1799</a>In cases in which a juvenile offender was originally sentenced to death after the sentencer considered but rejected youth as a mitigating factor, courts are free on remand to evaluate whether any further individualized consideration is required.</p><p id=\"p-16\">Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate and remand.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-17\">The petitioners in these cases were sentenced to death for crimes they committed before they turned 18.

There is no indication that, when the factfinders in these cases considered petitioners' youth, they even asked the question <em>Miller</em> required them not only to answer, but to answer correctly: whether petitioners' crimes reflected \"transient immaturity\" or \"irreparable corruption.\" 577 U.S., at ---- - ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">136 S.Ct., at 734</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-20\">The last factfinders to consider petitioners' youth did so more than 10-and in most cases more than 20-years ago. (Petitioners' post-<em>Roper</em> resentencings were generally automatic.) Those factfinders did not have the benefit of this Court's guidance regarding the \"diminished culpability of juveniles\" and the ways that \"penological justifications\" apply to juveniles with \"lesser force than to adults.\" <em>Roper,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">543 U.S., at 571</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">125 S.Ct. 1183</extracted-citation>. As importantly, they did not have the benefit of this Court's repeated exhortation that the gruesomeness of a crime is not sufficient to demonstrate that a juvenile offender is beyond redemption: \"The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">Id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\"> at 570</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">125 S.Ct. 1183</extracted-citation> ; see also <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">id.,</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\"> at 573</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">125 S.Ct. 1183</extracted-citation> ; <em>Miller,</em> 567 U.S., at ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">132 S.Ct., at 2475</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-21\">When petitioners were sentenced, their youth was just one consideration among many; after <em>Miller,</em> we know that youth is the dispositive consideration for \"all but the rarest of children.\" <em>Montgomery,</em> 577 U.S., at ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">136 S.Ct., at 726</extracted-citation>. The sentencing proceedings in these cases are a product of that pre-<em>Miller</em> era. In one typical case, a judge's sentencing order-overruling a unanimous jury verdict recommending life without parole instead of death-refers to youth only once, noting \"the court finds that the age of the defendant at the time of the crime is a mitigating circumstance\" and then that \"[t]he [c]ourt rejects the advisory verdict of the jury, and finds that the aggravating circumstances in this case outweigh the mitigating circumstances and that the punishment should be death.\" Sentencing Order, <em>Alabama v.

That petitioners were once given a death sentence we now know to be constitutionally unacceptable tells us nothing about whether their current life-without-parole sentences are constitutionally acceptable.
