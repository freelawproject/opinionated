The plaintiff, Charles A. Worsham, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Eric M. Greifenberger, and his employer, Gelco Corporation. The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs cause of action had abated pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 because of his failure timely to intervene in an action brought by his employer, National Guardian Security (National), against the defendants. The plaintiff claims that the trial court\u2019s judgment is flawed b\u00e9cause the lack of notification of the limit\u00e9d period during which he could intervene, and the failure to warn him of the consequences of failing timely to intervene, rendered the notice of his employer\u2019s action constitutionally inadequate to support a complete abatement of his cause of action. We agree and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The material facts are undisputed. Following a September 23, 1991 motor vehicle accident that involved the plaintiff, who was driving a vehicle owned by National, the plaintiff filed a claim for, and received, benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. On July 1, 1992, National instituted an action against the defendants under \u00a7 31-293 in order to recover the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that it had paid to the plaintiff. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-293, National notified the plaintiff of the initiation of those proceedings by a certified letter dated August 12, 1992. The letter identified the applicable court and docket number, and stated that the action was being taken pursuant to \u00a7 31-293.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter did not inform the plaintiff that, in accordance with \u00a7 31-293, his cause of action against the defendants would abate if he failed to intervene in National\u2019s action within thirty days. The plaintiff did not intervene in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On June 23, 1993, the plaintiff filed this action against the defendants, alleging injuries arising from the negligence of Greifenberger. The defendants ultimately moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiffs claim had abated because he had not intervened as a plaintiff in National\u2019s action within thirty days of the notice contained in the August 12, 1992 letter from National, as required by \u00a7 31-293. The trial court agreed with the defendants, and granted their motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the complete abatement of his cause of action against the defendants in the circumstances of this case violates his federal and state<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> due process rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that the August 12, 1992 letter from National provided him insufficient notice of the procedurally fatal consequences of a fa.ilure to move to intervene as a party plaintiff within thirty days as required by \u00a7 31-293. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We first note that the notice provided in this case comported with the statutory notice requirements of \u00a7 31-293. These statutory requirements for notice have been clearly settled by prior decisions of this court. In <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990), an employer sought to intervene, after the thirty day period had expired, in a third party action of its employee, who had received compensation benefits. Like the plaintiff in the present case, the employer in <em>Winslow </em>claimed that the abatement provision of \u00a7 31-293 should not' apply to it because the notice received from the employee initiating the action failed to inform the employer that its right to intervene would abate unless exercised within thirty days. Id., 536-37. The employer argued that \u00a7 31-293 required that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>include this information. We held that \u201cunder \u00a7 31-293, an employee or employer who brings a third party action must simply notify the other of two facts: (1) the fact that the action has been brought; and (2) the name of the court to which the writ in the action is returnable. The plain terms of the statute require no more.\u201d Id., 538. <em>In Durrschmidt v. Loux, </em>230 Conn. 100, 644 A.2d 343 (1994), we considered a claim that valid notice to an employer must include notice of the employment relationship. We again held that the statute requires only the two facts set forth in <em>Winslow. </em>Id., 104. Finally, <em>Reichert </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>34 Conn. App. 521, 528, 642 A.2d 51 (1994), aff'd, 233 Conn. 251, 658 A.2d 96 (1995), clarified that the notice and abatement provisions of \u00a7 31-293 also apply to situations in which injured employees sought to join third party actions initiated by employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In the present case, the August 12, 1992 letter sent to the plaintiff by National set forth the information required by <em>Winslow. </em>The letter provided: \u201cPursuant . . . to [General Statutes \u00a7 31-293], we have issued a Writ, Summons and Complaint against [the defendants], owner and operator respectively of the automobile which rear ended your motor vehicle and caused you to sustain injuries. Said action was returnable to the Superior Court for the Judicial District of StamfordNorwalk at Stamford on August 11, 1992. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The prior cases interpreting \u00a7 31-293, however, did not involve constitutional claims regarding the sufficiency of the statutory notice. Whether the due process clause requires that the notice contain more information, therefore, remained an open question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Our due process inquiry takes the form of a two part analysis. \u201c[W]e must determine whether [the claimant] was deprived of a protected interest, and, if so, what process was his due.\u201d <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 428, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1982); see also <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 576, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972); <em>Kelley Property Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>226 Conn. 314, 322, 627 A.2d 909 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 181, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993) (\u201c[d]ue process analysis begins with the identification of the life, liberty or property interest at stake\u201d). The plaintiffs right to pursue his tort remedy rises to the level of a property interest protected by the due process clause. \u201cAn interest protected or cognizable under the due process clause must have a basis in existing rales or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rales or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 437-38, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). An individual\u2019s entitlement to a prospective cause of action is well settled in our state law. \u201cA right of action, including one for personal injuries, is a vested property interest, before as well as after judgment.\u201d <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Nastri, </em>125 Conn. 144, 147, 3 A.2d 839 (1939). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201ca cause of action is a species of property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>supra, 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiff has suffered a deprivation of this property interest. In the context of a \u00a7 31-293 proceeding such as this, a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the basis that the plaintiffs action was filed more than thirty days after notice of the initiation of the proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>extinguishes the plaintiffs claim permanently and completely. See <em>Reichert </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 528-31. Because this is precisely what took place in the present case, the plaintiff has unquestionably been deprived of his interest in his tort claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Because the plaintiff was deprived of an interest that rises to the level of a property interest protected by the due process clause, we next consider what process is due the plaintiff. See <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>supra, 455 U.S. 428. Although we have noted that the \u201c [fundamental tenets of due process . . . require that all persons directly concerned in the result of an adjudication be given reasonable notice\u201d; <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 193, 423 A.2d 857 (1979); we have not had occasion to address the due process requirements for notice in this or comparable circumstances. We are not completely without guidance, however, because \u201c[i]n cases with issues involving the sufficiency of notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>under due process standards, a starting point is <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950) . . . .\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Health &amp; Hospital Corp., </em>620 F.2d 1201, 1214 (7th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Mullane </em>stated that \u201c[a]n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity [to be heard].\u201d <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, 339 U.S. 314. The court pointed out that an essential function of notice is to enable the recipient to \u201cchoose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest\u201d; id.; with regard to proceedings affecting the recipient\u2019s interests. Although <em>Mullane </em>concerned the means, and not the content, of notice, the content of the notice is as relevant as the means in evaluating its sufficiency. Unless the content of the notice conveys to the recipient a certain minimum level of information, the notice cannot enable the recipient meaningfully to choose a course of action in regard to the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In the context of \u00a7 31-293 proceedings brought by either employers or employees against alleged third party tortfeasors, it is of particular importance that the recipient of the notice, whether it is the employee or the employer, be apprised of the consequences of inaction pursuant to the abatement provision of \u00a7 31-293. Upon receiving the notice of such a proceeding, the recipient has two alternatives with respect to the recipient\u2019s own right of action: (1) move immediately to intervene in the action; or (2) do nothing before the thirty day period for action expires and lose the claim forever. Without adequate information concerning the abatement provision, the recipient simply is not informed that this choice needs to be made. Especially in light of the short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>thirty day period for action, it is all too possible that the recipient may forfeit the claim without ever being aware that his or her property interest was in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The notice at issue in the present case failed to inform the plaintiff adequately of the consequences of inaction. The August 12,1992 letter contained no explicit mention that a failure to move to intervene within thirty days would result in the permanent loss of the plaintiffs cause of action, and it could not reasonably be assumed that the plaintiff had independent knowledge of this fact. Moreover, the letter\u2019s identification of the specific statutory section governing the employer\u2019s action, namely, \u00a7 31-293, cannot be considered a sufficient means of apprising the plaintiff of this essential information. It is true that the plaintiff could have theoretically obtained the information by looking up the statute. The fact that prompt action is necessary after receipt of notice in order to preserve the recipient\u2019s rights, in conjunction with the fact that recipients of \u00a7 31-293 notice will not ordinarily have legal training, however, persuades us that a bare reference to \u00a7 31-293 is not an adequate surrogate for a reasonably clear statement of the legal effect of its statutory terms. We conclude, therefore, that the notice given to the plaintiff was constitutionally insufficient, and, thus, the abatement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim based upon his failure to intervene in a timely fashion unconstitutionally deprived him of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Faced with analogous cases, the highest courts of other jurisdictions have reached similar conclusions. The Supreme Court of Washington has considered a challenge to the notice issued pursuant to that state\u2019s \u201cmissing shareholders\u201d statute. That statute allowed a corporation, after publishing notice of an upcoming shareholder\u2019s meeting, to petition the Superior Court for appointment of a representative to cast the votes of missing shareholders at the meeting. The challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>notice failed to inform shareholders that pursuant to the \u201cmissing shareholders\u201d statute, \u201cshould they fail to appear at the shareholders\u2019 meeting, the court will appoint a person to vote their shares.\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Washington Preferred Life Ins. Co., </em>81 Wash. 2d 403, 408, 502 P.2d 1016 (1972). The Washington Supreme Court concluded that the notice was unconstitutional, stating that it \u201c \u2018is fundamental that a notice to be meaningful must apprise the party to whom it is directed that his person or property is in jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d Id. In <em>Schafran &amp; Finkel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>280 N.Y. 164, 19 N.E.2d 1005 (1939), the New York Court of Appeals dealt with this issue in the context of statutory notice of a demand regarding arbitration. The challenged notice did not inform the recipient that its failure to move for a stay of the arbitration proceeding within ten days would result in waiver of the claim that the recipient was not contractually bound to arbitrate the dispute. Id., 171. The court concluded that this notice did not comply with due process. Id. The court stated: \u201cThe notice should state . . . the consequences of [the recipient\u2019s] failure to act as the law specifies.\u201d Id., 172. We agree with the approach taken by these courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Moreover, although the present case involves a notice given by an employer to an employee, the same principles apply also to a notice issued to an employer by an employee bringing a third party action and giving notice pursuant to \u00a7 31-293. With respect to claims for reimbursement brought pursuant to \u00a7 31-293, employers have property interests similar to those of employees, and those interests merit equal constitutional protection. In addition, they are likely to be similarly affected by insufficient knowledge of the consequences of inaction with respect to actions governed by \u00a7 31-293. Employers and employees have generally been treated identically under the notice and abatement provisions of \u00a7 31-293. See, e.g., <em>Reichert </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>supra, 34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Conn. App. 528. We see no persuasive reason why they should not be treated identically for purposes of the constitutionality of the notice under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Finally, we address the remedy that is appropriate for this case. Ordinarily, \u201c[i]f literal construction of a statute raises serious constitutional questions, we are obligated to search for a construction that will accomplish the legislature\u2019s purpose without risking the statute\u2019s invalidity.\u201d <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 785, 629 A.2d 357 (1993). That adjudicative technique, however, presumes that an alternative, constitutional interpretation remains available. In the present case, our prior decisions interpreting \u00a7 31-293 have explicitly held that the statute requires no more than the fact that the action has been brought and the name of the relevant court, thereby precluding this approach. See <em>Durrschmidt </em>v. <em>Loux, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 104; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 538. Therefore, we must conclude that the statutory notice provision of \u00a7 31-293 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We are reluctant, however, simply to invalidate this provision, leaving the collateral consequences unaddressed. Such a step would entail significant questions concerning severability and the effect of the invalidation upon related provisions of the statute. These questions have not been briefed or presented to this court, and we are, therefore, not inclined to answer them. Yet, in the absence of some clear direction from us concerning the implementation of this decision, there would inevitably ensue significant uncertainty concerning the rights of, and the limitations upon, employers and employees bringing third party actions governed by \u00a7 31-293. Not only would resolving this confusion consume a great deal of judicial resources, the uncertainty would negatively impact the material interests of the workers\u2019 compensation community \u2014 employers, employees and the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>We therefore delineate a procedural scheme that will allow the statute to continue to function within the bounds of the constitution. Although courts rarely craft remedies of this sort, we note that it is not unprecedented for the judiciary in exceptional circumstances to delineate a procedural scheme for the protection of constitutional rights where statutory protections fall short or are nonexistent. See, e.g., <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) (fashioning procedures for police interrogations in order to protect fifth amendment right against self-incrimination); see also <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (1914) (adopting exclusionary rule in order to protect against unconstitutional searches and seizures by federal authorities); <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961) (extending exclusionary rule to states); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974) (clarifying that exclusionary rule \u201cis a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect\u201d); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 164, 579 A.2d 58 (1990) (\u201c \u2018The exclusionary rule places no limitations on the actions of the police. The fourth amendment does.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Specifically, we hold that in order for the abatement provision of \u00a7 31-293 to be invoked against a party, the notice given pursuant to that statute must have comported with both the statutory requirements and the due process clause. In compliance with the statute, the notice must contain \u201c(1) the fact that the action has been brought; and (2) the name of the court to which the writ in the action is returnable\u201d; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 538; and in compliance with the due process clause, the notice must also include a notice that the recipient\u2019s right to bring an action against the third party tortfeasor will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>be permanently lost if the recipient does not move to intervene in the action within thirty days of such notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aie\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the employee, the employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund brings an action against [a third party tortfeasor], he shall immediately notify the others, in writing ... of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the others may join as parties plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the others fail to join as parties plaintiff, their right of action against [the third party tortfeasor] shall abate. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Although at the time of the plaintiffs injuries, General Statutes (Rev. t1991) \u00a7 31-293 was in effect, subsequent amendments to that statute have effected only minor technical changes not relevant to this opinion.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">First, the plaintiff does not contend, as the defendants imply, that the legislature has no right to impose a time limit on a cause of action, such as that imposed by the abatement provision of \u00a7 31-293. Such an argument would indeed be difficult to sustain. Rather, the plaintiff mal\u00edes the narrower claim that the process of law accorded to him under that abatement provision, and the associated notice provision, was constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Moreover, insofar as the defendants have accurately characterized the plaintiffs complaint as an objection to the procedure that he has been accorded, they have erroneously characterized this objection as the plaintiffs claim of entitlement. By inappropriately conflating the substantive and the procedural prongs of the due process inquiry, the defendants ignore the substantive loss that the plaintiff has suffered. Cf. <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>227 Conn. 270, 276, 630 A.2d 1010 (1993). Stated simply, the abatement procedure of \u00a7 31-293 does not operate iri a vacuum. Rather, it serves to end forever the plaintiffs right to pursue his tort remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
