In addition, the defendant was sentenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>fifteen years imprisonment on the conspiracy count, that sentence to run concurrently with the capital felony sentence, for a total effective sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release. On appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant claims the trial court improperly: (1) refused to dismiss the capital felony count because a capital felony conviction may not be predicated on a charge of felony murder; (2) charged the jury, over the defendant\u2019s objection, on the statutory affirmative defense to felony murder, even though the evidence did not support that defense and the defendant did not rely on that defense; (3) allowed the jury to hear evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions; (4) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial after it was learned that one of the jurors had been the defendant\u2019s neighbor, knew the defendant and his family, and had not disclosed a sibling\u2019s narcotics arrest; and (5) charged the jury as to \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in such a manner as to shift the burden of proof to the defendant. In addition, the defendant claims that his convictions for felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery cannot stand if his coconspirator\u2019s convictions are reversed on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court as to the capital felony count, affirm the judgment of conviction on the remaining counts and remand the case for sentencing on the felony murder convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In October, 1990, the defendant was involved in drug trafficking with his friend, Eric Amado. The defendant and Arriado stored drugs at the West Haven apartment of Amado\u2019s girlfriend, Joanne Bailey. Bailey shared the apartment with Hope Vaughn, who had been dating the defendant. On October 19,1990, Vaughn, who was upset over statements regarding her allegedly made by the defendant and Amado, decided that she would \u201cput a stop to it.\u201d Vaughn telephoned a friend, Anthony Young, and asked him to come to the apartment she shared with Bailey. She then opened a window and knocked over some of the apartment\u2019s furnishings to make it appear as though the apartment had been burglarized. When Young arrived, Vaughn told him that she had some things to bring out and, after Young had backed his car, a red Toyota C\u00e9lica, up to the door of the apartment building, she loaded two duffel bags and a small safe containing the drugs into the trunk of the car. The two then drove to Young\u2019s apartment in Bridgeport, where they were joined by Peter Hall, Vaughn\u2019s former boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Meanwhile, the defendant and Amado returned to the West Haven apartment and discovered that the drugs were missing. The two men immediately began to search for the drugs and for whomever had taken them. They were joined in their search by Joanne Bailey, as well as by two associates, John \u201cJohn-John\u201d Wideman and David \u201cChico\u201d Bailey.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During the course of their search, the group traveled to Stamford so that Amado could consult with a \u201cvoodoo man\u201d of his acquaintance. The \u201cvoodoo man\u201d told him that Vaughn had taken the drugs. Joanne Bailey informed Amado that Vaughn might be with a friend, Sarita Malloy, who lived in Bridgeport with Young. The group drove in two cars to Young\u2019s apartment, where they found Vaughn, Young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and Hall standing outside on the porch. At that time, they apparently did not suspect Young or Hall to have been involved in the theft. Joanne Bailey approached Vaughn and told her that Amado wanted to speak with her. Vaughn went over to the car where Amado was waiting, and when he ordered her to get into the car she complied. The group then returned to West Haven, where they spent the night. Throughout the night, Amado and the defendant, along with the other two men, questioned Vaughn as to her knowledge of the missing drugs. Amado threatened to shoot her and, at one point, the defendant tied a sock around Vaughn\u2019s head while David Bailey threatened her with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The next morning, Joanne Bailey asked neighbors whether they had seen anything suspicious. After being told by a neighbor that Vaughn had been seen loading bags into the trunk of a red Toyota, the defendant, Amado, Joanne Bailey, Wideman and David Bailey returned to Young\u2019s Bridgeport apartment. The men were armed with automatic or semiautomatic weapons, including Uzis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant carried an Uzi. Upon arriving at Young\u2019s apartment, Amado told Young that he had come for his \u201cstuff.\u201d Young told him to calm down and to come inside the house, but Amado began yelling and then began shooting. Young and Hall were fatally wounded, and Joanne Bailey was shot in the back of her left thigh. The defendant, Amado, Wideman and David Bailey fled the scene. The defendant subsequently left the Bridgeport area, and moved to Queens, New York, where he remained until his arrest for the murders in 1994. Further facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">.1</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>felony count.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 839, 681 A.2d 944 (1996), argues that the capital felony count should have been dismissed because a capital felony conviction may be predicated only upon a conviction for intentional murder. This issue is controlled by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 699 A.2d 57 (1997), and, in accordance with that decision, the defendant\u2019s capital felony conviction is vacated. Because the two counts of felony murder were merged with the capital felony count for sentencing purposes, the case is remanded for resentencing on the felony murder counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly charged the jury as to the statutory affirmative defense to felony murder. Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54c, if a defendant charged with felony murder was not the sole participant in the underlying crime, that defendant may claim as an affirmative defense that he or she: \u201c(1) [d]id not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (2) was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any dangerous instrument; and (3) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon or instrument; and (4) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.\u201d The defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>is only effective if all four elements are met. The burden of proving these elements is on the defendant, who must prove their existence by a preponderance of the evidence. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to the defendant\u2019s testifying at trial, the trial court raised the issue as to whether the defendant would request a jury charge as to the affirmative defense set forth in \u00a7 53a-54c. At that time, the defendant stated that he did not plan to assert an affirmative defense. The state, however, indicated that it would request such a charge and, prior to final argument, gave the defendant a copy of its request for a jury charge as to the affirmative defense. As the defendant later told the court, he assumed that, based on his testimony, the state\u2019s request would be denied and, therefore, he did not object to or argue against the state\u2019s request at that time. Consequently, during its summation, the state referred to the existence of the affirmative defense. At that point, the defendant objected, arguing that reference to the affirmative defense was inappropriate because he had not asserted the defense and had not requested a charge on the defense. The trial court indicated that it was bound by the statute to give the affirmative defense charge as requested by the state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Subsequently, over the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>dant\u2019s objection, the court charged the jury concerning the statutory affirmative defense to felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The defendant claims that, by giving the charge, the court deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) the charge was improper because it was not supported by the evidence; and (2) it was improper for the court to grant the state\u2019s request for the affirmative defense charge over the defendant\u2019s objection because the giving of the charge effectively stripped him of his asserted defense of mere presence and relieved the state of its burden to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the charge, and that the giving of the charge did not effectively strip the defendant of any other defense, but, rather, provided him with further means to escape culpability if his asserted defense had failed. We need not decide at this time whether it was improper for the court to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the affirmative defense instruction over the defendant\u2019s objection because we conclude that, even if it was improper, the defendant was not harmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The defendant argues that the instruction regarding the affirmative defense was improper because it was not supported by the evidence. We disagree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">We note that the consideration of the evidence in this case is complicated by the fact that it is the state that requested the instruction. In the vast majority of cases involving requests for instructions as to legally recognized defenses, including affirmative defenses, it is the defendant who has made the request. In those cases, we have held that the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the request. <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 283, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 279, 506 A.2d 556 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 430, 435 A.2d 967 (1980). With regard to the <em>amount </em>of evidence needed, when the requested instruction is for an affirmative defense, the evidence must be \u201csufficient . . . for a rational juror to find that all the elements of the defense are established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>236 Conn. 342, 353, 673 A.2d 463 (1996). Although the rule in <em>Person </em>was formulated in response to a defense request for the instruction, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>in this case has not pointed to any authority or reasoned distinction that would suggest that we apply a different standard to a request by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The evidence supporting the affirmative defense may be summarized as follows. The defendant testified that he did not know what had been taken from the apartment shared by Vaughn and Joanne Bailey. He testified that he accompanied Amado throughout the day the drugs were taken and the next day solely to protect himself from suspicion. The defendant further testified that, when the group arrived at Young\u2019s apartment on the day of the shootings, he was not sure if anyone was armed. Although the defendant later stated that \u201cEric had been swingin\u2019 that gun around,\u201d the juiy reasonably could have concluded that the defendant had been referring to the events of the previous night. Neither Vaughn nor Joanne Bailey could state with certainty that any of the men were armed on the morning of the shootings. The defendant claimed that he believed that Amado merely wanted to question Young and Hall about the missing property and further claimed that his only reason in accompanying Amado was to \u201clisten to the whole scenario and make sure my name wasn\u2019t implicated in anything.\u201d We conclude that this testimony, when viewed in the light most favorable to the request, was sufficient to support the affirmative defense because a rational juror reasonably could have found that the defendant: (1) did not commit the murder; (2) was not armed; (3) had no reasonable ground to believe Amado was armed; and (4) had no reasonable ground to believe Amado intended to rob or shoot anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The defendant next argues that by giving the affirmative defense instruction the trial court effectively deprived the defendant of his asserted defense of mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>presence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> misled the jury as to the defendant\u2019s burden of proof and burdened the defendant\u2019s right to testify by damaging his credibility as a witness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The defendant first claims that by giving the affirmative defense instruction, and by discussing the propriety of that instruction in the presence of the jury, the trial court supplanted his asserted defense of mere presence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">It is settled law that a defendant who has produced evidence supporting a legally recognized defense is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction, and that the denial of such an instruction is a violation of due process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 597-98, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990). If, as the defendant claims, the charge regarding the statutory affirmative defense effectively prevented the jury from <em>considering </em>the defendant\u2019s asserted defense of mere presence, the state would be required to prove that the erroneous charge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerardi, </em>237 Conn. 348, 362, 677 A.2d 937 (1996). In the present case, however, the defendant acknowledges that the trial court did indeed instruct the jury on two occasions as to the \u201cmere presence\u201d defense, and the defendant has not claimed that those instructions were erroneous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, although the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>argues that the jury may have been led to believe that the affirmative defense was the defendant\u2019s only option, we note that the trial court and counsel engaged in debate over the propriety of the affirmative defense in the presence of the jury. Although the discussion, much like attorney summations, could not be considered as evidence, the jury nevertheless heard that the defendant was asserting a separate defense of mere presence and not admitting to any participation in the underlying crimes. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the defendant benefited from this colloquy by failing to object to the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The defendant next claims that, by giving the affirmative defense instruction over his objection, the trial court improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, thereby depriving him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant argues that by relying upon an affirmative defense, a defendant in effect admits to the underlying crimes and takes on the burden of proving mitigating circumstances. Therefore, the defendant asserts, it is inappropriate for the trial court to allow the state to relieve itself of its burden of proof by granting such a request when the defendant chooses not to assume that responsibility. The defendant further contends that, because he had offered testimony in support of his claim of mere presence that, if accepted by the jury, negated the affirmative defense, the affirmative defense instruction forced the defendant to prove facts contradicted by his own testimony, and thus damaged his credibility in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In response, the state argues that the defendant offered testimony supportive of the affirmative defense but chose not to request an instruction, with the hope that the jury, believing that the defendant was more than merely present but knowing that he was not the principal shooter, would, in its ignorance of the existence of the affirmative defense, acquit the defendant of the charges against him. The state argues that to allow the defendant to take such a gamble undermines the state\u2019s right to a thoughtful consideration by the jury of all the issues presented. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 731, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 353, the state argues that when it comes to requesting an affirmative defense instruction, the defendant does not hold a monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We do not reach these claims, however, because we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the giving of the affirmative defense instruction in addition to instructing on the asserted defense of mere presence, even if improper, was harmless<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because: (1) the state produced substantial evidence negating the defendant\u2019s claim of mere presence; and (2) in order for the jury to reach the merits of the affirmative defense, it first would have had to consider and reject any other defenses, including the defense of mere presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">It was undisputed that the defendant did not shoot the victims and that he did not personally attempt to take any property from them. There was conflicting testimony, however, regarding the extent of the defendant\u2019s participation in the other activities leading up to the shootings. Although the defendant testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>was never armed, both Joanne Bailey and Vaughn testified that they believed that he had been carrying a gun, which Vaughn described as an Uzi. Additionally, Vaughn testified that the drugs taken from the apartment belonged to both Amado and the defendant. Vaughn further testified that the defendant had taken part in questioning and threatening her the night before the shootings. The defendant himself testified that Amado had a gun and that he was afraid of what might have happened to him or his family if Amado had thought he had taken the missing property. When asked to elaborate on his fears, he stated that, in his experience, such situations \u201cmost of the time [end] up in somebody get-tin\u2019 killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In our view, the jury reasonably could have disregarded this testimony and found that the defendant merely had been present at the shootings. The jury therefore could have viewed the statutory affirmative defense as superfluous. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 468, 503 A.2d 599 (1986) (defendant not prejudiced by jury consideration of superfluous defense). If, however, the jury determined that the defendant was not merely present at the scene, but, instead, was an active participant in the crime, the jury\u2019s consideration of the statutory affirmative defense could not have harmed the defendant. Rather, the statutory affirmative defense could only have helped the defendant by providing him with another opportunity to escape a jury finding of culpability for the murders. The jury would not have reached the issue of the affirmative defense had it not already determined that the defendant was a participant in the crime, and not merely present during its commission. Indeed, absent \u201cmere presence,\u201d had it not been for the possible affirmative defense, the defendant would have had <em>no </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">This progression follows what this court has recognized to be the appropriate sequence of issue analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>by the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 579, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993). The existence of an affirmative defense does not obviate the requirement that the state establish the defendant\u2019s guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each essential element of the crime charged. Only after it had confronted the difficult task of resolving the issues surrounding the defendant\u2019s complicity in the robbery could the jury have moved on to the task of deciding whether he had satisfied the requirements of the affirmative defense. By giving the instructions as to mere presence and the statutory affirmative defense in the sequence that it did, the trial court fulfilled its \u201cduty ... to structure the jurors\u2019 deliberations in a manner that permits them to perform in an orderly fashion their fact-finding function . . . .\u201d Id. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the instruction was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed evidence of his prior felony convictions to be presented to the jury. He argues that because the state was allowed to mention the nature of the felony convictions, which were drug related, the prejudicial effect of the evidence far outweighed its probative value. The state responds that the felony convictions were admitted properly for impeachment puiposes and that the court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury clearly indicated that the felony convictions were to be used only for the purpose of weighing the defendant\u2019s credibility. We agree with the state that the prior felony convictions were admissible for impeachment puiposes and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the state to inform the jury as to the nature of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to analyze this claim. In April, 1987, the defendant was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>victed of having a weapon in a motor vehicle and in May, 1989, the defendant pleaded guilty and was convicted on two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell. Prior to trial, the defendant submitted a motion in limine to exclude evidence of the three prior felony convictions. That motion was ordered over to the time of trial, at which time it was denied. The defendant testified at trial and, on direct examination by counsel, admitted to the prior felony convictions without disclosing their nature. On cross-examination, the defendant admitted that two of the felony convictions were narcotics related. In its summation, the state referred to the prior convictions, stating to the jury, \u201c[a]s a witness here, the defendant has put into the record ... his past record of three felony convictions. . . . Do you want to believe a person who\u2019s previously been convicted of three separate felonies? Has any other witness in this trial ever been convicted of a felony? I haven\u2019t heard.\u201d The trial court charged the jury that the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the existence and nature of the prior felony convictions could be considered only insofar as those convictions reflected on his credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of guilt of other crimes is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged against him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 428, 568 A.2d 448 (1990), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). The trial court, however, may allow the state to mention specific prior convictions as evidence of a defendant\u2019s credibility provided such convictions carry a penalty of more than one year in prison and provided that their prejudicial effect does not far outweigh their probative value. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 16, 480 A.2d 489 (1984). The trial court has wide discretion in this balancing determination and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ruling .... Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 458, 464, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u201cThree factors should be examined to determine whether a prior criminal conviction . . . has been [properly] admitted: (1) the extent to which admission is likely to prejudice the defendant\u2019s cause; (2) the significance of the prior crime as bearing on the defendant\u2019s truthfulness; and (3) the remoteness in time of the prior conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, [194 Conn.] 11; see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.21.6. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u201cAs to the first criterion, a high degree of prejudice can be expected when the prior crime is quite similar to the crime charged because of the jury\u2019s tendency to believe that if he did it before, he probably did it again. <em>State v. Carter, </em>[189 Conn. 631, 644, 458 A.2d 379 (1983)]. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 7.21.6, p. 199. . . . Notwithstanding the lack of similarity between the crimes of possession of narcotics and [the crimes of felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery], the defendant claims that [because the events of October 19 and 20, 1990, involved drugs] the mere mention of a prior drug-related offense is enough to cause unacceptable prejudice. While we agree that evidence of a prior narcotics felony conviction is certainly prejudicial to the defendant, evidence of any felony conviction is equally prejudicial. This generic prejudice is insufficient to render the disclosure of his prior conviction inadmissible.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.Rivera, </em>221 Conn. 58, 72-74, 602 A.2d 571 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">As to the second criterion, although a felony conviction for possession of narcotics does not reflect directly on the credibility of the defendant; <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 12-13; we note \u201cthe \u2018legislative judgment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>records of [all] crimes involving sentences of more than one year affect the credibility of a witness . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 10, 291 A.2d 240 (1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Finally, neither party disputes that the narcotics convictions occurred a little over one year before the crimes at issue in the present case. Therefore, \u201cthe third prong of the test, which looks upon older convictions with less favor, is clearly satisfied.\u201d Id., 73. Applying these factors, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state to inquire into the nature of the prior felony convictions. The defendant put his credibility at stake by testifying, and the court made it clear in its instructions that the prior convictions were admitted for the sole purpose of testing that credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial based on evidence that a juror had not revealed that she was a neighbor of the defendant, that she knew the defendant and his family, and that she had a sibling who had been arrested on drug charges. The state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion because he did not establish any misconduct on the part of the juror. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On April 28, 1995, approximately one month after the verdict against the defendant was rendered, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, claiming juror misconduct. Specifically, the defendant, claimed that a female juror did not disclose during voir dire that she had been a neighbor of the defendant, had known the defendant\u2019s family and had a brother who had been arrested on a narcotics charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In response to the motion, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing at which the juror and the defendant\u2019s father testified. The juror testified that, although she had lived on the same street as the defendant\u2019s family, she and the defendant had not lived on that same street at the same time. The juror further testified that she had never met the defendant, and did not recognize him as a neighbor. When asked about her brother\u2019s narcotics arrest, she testified that she knew nothing about it until she was contacted by someone from the court at the time the defendant made his motion for a new trial. The defendant\u2019s father then testified that he had recognized the juror the first day that he attended the trial, but was told by the defendant not to look at the jury or mention anything about it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court ruled from the bench that the juror\u2019s testimony was more credible than that of the defendant\u2019s father and that there was no misconduct warranting a new trial. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u201cA defendant is entitled to have an impartial jury decide his case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given them in the adversary arena after proper instructions on the law by the court. . . . It is well established, however, that not every incident of juror misconduct requires a new trial. . . . The question is whether or not the misconduct has prejudiced the defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial. . . . The defendant has been prejudiced if the misbehavior is such to make it probable that the juror\u2019s mind was influenced by it so as to render him or her an unfair and prejudicial juror. . . . We have previously held that, in cases where the trial court is directly implicated in juror misconduct, the state bears the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>of proving that misconduct was harmless error. . . . Where, however, the trial court was in no way responsible for the juror misconduct . . . we have repeatedly held that a defendant who offers proof of juror misconduct bears the burden of proving that actual prejudice resulted from that misconduct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 627-28, 682 A.2d 972 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion for a new trial must take into account the trial judge\u2019s superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she has personally presided. . . . [W]e have . . . accordingly confined our role to a determination of whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 269-70, 604 A.2d 793 (1992). Claims of juror misconduct fall within this rule of limited review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>[supra, 193 Conn. 735-36].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 227-28, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The trial court was not implicated in the defendant\u2019s charge of juror misconduct and, therefore, the defendant bore not only the burden of proving misconduct, but also the burden of proving the prejudicial impact of that misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 628. Although the defendant offered evidence of misconduct, which the court rejected as not credible, the defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced by the juror\u2019s alleged knowledge. Because the defendant failed to prove either misconduct or prejudice, the trial court acted well within its discretionary authority in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The defendant\u2019s fifth claim is that the trial court, in its instruction as to reasonable doubt, improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>shifted the burden of proof to the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant failed to object to the instruction at trial, and presents the issue to this court by invoking the appellate review authorized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The state contends that review is not appropriate because the issue was not properly preserved and because this court, on numerous occasions, has rejected these claims as not rising to the level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of a clear constitutional violation. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Williams, 231 Conn. 235, 254 n.22, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). The defendant concedes that the instruction as given by the trial court was in accordance with \u201cthis long line of precedent\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 705, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995); but urges this court to reconsider that precedent. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation, and reject his claim as not satisfying <em>Golding's </em>second and third requirements because, when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, the court\u2019s instruction as to reasonable doubt was in accord with precedent and did not constitute a clear violation of the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights nor deprive him of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The defendant\u2019s sixth and final claim is that his convictions necessarily are tied to those of Eric Amado, and, therefore, should Amado succeed on his appeal, the defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The defendant was charged with capital felony, felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. Amado was the principal actor in the underlying crimes, and the defendant was charged under the theory of accomplice liability. Amado was not charged with the robbery, or with conspiracy to commit robbery. The defendant does not argue that in order for him to be convicted of conspiracy, Amado must also have been charged with, and convicted of, robbery and conspiracy. Rather, the defendant claims that his complicity is pinned to Amado\u2019s culpability. Specifically, the defendant argues that Amado was acting in self-defense, meaning that Amado\u2019s actions were justified and, consequently, there was no crime, and by extension no conspiracy, committed. The defendant concedes that Amado did not succeed with this defense at trial, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>argues that should Amado succeed on appeal his own convictions must necessarily fall. In essence, the defendant requests this court to reserve judgment on the propriety of the defendant\u2019s convictions until Amado has completed his own appeal process. The state contends that, even if this issue were preserved properly,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the circumstances of Amado\u2019s appeal are such that the results would have no effect on the defendant\u2019s convictions. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Amado\u2019s appeal as presented to the Appellate Court went only to the issue of self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>42 Conn. App. 348, 350, 680 A.2d 974 (1996). In upholding Amado\u2019s convictions, the Appellate Court concluded that self-defense is not a legally cognizable defense to capital felony or felony murder when the underlying crime is robbery. Id., 362. Upon certification to this court, we remanded the appeal to the Appellate Court to reconsider only the issue of capital felony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>242 Conn. 906, 697 A.2d 368 (1997); see footnote 6 of this opinion. Consequently, regardless of the outcome of Amado\u2019s appeal, the fact of the underlying crime of robbery remains unchanged, and the defendant\u2019s convictions remain unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate the capital felony conviction and to impose sentence on the felony murder convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u25a0 In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

Consistent with <em>Person, </em>we have held that the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on inconsistent defenses, including a theory of defense that his testimony squarely contradicts, where there is evidence that supports the inconsistent defenses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>189 Conn. 268, 273, 455 A.2d 342 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">These precedents compel the conclusion that the trial court may present to the jury an affirmative defense that is supported by the evidence, even where the defendant objects thereto. It is true, as the majority notes, that both <em>Asherman </em>and <em>Person, </em>on their specific facts, involved the mental state affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Those cases are not limited, however, to mental state issues. In <em>Asherman, </em>for example, we reasoned more broadly that simply because the defendant had the right to rely on the mitigating circumstance of extreme emotional disturbance \u201cdoes not mean that by his contrary election he may also circumscribe the homicide offenses which the jury may consider.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 732. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 349-50, we relied on cases involving inconsistent defenses that did not involve mental states, such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 271-72 (alibi and allegation that gun was toy), and <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 62, 108 S. Ct. 883, 99 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1988) (entrapment and denial of commission of crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">It is true that in both <em>Asherman </em>and <em>Person </em>we referred to the often elusive differences among states of mind as part of the basis of our rulings. There are other factual differences, however, that may be equally elusive, depending on the state of the evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that may result in the applicability of an affirmative defense. Indeed, in the present case the difference between the defendant\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d at the underlying felony and the evidence supporting the affirmative defense to the charge of felony murder is just such a difference. There is, therefore, no compelling reason to confine the <em>Asherman </em>and <em>Person </em>principle to mental state issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Moreover, those cases ar e not limited to mental state issues because they are consistent with the fundamental principles underlying the purposes of instructing the jury \u2014 \u201cto assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find to be established . . . [and] to call the attention of the members of the jury, unfamiliar with legal distinctions, to whatever is necessary and proper to guide them to a right decision in aparticular case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marte omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 510, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995). It is axiomatic that, in finding those facts to which it is correct to apply the law so as to reach a right decision in a case, the jury is required to take into account all of the evidence presented to it. If the court were to be precluded from instructing the jury on an affirmative defense that the evidence supports, solely because the defendant objects thereto, then the court would be required: (1) to direct the jury to take into account only <em>some, </em>but not all, of the evidence presented to it; (2) to assist the jury in applying the law <em>incorrectly, </em>rather than correctly, to the facts that the jury might find; and thus (3) to guide them to a <em>wrong, </em>rather than to a right, decision in the case. These precedents, in my view, rest on the notion that it is the juiy that is responsible for sifting through conflicting evidence and determining where the truth lies, and that process should not be distorted by the trial court\u2019s own view of the evidence or by the strategic choices made by either the state or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>This brings me, then, to the more fundamental reasons why the trial court was correct in instructing the jury on the affirmative defense, despite the defendant\u2019s objection. The purpose of the criminal trial process is to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>231 Conn. 195, 212, 647 A.2d 342 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1099, 115 S. Ct. 770, 130 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1995). It is not a game of sport. Although both the state and the defendant are entitled to make their strategic choices in how they present their cases or defenses, including how they argue their cases to the jury, there is nothing in law, policy or reason requiring that, when the case is ultimately presented to the jury by the court, a rule of law that is called to the court\u2019s attention and that otherwise applies to the facts of the case, as disclosed by the evidence, must nonetheless yield to those strategic choices. To hold otherwise would be to distort the fact-finding process, to permit strategy to trump law, and to make sport prevail over the purpose of the trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b138-6\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">concurring and dissenting. The majority opinion leaves open the issue of whether the state can foist an affirmative defense upon a defendant, the very assertion of which implicates him in the crime, when his defense is mere presence (that is, he was present at the scene but did not participate in the commission of the crime). I would reach that issue because, in my view, having allowed the state to argue that the defendant failed to prove an affirmative defense that he did not assert, combined with the trial court\u2019s instruction on that affirmative defense, created a highly prejudicial situation requiring that we grant the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In this case, the defendant, Anthony Small, testified that he was at the scene when the victims were shot, but he denied participating in the incident. At the request of the state, and over the objection of the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>trial court instructed the jury on the affirmative defense to felony murder \u2014 that is, in this case, although the deaths occurred during the commission of a robbery, the defendant \u201c(1) [d]id not commit the homicidal act[s] or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (2) was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any dangerous instrument; and (3) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon or instrument; and (4) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The entire scenario in which this affirmative defense was played out before the jury was highly prejudicial. The state\u2019s strategy was to make it appear that the defendant\u2019s defense to the felony murders was not that he did not participate in the robbery, the underlying crime for the felony murders, but that he relied upon the affirmative defense to felony murder for which he had the burden of proof. The state could then argue to the jury, as it did, that although the defendant relied on the affirmative defense, he did not sustain his burden of proving that defense, a defense the defendant never asserted in the first place. This strategy enabled the state to gain the tactical advantage of placing the defendant in the light of having participated in the robbery, but that he was seeking to avoid the consequences of the deaths that resulted by asserting the affirmative defense. And, of course, the affirmative defense would fail by necessity because there was insufficient evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">I realize that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 729-33, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985), this court held, over the objection of the defendant, that if there was sufficient evidence to support a less culpable mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>state, the trial court, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s objection, could instruct the jury on a crime supported by that mental state. In <em>Asherman, </em>that less culpable mental state was not an affirmative defense, but, rather, it was a lesser included offense. Instructing on a lesser included offense, for which the state has the burden of proof, is a far cry from instructing on an affirmative defense for which the defendant carries the burden. Instructing on such an affirmative defense implants in the minds of the jurors that the defendant committed the underlying crime \u2014 in this case robbery \u2014 but sought to avoid the consequences that would result from felony murder. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>968 F.2d 208, 213-14 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 964, 113 S. Ct. 436, 121 L. Ed. 2d 355 (1992) (\u201c[A]n affirmative defense may not, in operation, negate an element of the crime which the government is required to prove; otherwise, there would be too great a risk that a jury, by placing undue emphasis on the affirmative defense, might presume that the government had already met its burden of proof. Such a presumption would, without question, violate due process.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In my view, the giving of an instruction on an affirmative defense over the objection of the defendant requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Furthermore, seeking such an instruction is an unfair tactic employed by the state that this court should not condone.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">I agree with part I of the majority opinion that felony murder cannot be a predicate for a capital felony conviction. I dissent with respect to part II and would reverse the conviction and order a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\"> In his concurring opinion, Justice Borden relies on <em>Asherman </em>to support the conclusion that the jury can be instructed on an affirmative defense with respect to felony murder, without the defense being sought by the defendant. <em>Asherman, </em>however, clearly draws the same distinction between an affirmative defense and a lesser included offense, as I do in this opinion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 731 (\u201cUnder General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (2) manslaughter predicated on the mitigating circumstance of extreme emotional disturbance is a lesser included offense of murder. . . . Under [General Statutes (Rev. to 1983)] \u00a7 53a-45 (c) the \u2018jury before which any person indicted for murder is tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u2019 It follows that in any murder prosecution the issue of the lesser included offense of manslaughter under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (2) may be raised either by the <em>defendant </em>by way of an affirmative defense <em>or </em>by the <em>state </em>where it is warranted by the evidence.\u201d [Citation omitted; emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Justice Borden also relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>236 Conn. 342, 673 A.2d 463 (1996), to support his claim that it is proper for a trial judge to instruct the jury on an affirmative defense over the objection of the defendant. That reliance ignores the important distinction that in <em>Person </em>it was the defendant who requested the instruction on the inconsistent defense. Id., 344.</p>\n<p id=\"AKv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In addition, the majority, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 579, 620 A.2d 1064 (1992), concludes that even if the trial court, impntjterly instructed the jury on the affirmative defense to felony murder, that instruction was harmless because \u201c[o]nly after [the jury] had confronted the difficult task of resolving the issues surrounding the defendant\u2019s complicity in the robbery could the jury have moved on to the task of deciding whether [the defendant] had satisfied the requirements of the affirmative defense [to felony murder].\u201d In <em>Sawyer, </em>this court held that a jury must be instructed to first confront and unanimously complete the task of deciding the guilt or innocence of the defendant with respect to the charged offense before it, can consider any lesser included offenses that the trial court, offers in its instructions. Id., 583. The majority, however, also commits the error of not distinguishing' between lesser included offenses and affirmative defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b141-7\">MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJC\">concurring and dissenting. I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that, in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 699 A.2d 57 (1997), and State v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 681 A.2d 944 (1996), the defendant, Anthony Small, must be acquitted of capital felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I do so for the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In this case, there is no crime of arson murder, which may be punished by life imprisonment without parole and may be proved by reckless conduct, as in <em>Harrell. </em>Here, also, the jury did not impose the death penalty, which further distinguishes this case from <em>[Jarrell. </em>This case does involve an attempted robbery by drug dealers armed with machine guns forcibly taking cocaine from other drug dealers. The result was that two people were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>murdered in their home. The evidence showed that the defendant was then armed with an Uzi, a handheld machine gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The question here presented is whether a person who participates in a dangerous or violent felony resulting in multiple deaths may suffer the penalty for capital felony. I see no reason why this court should alter the plain intent of the General Assembly to impose greater penalties than those available for murder when two or more persons are murdered at the same time or in the course of a single transaction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">As in <em>Johnson, </em>the majority in this case, I regret to say, ignores reality and the need for public security. This decision forbids the imposition in the future of a life sentence without parole for monstrous crimes because killers and the other participants had other crimes as their objective when they killed multiple victims or participated in dangerous criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">I respectfully dissent from part I of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">I concur with Justice Borden and the majority in part II of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The jury instruction on mere presence is the mirror of the instruction given here that the state must prove that the defendant had the requisite intent in order to be convicted as an accessory under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8. The law of accessorial liability under \u00a7 53a-8 applied here to a finding of guilt as to the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>felony, one element of felony murder. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. The felony murder statute itself, however, establishes a distinct principle of accessorial liability for murder on the part of participants who did not themselves cause the death of someone during commission of the underlying felony, and it does so apart from \u00a7 53a-8. The felony murder statute also establishes a distinct defense that the defendant must prove and that requires proof of four elements not found within the concept of mere presence. Instructing a jury, with respect to felony murder, that mere presence is not sufficient to convict fails to inform the jury as to the affirmative defense distinctly applicable to felony murder. Since the defendant here requested and received the benefit of the mere presence instruction as to the underlying felony, the court was correct in further instructing the jury as to the distinct accessorial defense applicable to felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">I should add that I also agree with the majority that in these circumstances the charge did the defendant no harm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\"> I agree with and join in pints III, IV, V and VI of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\"> The deaths of three guards during an armed robbery of an armored truck was the catalyst for the enactment of the multiple murder capital felony statute. 23 S.
