On February 21, 1992, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the two year period of limitations in \u00a7 52-584, because the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence action was not brought until more than five and one-half years after the alleged injuries were sustained. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment thereon, and the Appellate Court affirmed. <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>42 Conn. App. 324, 679 A.2d 397 (1996). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the class action statute of limitations tolling rule, as articulated in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538 [94 S. Ct. 756,38 L. Ed. 2d 713] (1973), and its progeny, did not apply so as to toll the statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 class action claims?\u201d <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>239 Conn. 918, 682 A.2d 1000 (1996). We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 10, 1981, six Elm Haven tenants filed a class action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on behalf of all Elm Haven tenants against the defendant, the owner and operator of the apartment complex, the basis of which formed this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>213 Conn. 354, 567 A.2d 1212 (1990). The plaintiffs in <em>Connelly (Connelly </em>plaintiffs) alleged that the defendant violated General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Haven housing code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by failing to provide sufficient and stable heat and hot water for the tenants. In count one of the <em>Connelly </em>complaint, the tenants alleged that \u201c[a]s a result of the insufficient and erratic heat and hot water, [the] plaintiffs and their families have been subjected to unsanitary and unsafe conditions which materially affect their health and well-being.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a temporary injunction to compel the defendant to make immediate repairs to the heating and hot water systems, and in the form of compensatory damages for the named plaintiffs and for the class. The defendant did not seek revision of the complaint to require the plaintiffs to particularize the damages the lack of hot water caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">On December 22, 1981, the trial court in <em>Connelly </em>ordered that this \u201caction <em>provisionally </em>be allowed to be maintained as a class action for all of the tenants in the buildings of New Haven Housing Authority collectively known as Elm Haven High Rises\u201d and issued a temporary injunction ordering the defendant to make immediate repairs to restore heat and hot water to the tenants\u2019 apartments. (Emphasis added.) The trial court did not set inclusive dates with respect to the tenants who were covered under the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>On September 4, 1982, the plaintiffs in this case were injured as a result of the defendant\u2019s failure to provide hot water in violation of \u00a7 47a-7 (a) and paragraph 300 of the New Haven housing code. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that \u201c[o]n September 4, [1982] Delores Grimes [a seven year old child] attempted to remove a pot containing hot water from the stove, in order to take it into the bathroom for the bath .... The hot water spilled onto [the] plaintiff Delores Grimes . . . [who] suffered serious permanent injuries, which have caused her and will continue to cause her pain, suffering, [and] distress, including: second and third degree burns covering approximately 22 percent of her total body area, including third degree burns over the anterior thighs, lower abdomen and vulva requiring multiple skin grafts and causing permanent scarring .... [The p]laintiff Ethel Grimes saw [the] plaintiff Delores Grimes seconds after she had been scalded, and as a result of seeing her daughter\u2019s injuries suffered and will continue to suffer anxiety and distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In January, 1987, the trial court in <em>Connelly </em>limited the class to those tenants who resided at Elm Haven between November 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, and who lacked adequate heat and hot water in their apartments. The establishment of this time frame had the effect of excluding the plaintiffs here with respect to the injuries they sustained as a result of the incident on September 4, 1982. On March 11, 1988, the plaintiffs commenced this action, less than fifteen months after they were ousted from the <em>Connelly </em>class. On May 22, 1995, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that their claims were barred by the two year statute oflimitations for personal injury actions in \u00a7 52-584. In granting the motion, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ages for personal injuries was not directly related to the cause of action asserted in the <em>Connelly </em>class action. The Appellate Court affirmed, concluding that \u201cthe claims raised in the class action that the defendant violated \u00a7 47a-7 ... did not provide notice to the defendant that negligence claims were being made by the [named] plaintiff and her daughter for personal injuries. . . <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 330. More specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that the statute of limitations was not tolled because the \u201ctolling effect given to the timely prior filings in <em>[American Pipe &amp; Construction Co.] . . . </em>depended heavily on the fact that those findings involved exactly the same cause of action subsequently asserted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 329-30. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the tolling rule for class actions announced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>supra, 414 U.S. 538, should be adopted in Connecticut. In response, the defendant argues that because Connecticut class action rules are not identical to the federal rules, the <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>rule should be rejected. Although this court previously has not had the occasion to consider this rule,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>adopt the rule set forth in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>with respect to the tolling of statute of limitations for the purported members of a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co., </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe commencement of a class action <em>suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class </em>who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 554. In that case, the court approved the intervention of third parties on whose claims the statute of limitations would otherwise have run.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>If </em>the statute of limitations is not tolled by the filing of the class action, \u201cclass members would not be able to rely on the existence of the suit to protect their rights. ... A putative class member who fears that class certification may be denied would have every incentive to file a separate action prior to the expiration of his own period of limitations. The result would be a needless multiplicity of actions \u2014 precisely the situation that [rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] and the tolling rule of <em>[American Pipe &amp; Construction Co.] </em>were designed to avoid.\u201d <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>462 U.S. 345, 350-51, 103 S. Ct. 2392, 76 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1983). Potential class members should not be induced to \u201cfile protective motions to intervene or to join [a class action] in the event that a class was later found unsuitable.\u201d <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>supra, 414 U.S. 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Connecticut\u2019s class action procedures in Practice Book \u00a7 86 et seq., like rule 23, are designed to increase efficiencies in civil litigation by encouraging multiple plaintiffs to join in one lawsuit. Many jurisdictions have recognized that in certain situations, class action suits are superior to individual lawsuits. See, e.g., <em>Deposit Guaranty National Bank of Jackson, Mississippi </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 338-40, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1980); <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Amrep Corp., </em>429 F. Sup. 313, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 1977); <em>In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litigation, </em>73 F.R.D. 322, 358 (E.D. Pa. 1976); <em>In re Ampicillin Antitrust Litigation, </em>55 F.R.D. 269, 276 (D.D.C. 1972); <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>American Oil Co., </em>53 F.R.D. 45, 68 (D.N.J. 1971); <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>44 F.R.D. 559, 572 (D. Minn 1968); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 357, 370, 423 A.2d 900 (1980). Class action suits: (1) promote judicial economy and efficiency; (2) protect defendants from inconsistent obligations; (3) protect the interests of absentee parties; and (4) provide access to judicial relief for small claimants. H. Newberg, Class Actions (3d Ed. 1992) \u00a7 1.06, p. 1-20; see also <em>United States Parole Commission </em>v. <em>Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 402-403, 100 S. Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We thus conclude that the <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>tolling rule that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action as originally brought is the rule most consistent with Connecticut class action procedure. Accordingly, we adopt that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">We next consider whether the <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>rule applies to toll the commencement of the two year statute of limitations for the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>negligence action from September 3, 1982, to January, 1987, the date the <em>Connelly </em>class was certified.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That rule, consistent with the functional operation of a statute of limitations, is limited in order to ensure essential fairness to defendants by barring a plaintiff who \u201chas slept on his rights.\u201d <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>New York Central R. Co., </em>380 U.S. 424, 428, 85 S. Ct. 1050, 13 L. Ed. 2d 941 (1965). The rule is designed to prevent \u201csurprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>supra, 414 U.S. 554; <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Margiotta, </em>811 F.2d 698, 720 (2d Cir. 1987). Even if a plaintiff has a just claim, it is unjust not to put the defendant on notice within the limitations period. <em>Order of Railroad Telegraphers </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>321 U.S. 342, 348-49, 64 S. Ct. 582, 88 L. Ed. 788 (1944). This essential point, that the defendant be put on notice, is generally fulfilled where a prior class action alerts a defendant to preserve evidence that would be helpful in defending against a subsequent individual claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In order to satisfy the notice requirement, the <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>rule can be applied only in those situations where the class action has \u201cnotifie[d] the defendants ... of the substantive claims being brought against them [and] of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.\u201d <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>supra, 414 U.S. 555. The defendant argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the first prong of the tolling rale was not met because the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is not the same as that in the class action, and the second prong was not met because the plaintiffs were not generally identified as potential class members in the <em>Connelly </em>complaint. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The defendant argues that the <em>Connelly </em>complaint did not provide it with notice of the substantive claims filed by the plaintiffs here because the <em>Connelly </em>complaint did not involve \u201cexactly the same cause of action subsequently asserted.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 467, 95 S. Ct. 1716, 44 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1975). Because the plaintiffs base their complaint on a negligence theory, and the <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs base their complaint on statutory and code violations, the defendant concludes that the plaintiffs here have asserted a different cause of action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">It is correct, as the plaintiffs concede, that the complaint in this case is predicated on a different legal theory. In this case, the plaintiffs seek damages based on the defendant\u2019s negligence. In <em>Connelly, </em>the plaintiffs sought damages and other relief based upon the defendant\u2019s continuing violation of \u00a7 47a-7 (a) and the New Haven housing code. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit addressed this precise issue in <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Margiotta, </em>supra, 811 F.2d 719, when it held, \u201cwe do not regard the fact that the state court action was premised on different legal theories as a reason not to apply <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>tolling to save the claims of class members who were not named plaintiffs in the state court action. It is not a flaw under that doctrine that the first action did not alert the defendant to have its lawyers research the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>applicability of a particular statute or rule of common law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In <em>Cullen, </em>the court reasoned that it would be inconsistent with the underlying policy of <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>to decide that a change of legal theory amounts to a lack of notice that would bar application of the class action tolling rule. Such a limitation would \u201cencourage and require absent class members to file protective motions to intervene and assert their new legal theories prior to class certification . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 721. Connecticut\u2019s class action procedures, however, are designed to prevent the proliferation of lawsuits, and duplicative efforts and expenses. The extent of proliferation and duplication problems in this case is illustrated by the fact that every one of the hundreds of tenants of Elm Haven would have needed to file separate actions or motions to intervene to protect his or her rights in the event the trial court did not finally certify the <em>Connelly </em>action as a class action, or in the event the court excluded them from the certified class.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In both the <em>Connelly </em>class action and the present case, the facts relating to the defendant\u2019s conduct and the establishment of the breach of duty are the same. The <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in this case had a right to services, including reasonable amounts of hot water at all times, and reasonable heat. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a); paragraph 300 of the New Haven housing code. Both alleged that they suffered harm as a result of the defendant\u2019s continuing failure to provide sufficient and stable hot water for its tenants. Presumably, the plaintiffs will probably attempt to show at trial that the violation of statutorily prescribed duties under \u00a7 4-7a-7 (a) and paragraph 300 of the New Haven housing code constituted negligence per se.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Likewise, the <em>Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>nelly </em>plaintiffs will probably attempt to show that their injuries arose in part out of the failure to supply hot water pursuant to \u00a7 47a-7 (a) and paragraph 300 of the New Haven housing code. Because the plaintiffs did not present the defendant with an \u201c \u2018entirely new and different factual situation\u2019 <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 71-72, 546 A.2d 846 (1988); the defendant was put on notice by the <em>Connelly </em>complaint of the nature of the evidence that would be needed at the plaintiffs\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Our state law with respect to relation back theory supports the Second Circuit\u2019s view that changes in legal theories do not create different causes of action. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Margiotta, </em>supra, 811 F.2d 720-21. A long-standing principle in Connecticut is that \u201c[a] right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action.\u201d <em>Pavelka </em>v. <em>St. Albert Society Branch No. 30, </em>82 Conn. 146, 147, 72 A. 725 (1909). This court has also held for relation back purposes that \u201c [a] change in, or an addition to, a ground of negligence or an act of negligence arising out of the single group of facts which was originally claimed to have brought about the unlawful injury to the plaintiff [as is alleged in this case] does not change the cause of action. . . . It is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action, provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 71-72. Because the identity of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action remains sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>stantially the same as the <em>Connelly </em>cause of action arising out of the fact that the defendant failed to supply hot water, which it was obligated to supply, it is proper for the plaintiffs to amplify the allegations in the <em>Connelly </em>complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The defendant also argues that the <em>Connelly </em>complaint did not put it on notice of the remedy being sought by the plaintiffs in this case. Notwithstanding the well settled law with respect to the broad construction of pleadings, the defendant asserts that the <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs did not seek compensatory relief for the injuries caused by the defendant\u2019s alleged statutory and municipal code violations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201c [T]he interpretation of pleadings is always a question of law for the court . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Geren </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>36 Conn. App. 282, 290, 650 A.2d 616 (1994), cert. denied, 232 Conn. 907, 653 A.2d 194 (1995). \u201cThe modem trend, which is followed in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and <em>realistically, </em>rather than narrowly and technically.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Town Oil Co., </em>207 Conn. 575, 587-88, 542 A.2d 1124 (1988). \u201cAs long as the pleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or prejudice the opposing party, we will not conclude that the complaint is insufficient . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Tardif </em>240 Conn. 610, 620, 692 A.2d 1266 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Our review of the pleadings reveals that the <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs sought more than mere injunctive relief for the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 47a-7 (a) and the New Haven housing code. Paragraph eight of count one of the <em>Connelly </em>complaint provides in part: \u201cThe named plaintiffs, in addition to maintaining this action on their own behalf, seek to maintain this action for injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and ancillary relief on behalf of all tenants who reside in the buildings owned and operated by the defendant . . . .\u201d More importantly, in the <em>Connelly </em>prayer for relief, the plaintiffs specifically claimed \u201ccompensatory damages for the named plaintiffs and for the class,\u201d the same relief claimed by the plaintiffs in this case. It has long been recognized that \u201c[g]eneral damages, which are such as the law presumes from the wrong complained of, need not be specially pleaded, because the law presumes them . . . .\u201d <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>24 Conn. 392, 404 (1856). Indeed, personal injury damages are presumed from paragraph eighteen, count one, of the <em>Connelly </em>complaint which alleges: \u201cAs a result of the insufficient and erratic heat and hot water, plaintiffs and their families have been subjected to unsanitary and unsafe conditions which materially affect their health and well-being.\u201d It is incongruous then for the defendant to suggest that the <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs did not seek compensatory damages when they specifically pleaded that class members had suffered some form of personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Furthermore, events subsequent to the filing of the <em>Connelly </em>complaint provided the defendant with further notice that some of the plaintiffs in the <em>Connelly </em>class would present damage claims for personal injuries resulting from the lack of hot water in their apartments. After counsel for the class stated at the preliminary injunction hearing on December 18, 1981, that his clients were concerned that children were being put in danger because families had to resort to boiling water in order to take baths, the defendant should have been able to foresee that one or more of the <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs, like the named plaintiff here, would sustain severe burns from boiling hot water. The fact that the named plaintiffs previously described injuries \u201cmay be more or less extensive than that of some of the class members is not sufficient to make [their] claims \u2018markedly differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ent\u2019 from that of the class.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 36 Conn. Sup. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Moreover, the defendant should not be heard to complain that it was not put on notice when it failed to take any action between December, 1981, and January, 1987, to narrow the broad pleadings in <em>Connelly </em>that sought damages for individual members of the class, who, as a result of the lack of hot water, were \u201csubjected to . . . unsafe conditions which materially affect their health and well-being.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Simply put, it was the defendant who \u201chas slept on [its] rights.\u201d <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>New York Central R. Co., </em>supra, 380 U.S. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Furthermore, in January, 1987, the defendant stipulated to a court-ordered class notice that informed potential class members: \u201cYou have a right to be included in this lawsuit if you . . . believe you suffered <em>damages </em>because the Housing Authority did not provide you with adequate heat or hot water . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) The notice further stated that if the defendant was found liable for damages, each class member would have \u201ca separate hearing to determine what <em>damages </em>would be awarded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, when the class was certified, the defendant recognized that individual class members would seek damages for personal injuries suffered as a result of its failure to provide adequate hot water.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We share the Appellate Court\u2019s concern that we must make \u201ccertain that <em>[American Pipe &amp; Construction Co.] </em>is not abused by the assertion of claims that differ from those raised in the original class suit.\u201d <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 330, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 355 (Powell, J., concurring). Nevertheless, we conclude that the <em>Connelly </em>complaint, construed broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically; <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Town Oil Co., </em>supra, 207 Conn. 587-88; provided the defendant with adequate notice that a potential class member could make damage claims for a serious personal injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s continuing failure to provide sufficient hot water. Subsequent events should have made it sufficiently clear for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The defendant also claims that the <em>Connelly </em>complaint never put it on notice that the plaintiffs here were potential class members because the complaint did not refer to residents of the plaintiffs\u2019 apartment building. It is evident from the record that the omission of the street address of the plaintiffs\u2019 apartment, 250 Ashmun Street, from the complaint, does not alter the fact that the plaintiffs were tenants of one of the Elm Haven apartments generally referred to in the complaint. Moreover, the trial court issued an oral order at the hearing on the temporary injunction in <em>Connelly </em>that provisionally included tenants of the building at 250 Ashmun Street as class members without limitation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> From the outset, the defendant had the essential information necessary to determine that the plaintiffs were potential class members \u2014 a list of the names and addresses of all tenants of Elm Haven, including the plaintiffs. Furthermore, the defendant had the essential information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>necessary to know the particular identity of the plaintiffs after a Yale-New Haven Hospital social worker informed the defendant of the nature and cause of the named plaintiff s injuries as early as September 14,1982, ten days after she was seriously injured by the scalding water.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The defendant further argues that the plaintiffs were never members of the <em>Connelly </em>class because their injuries occurred nine months after the <em>Connelly </em>complaint was filed. Its argument is premised on the mistaken belief that the <em>Connelly </em>plaintiffs limited their allegations to statutory and ordinance violations fixed in time. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s belief, the <em>Connelly </em>complaint attempted to address present and future harm caused by the defendant\u2019s continuing failure to supply sufficient hot water. Specifically, the <em>Connelly </em>complaint stated that the defendant had failed, in violation of \u00a7 47a-7 (a), and the New Haven housing code, to make necessary repairs to the hot water systems at the Elm Haven apartments. The complaint further alleged that by <em>remaining </em>in a state of disrepair, the defendant\u2019s buildings posed risks to the health and well-being of class members. Finally, the complaint alleged in count two that by <em>continuing </em>to rent apartments that lack sufficient heat and hot water to the plaintiffs, the defendant was violating General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, even though the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were sustained nine months after the <em>Connelly </em>complaint was filed, their injuries arose out of the same group of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>facts as alleged in the <em>Connelly </em>complaint, namely, the defendant\u2019s ongoing violations of \u00a7 47a-7 (a) and the New Haven housing code.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Finally, tolling the statute of limitations in this case is consistent with the rationale of the rule in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>The court in that case explained that rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not designed to limit class action representation to those who are active participants in the litigation, or to those who are aware of the proceedings. <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>supra, 414 U.S. 551-52. During the pendency of the trial court\u2019s determination whether to certify the class, \u201cpotential class members are mere passive beneficiaries of the action brought in their behalf.\u201d Id., 552. Although not necessary under <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co., </em>Ethel Grimes considered herself a class member, and looked to the <em>Connelly </em>action to protect her rights. She testified at her deposition that she did not file an individual action after her child Delores was injured because she was aware of the <em>Connelly </em>action and believed she had \u201csigned up\u201d to be a class member.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As potential class members, the plaintiffs had no \u201cduty to take note of the suit or to exercise any responsibility with respect to it in order to profit from the eventual outcome of the case,\u201d until the \u201cexistence and limits of the class have been established and notice of mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>bership has been sent.\u201d Id. Once the class was certified in January, 1987, the plaintiffs did not \u201csleep on their rights,\u201d but, rather, exercised their responsibility by filing their complaint in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and this case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-584 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo action to recover damages for injury to the person . . . caused by negligence . . . shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em> </em>Many of these fads are reproduced in <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>213 Conn. 354, 567 A.2d 1212 (1990) (holding that trial court properly dismissed count two of class action complaint because municipal housing authority is exempted from liability under Connecticut.
