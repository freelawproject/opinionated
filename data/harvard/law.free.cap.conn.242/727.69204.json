J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdB\">The defendant, the town of West Hartford (town), appeals from the judgment of the trial court reducing the tax assessments levied upon the real property of the plaintiff, Simon Konover, on the grand lists of 1993, 1994 and 1995. The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly refused to include, in its determination of the fair market value of the plaintiffs property, the value of a portion of the property that the town\u2019s assessor mistakenly had failed to include in her valuation during the decennial revaluation of 1989. We conclude that, to determine whether the plaintiffs property had been overassessed, the trial court should have considered the value of the omitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>portion of the property in its calculation of the total fair market value of the property. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The record reveals the following facts. The plaintiff is the fee owner of an improved parcel of land located at 2410 Albany Avenue in the town of West Hartford. The property consists of land and an office building. The plaintiff purchased the property in 1972, and uses it as the headquarters for his real estate development business. When the plaintiff purchased the property, its southwest corner extended to a public highway known as Shawmet Road. At that time, Shawmet Road was a dead end road that extended from Albany Avenue into the plaintiffs property and the adjoining property to the west of the plaintiffs property, which is currently owned by an entity known as Colonial Health Care Limited Partnership (Colonial). Shawmet Road served as an access road to the property of both the plaintiff and Colonial. The paved portion of the road was approximately twenty feet wide and 270 feet long. Shawmet Road had existed as a public highway since it was accepted by the town in 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Following the 1989 decennial revaluation, the assessor determined the total area of the plaintiffs property to be 49,121 square feet and its fair market value to be $1,497,000. On the October 1, 1993 grand list, the assessor assessed the property in accordance with the 1989 valuation. The plaintiff, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-111,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appealed the assessment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>board of tax review for the town of West Hartford (board), which declined to reduce the assessment. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The case was tried to the court. During the trial, both the plaintiff and the town presented the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>experts who had appraised the property. It was the opinion of the town\u2019s expert, Edgar B. French, that, at the time of the 1989 decennial revaluation, the fair market value of the plaintiffs property was $1,550,000. The principal reason for the disparity between French\u2019s valuation and the assessor\u2019s 1989 valuation was that, during the course of his appraisal, French had discovered that in 1984, at the request of the plaintiff and Colonial\u2019s predecessor, the town council of West Hartford had passed a resolution, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> discontinuing Shawmet Road as a public highway. As a result of the town\u2019s discontinuance of Shawmet Road, approximately 8987 square feet of land owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>by the plaintiff, and occupied by one half of Shawmet Road, had been discharged of the easement that had existed for a public highway since 1928. In addition, French discovered that the town\u2019s discontinuance of Shawmet Road had freed of the public easement the portion of the land occupied by Shawmet Road that was owned by Colonial\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Shortly after the town\u2019s discontinuance of Shawmet Road, the plaintiff and Colonial\u2019s predecessor deeded each other cross easements over their respective portions of the land formerly occupied by Shawmet Road. Pursuant to the easement agreement, the plaintiff granted Colonial\u2019s predecessor a private easement over the 8987 square feet of land owned by the plaintiff that had been discontinued as a public highway. Similarly, Colonial\u2019s predecessor granted the plaintiff a private easement over the area of land owned by Colonial\u2019s predecessor that had been freed of the public easement. In the easement agreement, the portion of the land formerly occupied by Shawmet Road that was owned by the plaintiff was referred to as easement area B, and the portion that was owned by Colonial\u2019s predecessor was referred to as easement area A. For purposes of clarity, hereinafter, we will refer to these respective areas as either easement area B. or easement area A. The plaintiff and Colonial currently use the two areas as a driveway and parking lot. Easement area B comprises approximately 15 percent of the total land area of the plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">When the assessor valued the plaintiffs property at the time of the 1989 revaluation, the assessor was not aware of the town\u2019s 1984 discontinuance of Shawmet Road, or of the easement agreement between the plaintiff and Colonial\u2019s predecessor. As a result, the assessor valued the plaintiffs property on the basis of the configuration of the property prior to the discontinuance of Shawmet Road. In other words, in valuing the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>at $1,497,000, the assessor did not include any value for easement area B, although in 1989 that area belonged to the plaintiff free of the public easement, the reason being that the assessment map and property record cards used by the assessor for purposes of the 1989 valuation failed to disclose the town\u2019s 1984 discontinuance of Shawmet Road as a public highway. According to the assessment map and the property record cards extant in 1989, the total land area of the plaintiffs property amounted to only 49,121 square feet. Indeed, the assessor became aware of the discontinuance of Shaw-met Road only during the course of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In determining the total fair market value of the plaintiffs property, French included an estimate of the value of easement area B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> French arrived at that value by multiplying the square footage of the land by what he determined to be the fair market value per square foot of land in the area of West Hartford in which the property was located. He determined that value to be $15.11 per square foot. He then concluded that the value of the 8987 square feet of land comprising easement area B was $135,794 (8987 square feet x $15.11 per square foot = $135,793.57). He testified that the total land area of the plaintiffs property, including the 8987 square feet of the discontinued highway, was 58,108 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The plaintiffs expert, Edward F. Heberger, testified that in his opinion the fair market value of the plaintiffs property at the time of the 1989 decennial revaluation was $1,200,000. In making this determination, Heberger operated on the belief that the total land area of the property in 1989 amounted to 49,121 square feet. Thus, in valuing the property, Heberger, like the assessor in 1989, did not include any value for easement area B.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The trial court, after hearing all the evidence, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court determined that the fair market value of the plaintiffs property was $1,300,000, and ordered the assessor to reduce the plaintiffs assessments accordingly. In determining the fair market value of the plaintiffs property, the court refused to consider any value for easement area B. The town appealed from the judgment of the trial corut to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The principal issue presented is a question of first impression, the resolution of which requires us first to clarify the function of the trial court in a \u00a7 12-117a appeal. Section 12-117a, which allows taxpayers to appeal the decisions of municipal boards of tax review to the Superior Court, \u201c \u2018provide[s] a method by which an owner of property may directly call in question the valuation placed by assessors upon his property .'. . \u201d <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>220 Conn. 335, 339, 597 A.2d 326 (1991); <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 650, 563 A.2d 688 (1989); see also <em>E. Ingraham Co. </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>146 Conn. 403, 408-409, 151 A.2d 700 (1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 929, 80 S. Ct. 367, 4 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1960); <em>Cooley Chevrolet Co. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>146 Conn. 165, 166, 148 A.2d 327 (1959). In a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, the trial court performs a two step function. \u201cThe burden, in the first instance, is upon the plaintiff to show that he has, in fact, been aggrieved by the action of the board in that his property has been overassessed.\u201d <em>Gorin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>178 Conn. 606, 608, 424 A.2d 282 (1979); <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>169 Conn. 129, 131, 362 A.2d 914 (1975). In this regard, \u201c \u2018[m]ere overvaluation is sufficient to justify redress under [\u00a7 12-117a], and the court is not limited to a review of whether an assessment has been unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>able or discriminatory or has resulted in substantial overvaluation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>226 Conn. 92, 104, 626 A.2d 1292 (1993); <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 130-31; see also <em>Hutensky v. Avon, </em>163 Conn. 433, 436-37, 311 A.2d 92 (1972). \u201cWhether a property has been overvalued for tax assessment purposes is a question of fact for the trier.\u201d <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 104. \u201cThe trier arrives at his own conclusions as to the value of land by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value including his own view of the property.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Only after the court determines that the taxpayer has met his burden of proving that the assessor\u2019s valuation was excessive and that the refusal of the board of tax review to alter the assessment was improper, however, may the court then proceed to the second step in a \u00a7 12-117a appeal and exercise its equitable power to \u201cgrant such relief as to justice and equity appertains . . . .\u201d See <em>Gorin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 608; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 131; see also <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 104; <em>Hutensky </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>supra, 163 Conn. 436-37; <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>158 Conn. 138, 148, 256 A.2d 234 (1969); <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>146 Conn. 578, 585, 153 A.2d 420 (1959); <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>99 Conn. 329, 332-33, 122 A. 91 (1923); <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Goshen, </em>65 Conn. 456, 459-60, 32 A. 932 (1895). \u201cIf a taxpayer is found to be aggrieved by the decision of the board of tax review, the court tries the matter de novo and the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the applicant\u2019s property.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>supra, 131. \u201cIf the court finds that the property has been in fact overvalued, it has the power to, and should, correct the valuation.\u201d <em>Hutensky </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>supra, 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Section 12-117a provides a remedy only for an aggrieved taxpayer seeking to reduce his tax assessment. It provides no remedy for a municipality claiming to have undervalued a taxpayer\u2019s property. See <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>44 Conn. App. 494, 497-98, 690 A.2d 405 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The first step that the trial court should have taken in deciding the plaintiffs appeal, therefore, was to determine whether the plaintiff was aggrieved by the decision of the board, on the grounds that his property had been overassessed and the board improperly had refused to reduce the assessments. In making that determination, it was necessary for the trial court to arrive at a preliminary conclusion concerning the fair market value of the plaintiffs property. The question of whether the total land area of the plaintiffs property on the valuation and assessment dates was 49,121 square feet or 58,108 square feet was a subsidiary fact question that was an essential predicate to the ultimate question of whether the plaintiffs property had been overassessed. It was also an issue that was not disputed by either party. Both the plaintiff and the town agreed that on the dates in question the total land area of the plaintiffs property, including easement area B, was 58,108 square feet, but that the area valued by the assessor in 1989 was only 49,121 square feet. Nevertheless, when valuing the property for the purpose of determining whether the plaintiff had been overassessed, the trial court refused to consider any value for easement area B.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">We conclude that the trial court, when determining whether the plaintiff had been overassessed pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, should have valued the plaintiffs property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>on the basis of the actual land area owned by the plaintiff on the date of valuation, rather than on the basis of an erroneous description of the property in the tax maps and property record cards in the possession of the assessor when she valued the property in 1989. By refusing to include any value for easement area B in its determination of the fair market value of the plaintiffs property, the trial court valued a fictional piece of property. Instead of determining whether the plaintiffs property, as it actually existed on the date of the revaluation, had been overassessed, the trial court, in effect, determined that only a part of the plaintiffs property had been overassessed. We have never held that a trial court in a de novo appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a may determine the value of only a portion of a taxpayer\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The plaintiff makes two alternative arguments in support of the trial court\u2019s approach in the present case, neither of which are persuasive. The plaintiff first claims, in essence, that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider easement area B when determining the fair market value of the plaintiffs property. Essentially, he argues that the assessor never assessed easement area B in the first instance because the tax maps and property record cards used by the assessor for valuation purposes in 1989 did not attribute the ownership of easement area B to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that because the assessor never assessed easement area B, and never raised the issue with the board, easement area B was not a part of the appeal filed by the plaintiff with the board. Furthermore, he contends that because \u00a7 12-117a limits the class of persons who may appeal from the board to the Superior Court to persons \u201caggrieved by the action of the board,\u201d and, because, according to the plaintiff, the board took no \u201caction\u201d with respect to easement area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>B, easement area B was not a part of the appeal filed by the plaintiff with the trial court. In addition, the plaintiff asserts that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-53<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 12-</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>60<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are the exclusive statutory means by which an assessor may revalue and reassess a taxpayer\u2019s property in the years between decennial revaluations. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>argues that the assessor\u2019s failure to utilize \u00a7\u00a7 12-53 and 12-60 precluded the trial court from considering easement area B when determining whether the plaintiff had been overassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The plaintiffs arguments misperceive the tax assessment process, the nature and scope of the trial court\u2019s review in a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, and the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. First, the plaintiffs argument places too much emphasis on the tax maps and property record cards in the possession of the assessor. The fact that the assessor, at the time of the valuation in 1989, did not realize, because of an error in her maps and records, that the property owned by the plaintiff and subject to taxation actually amounted to 58,108 square feet, not 49,121 square feet, does not mean that the assessor did not assess the property actually situated at 2410 Albany Avenue. Rather, the assessor simply failed to include easement area B in its valuation of 2410 Albany Avenue in the 1989 revaluation. Although that mistake may have resulted in an undervaluation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it did not deprive either the board or the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to consider easement area B when determining whether the plaintiffs property had been overassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. . . . A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. . . . It is a familiar principle that a court which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996). Section 12-117a empowers the trial court to hear and determine appeals by taxpayers claiming that their property has been overassessed. See footnote 2 of this opinion. As previously noted, the trial court\u2019s initial function in such an appeal is to determine whether the taxpayer is aggrieved by the board\u2019s action, on the grounds that the taxpayer has been overassessed and the board improperly has refused to reduce the assessment. See, e.g., <em>Gorin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 608. The scope of a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in such an appeal must encompass the power to consider any facts that are relevant to determining whether a taxpayer actually has been overassessed. Certainly, the presence of more land than had been valued in the revaluation was a factor to consider in making such a determination. The trial court, therefore, could consider the value of easement area B in determining whether the plaintiffs property had been overassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In addition, we note that the trial court\u2019s power to consider easement area B in determining whether the plaintiffs property had been overassessed was not affected by the fact that the assessor had not raised the question of easement area B at the hearing before the board. As we have stated on numerous occasions, in a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, the trial court tries the matter de novo. See, e.g., <em>Xerox Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>240 Conn. 192, 204, 690 A.2d 389 (1997). In a de novo proceeding, the trier of fact makes an independent determination of the matters on which the appeal was taken without regard for the action or decision of the lower tribunal. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Gorby, </em>237 Conn. 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>14, 16-17, 675 A.2d 449 (1996); <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>158 Conn. 286, 294, 259 A.2d 621 (1969); <em>Orange Street Armory Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>17 Conn. App. 166, 171, 551 A.2d 759 (1988). The question of whether the plaintiff had been overassessed was a question of fact to be determined de novo by the trial court. We do not agree with the plaintiff that in making that de novo determination the trial court was prevented from considering the value of easement area B simply because the issue had not been raised with the board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff was well aware when he appealed to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a that the proceeding would be de novo, and not based on any record of the proceedings before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Furthermore, we conclude that the assessor\u2019s failure to utilize \u00a7\u00a7 12-53 or 12-60 to alter the plaintiffs assessment did not affect the trial court\u2019s power to consider easement area B when determining whether the plaintiff had been overassessed. Even if we assume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>plaintiff is correct that \u00a7\u00a7 12-53 and 12-60 constitute the exclusive means by which an assessor may increase the valuation and assessment of a taxpayer\u2019s property between revaluations, permitting the trial court to consider the value of easement area B in determining whether the plaintiff has been overassessed is not equivalent to allowing the assessor to revalue and reassess the plaintiffs property pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-53 or 12-60. See footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion. Section 12-117a provides a remedy for a taxpayer who has been overassessed. If, after including the value of easement area B, the trial court determines that the plaintiff has not been overassessed and, thus, is not aggrieved by the action of the board in refusing to reduce the assessment, the trial court must dismiss the appeal. The court\u2019s judgment cannot result in an increase in the plaintiffs assessment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The plaintiff next argues, in the alternative, that if the trial court had the power to include the value of easement area B in its determination of the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property, \u00a7 12-117a mandates that such power was discretionary in nature. We disagree. When construing statutes, \u201cwe will avoid constructions that lead to absurd, unworkable or bizarre results.\u201d <em>In re Flanagan, </em>240 Conn. 157, 183, 690 A.2d 865 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>240 Conn. 727, 736-37, 694 A.2d 758 (1997). We conclude that such a construction of \u00a7 12-117a would lead to absurd and bizarre results and would be contrary to common sense and established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>precedent. In a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, \u201c \u2018the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the [taxpayer\u2019s] property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 104, quoting <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 131. If we were to accept the plaintiffs argument, essentially we would be validating a system in which trial courts would have the discretion to determine the true and actual value of hypothetical parcels of real estate that do not exist. For example, if the assessor\u2019s tax maps and records mistakenly had depicted the taxpayer\u2019s property as containing more square footage of land than the taxpayer, in reality, owned, the trial court, under the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 12-117a, would have the discretion to disregard reality and value the taxpayer\u2019s property on the basis of the erroneous tax maps. Such a result certainly would be inappropriate because the trial court\u2019s function in a \u00a7 12-117a appeal is to determine whether the taxpayer\u2019s existing property has been overassessed. Although \u00a7 12-117a provides the trial court with broad equitable powers to grant relief to a taxpayer once the court is persuaded that the taxpayer has carried his burden of proving that he has been overassessed; see, e.g., <em>Gorin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 608; \u00a7 12-117a does not provide the trial court with the discretion to ignore reality and to value the plaintiffs property on the basis of tax maps and records that obviously are incorrect. We conclude that the actual size of the taxpayer\u2019s property was a factor that should have been considered by the trial court in estimating its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court, when determining whether the plaintiff had been overassessed, should have considered the value of easement area B in its determination of the fair market value of the plaintiffs property.

That question of fact must be decided by the trial court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> The plaintiff does not dispute that the board, pursuant to \u00a7 12-111, had the power to consider easement area B when evaluating the plaintiffs appeal. Section 12-111 provides that \u201c[the] board may equalize and ac[just the valuations and assessment lists of such town and may increase the items of taxable property in the list of any person, or the number, quantity or amount of any such item, or add to any such list any taxable property or interest therein omitted by the assessors which should be added thereto . . . .\u201d Thus, if the assessor\u2019s mistake with respect to easement area B had been realized at the time the plaintiff appealed to the board, the board would have had the power, pursuant to \u00a7 12-111, to alter the valuation and assessment of the plaintiffs property accordingly. Given such a hypothetical scenario, in which the question of easement area B had been raised in the appeal to the board and the board either altered or declined to alter the assessment, the trial court, in deciding an appeal, would have the power to consider easement area B in determining whether the plaintiff had been overassessed. In such a scenario, according to the plaintiffs argument, the board would have taken \u201caction\u201d with respect to easement area B, therefore making easement area B part of the appeal to the trial court. It would contravene the concept of de novo review, however, to assert that the trial court\u2019s power to consider easement area B was dependent on whether easement area B had been raised before the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\"> Any concern that our decision might be construed to infringe upon the plaintiffs due process right t,o notice and a meaningful hearing before the board, we believe, is misplaced. After notice, affording the plaintiff a trial de novo would seem to alleviate any due process problem, particularly in view of the fact that, pursuant to our interpretation of \u00a7 12-117a, the trial court does not have the statutory authority to increase the taxpayer\u2019s assessment. The trial court, rather, simply determines whether the assessment of the taxpayer's property was excessive. In any event, the plaintiff did not brief a due process claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
