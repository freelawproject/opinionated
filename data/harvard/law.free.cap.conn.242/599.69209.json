Following an audit for the period of September 1, 1988, through August 31, 1991, the commissioner found that the plaintiffs were liable for additional sales tax. The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that the commissioner\u2019s tax calculation was based on incorrect applications of the tax statutes and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the commissioner had failed to examine many of their cash register tapes when conducting the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The trial court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, concluding that the commissioner had improperly: (1) found that certain items sold as food were subject to the sales tax as \u201cmeals\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (13); (2) failed to treat each item of food sold as a separate \u201cmeal\u201d and thereby improperly taxed the plaintiff for certain items costing less than $2 in violation of \u00a7 12-412 (51); and (3) concluded that certain sales were not exempt as sales of food to nursing homes or rest homes in accordance with \u00a7 12-412 (9). The trial court remanded the case to the commissioner to recalculate the plaintiffs\u2019 tax liability in accordance with the court\u2019s ruling and to consider newly available cash register receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">From the judgment of the trial court, the commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court and the plaintiffs thereafter cross appealed. The Appellate Court dismissed both the appeal and the cross appeal for lack of a final judgment. Thereafter, the commissioner alone petitioned for certification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4126.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The plaintiffs had appealed to the trial court from the commissioner\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 12-422, which allows for sales and use tax appeals to be tried de novo. See <em>Sanitary Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 393, 394-95, 665 A.2d 895 (1995); <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 144-45, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). The trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 12-422, remanded the case to the commissioner. The plaintiffs argue that an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to an appellate court may be taken only from the final tax assessment following that recalculation. It is well established that such an appeal may be taken only from a final judgment. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-263 and 51-197a; <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The plaintiffs point out that under <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 410, 521 A.2d 566 (1987), an administrative remand may not be appealed from if the remand would require more than ministerial acts. Unlike the present case, however, <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>concerned an appeal brought pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 4-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">We conclude that our decision in this case is controlled by <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, 202 </em>Conn. 412, 422, 521 A.2d 569 (1987), wherein this court considered a trial court\u2019s order under General Statutes \u00a7 12-237<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> remanding the case to the commissioner for the purpose of making a fair apportionment of corporate business taxes in light of the court\u2019s decision. Unlike the administrative appeal in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>the tax appeal to the trial court in <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>afforded the taxpayer a trial de novo. Id., 421. Therefore, despite the remand, the trial court had plenary authority under \u00a7 12-237 to adjudicate fully all of the issues raised in the taxpayer\u2019s complaint. Id., 422 n.8. In light of this authority, unlike in <em>Schieffelin &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Co., </em>we concluded that appellate review of the trial court\u2019s remand was not premature and that the judgment was final. Id. Because \u00a7 12-422, the statutory provision at issue in this case, gives the trial court plenary authority to adjudicate fully all of the issues in the same language as \u00a7 12-237, for purposes of deciding whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was final, this case is indistinguishable from <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed the commissioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Although we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court for consideration of the commissioner\u2019s appeal, because our grant of certification encompassed only the dismissal of the commissioner\u2019s appeal, the dismissal by the Appellate Court of the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal to that court is not affected by our adjudication of this appeal. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4126, the commissioner filed a petition for certification seeking to overturn the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment dismissing its appeal to that court. Although the Appellate Court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal, the plaintiffs did not file their own petition for certification seeking review of that judgment in this court. Furthermore, although subsequent to the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification, the plaintiffs could have filed a cross petition for certification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4129,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they failed to take any such action. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 4129, which became effective September 3, 1996, restored to appellate procedure the cross petition for certification that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>existed from 1986 to October 1,1992, when it was abolished. The plaintiffs\u2019 decision not to take advantage of either of these available options means that they may not, except in the most extreme circumstances, benefit from an appellate decision rendered in the context of an appeal brought by another party in the same case. This, however, is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and BORDEN and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-11\"> We granted the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal for lack of a final judgment?\u201d <em>Jones </em>v.

I agree that under <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 422 n.8, 521 A.2d 569 (1987), this court is required to reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">I do not agree, however, that it was necessary for the majority to conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal is not reinstated by this court\u2019s decision. As I understand the majority\u2019s rationale, the cross appeal is not viable because the plaintiffs did not file a cross petition for certification. Since the cross appeal was not before us, the majority should not have commented as it did. If the cross appeal were before us, I see no reason why it also should not be reinstated as it was dismissed on the same grounds as the defendant\u2019s appeal. In the interest of fairness, the cross appeal should be heard along with the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Beyond being gratuitous, the observation concerning the cross appeal punishes a party, who would rather have this matter concluded as it had been in the Appellate Court, for not filing a \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d cross petition for certification. Under the majority\u2019s decision, in order to save their cross appeal, the plaintiffs were required to argue that their cross appeal should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>have been dismissed and, at the same time, that the commissioner\u2019s appeal was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">I, therefore, concur in the result only as to the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
