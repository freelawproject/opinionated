Because we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court describes many of the facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cThe defendant was a \u2018regional commander\u2019 of a street gang known as the \u2018Latin Kings.\u2019 For several weeks, the defendant\u2019s gang was involved in an ongoing dispute with a rival gang known as \u2018Los Solidos.\u2019 In the afternoon hours of September 26, 1993, the Latin Kings conducted an emergency meeting ... to discuss a recent incident in which a member of their gang was shot at by a member of the rival gang. During the meeting, Jose Martinez, a member of the gang and a witness for the state, served as a lookout. Although Martinez had attended nine prior gang meetings in which the defendant had been present [in the two month period immediately preceding the shooting], he did not attend the emergency meeting, nor did he know whether the defendant was there. At the meeting, the gang devised a plan to retaliate for the shooting incident by killing a member of Los Solidos.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u201cAfter the meeting, Jose Velez, another gang member, instructed Martinez to keep watch for rival gang members from the roof of a four-story building located on East Clay Street [in the city of Waterbury]. When Martinez arrived, four other gang members, including Velez, were already there. The group possessed an assortment of firearms including an M-16 rifle with a scope, a shotgun and several handguns. Velez had a portable [citizens band (CB)] radio that he used to maintain contact with other gang members, some of whom had remained at Morales\u2019 Cafe, which was referred to by the gang as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u2018sector one.\u2019 Other gang members were stationed in different locations throughout the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u201cAt approximately midnight, [one of the victims], Ana Plaza, was returning to her home at 79 East Clay Street, which is located across the street from the building where the group stood lookout on the roof. Plaza was accompanied by her son, Obdulio, her daughter, Melissa, and her infant granddaughter. As Plaza and her family prepared to enter Plaza\u2019s house, Velez and the others observed their actions from the rooftop. Velez had a brief conversation over the portable radio with an unknown individual about the activity at the Plaza residence. Immediately following that conversation, Velez instructed his people to fire at the Plaza family. At least three gang members immediately opened fire discharging several rounds of ammunition for a duration of approximately twenty seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u201cAs a result of the gunfire, Ana Plaza was struck by a bullet in her hip and Melissa was struck by a bullet in her arm. As both women began screaming, Obdulio ran into the house and phoned the police and an ambulance. Meanwhile, the shooters fled from the roof of the building into a vacant apartment, stuffed their weapons into a duffel bag and ran from the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u201cApproximately ten days later, the police arrested the defendant and several other members of the Latin Kings. In an oral statement to Detectives Robert Henderson and Mark Deal of the Waterbury police department, the defendant admitted that he was a member of the Latin Kings and that he held the rank of regional commander at the time of the shooting. Although the defendant denied any personal involvement in the shooting, he informed the police that several members of a gang called the \u2018Nietas,\u2019 who were allied with his gang, were responsible for the shooting. The defendant stated that one of the shooters was called \u2018Cano,\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that a Latin King called \u2018Rambo\u2019 had helped with the disposal of the weapons used in the shooting.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 496-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant thereafter moved for a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed his conviction on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was not supported by the evidence. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [jury] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 435, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996). \u201cIn this process of review, it does not dimmish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 510, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u201cWhile the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>dant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 617, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). Moreover, \u201c[i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the [jury] is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 195, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). \u201cAs we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 693, 646 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>[229 Conn. 328, 332, 641 A.2d 123 (1994)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 671-72, 485 A.2d 913 (1984); nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [jury], would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 196; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 134, 646 A.2d 169 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]his court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 258, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201c[w]e do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Finally, \u201c[i]n reviewing the jury verdict, it is well to remember that [j]urors are not expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observation and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 693; <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 674; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 620, 490 A.2d 68 (1985) (\u201c[i]t is an abiding principle of jurisprudence that common sense does not take flight when one enters a courtroom\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Because the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, we also must consider the essential elements of the crime of conspiracy. \u201cTo establish the crime of conspiracy [to commit murder . . . the state must show] that an agreement was made between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting [the crime of murder] and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators. . . . While the state must prove an agreement [to commit murder], the existence of a formal agreement between the conspirators need not be proved because [i]t is only in rare instances that conspiracy may be established by proof of an express agreement to unite to accomplish an unlawful purpose. . . . [T]he requisite agreement or confederation may be inferred from proof of the separate acts of the individuals accused as coconspirators and from the circumstances surrounding the commission of these acts. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Further, [conspiracy can seldom be proved by direct evidence. It may be inferred from the activities of the accused persons.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 245-46, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 495-96, 687 A.2d 489 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Guided by these principles, we consider whether the Appellate Court properly determined that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conspiracy conviction. The defendant does not dispute either that members of the Latin Kings conspired to kill a member of the Los Solidos gang or that this illegal agreement culminated in the ambush of the victims on September 26,1993. Rather, the defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he was part of the illicit plan. We agree with the state that the evidence adduced at trial, considered cumulatively and viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The following additional facts, relevant to our resolution of this issue, reasonably could have been found by the jury. As a result of his investigation, Henderson learned that members of the Latin Kings had occupied various positions throughout Waterbury\u2019s south end on the evening of the shooting in order to implement the gang\u2019s plan to kill a Los Solidos gang member. Communication among the various locations was maintained through a CB channel on walkie-talkies, some of which Henderson subsequently retrieved. According to Martinez,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the four other members of the Latin Kings assigned to the rooftop of the building on East Clay Street with Martinez were heavily armed with shotguns, handguns and automatic weapons. Martinez further testified that, while acting as a rooftop lookout, he had heard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>defendant\u2019s voice, among others, broadcast over Velez\u2019 walkie-talkie.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At approximately midnight, Velez, immediately after speaking with an unidentified person over his walkie-talkie, gave the order to fire at the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Martinez also testified that the defendant was located at \u201csector one\u201d at the time Martinez heard his voice over Velez\u2019 walkie-talkie, and that \u201csector one\u201d was Morales\u2019 Cafe in Waterbury, one of the locations where members of the Latin Kings had been stationed in connection with the implementation of the plan. Martinez further indicated that, after the emergency meeting at which the illegal scheme was approved, members of the Latin Kings who had attended that meeting reviewed the plan with those gang members who, like Martinez, already had taken their positions and, consequently, were not present at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In his interview with Henderson after the shooting, the defendant acknowledged that he was the regional commander of the Waterbury Latin Kings, and that he previously had served as the gang\u2019s president and philosopher. On the basis of his conversation with the defendant, Henderson concluded that, although he was reluctant to implicate himself in the conspiracy, the defendant had demonstrated \u201ca lot of knowledge\u201d regarding the shooting and had revealed information concerning the crime that was not available to the general public at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The jury, considering the cumulative weight of all the evidence, reasonably could have inferred that the defendant had joined with his fellow gang members in the conspiracy to kill a member of the Los Solidos. First, the testimony by Martinez and Henderson regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>defendant\u2019s rank in the organization, viewed in combination with the other evidence adduced at trial, supports such an inference. In light of the defendant\u2019s rank as regional commander for the Waterbuiy Latin Kings, his attendance at numerous gang meetings in the months immediately preceding the shooting, and his presence at Morales\u2019 Cafe in the hours leading up to the shooting, the jury reasonably could have inferred either that the defendant had attended the planning meeting or, alternatively, that he otherwise had participated in or approved of the scheme. The jury heard testimony regarding various leadership positions held by Latin King members, including those of president and regional commander, and that the gang met regularly as a group. The evidence also established that, in connection with the Latin Kings\u2019 plan to retaliate against the Los Solidos, members of the Latin Kings had armed themselves with automatic weapons, deployed armed members at various \u201csectors,\u201d and communicated with each other over portable radios. In view of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the Latin Kings operated in a paramilitary fashion with a hierarchical chain of command. Consequently, the jury reasonably could have concluded that a scheme as important and well organized as the plan to Mil a rival gang member would not have been undertaken without the prior approval of the Latin King leadership, including its regional commander,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who previously had served as its president and philosopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Other evidence supports the inference that the defendant was actively involved in the gang\u2019s illegal operations on the night of the shooting. Martinez testified that the defendant was present at \u201csector one,\u201d one of the locations where members of the conspiracy were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>stationed. The jury also heard testimony from Martinez that the defendant had communicated from \u201csector one\u201d over Velez\u2019 walkie-talkie during the hours leading up to, and culminating in, the shooting. It was reasonable for the jury to infer, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s presence at \u201csector one\u201d with other gang members involved in the plan was neither coincidental nor innocent, especially in view of the defendant\u2019s rank in the organization. Moreover, because the evidence supported the inference that Velez and his confederates on the rooftop were waiting for authorization to begin shooting and, further, that such authorization had come over the walkie-talkie, it also would have been reasonable for the jury to have inferred that the Latin Kings\u2019 use of walkie-talkies was integrally related to the conspiracy. Finally, the jury reasonably could have inferred that, in light of his position as regional commander, his presence at \u201csector one,\u201d and his voice transmission over the radio system used by the conspirators to communicate with one another, the defendant had obtained the information which he later conveyed to Henderson regarding the illegal plan as a direct result of his participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support the guilty verdict, the Appellate Court identified several purported deficiencies in the testimony that the state claimed constituted circumstantial proof of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. This evidence included: (1) the defendant\u2019s voice communication over Velez\u2019 walkie-talkie at some time prior to Velez\u2019 order to shoot; (2) the defendant\u2019s rank as regional commander of the Waterbury Latin Kings; and (3) the information provided by the defendant to Henderson regarding the perpetrators of the shooting. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 501. In concluding that the jury reasonably could have considered this evidence as a link in a chain of inferences leading to a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that the defendant had been part of the conspiracy, Judge Schaller, in his dissent; see footnote 3 of this opinion; expressed the view that the majority improperly had \u201cdiscredit[ed] the evidence that the jury chose to credit.\u201d <em>States. Torres, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 506-507. For the following reasons, we agree with Judge Schaller.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">First, the Appellate Court declined to accord any weight to Martinez\u2019 testimony that he had heard the defendant\u2019s voice over Velez\u2019 walkie-talkie. Id., 502-503. Specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that this evidence was insufficient to establish either that the defendant had communicated directly with any of the gang members who fired the shots from the rooftop, or that the defendant was located at \u201csector one\u201d when Martinez heard his voice transmission over Velez\u2019 walkie-talkie. Id. In support of its first point, the Appellate Court relied on the fact that Martinez did not testify as to the time, nature, duration or substance of the communication. Id., 502. Even if we assume, arguendo, that Martinez\u2019 testimony was inadequate to support an inference that the defendant had communicated directly with Velez, we note that the state was not required to prove that these individuals had communicated directly with each other in order to establish the defendant\u2019s involvement in the Latin Kings\u2019 illegal plan. Rather, the fact that the defendant\u2019s voice was overheard on the radio system used by the conspirators to communicate with one another during the critical period leading up to the shooting, when viewed in combination with the other evidence, reasonably supports an inference that the defendant was part of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We also disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s assertion that Martinez\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s presence at \u201csector one\u201d was not sufficiently rehable to be accorded any weight by the jury. The Appellate Court concluded that the jury could not reasonably have cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ited this evidence because Martinez failed to provide the basis for his knowledge of the defendant\u2019s presence at \u201csector one\u201d and, further, that there was no evidence that \u201csector one\u201d was a command post. Id., 503. The defendant, however, never challenged the foundation of Martinez\u2019 testimony that the defendant was located at \u201csector one.\u201d Moreover, Martinez testified that he and the other Latin Kings who had not attended the emergency meeting were apprised of the details of the plan by gang members who had attended that meeting. Furthermore, the jury reasonably could have inferred that \u201csector one\u201d was a command post because the name \u201csector one\u201d suggests the primacy of that location and, according to Martinez, the defendant, the gang\u2019s regional commander and past president and philosopher, was present there. In light of Martinez\u2019 testimony that \u201csector one\u201d was one of the locations where lookouts were stationed, however, it was not critical for the state to have established that \u201csector one\u201d was a command post. Finally, although Martinez did not testify that the defendant had disclosed his location when he spoke over the walkie-talkie, we note that Martinez did indicate that fellow gang members who had attended the emergency meeting had provided Martinez with information regarding the illegal plan discussed at the meeting. The jury reasonably could have inferred that Martinez was told where the defendant would be located during this debriefing. Consequently, the jury reasonably could have credited Martinez\u2019 testimony regarding both that the defendant was present at \u201csector one,\u201d and that \u201csector one\u201d was one of the designated sites from which the plan was to be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Second, the Appellate Court concluded that the jury could not reasonably have drawn any incriminatory inferences as a result of the defendant\u2019s rank as regional commander of the Waterbury Latin Kings. Id., 504. In support of this conclusion, the Appellate Court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that the evidence indicated that the defendant had not presided over the prior gang meetings attended by Martinez, and that there was no testimony regarding the specific role of the regional commander or the internal structure of the Latin Kings. Id. Because the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s rank in the organization do not depend on either of these evidentiary lacunae, we do not agree with the Appellate Court that the jury was required -to ignore the defendant\u2019s leadership role in the gang in determining whether he was a member of the conspiracy. The jury was entitled to use its common sense and judgment in evaluating the relationship, if any, between the defendant\u2019s past and present positions in the Latin Kings and the likelihood of his involvement in the conspiracy. This is particularly true in view of the evidence adduced by the state establishing the hierarchical nature of the gang, and the organized manner in which the illegal plan was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Finally, the Appellate Court found \u201cnothing of an inculpatory nature in the defendant\u2019s responses to Detective Henderson\u2019s questions despite Henderson\u2019s opinion that -the defendant \u2018was reluctant to admit his involvement\u2019 in the conspiracy.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court noted that \u201cHenderson testified that the defendant expressly denied any involvement in the conspiracy, and that he could have learned whatever information he possessed about the shooting after it had occurred.\u201d Id., 504-505. The Appellate Court concluded that the jury could not reasonably have inferred that the defendant\u2019s knowledge about the crime derived from his involvement in the conspiracy, rather than from discussions with gang members after the incident. Id., 505. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Henderson testified that, although the defendant was \u201creluctant to implicate himself in the actual shooting,\u201d he both identified one of the shooters and provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>detailed information regarding the disposal of the weapons used during the incident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThat the jury might have drawn <em>other possible inferences </em>from these facts is not sufficient to undermine its verdict, [because] proof of guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond a possible doubt. . . . [I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the jury\u2019s function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 604, 594 A.2d 459 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 545-46, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). Consequently, in view of the defendant\u2019s position as regional commander, his presence at \u201csector one,\u201d and his voice communication over the radio used by the conspirator who relayed the order to shoot, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the details of the conspiracy derived from his direct participation in it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201cFrom the evidence presented, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant held a series of leadership positions in the Waterbury branch of the Latin Kings, including president, culminating in his position as regional commander. He regularly attended the Latin Kings meetings, including all of the meetings at which Martinez had been present. On the day of the emergency meeting, held in the midst of a \u2018war\u2019 with a rival gang, he was present at the sector established as part of the conspiracy to shoot a member of Los Solidos, and he communicated before the shooting with Velez on the rooftop. Because no Latin Kings leaders were on the roof, and [because a radio] communication immediately preceded the shooting, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Latin Kings leaders were at sector one, where the defendant, who was a leader, was located. From the defendant\u2019s leadership position, his regular attendance at meetings, the emergency nature of the situation and the fact that the defendant employed a [walkie-talkie] for communication, all of which were integral parts of the plan to commit the murder, and that the plan proceeded without interruption after the defendant\u2019s communication with Velez, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant knew of the plan to kill a member of Los Solidos, agreed to conspire to commit the murder, shared the intent to commit the murder and that a coconspirator committed an act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cHaving drawn those reasonable inferences concerning the defendant\u2019s participation and shared intent, the defendant\u2019s disclosure ten days later, in Henderson\u2019s words, of \u2018a lot of knowledge\u2019 about the incident, not readily available \u2018in the general public\u2019 could have led to further reasonable inferences of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged. The fact that the evidence was disputed or that other inferences could have been drawn is not relevant to our review. As long as evidence existed from which the jury reasonably could have found the facts and drawn the inferences leading to its guilty verdict, it is our obligation to defer to those findings and inferences in passing on this sufficiency challenge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 510-11 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Consequently, although \u201cno clear line of demarcation exists between a permissible inference and an impermissible speculation\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 165 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>dissenting); we are persuaded that the inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence, taken together and viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict, supported the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. In so concluding, \u201c[w]e acknowledge that [our] reasoning requires us to posit a chain of inferences, each link of which may depend for its validity on the validity of the prior link in the chain. That is essentially what circumstantial evidence means, however, and it is what our case law generally permits. We also acknowledge that this is not an easy case. We conclude, nonetheless, that it is a case in which the jury\u2019s [conclusion that the defendant was a member of the conspiracy] was sufficiently supported by the circumstantial evidence.\u201d Id., 130-31. Although another jury rationally could have reached a different conclusion, we cannot say that this particular jury verdict lacked sufficient support in the evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>reversed the judgment of conviction rendered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b504-11\"> Judge Schaller dissented from the decision of the majority, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>41 Conn.

The Appellate Court did not address these claims because it reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency. In light of the fact that the parties have not briefed these issues in this court, we decline to consider them, and the Appellate Court will be required to address them on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> The defendant also had been charged with attempt to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2), 53a-54a (a) and 53a-8 (a), and first degree assault in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1).

I disagree with the majority because there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit murder. In my view, the defendant\u2019s conviction boils down to a finding of \u201cguilt by association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">This case requires us to revisit a basic principle of constitutional law. Justice Brennan, in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 362-64, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), writing for a majority, stated: \u201cExpressions in many opinions of this Court indicate that it has long been assumed that proof of a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt is constitutionally required. . . . The reasonable-doubt standard plays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure. It is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence \u2014 that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. . . . The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons. The accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance, both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>his guilt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In addition, Justice Brennan wrote: \u201c[Use of the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable to command the respect and confidence of the community in applications of the criminal law. It is critical that the moral force of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned. It is also important in our free society that every individual going about his ordinary affairs have confidence that his government cannot adjudge him guilty of a criminal offense without convincing a proper factfinder of his guilt with utmost certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cLest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d Id., 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u201cIn determining whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict, we have said that the issue is whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Each essential element of the crime charged must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt . . . and although it is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable logical inferences from the facts proven, they may not resort to speculation and conjecture. ... A conclusion of guilt requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and proof to that extent is proof which precludes every reasonable hypothesis except that which it tends to support, and is consistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 671, 485 A.2d 913 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The evidence that the majority finds sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction is the same evidence that the Appellate Court concluded was insufficient to support a conviction. The Appellate Court summarized this evidence by indicating that \u201cthe state attempts to build its case on a foundation comprised of three facts: (1) The defendant was a regional commander in the Waterbury Latin Kings gang; (2) [Jose] Martinez [another Latin Kings gang member] heard the defendant\u2019s voice over [gang member Jose] Velez\u2019 portable radio on the rooftop sometime during the evening of the occurrence; and (3) the defendant displayed inside knowledge of the shooting when he was interrogated by the police ten days later.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>41 Conn. App. 495, 501, 676 A.2d 871 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">When considering the state\u2019s inference based case, the Appellate Court aptly explained that \u201c[t]he difficulty we have in accepting the state\u2019s argument is the lack of predicate facts from which the jury could reasonably have drawn the appropriate permissive inferences that the defendant was present at the emergency meeting or was in communication with the rooftop shooters. Furthermore, there is nothing in the defendant\u2019s oral statement to the police to allow the jury to infer that he had prior knowledge of the conspiracy.\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 165, 646 A.2d 169 (1994) <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>dissenting) (\u201c[w]hen there are no ascertainable facts from which the appropriate inferences may reasonably be drawn, the presumption of innocence requires a conviction to be set aside\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 167 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting) (\u201c[speculative evidence, no matter how cumulative, cannot support an inference or series of inferences upon which an element of a crime can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). In a lengthy and detailed decision, and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>carefully scrutinizing all of the evidence, the Appellate Court \u201cconclude[d] that, when evaluated under the appropriate standard, the evidence in this case is insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit murder.\u201d <em>State v. Torres, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 505. Due to the fact that there was insufficient evidence, the defendant in this case has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and his conviction should be reversed. Because I agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning and its result, I endorse that opinion and incorporate it herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
