Although the defendant raises several issues in this appeal, at this time we reach only the procedural aspects of his claim for a new trial predicated on juror bias and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">On June 8, 1994, the jury rendered a verdict of guilty on all counts. On June 27, 1994, prior to sentencing, the defendant filed a motion captioned \u201cmotion for a new trial\u201d (motion) on the basis of juror bias. In the motion, the defendant sought a new trial and the motion set forth its basis, together with an appendix containing photocopies of certain relevant newspaper articles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the last paragraph of his motion, the defendant requested that the trial court <em>also </em>consider it as a \u201cpetition for a new trial,\u201d in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-270.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On September 19, 1994, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>of juror bias, and concluded the hearing on January 9, 1995. At no time prior to the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion did the state object to the procedural posture of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On October 24, 1994, before the completion of the hearing and the subsequent ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court sentenced the defendant to a total term of 100 year's imprisonment. The trial court stated that it sentenced the defendant before deciding his motion in order to ensure that there would be appellate review of the court\u2019s decision on the motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On March 17, 1995, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. On March 27, 1995, the state moved for reconsideration of that decision, arguing for the first time that the defendant\u2019s claim of juror bias was raised in a procedurally defective manner. Because the defendant had failed to institute a separate proceeding by way of a petition for a new trial, pursuant to \u00a7 52-270, by serving a writ and complaint on the state; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 144, 429 A.2d 810 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>14 Conn. App. 88, 101, 540 A.2d 378, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 811, 545 A.2d 1107 (1988); the state argued that the defendant\u2019s petition was improperly brought and, consequently, that the state was deprived of its right to appeal from the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>court\u2019s order granting a new trial. The trial court agreed with the state and vacated its order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly vacated its order granting the defendant a new trial on the ground, inter alia, that the defendant should have raised the issue of juror impartiality by way of a properly instituted proceeding on a petition for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-270. The state argues that the trial court acted properly and, also, as an alternative ground on which to affirm the judgment of the trial court, that the defendant failed to establish that he was actually prejudiced by the juror\u2019s failure to disclose pertinent information. We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly concluded that the issue of juror bias in this instance must have been raised by a petition for a new trial brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-270. We must, however, remand the case to the trial court for an articulation as to whether the trial court found actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The following undisputed facts recited by the trial court are relevant to the resolution of the issue raised by the defendant\u2019s motion. \u201cThe issue raised by the defendant in his motion for a new trial, which was filed prior to the sentencing of the defendant, is that the juror, Richard Gay, who turned out to be the foreperson, had been involved in an incident about thirteen months prior to his selection as a juror and made no mention of it at any time during the process of jury selection or at any time thereafter. According to the testimony of [Gay] given in the course of the evidentia[ry] hearing held by the court on September 19, 1994, he made no mention of this occurrence because he did not think it was relevant. [He testified that] \u2018[i]t had no bearing on anything.\u2019 . . . And when asked if anybody he knew, [or a] family member, had ever been the victim of a crime, his response had been \u2018No\u2019 because \u2018a family member\u2019 \u2018didn\u2019t mean me.\u2019. . . Had he been asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>specific question as to himself and any experience with being a victim of a crime, he would have answered differently. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u201cEvidence was offered by way of newspaper articles in the New Haven Register of May 1, 1993 ... [to which Gay testified] of an occurrence in which he was assaulted by a number of youths following an automobile accident in downtown New Haven in which he either was pulled out of his car or got out and was thereafter subjected to an assault which required overnight hospitalization. In a subsequent interview by a Register reporter he was quoted as saying that the law was easing up too much on these kids, they\u2019re not good for anything and the law should kick their . . . ,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant in this case is a young black male residing in New Haven and in the opinion of the court would fit generally within the class of the individuals allegedly referred to by [Gay], These statements were denied by [Gay] in that he claimed not to recall specifically what he told the reporter but that he did recall wanting the police to investigate the incident. [Gay] also indicated . . . that he wanted the police to investigate because he had been \u2018beat up,\u2019 although he claimed not to remember the assault at the time of the hearing on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u201cThe question raised by the defendant in the face of this information is whether [Gay] should have disclosed this information as bearing upon his ability to be fair and impartial in sitting as a juror on this case. The state claims that no actual bias has been shown and that when asked the question whether any family member had been the victim of a crime, he truthfully answered as to others of the family, but because he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>specifically asked whether <em>he </em>had been a victim of a crime he had no duty to volunteer the incident of April 29, 1993 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We first address whether the trial court properly vacated its decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based upon its conclusion, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s claim was required to have been brought by way of a properly instituted proceeding on a petition for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-270. The state argues that the defendant\u2019s claim of juror bias was initiated through a procedurally defective petition for a new trial. The defendant counters that his motion for a new trial, brought pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> properly raised his claim of juror bias. We agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s motion was not a properly brought petition for a new trial, but we also agree with the defendant that a claim of juror bias may be brought either by way of a motion for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 902 of the Practice Book or a petition for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The state relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>supra, 14 Conn. App. 100-102, for its argument before the trial court that the defendant\u2019s petition for a new trial was procedurally defective. The state renews this argument on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>A petition for a new trial is properly \u201cinstituted by a writ and complaint served on the adverse party; although such an action is collateral to the action in which a new trial is sought, it is by its nature a distinct proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 144. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>supra, 101, the Appellate Court noted that the defendant did not follow that procedure and that \u201c[t]he defendant filed his \u2018petition for new trial\u2019 within the technical confines of the docketed criminal case. No separate civil action was brought.\u201d The court in <em>Servello </em>indicated that \u201c[w]e are presented, then, with the question of whether the defendant\u2019s failure to bring a petition for a new trial in a separate action deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the petition. . . . [T]he trial court should have dismissed the defendant\u2019s petition for a new trial because it was improperly brought, and we do not review the trial court\u2019s denial of that petition.\u201d Id., 101-102; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 Conn. App. 502, 503, 545 A.2d 1150 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Saraceno, </em>15 Conn. App. 222, 250-51, 545 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 823, 824, 552 A.2d 430, 431 (1988). The motion in the present case clearly does not meet the requirements of a petition for a new trial because it too was filed within the confines of the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Nonetheless, we construe the defendant\u2019s motion as a motion for a new trial, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902, even though he alternatively sought a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-270. Although not dispositive, the motion was clearly captioned \u201cmotion for a new trial\u201d and the defendant filed his motion prior to final judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, the trial court captioned its written decision on the motion as a \u201cmemorandum of decision on <em>motion </em>for new trial\u201d (emphasis added), although the trial court also made reference to \u00a7 52-270 in its decision. We conclude that the motion was a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902 and not a petition for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The trial court indicated, in its oral decision vacating its previous order granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, that its \u201cruling on the defendant\u2019s motion after imposing sentence was improper, and that the issue of a juror\u2019s impartiality must be addressed by way of a petition for a new trial.\u201d The trial court stated that the defendant\u2019s motion \u201cobviously . . . falls short of being a petition that\u2019s required under [\u00a7 52-270] . . . .\u201d In addition, the trial court indicated that it had sentenced the defendant and then ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion under the assumption that its decision granting the defendant a new trial would be appealable by the state before any retrial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Notwithstanding this procedural quagmire, the trial court retained jurisdiction to entertain the motion for a new trial after sentencing<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because it could have opened the judgment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 436, 507 A.2d 1367 (1986) (\u201cduring the continuance of a term of court the judge holding it has, in a sense, absolute control over judgments rendered; that is, he [or she] can declare and subsequently modify or annul them\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>It is true that this court has stated, as a general matter, that \u201cthe purpose of a hearing on a \u00a7 902 motion for a new trial is to determine whether <em>the court, in the course of the trial, committed error </em>and thereby deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Synakorn, </em>239 Conn. 427, 435, 685 A.2d 1123 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 730, 535 A.2d 808 (1988). Moreover, the defendant does not claim that the trial court acted improperly when it allowed Gay to sit as a juror based on the answers that Gay did provide on voir dire. Nonetheless, it is also true that this court has routinely reviewed claims of jury misconduct or jury bias brought by way of motions for a new trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 622-29, 682 A.2d 972 (1996) (reviewing trial court\u2019s denial of motion for new trial based on alleged juror misconduct); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Brye, </em>236 Conn. 209, 211, 671 A.2d 1295 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 227-29, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 735-36, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda,, </em>189 Conn. 303, 310, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983), on appeal after remand, 196 Conn. 507, 493 A.2d 890 (1985). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 144-45, this court stated that \u201cerrors which are claimed in relation to a <em>motion for a new trial </em>may be assigned on the appeal from the judgment rendered in the case in which the motion is made. . . . In the present case, the assignment of error would have to do with alleged <em>jury misconduct </em>and the defendant does not claim that he could not raise this particular claim of error on appeal. The alleged jury misconduct at this point is just one more event during the trial upon which the defendant may argue that a claim of error should be based after judgment is rendered.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Here, the defendant did just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>that. That is not to say, however, that claims of juror misconduct do not also fall within the reach of a petition for a new trial brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-270. See, e.g., <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 439-43, 521 A.2d 578 (1987); <em>Aillon v. State, </em>168 Conn. 541, 363 A.2d 49 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Indeed, there are important practical reasons why claims of juror misconduct raised prior to judgment should be able to be brought through the route of a motion for a new trial. \u201cThe trial judge plays a crucial role in ensuring that a criminal defendant receives a fair trial by an impartial jury, and must be ever vigilant, throughout the course of the trial, to guard against jury partiality. In a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is [the judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. . . . The jury room cannot be guarded with too much vigilance and jealousy. Courts must reject all evidence not received on the trial, and must repel every foreign influence, which may affect the minds of the jury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u201cWe <em>recognize that the trial judge has a superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she personally has presided . . . and thus is in a superior position to evaluate the credibility of allegations of jury misconduct, whatever their source.\" </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 527-28, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995). Permitting claims of juror misconduct to be brought by way of a motion for a new trial prior to judgment makes eminent sense because of the exigency of the situation when the court is confronted with such allegations. Id., 528-29. Even if claims of juror misconduct are not raised through a motion by the defendant, \u201ca trial court must, when presented with any allegations of jury misconduct, conduct a preliminary inquiry, sua sponte if necessary, in order to assure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>itself that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury has been fully protected.\u201d Id., 528. Allegations of juror misconduct must be addressed at whatever stage they are encountered. Accordingly, we conclude that the issue of juror bias was properly before the trial court in the motion for a new trial brought prior to judgment and pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On the basis of the reasons offered by the trial court, we conclude that the trial court in this case improperly vacated its decision granting the defendant a new trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">We now reach the state\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance on this issue. The state argues that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the trial court improperly vacated its order granting the defendant a new trial, the defendant has failed to establish that he was actually prejudiced by the juror\u2019s failure to disclose certain information. Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is unclear as to whether the trial court found actual bias, we remand the case for further articulation as to the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We are mindful that \u201c[j]ury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. ... In essence, the right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. . . . The modem jury is regarded as an institution in our justice system that determines the case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given [it] in the adversary arena after proper instructions on the law by the court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 522-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u201cA great deal is at stake in a criminal trial. The interests involved go beyond the private interests at stake in the ordinary civil case. They involve significant public interests. \u2018The accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance, both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.\u2019 <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 363, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1969). Indeed, the criminal jury trial has a role in protecting not only the liberty of the accused, but also the entire citizenry from overzealous or overreaching state authority. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 156, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968). In addition, the state has a valid and weighty interest in convicting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>guilty. <em>Summerville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 397, 427, 641 A.2d 1356 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 579, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 398, 645 A.2d 535 (1994), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Nevertheless, \u201c[t]o succeed on a claim of bias the defendant must raise his contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>167 Conn. 526, 532, 356 A.2d 162 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>164 Conn. 224, 228, 319 A.2d 398 (1973). It follows therefrom that the trial court must make a finding of the ultimate fact sought to be proved. A new trial is not required where a juror has given a false answer on voir dire which has the effect of depriving counsel of the opportunity to exercise the right to challenge a juror unless it appears that the party seeking it has been prejudiced in his case by the false answers. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 301, 311-12, 444 A.2d 239 (1981); <em>Moynahan </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Conn. Sup. 434, 437, 334 A.2d 242 (1974); see <em>Burns </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 518, 521, 80 A. 712 (1911).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 313. In <em>Almeda, </em>the court indicated that \u201c[i]t is central to note that while the court might have been justified in drawing an inference of actual bias from the facts, especially when considered in light of their initial intentional nondisclosure, the court did not explicitly do so.\u201d Id., 312. The court, in <em>Almeda, </em>remanded the matter for an articulation with respect to the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. Id., 314. In the subsequent appeal in <em>Almeda, </em>after the trial court had articulated its findings in accordance with the remand order, we indicated that \u201c[t]he scope of the remand required that the trial court make an explicit finding of the ultimate fact to be proved, actual bias on the part of a juror.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>196 Conn. 507, 508, 493 A.2d 890 (1985). The trial court articulated its decision and found actual bias, and we affirmed its decision. Id., 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In the present case, the trial court, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 303, found that \u201cthe defendant is not able to demonstrate actual bias but . . . the court may import bias from all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. The facts and circumstances brought to the court\u2019s attention in this matter suggest [that] the requested disqualification of [Gay] as a juror is based upon something more than mere speculation. . . . Following the review of the background of this juror as brought out by the individual voir dire and the subsequent evidentiary hearing of September 19, 1994, the perception of the court is that this defendant was entitled to more candid responses to the questions posed to the veniremen on voir dire and had those been given there is little question that on motion the court would have excused him from service. The perception as well as the actuality of a fair trial must be preserved in order that justice be done.\u201d Consequently, the trial court initially ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Unfortunately, we are in the same position here as we were in <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 303. It is not clear from the trial court\u2019s decision in this case whether it found actual bias. Although the trial court\u2019s decision correctly stated that it \u201cmay import bias from all of the surrounding facts and circumstances,\u201d it also vaguely noted that all the facts and circumstances brought out at the hearing \u201csuggest [that] the requested disqualification of [Gay] as a juror is based upon something more than mere speculation.\u201d In addition, the court stated that \u201cthe perception of the court is that this defendant was entitled to more candid responses,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he perception as well as the actuality of a fair trial must be preserved . . . .\u201d We conclude that the ruling as a whole lacks a definitive finding on whether there was actual bias. In order for this court to evaluate the state\u2019s claim that there was no actual bias, the trial court must therefore first clarify its find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ings on the claim of alleged juror partiality. \u201cWhere necessary to the proper disposition of the cause, this court may remand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>State v.

The foreperson of the jury was Richard Gay. Since the time the verdict in this matter was handed down, the defense has found information that he was the victim of a beating on or about Thursday April 29, 1993. Upon information and recollection (a copy of his voir dire testimony has been ordered) Mr. Gay was aslced whether he had ever been the victim of a crime and other questions in that line and he replied in the negative. Attached hereto are copies of articles from the New Haven Register which outline the following events. A motorcyclist was killed when he slammed into the back of a vehicle, operated by Mr. Gay, while the car was stopped at a red light on Dixwell Ave. at its intersection with Webster Street. After the above described collision, a crowd of onlookers beat and lacked Mr. Gay resulting in Mr. Gay\u2019s being taken by ambulance to Yale-New Haven Hospital. Gay was quoted in the New Haven Register dated May 1, 1993:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u201c \u2018The law is easing up too much on these kids \u2014 they\u2019re not good for anything and the law should lack their . . . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u201cThe failure of this venireperson to disclose this information in response to pertinent voir dire questions by counsel deprived the defendant from a fair and impartial jury in violation of the due process and equal protection guarantees of both the Connecticut and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u201c2. The court\u2019s decision to not allow the defense to put into evidence the fact that one Andre Rogers, a state\u2019s witness whose statements to detectives were put into evidence for substantive purposes, was accused of felony murder and other charges arising from the murder subject of this case, entitles the defendant to a new trial. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 309 [94 S.

Practice Book \u00a7 903 provides: \u201cUnless otherwise permitted by the judicial authority in the interests of justice, a motion for a new trial shall be made within five days after a verdict or finding of guilty or within any further time the judicial authority allows during the five-day period.\u201d Although the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was not filed within five days after the guilty verdict, the trial court accepted and acted on the motion. The state makes this timeliness claim even though it did not object in the trial court when the defendant filed the motion and it was clearly captioned \u201cmotion for a new trial.\u201d The state waived this claim by not objecting to the motion being filed more than five days after the verdict was returned.
