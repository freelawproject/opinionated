The defendant appeals, upon our grant of certification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming his conviction of attempted assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-59 (a) (1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant claims that, once the time limits set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 956B and 956C had passed and he had filed a motion for a speedy trial under \u00a7 956D, the trial court had no authority to delay his trial until his attorney completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>another trial in which he was engaged. We disagree, and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, although on different grounds from those articulated by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The Appellate Court stated the facts that the jury reasonably could have found as follows. \u201cOn January 9, 1993, the victim, Vincent Broadnax, went to his second floor bedroom to gather his belongings and to move them to an apartment that he had just rented. The victim shared a kitchen, living room, and bathroom with Yolanda Zayas, her five children, and her aunt, Odella Zayas, in the two-family dwelling. When the victim discovered that his clothes were missing, he began to question Odella Zayas. The defendant was in the apartment and threatened to shoot everybody if the victim continued making noise. After the victim stated that the defendant would not shoot anyone, the defendant ran into the victim\u2019s room and shot him with a sawed-off rifle. The bullet grazed the victim\u2019s upper right thigh. When the victim ran out of the house, the defendant followed and fired another shot that passed completely through the victim\u2019s thigh. Bridgeport police officer James Kirkland arrived at the scene as the victim was being transported to a hospital. Kirkland spoke to the defendant who stated that the assailant had fled down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201cA few days after the shooting, the victim spotted the defendant in a Bridgeport courthouse. The victim telephoned the police station and then notified the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. Kirkland arrested the defendant in the courthouse shortly thereafter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Brown, </em>40 Conn. App. 483, 484-85, 671 A.2d 1316 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The defendant was arrested on January 14,1993, and an information was filed against him on January 15, 1993. He was represented by Miles Gerety, an assistant public defender. It is undisputed that the defendant was incarcerated in lieu of bond from the time of his arrest. On September 14, 1993, Gerety filed, on behalf of the defendant, a motion for a speedy trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 956B, 956C and 956D, and requested that the trial court \u201cassign this case to a date certain for trial within thirty days of the filing date of this motion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">On October 13, 1993, this motion came before the trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>the presiding judge for criminal matters in the judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport. At the time the defendant\u2019s motion was heard, Gerety had been engaged in a trial in an unrelated case since September 7, 1993. In Gerety\u2019s absence, in court with the defendant was William Holden, who was then the chief public defender for the judicial district of Fairfield. The state was ready to proceed to trial. Holden, on behalf of the defendant, objected to any extension of time within which to commence the defendant\u2019s trial. The trial court indicated that, although it was inclined to \u201csend the . . . matter for trial up to Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>McKeever\u201d with a new counsel appointed in Gerety\u2019s place, to do so would not be fair to the defendant \u201cin that [Gerety] is his attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court, therefore, excluded \u201cthe [other client\u2019s trial] time from the thirty days. Once that trial is concluded, [the defendant\u2019s] case will go on trial . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">On October 15, 1993, Gerety, on behalf of the defendant, filed a written motion to dismiss the information on the grounds that \u201chis trial has not commenced within thirty days of the filing of his [September 14, 1993] speedy trial motion.\u201d On October 20, 1993, Holden, acting on behalf of the defendant, moved for the appointment of attorney Robert Sullivan as a special public defender, on the ground that the defendant was \u201cpresently represented by [Gerety] who is on an extended trial, lasting one month already and has several speedy trial cases pending.\u201d The trial court granted that motion on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On Thursday, October 21, 1993, Gerety completed his other client\u2019s trial, and on Friday, October 22, 1993, he was unavailable because he attended the funeral of another attorney. On Monday, October 25, 1993, Gerety filed an appearance for the defendant in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Sullivan\u2019s appearance as special public defender, and the defendant\u2019s trial commenced on that date, within the meaning of the speedy trial provisions of the rules of practice, with the beginning of the jury voir dire before the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J. </em>See Practice Book \u00a7 956E.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7\">On October 26, 1993, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss came before Judge Damiani. Sullivan argued the motion on behalf of the defendant. The court noted that Gerety, who was \u201ccocounsel\u201d with Sullivan on the case, was now representing the defendant as \u201cthe lead counsel who is involved with the jury selection [and] trial of the case. \u201d The court denied the motion to dismiss for two reasons. The first reason was that, in light of the fact that most of the defendants in that judicial district were represented by a public defender, it would be contrary to the intent of the statute and the rules of practice, despite their language, to dismiss all of the cases pending against a majority of a public defender\u2019s clients for failure to meet the thirty day time limit of Practice Book \u00a7 956D when that delay was caused by the public defender\u2019s trial representation of another client.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The second reason was that, given Gerety\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>unavailability at the time the motion was made, to have granted the defendant\u2019s thirty day speedy trial motion under \u00a7 956D would have been to deny him effective assistance of counsel and thus a fair trial, contrary to the intent of the statute and the rules of practice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court raising several claims, among them that the trial court had denied him his statutoiy right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Appellate Court did not address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim because, in its view, the defendant\u2019s speedy trial motion, having been filed on September 14, 1993, was one day premature and, therefore, as a matter of law could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>been granted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 487. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We first address the formulation of the certified issue. See footnote 3 of this opinion. Although we formulated the issue with a focus on the effect, if any, on the defendant\u2019s statutory right to a speedy trial, <em>of his public defender\u2019s </em>unavailability for trial, we now conclude that this focus was misdirected. First, we have never applied different rules of law or attributed different rights or obligations to defendants depending on whether they are represented by a public defender or a privately retained attorney. Indeed, we have emphasized that \u201cthe relation of attorney and client is the same when a public defender appears for one accused of crime as would be the relation between privately employed counsel and client.\u201d <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 575, 362 A.2d 871 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Second, although as part of its reasoning the trial court noted that most of the defendants in that judicial district were represented by a public defender \u2014 a fact that probably holds true, in varying degrees, for most if not all of our judicial districts \u2014 that was not the entire basis for its ruling. The other, and equally important, basis was that to grant the defendant\u2019s thirty day speedy trial motion would in effect have been to put at risk his constitutional right to competent counsel. That reason would apply equally to a case in which a defendant, in a similar situation, was represented by private counsel who was engaged in another criminal trial while the other Ghent\u2019s statutory thirty day period was running. Indeed, we are aware from experience that the problem of the unavailability of counsel for a scheduled criminal trial, because counsel is engaged in another trial, occurs with respect to privately retained counsel as well. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 501 A.2d 752 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Moreover, there is nothing in this record to suggest that it is because this defendant was represented by a public defender, as opposed to a privately retained attorney, that he was not brought to trial within thirty days of his motion for a speedy trial. The record does not support a determination that this failure was due to a lack of resources available to the office of the public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We do not doubt that the public defender system could benefit from additional resources. Such a generalized notion, which may well be shared by other components of our criminal justice system, does not mean, however, that any individual case should be resolved based on an <em>assumption </em>of the effect of lack of resources. In the absence of a showing that a significant deficiency in resources available to the public defender system substantially contributed to the denial of an individual\u2019s speedy trial rights, we decline to create a rule of law that differentiates between the rights of defendants represented by a public defender and those represented by private attorneys. Cf. <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>194 Conn. 510, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Accordingly, we reformulate our certified question to eliminate its focus on the availability for trial of the defendant\u2019s public defender. We consider the more appropriate question to be whether, under the circumstances, the fact that the defendant\u2019s attorney was engaged in another criminal trial justified the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The defendant claims that once the eight month period for commencing his trial had passed, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>subsequently had filed a motion for a speedy trial, then if his trial did not commence within thirty days of the filing of his speedy trial motion, his subsequent motion to dismiss was required to be granted with prejudice. The defendant\u2019s argument is straightforward. He contends that there are no time exclusions from the thirty day motion period under either General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m or Practice Book \u00a7 956D, which was promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 54-82m. In support of his reading of the statute, the defendant points to certain of its legislative history, and to the familiar canon of statutory construction that criminal statutes are \u201cto be construed liberally in favor of the defendant and strictly against the state.\u201d Consequently, he contends, the trial court had no option but to grant his motion to dismiss. Although we acknowledge that the language of both the statute and the rules of practice, read literally, supports the defendant\u2019s claim, we conclude that the language cannot be applied sensibly in that fashion, and that the trial court had the authority to delay the defendant\u2019s trial for a \u2022reasonable period of time until his counsel had finished his other trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>742 (1997). In accomplishing this task, we take account of the rules of statutoiy construction as \u201cimportant guidelines to the determination of legislative meaning. To permit them to displace the conclusions that careful interpretation yields, however, would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.\u201d Id., 455. The same process of interpretation applies \u201cto provisions of the [rules of practice].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744, 613 A.2d 804 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We recognize, as previously noted, that the language of both General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m and Practice Book \u00a7 956D, as it existed at the time in issue here; see footnote 2 of this opinion; provided for certain time extensions applicable to the defendant\u2019s eight month incarceration period but not to the thirty day period following his speedy trial motion. Section 54-82m requires that the rules adopted by the judges of the Superior Court, \u201cto assure a speedy trial for any person charged with a criminal offense . . . shall provide that (1) in any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered . . . [and] when such defendant is incarcerated in a correctional institution of this state pending . . . trial . . . the trial of such defendant shall commence within eight months from the filing date of the information ... or from the date of arrest, whichever is later; and (2) if a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit set forth in subdivision (1) and a trial is not commenced within thirty days of a motion for a speedy trial made by the defendant at any time after such time limit has passed, the information . . . shall be dismissed. Such rules shall include provisions to identify periods of delay caused by the action of the defendant, or the defendant\u2019s inability to stand trial, to be excluded in computing the time limits set forth in subdivision (1).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 956D provided in relevant part: \u201cIf the defendant is not brought to trial within the applicable time limit set forth in Secs. 956B and 956C,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and a trial is not commenced within thirty days of the filing of a motion for speedy trial by the defendant at any time after such time limit has passed, the information shall be dismissed with prejudice, on motion of the defendant filed after the expiration of such thirty day period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Thus, under the literal language of the statute an incarcerated defendant must be brought to trial within eight months, plus any excludable time calculated under the rules promulgated by the judges of the Superior Court, of his arrest or the filing of an information, whichever is later. Once that time has passed, he may then file a motion for a speedy trial. If thirty days passes without his trial commencing, he may then file a motion to dismiss, which must be granted with prejudice. The court has the authority to exclude certain periods of time in calculating when the eight month speedy trial time for an incarcerated defendant expires, but there is no corresponding language authorizing any extension of the thirty day period that begins to run upon the filing of a speedy trial motion following the expiration of that eight month period. Indeed, the specific direction in the last sentence of \u00a7 54-82m to the judges, in their rule-making capacity, \u201cto identify periods ... to be excluded in computing the time limits <em>set forth in subdivision (1) </em>\u201d; (emphasis added); without a corresponding direction to exclude any time periods to be excluded in computing the thirty day period under subdivision (2), precludes the inference, at least in the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>case, that the court has such authority to extend the thirty day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The rules of practice, adopted pursuant to \u00a7 54-82m, track the distinction drawn by the statute between the initial eight month period and the subsequent thirty day period following a motion for a speedy trial. Sections 956B and 956C set forth the parameters of the eight month period. Specifically, \u00a7 956B sets forth, among other things, the eight month period for the commencement of the trial of an incarcerated defendant. Section 956C sets forth the periods of time to be excluded in computing the eight month time period set forth in \u00a7 956B. Section 956D, which sets forth the procedure and timing for the subsequent thirty day speedy trial motion and motion to dismiss, has no language providing for periods of exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We conclude, nonetheless, that where the reason for the failure to commence the defendant\u2019s trial within thirty days of his speedy trial motion filed under \u00a7 956D is that his attorney is then engaged in another criminal trial, the court has the inherent power to suspend the running of that period for a reasonable time until the attorney becomes available, and that neither the statute nor the rules of practice precludes the exercise of that power. We reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">First, if a literal interpretation of statutory language \u201cwould lead to an unworkable result,\u201d we avoid such an interpretation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 745. In the present case, it would lead to an unworkable result to require a dismissal for failure to commence the defendant\u2019s trial within thirty days of the defendant\u2019s speedy trial motion, if the reason for that failure is that the defendant\u2019s own attorney is engaged in a trial in another criminal case. It would be equally unworkable to require that the trial commence within that period of time in the absence of the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>either by appointing substitute counsel for the defendant or requiring him to proceed pro se.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the trial court did appoint Sullivan to represent the defendant in place of Gerety, the defendant does not claim that Sullivan would have been prepared to proceed to trial on the case within the thirty day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Indeed, a literal interpretation of the language of the statute and the rules of practice would lead to other unworkable results. Reading the language to permit <em>no </em>exceptions once the thirty day speedy trial motion was filed would mean, for example, that even if the defendant\u2019s attorney were to become unavailable because of illness or other unavoidable circumstance, or even if the defendant fled the jurisdiction, the case would have to be dismissed. Despite the categorical nature of the language of the statute and the rules of practice, we conclude that it would not require such a result. Thus, if a literal application of the language of the statute would generate a clash between the defendant\u2019s rights to a speedy trial and to adequate representation, the literal application must yield to the power of the court to make a reasonable accommodation between those two rights, as did the trial court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Second, a useful guide to the meaning of statutory language is an identification of the principal audience of that language \u2014 that is, by answering the question: To whom is the statute primarily addressed? <em>State </em>v. <em>Piorkowski, </em>236 Conn. 388, 408-409, 672 A. 2d 921 (1996). As Judge Learned Hand said: \u201cWords are not pebbles in alien juxtaposition; they have only a communal existence; and not only does the meaning of each interpenetrate the other, but all in their aggregate take their purport from the setting in which they are used, <em>of which the relation between the speaker and the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>hearer is perhaps the most important part.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Federbush Co., </em>121 F.2d 954, 957 (2d Cir. 1941). The same principle applies to statutory language. Part of the context in which that language is to be understood is its primary audience or audiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">One of the primary audiences of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m is the judges of the Superior Court. The first sentence of \u00a7 54-82m is directed to that audience: \u201cIn accordance with the provisions of section 51-14, the judges of the Superior Court shall make such rules as they deem necessary to provide a procedure to assure a speedy trial for any person charged with a criminal offense on or after July 1, 1985.\u201d Thus, although the statute creates a statutory speedy trial right in defendants, and although it sets the parameters of that right, it provides that the judges are to adopt the rules by which that right is implemented. In pursuance of that statutory directive, the judges adopted Practice Book \u00a7 956D.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">This background buttresses our conclusion that, despite the categorical language of both General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m and Practice Book \u00a7 956D, they cannot be read to preclude the trial court\u2019s inherent power to make a reasonable accommodation in an individual case between the right to a speedy trial and the unavailability of the defendant\u2019s attorney. It is unlikely that either the legislature in enacting the statute directed to the judges, or the judges in adopting the mies of practice pursuant to the statute, intended to put a trial court in such a dilemma. The language must be understood to admit of an implied exception for such a case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Third, there is nothing in the legislative history that compels a different conclusion. It is true, as the defendant points out, that as originally drafted the bill that ultimately became \u00a7 54-82m gave more discretion to the judges in setting the speedy trial parameters; see 25 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1982 Sess., p. 1234, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr.; and that language was ultimately eliminated from the bill as enacted. It is also true that some of the legislative debate indicates a legislative intent that \u201c[i]t will be automatic release at the end oi thirty days if the trial does not commence.\u201d 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1982 Sess., p. 5806, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano. The legislative debate does not, however, indicate an awareness of a circumstance as presented in this case, in which the unavailability of the defendant\u2019s attorney is the reason that the trial cannot be started within the thirty day period. We cannot construe the language to encompass such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Finally, we note that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in construing similarly categorical language of the speedy trial plan of the District Court of Connecticut, held that there was an implied necessity exception to language requiring the commencement of a retrial of a criminal defendant \u201cnot later than [sixty] days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the finality of\u2019 the order for a new trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bubar, </em>567 F.2d 192, 206 n.20 (2d Cir. 1977). The court stated: \u201cIt requires but a moment\u2019s reflection . . . to recognize that there are certain situations where, to apply the [sixty] day limitation provision ... as an absolute bar, would result in a gross miscarriage of justice \u2014 most assuredly contrary to the intent of the drafters of the provision. For example, the [sixty] day period could run out because a defendant became sick or had fled the jurisdiction. Under the literal reading of [the plan] urged by [the defendant], such a defendant would be rewarded by dismissal of the indictment. In our view, an exception to the [sixty] day limitation period for acts of God and misconduct on the part of a defendant clearly is a necessary implication.

The Appellate Court resolved the constitutional aspects of the defendant\u2019s claim adversely to him, including the claim, to which the defendant adverts in his brief in this court, that the death of a witness constituted sufficient prejudice to violate his constitutional right to a speedy trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 488-90. We certified only those aspects of his speedy trial claim that involve the statute and, by extension, the rules of practice that implement the statutory provisions, which do not depend on a determination of prejudice. We therefore confine our discussion to the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 956B, 956C and 956D, as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> The trial court also noted that \u201c[t]o have another Public Defender represent [the defendant] at that trial would in fact give [him] a built-in habeas\u201d based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Indeed, the court also questioned whether \u201canother judge would actually start that trial knowing full well counsel of record who was familiar with the case was not present for trial, that a new counsel is there knowing nothing about the case. Therefore, [the defendant] will not be adequately defended and have proper assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> When the defendant himself objected to this ruling, the trial court explained: \u201cYour thirty days is up today but how can I put you on trial with a new lawyer who knows nothing about your case? How could that person defend you properly? ... So I am not going to rush to give you a trial today. I am not trying to deny you your right. Once [Gerety] finishes that trial which will be next week some time, this case will go on trial. [Gerety] filed a speedy trial motion on September 14. He was already engaged in trial. There is no way I could stop that trial to start your trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> Practice Book \u00a7 956E provides: \u201c \u2014 Definition of Commencement of Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cFor purposes of Secs. 956A through 956D, \u2018commencement of trial\u2019 means the commencement of the voir dire examination in jury cases and the swearing-in of the first witness in noryury cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> The trial court stated: \u201cPresently pending as of the end of August in the Bridgeport [judicial district] are 113 potential speedy trial cases. Probably 90 percent of those cases are represented by [public defenders.] Now, if I accept your argument . . . and in theory it is a good argument, but in practicality 90 percent of those people have public defenders. Put one [public defender] on trial. You may have twenty cases pending out of the 90 percent or 95 [percent of the] other cases. That means his case takes thirty-two days, thirty-three days to try. All his other clients get a dismissal. They just get a free walk out the door. One poor unlucky individual who got picked for trial gets his trial and may be convicted and spend time in jail. But the other ones just by chance they walk out the door because that attorney is tied up on trial. I don\u2019t think that is the intent or the meaning of the statute or the Practice Book, irrespective of the fact that it does say \u2018shall.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> The trial court stated: \u201cTo do what you [Sullivan] want also would be violating your client\u2019s rights. Mr. Gerety is his counsel. You were not appointed a special [public defender] until last Thursday, October 21. If in fact I put [the defendant] on trial subsequent to September 14, Mr. Gerety\u2019s on trial, do I send [the defendant] upstairs by himself pro se? Do I just pluck a lawyer out of the audience and say you\u2019re [the defendant\u2019s] lawyer? Do I give [the defendant] ability in habeas [to raise] an appealable issue? Do I impose upon an attorney to put his reputation on the line to go upstairs to sit at counsel table to represent [the defendant] in a case he is not prepared to defend? So what you\u2019re saying is to protect and preserve your client\u2019s right to a speedy trial I violate his right to have a fair trial and to have the effective assistance of counsel. I don\u2019t think that is the meaning or the import or the interpretation of [Practice Book \u00a7 956D] or of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Sullivan then noted for the record \u201cthat [the defendant] did in fact insist upon going forward with the speedy trial irrespective of Mr. Gerety\u2019s preoccupation with another trial.\u201d The court responded that it understood that the defendant \u201cwanted to have his trial that very day. But I am here to ensure that a fair trial takes place. For me to send [the defendant] upstairs to represent himself or to say, Mr. \u2018X\u2019 or Mr. \u2018Z, \u2019 you represent [the defendant], is not fair to the attorneys and surely is not fair to [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> At trial, the state filed a substitute information charging the defendant with attempted assault in the first degree and assault in the second degree.

As applied to the defendant, they would consist of any excludable periods of time in the calculation of the eight month period under that subdivision. In this case, there were no such exclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> We note that the defendant does not claim in this appeal that he was deprived of his right to represent himself at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> Indeed, dating from the enactment of \u00a7 54-82m, the judges of the Superior Court have considered that its language cannot be read so literally as to preclude the rules of practice adopted pursuant thereto from including reasonable circumstances that are within its purpose but not its literal language. For example, \u00a7 54-82m provides that, \u201cin computing the time limits set forth in subdivision (1),\u201d those rules \u201cshall include provisions to identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>periods of delay <em>earned by the action of the defendant, or the defendant\u2019s inability to stand trial . . . </em>(Emphasis added.) Despite this language, however, the rules adopted for computing those time limits include numerous instances that are not strictly attributable to the action of the defendant or his inability to stand trial. See, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7 956C (b) (period of delay resulting from \u201cabsence or unavailability of . . . counsel for the defendant, or any essential witness for the prosecution or defense\u201d); Practice Book \u00a7 956C (d) (\u201creasonable period of delay when the defendant has been joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted\u201d); Practice Book \u00a7 956C (h) (period of delay \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by the judicial authority at the request of the prosecuting authority\u201d if certain conditions are met); Practice Book \u00a7 956C (j) (\u201c[o]ther periods of delay occasioned by exceptional circumstances\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
