Count one charged the defendant with capital felony (murder committed in the course of the commission of a sexual assault in the first degree) in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counts two and three charged the defendant with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-8,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and felony murder in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counts four and five charged the defendant with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed count one of the amended information, in part, on the basis that it failed to state an offense. See Practice Book \u00a7 815 (2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state has appealed that dismissal on the basis of a grant of certification, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 4180,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by Justice Borden, acting in place of the Chief Justice, who was unavailable. We conclude that count one of the amended information properly charged the defendant with the offense of capital felony. We therefore reverse the dismissal by the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Before addressing the substantive issue in this appeal, we set forth the relevant factual circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>out of which the charges against the defendant arose, and the procedural history of the case. In response to the defendant\u2019s renewed motion for a bill of particulars, the state filed a statement of essential facts setting forth the factual allegations that the state intended to prove at trial. The state claimed that on May 12 or 13, 1995, the defendant and another man, Scott Smith, visited the victim at her apartment in Bridgeport. The state alleged that the defendant threatened the victim by telling her that he would tie her up, throw her in the closet and bum her. The state alleged further that an altercation ensued between the victim and the defendant and Smith when the victim attempted to push the defendant out of her apartment. According to the state\u2019s allegations, Smith grabbed the victim in a headlock and attempted to knock her to the floor. The victim began to scream and straggle as Smith wrestled with her. Smith asked the defendant to get a knife. After unsuccessfully searching the apartment for a knife, the defendant stabbed the victim in the head with a can opener. As the victim continued to fight with Smith, the defendant hit the victim in the head with an iron. The defendant then kicked the victim five times, causing her to spit up blood. Smith manually strangled the victim and struck her in the neck with his knee as the defendant hit her in the head with the iron. After rendering her physically helpless, Smith proceeded to have oral sex with the victim. Smith also unsuccessfully attempted to have vaginal sexual intercourse with her while the defendant watched. After Smith was finished, the defendant had vaginal and anal sexual intercourse with the victim, causing lacerations of the vaginal wall and the junction of the perineum and posterior introitus of the vagina. The defendant ejaculated in the victim. The state alleged that the cause of the victim\u2019s death was asphyxia and that Smith had caused her death by manual strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Shortly thereafter, both the defendant and Smith gave separate and differing written statements to the Bridgeport police, each confessing their involvement in the events described above. On May 30, 1995, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s confession, the state charged the defendant by information with two counts of capital felony (murder committed during the course of a kidnapping, and murder committed during the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of subdivisions [5] and [7], respectively, of \u00a7 53a-54b), one count each of murder and felony murder, one count of first degree sexual assault, two counts of second degree sexual assault, one count of kidnapping in the first degree and one count of unlawful restraint in the first degree. In that information, the first count alleged, in part, that the defendant \u201cdid murder another person in the course of the commission of [s]exual [a]ssault in the [f]irst [d]egree, in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-54b (7) . . . .\u201d Count three alleged, in part, that the defendant, \u201cwith intent to cause the death of . . . another person, did strangle, and cause the death of the said other person, in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-54a (a) . . . .\u201d The state also charged Smith by information with several criminal offenses, including, among other things, two counts of capital felony in violation of subdivisions (5) and (7) of \u00a7 53a-54b, one count of felony murder and one count of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The trial court, <em>Reman, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a separate probable cause hearing and for severance of the case against him from the state\u2019s case against Smith. As a result, two trial court judges conducted separate hearings in probable cause for the defendant and for Smith. Because of a potential problem under <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968), the defendant\u2019s confession was not admitted as evidence in Smith\u2019s probable cause hearing, and, likewise, Smith\u2019s confes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>sion was not admitted as evidence in the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing. The trial court, <em>McKeever, J., </em>found probable cause with respect to the defendant on the charges of capital felony (murder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree), murder and felony murder, but did not find probable cause with respect to the second capital felony count (murder committed in the course of a kidnapping). The trial court, <em>Gormley, J., </em>found no probable cause with respect to Smith on the two counts of capital felony and the felony murder count. The court, however, did find probable cause with respect to Smith on the murder count.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">On December 11, 1996, the state filed an amended information, charging the defendant with six criminal offenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that information, the state had altered the wording of the murder count to charge the defendant on the basis of an accessory theory of liability. The murder count provided as follows: \u201c[The defendant], with intent to cause the death of another person, <em>did intentionally aid one Scott Smith, who did strangle, and cause the death of the said other person, in violation of [\u00a7\u00a7] 53a-8 and 53a-54a (a).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The wording of the capital felony count, however, remained the same as it had been in the May 30, 1995 information.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The trial court, <em>Hartmere, J., </em>held a hearing on, among other things, the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At that hearing, the defendant objected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>to the form of the capital felony count in the December 11,1996 amended information. The defendant requested that the state reword the capital felony count to allege that the defendant\u2019s liability was accessorial in nature, so that it would be consistent with the murder count. The defendant argued that the wording of the capital felony and murder counts would cause confusion for a jury because the murder count alleged that the defendant had aided Smith to commit the murder, but the capital felony count alleged that the defendant had murdered the victim. Although the state represented to the trial court that the capital felony count would be reworded to charge the defendant as an accessory to capital felony, the state filed another amended information on December 31, 1996, in which the wording of count one remained the same, except for the addition of Smith\u2019s name. The defendant subsequently moved the trial court to strike count one of the December 31, 1996 amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On January 3, 1997, the state filed the five count amended information that is involved in this appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In that information, the state had reworded the capital felony count to allege that \u201cat the City of Bridgeport, Fairfield County, on the 13th day of May 1995 at or about 2:39 a.m., at 2900 Main Street, Apartment 432, Bridgeport, [the defendant], in the course of the commission of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, with intent to cause the death of another person, <em>did intentionally aid one Scott Smith by striking with an iron, stabbing with a can opener, and kicking another per</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>son, while the said Scott Smith did strangle, and cause the death of the said other person, </em>in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-54b (7).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant again objected to the wording of the capital felony count, and orally moved the court to dismiss count one of the January 3, 1997 amended information pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 815 (2). The defendant interpreted the amended capital felony count as charging the defendant under an accessory theory of liability because of the use of the word \u201caid\u201d in the charge. Because Judge Gormley had not found probable cause to believe that the purported principal in the crime, Smith, had committed capital felony, the defendant argued that the state could not charge the defendant with capital felony on the basis of an accessory theory of liability. In addition, the defendant contended that the wording of the amended version of count one was vague and illogical and failed to state a cognizable offense. The state maintained that count one of the January 3, 1997 substitute information properly charged the defendant with capital felony as a principal, and that the additional facts had been added only in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">After substantial argument, the trial court, <em>Hartmere, J., </em>dismissed the capital felony count of the January 3, 1997 amended information. In its appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision, the state argues that count one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>January 3,1997 amended information properly charged the defendant with the offense of capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7). The state, furthermore, contends that count one provided the defendant with constitutionally adequate notice of the charge against him, and that such notice was sufficient to enable the defendant to prepare a defense. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The first basis upon which the trial court dismissed count one of the January 3, 1997 substitute information was Practice Book \u00a7 815 (2). Practice Book \u00a7 815 sets forth nine separate bases upon which a criminal defendant may ground a pretrial motion to dismiss. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Subdivision (2) of \u00a7 815 affords a criminal defendant the right to have an information dismissed prior to trial because of \u201c[d]efects in the information including <em>failure to charge an offense </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court determined that the charging language of count one was defective because it failed to state a cognizable offense. We have not had occasion to address the standard of appellate review applicable to a trial court determination, pursuant to \u00a7 815 (2), that an information, or, as in this case, one count of an information, failed to charge an offense. Although several of the bases for dismissal in \u00a7 815 are grounded in statutes; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-56 (insufficiency of evidence or cause), 54-193 (statute of limitations), 54-82c (speedy trial); and at least one of those determinations is discretionary in nature; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-56; we conclude that atrial court\u2019s dismissal of an information in whole or in part, pursuant to \u00a7 815 (2), because it failed to charge an offense amounts to a determination that the facts alleged in the information do not satisfy applicable statutory requirements. Where, as in this case, the question is a matter of statutory construction rather than of factual sufficiency, this determination constitutes a question of law that is reviewed de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The first question we must determine, therefore, is whether the allegations in count one of the January 3, 1997 information charged the offense of capital felony. Count one stated in relevant part that \u201c[the defendant], in the course of the commission of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, with intent to cause the death of another person, did intentionally aid one Scott Smith by striking with an iron, stabbing with a can opener, and kicking another person, while the said Scott Smith did strangle, and cause the death of the said other person, in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-54b (7).\u201d The state\u2019s theory of the defendant\u2019s liability for the offense was that, in the course of sexually assaulting the victim, the defendant aided Smith in killing the victim. Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-8, therefore, the defendant could be held criminally liable for murder on the basis of an accessory theoiy of liability. Moreover, because the defendant aided Smith in killing the victim during the course of committing his own sexual assault, the state asserted that the defendant also could be held criminally liable for capital felony. Implicit in the trial court\u2019s dismissal of count one, and in the defendant\u2019s arguments in his brief and at oral argument, is the assertion that the legislature did not intend the prohibition of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) to apply to such a situation. We conclude, to the contrary, that the legislature intended the provisions of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) to encompass a factual situation such as that charged in count one of the state\u2019s January 3, 1997 amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u201cOur fundamental objective when construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. </em>Co., 241 Conn. 282, 295, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996). When construing statutes, \u201cwe will avoid constructions that lead to absurd, unworkable or bizarre results.\u201d <em>In re Flanagan, </em>240 Conn. 157, 183, 690 A.2d 865 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>240 Conn. 727, 736-37, 694 A.2d 758 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Section 53a-54b provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of . . . murder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree . . . .\u201d In 1980, the legislature added this offense to the list of capital felonies in \u00a7 53a-54b. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-335 (P.A. 80-335). A review of the legislative history of P.A. 80-335 reveals that the legislature did not specifically contemplate whether its use of \u201cmurder\u201d in the wording of the offense encompassed murder committed by an accessory as well as murder committed by a principal. Public Act 80-335 must be read, however, in light of the principle of criminal law, based both in statutory and common law, that a defendant may be convicted of a substantive offense, through the use of accessory principles of liability, even though the defendant did not actually commit the substantive offense. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>169 Conn. 581, 585, 363 A.2d 1081 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raffone, </em>161 Conn. 117, 128, 285 A.2d 323 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The accessory statute in place in 1980, \u00a7 53a-8, provided in relevant part that \u201c[a] person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who . . . intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct <em>and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 53a-8. In addition, we have stated that \u201c[t]here is no such crime as being an accessory .... The accessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>statute merely provides alternate means by which a substantive crime may be committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Harris, 198 Conn. 158, 163, 502 A.2d 880 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 608, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Raffone, </em>supra, 161 Conn. 128. \u201cThis state . . . long ago adopted the rule that there is no practical significance in being labeled an accessory or a principal for the purpose of determining criminal responsibility. See General Statutes (1875 Rev.) tit. XX, c. XIII, part X; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gargano, </em>99 Conn. 103, 109, 121 A. 657 (1923); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>47 Conn. 95, 118 (1879). The modem approach is to abandon completely the old common law terminology and simply provide that a person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when he is an accomplice of the other person in the commission of the crime. . . . [The] labels [of accessory and principal] are hollow . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, <em>164-65; </em>see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 340-41, 696 A.2d 944 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Because these principles of accessory liability were well established when the legislature enacted P.A. 80-335, we infer that the legislature intended its use of \u201cmurder\u201d in the wording of the offense of capital felony to encompass murder committed by an accessory as well as murder committed by a principal. We find the defendant\u2019s alternate interpretation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The defendant argues that a defendant may be held criminally responsible for the capital felony of murder committed in the course of the commission of a sexual assault in the first degree only if the defendant, with the intent to cause the death of the victim, either: (1) intentionally causes the death of the victim in the course of a sexual assault in the first degree; or (2) intentionally aids another person and the other person, in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of that person\u2019s sexual assault of the victim, intentionally causes the death of the victim. The defendant argues that if Smith did not complete the crime of capital felony and if the defendant did not actually cause the death of the victim, then the defendant cannot be held criminally liable for capital felony. The legislature cannot have intended such an interpretation when it enacted P.A. 80-335, however, because it would lead to bizarre results. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 737; <em>In re Flanagan, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 183. If one breaks capital felony into its constituent parts of murder and sexual assault in the first degree, the defendant\u2019s argument falls in upon itself. According to the defendant\u2019s argument, a defendant who is an accessory with respect to the murder and an accessory with respect to the sexual assault may be held criminally liable for capital felony on the basis of \u00a7 53a-8, but a defendant who is an accessory with respect to the murder, <em>and a principal with respect to the sexual assault </em>may not be held criminally liable for capital felony. According to the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-54b, then, a defendant who has aided another person to commit the two substantive elements of capital felony, and thus is liable for capital felony pursuant to \u00a7 53a-8, may avoid capital felony liability by <em>himself committing </em>one of the substantive elements of capital felony. Because such an interpretation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) would be bizarre and illogical, the defendant\u2019s argument must fail. We conclude, accordingly, that count one of the information properly states a capital offense under \u00a7 53a-54b (7) and, therefore, should not have been stricken under \u00a7 815 (2) of the rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Moreover, contrary to the defendant\u2019s alternate argument, count one of the information also provided him with sufficient notice of the crime charged. When an information \u201cinformjs] the defendant of the charge against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and [is] definite enough to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense, [the information has] performed [its] constitutional duty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 381, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). As long as an information provides \u201cthe statutory name of the offense . . . identified] the place of the offense, the names of the victims, and the general nature of the acts . . . the allegations . . . [are] sufficient.\u201d Id., 382. Count one of the January 3, 1997 amended information notified the defendant of the statutory name of the offense with which he was charged, and of the date, time and place of the alleged offense. In addition, count one, coupled with the statement of essential facts, notified the defendant of the general nature of the acts that the state intended to prove that he had performed. Count one sufficiently set forth the charge against the defendant to enable him to prepare a defense and to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 538, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The trial court\u2019s second basis for dismissing count one of the January 3, 1997 amended information was <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>203 Conn. 420, 524 A.2d 1148 (1987). In that case, the state charged Hope, pursuant to an accessory theory of liability, with capital felony (murder for hire) in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (2). Id., 421. In the second count of the indictment, the state alleged that Geraldine Burke had hired John J. McGann, for his pecuniary gain, for the purpose of causing the death of her husband, Donald C. Burke. Id., 422. The second count alleged further that Donald Burke was murdered by a person or persons, including Hope, which person or persons, with intent to cause the death of Donald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Burke, did cause the death of Donald Burke. Id. The trial court dismissed the second count of the indictment for failure to allege the essential elements of capital felony and the state appealed to this court. Id. During the pendency of the state\u2019s appeal, we decided <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 506 A.2d 109 (1986). In that case, the trial court had found McGann guilty of capital felony for his role in the murder of Donald Burke. Id., 164. On appeal, however, we concluded that McGann could not be convicted of capital felony because, in view of the evidence presented by the state at trial, the hiring relationship required by \u00a7 53a-54b (2) was not present. Id., 176-78. In other words, we concluded as a matter of law that \u00a7 53a-54b (2) did not encompass the factual circumstances presented in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">As a consequence of our decision in <em>McGann, </em>we dismissed the state\u2019s appeal in <em>Hope </em>as moot. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 425. We stated that \u201c[a]s the state acknowledges, [Hope] can no longer be tried on a charge of capital felony murder in light of our determination that McGann was not a hired assassin under the terms of \u00a7 53a-54b (2). . . . [Hope] cannot be held liable as an accessoiy on [the capital felony] charge in the absence of evidence that anyone else committed a capital felony murder.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The trial court in the present case concluded that these statements in <em>Hope </em>mandated dismissal of count one of the January 3, 1997 amended information. First, the trial court construed count one as charging the defendant with capital felony on the basis of an accessory theory of liability. Because Judge Gormley did not find probable cause with respect to Smith, the purported principal, on the charge of capital felony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>trial court determined, on the basis of our statements in <em>Hope, </em>that the defendant could not properly be charged as an accessory to capital felony. Second, the trial court equated Judge Gormley\u2019s finding of no probable cause with respect to Smith with our conclusion in <em>McGann </em>that McGann was not an assassin for hire within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-54b (2). The trial court concluded that Judge Gormley\u2019s finding of no probable cause had the same preclusive effect on what it believed to be the state\u2019s accessory case against the defendant that our conclusion in <em>McGann </em>had on the state\u2019s accessory case against Hope.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We conclude that the trial corat\u2019s reliance on <em>Hope </em>was misplaced for several reasons. First, <em>Hope </em>is distinguishable from the present case because Judge Gormley\u2019s finding of no probable cause with respect to Smith on the capital felony charge is not equivalent to ora conclusion in <em>McGann </em>that McGann was not a hired assassin. Our conclusion in <em>McGann </em>was a conclusion of law that, on the basis of the evidence presented in McGann\u2019s trial, McGann did not commit the offense of capital felony. That conclusion was binding on all lower courts. Judge Gormley\u2019s finding of no probable cause with respect to Smith on the capital felony charge, however, was binding only with respect to Smith. Judge Gormley found that there was no probable cause to believe, on the basis of the evidence presented to him, that Smith had committed the offense of capital felony. The only binding effect that finding had was that the state could not thereafter charge Smith with capital felony unless, at a later date, it was able to persuade a judge that probable cause existed to believe that Smith had committed capital felony. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Judge Gormley\u2019s finding was not, however, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>determination that, as a matter of law, Smith did not commit the offense of capital felony, nor would it preclude the state, in its case against the defendant, from attempting to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Smith had committed capital felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Moreover, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that Judge Gormley\u2019s finding of no probable cause with respect to Smith on the capital felony charge had the same preclusive effect that our <em>McGann </em>finding had in <em>Hope, Hope </em>would operate to preclude the state from prosecuting the defendant for capital felony only if (1) the state\u2019s entire case against the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>predicated on accessory liability, or (2) the state had no evidence to prove that Smith committed capital felony other than the evidence presented to Judge Gormley in the probable cause hearing. Neither of these conditions exists in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">First, the state\u2019s case against the defendant on the capital felony charge is not predicated solely on an accessory theory of liability. Rather, only one element of the state\u2019s case against the defendant, the murder element, is dependent upon accessory liability. Although Judge Gormley found no probable cause with respect to Smith on the capital felony charge, he did find probable cause with respect to Smith on the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In addition, the evidence that the state intended to produce in its case against the defendant was different from the evidence that the state produced in Smith\u2019s probable cause hearing. Specifically, in its case against the defendant, the state intended to introduce into evidence the defendant\u2019s confession, which, because of a potential problem under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 123, had not been produced for Judge Gormley at Smith\u2019s probable cause hearing. In Smith\u2019s probable cause hearing, the state introduced into evidence only Smith\u2019s confession, which differed in various aspects from the defendant\u2019s confession. Thus, in the state\u2019s case against the defendant, the state intended to introduce evidence that Judge Gormley did not have the benefit of hearing when he made his probable cause decision with respect to Smith. For the foregoing reasons, <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 420, is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Finally, we deem it necessary to address what appears to be one other basis upon which the trial court dismissed count one, which may become relevant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>remand. In the trial court\u2019s articulation of its decision, the court asserted that it could not properly rule on the motions filed by the defendant concerning the imposition of the death penalty because of what it considered to be the vague and confusing charging language of count one.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See footnote 10 of this opinion. Specifically, the defendant had filed a motion for a pretrial determination that the defendant was ineligible for the imposition of the death penalty. In that motion, the defendant had cited General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (h),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which prohib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>its a court from imposing the death penalty on a defendant who has been convicted of a capital felony if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>jury or the court \u201cfinds by a special verdict . . . that at the time of the offense . . . [the defendant] was criminally liable under sections 53a-8, 53a-9 and 53a-10 for the offense, which was committed by another, but his participation in such offense was relatively minor, although not so minor as to constitute a defense to prosecution . . . .\u201d On the basis of the evidence disclosed by the state, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s criminal liability, if he was liable at all, was accessorial in nature and relatively minor. The defendant therefore sought a determination by the trial court that, on the basis of \u00a7 53a-46a (h), he was ineligible for the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The trial court dismissed count one, in part, because the court found the count, and the state\u2019s representations concerning it, to be confusing and vague on the question of whether count one charged the defendant as a principal or as an accessory, an issue that was relevant to the disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion. We conclude, however, that the trial court\u2019s concern with disposing of the defendant\u2019s motion prior to trial was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The defendant has not cited and we have found no authority aside from the constitutionally required hearing in probable cause; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a; that entitles a defendant to a pretrial judicial determination of ineligibility for the death penalty. Moreover, \u201c[u]nder Connecticut law, a defendant may be convicted as an accessory even though he was charged only as a principal as long as the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to establish accessorial conduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 388, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268 n.15, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>176 Conn. 508, 513 n.2, 408 A.2d 265 (1979). Because the defendant was not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>to a death penalty determination prior to trial, and because the capital felony count, when coupled with the statement of essential facts, adequately notified the defendant of the state\u2019s theory of liability against him, the trial court\u2019s concern with whether count one charged the defendant as a principal or an accessory was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On remand, after the close of evidence, the trial court will have to determine whether a jury instruction on accessory liability is warranted in view of the evidence presented during the trial and the state\u2019s theory of liability in the case. Furthermore, if the defendant is convicted of capital felony and the state seeks the death penalty, the trial court will have to fashion a jury instruction, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a, that will allow the penalty phase jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s participation in the capital felony was so minor as to constitute a mitigating factor that precludes the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The dismissal of count one of the January 3, 1997 amended information is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to reinstate that count and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b provides in relevant part: \u201cCapital felony.
