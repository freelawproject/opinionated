(Access), a license to provide ambulance services in Stamford and Greenwich. The named plaintiff and the plaintiff Danbury-Nelson Ambulance Services, Inc. (Danbury-Nelson), alleging that they each hold a license to provide such services in Fairfield County, appealed from the department\u2019s decision to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants, the department and Access, each filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The trial court found that the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson were not aggrieved by the department\u2019s decision and rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The relevant, undisputed facts are as follows. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-178,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the department is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>responsible for the licensing and certification of ambulance services. The plaintiff is a licensed emergency medical service operator providing emergency medical services as well as nonemergency ambulance and invalid coach transport throughout Fairfield County. On December 6, 1994, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-180 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Access applied to the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>requesting a license to operate a new ambulance service in Stamford and Greenwich with a branch office, three ambulances and an invalid coach. The application was referred to the Southwestern Connecticut Emergency Services Council, Inc., which recommended its approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The department then held a public hearing on the application, at which the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson submitted requests to be afforded party status in the proceedings because Access\u2019 proposed services \u201cwould be in direct competition with those services provided by [them].\u201d The hearing officer denied the requests for party status, but did grant both the plaintiff and Dan-bury-Nelson intervenor status. After hearings at which the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson participated, the department granted Access\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson appealed from that decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-180 (c) and 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff and Dan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>bury-Nelson alleged, inter alia, that they improperly had been denied party status by the department because \u201c[a]s direct competitors of [Access], the granting of a license to Access will cause a dilution and a diminuti[on] of the existing licenses held by [them].\u201d The plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson further alleged that the hearing officer and the department improperly concluded that Access had demonstrated the need for its proposed service, that health care facilities in Stamford and Greenwich had experienced response delays in non-emergency service calls from existing providers, and that Access\u2019 proposed service would improve response times and be more cost effective. Finally, the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson alleged that \u201c[a]s direct competitors of Access, [they] will be adversely affect[ed] by the granting of Access\u2019 application. In addition, having been issued licenses based upon need and necessity, the value of [their] licenses . . . and the transferability of these licenses, are diminished by the guaranty of Access\u2019 application. [The plaintiff] and Danbury[-Nelson] are therefore aggrieved by the [department\u2019s] Final Decision granting Access\u2019 application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The trial court found that the interests of the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson in the department\u2019s decision derive solely from the fact that they are existing ambulance companies in the area where Access would be operating. The court found, therefore, that \u201c[t]he injury that [the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson] would suffer as a result of the decision would be to their business interests \u2014 their profits would suffer because of increased competition for nonemergency ambulance business in the area.\u201d The court concluded that, because \u00a7 19a-180 (a) requires the department, in reviewing an application, to determine only the public necessity for such services, and does not require the department to consider the effects on competition, the interests of the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson were not at stake in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>department\u2019s decision. The court determined, therefore, that the plaintiff and Danbury-Nelson were not aggrieved by the department\u2019s final decision granting Access\u2019 application and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their appeal. Accordingly, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">An appeal from an administrative decision of the department is governed by \u00a7 19a-180 (c) and the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189. Section 19a-180 (c) provides: \u201cAny person or emergency medical service organization aggrieved by an act or decision of the Office of Emergency Medical Services regarding certification or licensure may appeal in the manner provided by [the UAPA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u201cPleading and proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter of an administrative appeal. <em>Bakelaar v. West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). It is [therefore] fundamental that, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved. <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>214 Conn. 726, 729,573 A.2d 736 (1990); <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>175 Conn. 415, 419, 399 A.2d 1274 (1978). . . . <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 168, 172, 592 A.2d 386 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u201cThe test for aggrievement long recognized by this court is set forth in our decision in <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 524 A.2d 636 (1987). There we stated that [t]he fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision .... <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>[supra, 193 Conn. 65]. Aggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected. <em>O'Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953). <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 442, 445, 435 A.2d 975 (1980).. . . <em>[State Medical Society v. Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra], 299-300. The determination of aggrievement presents a question of fact for the trial court and a plaintiff has the burden of proving that fact. <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 493, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>235 Conn. 334, 342-43, 663 A.2d 1011 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The second prong of the aggrievement test requires the plaintiff to \u201cdemonstrate that its asserted interest has been specially and injuriously affected in a way that is cognizable by law. See <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 300-301.\u201d <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 343. \u201c[I]n considering whether a plaintiffs interest has been injuriously affected by [an administrative decision], we have looked to whether \u2018the injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse effect upon him) falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for [its] complaint.\u2019 . . . <em>Air Courier Conference </em>v. <em>Postal Workers, </em>498 U.S. 517, 523, 111 S. Ct. 913, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1125 (1991), citing <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>National Wildlife Federation, </em>497 U.S. 871, 883, 110 S.

Ct. 1131, 103 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1989) (standing merely requires the party to make allegations of a colorable claim of injury to an interest which is arguably protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee); see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 702, 345 A.2d 563 (1974) ([i]t is now settled that standing to maintain an action in the federal courts requires proof of injury in fact to an interest within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the federal statute in question).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The plaintiff claims that it is aggrieved by the department\u2019s decision to grant Access a license to provide ambulance services in violation of \u00a7 19a-180 (a) because the competition that results from the decision diminishes the value of the plaintiffs previously exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>license to provide ambulance services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying the general standards of standing, therefore, our inquiry is whether the plaintiffs interest is within the zone of interests protected by \u00a7 19a-180 (a). We applied this principle in <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>and <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>with differing results. In <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 177, we concluded that various trucking companies were aggrieved by the alleged violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-286<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by the department of public utility control in granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a competitor. By contrast, in <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 346, we concluded that a cable television company was not aggrieved by the alleged violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 16-331 (b), (d) and (h)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by the department of public utility control in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a competitor, but was aggrieved by that depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ment\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 16-331 (i).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In this case, the trial court, after reviewing those two cases, concluded that, because \u00a7 19a-180 (a) does not require the department to consider the effect on existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ambulance service license holders in deciding whether to grant a new license, the plaintiff was not aggrieved. The plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cbased upon a far too expansive reading of <em>United Cable [Television Services Corp.] </em>and an excessively restrictive interpretation of <em>Light Rigging [Co.].\u201d </em>The plaintiff contends that the distinction between those two cases is whether the statutory schemes involved required the department to consider the public necessity of the proposed services. We conclude that public necessity alone does not confer aggrievement and, therefore, we find no merit to the plaintiffs arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In <em>Light Rigging Co., </em>we considered \u201cGeneral Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-286 [which required] the [department of public utility control] to consider <em>\u2018the existing motor transportation facilities and the effect upon them of granting such certificate, </em>[and] the public need for the service the applicant proposes to render\u2019 when determining whether to grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 176. <em>In Light Rigging Co., </em>the plaintiff trucking companies had standing, not because the department of public utility control was required to consider the public need for the proposed services, but, rather, because their competitive interests were protected by the statute. Id., 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 346, we concluded that \u00a7 16-331 (b), (d) and (h) \u201care meant to protect the public at large and not the interests of individual competitors.\u201d \u201c[T]he legislature has demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>strated an ability to protect existing competitors when it chooses to do so.\u201d Id., 351. When it chooses not to, \u201cthe community, through the office of consumer counsel, is the appropriate party to raise any claims concerning \u2018community needs.\u2019 \u201d Id., 352. We therefore held that because \u00a7 16-331 (b), (d) and (h) did not require the department of public utility control to consider the effects on competition, the cable television company did not allege a legally protected interest under \u00a7 16-331 (b), (d) and (h). Id., 346.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Section 19a-180 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate any ambulance service, rescue service or management service without either a license or a certificate issued by the Office of Emergency Medical Services. ... A certificate shall be issued to any volunteer or municipal ambulance service which shows proof satisfactory to the commissioner that it meets the minimum standards of the commissioner in the areas of training, equipment and personnel. . . . Upon determination by the Office of Emergency Medical Services that an applicant is financially responsible, properly certified and otherwise qualified to operate a commercial ambulance service, the Office of Emergency Medical Services shall issue a license effective for one year to such applicant. . . .\u201d Section 19a-180, by its language, requires the department to issue a license to a qualified applicant without consideration of the effects on competition. We conclude that \u00a7 19a-180 requires the department primarily \u201cto protect the public at large and not the interests of individual competitors\u201d; <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Con</em>trol, supra, 235 Conn. 346; in its decisions whether to grant licenses and certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The legislative history of No. 74-305, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 19, of the 1974 Public Acts (P.A. 74-305), which enacted \u00a7 19a-180, supports our conclusion. The debate regarding P.A. 74-305 focused on the need to regulate a system that had been criticized for abuses and inefficiency. Senator David Berry stated that \u201cthis bill establishes a state coordinated regional system for the delivery of emergency medical services throughout the entire state. It empowers the commission on hospitals and health care to plan, coordinate, and administer this system. It creates within the commission the position of deputy director of emergency medical services who would act as state coordinator for the system.\u201d 17 S. Proc., Pt. 6,1974 Sess., pp. 2403-2404. Representative Virginia Connelly remarked that \u201cswift passage of this bill will save hundreds of lives lost through death and disability because of inadequate or nonexistent emergency medical services.\u201d 17 H. Proc., Pt. 9, 1974 Sess., p. 4320. Representative Albert Webber added that \u201c[t]he bill is designed as an exemplary product of the General Assembly\u2019s concern for all the interests and welfare of our citizens.\u201d Id., p. 4336.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In <em>Light Rigging Co., </em>we did find a legislative intent to protect the existing competitive position of truckers carrying goods. In <em>United Cable Television Services Corp., </em>we found no such intent for cable television companies providing programming to the community at large. In this case, concerning the transportation of patients requiring ambulance services, sometimes in emergency and life-threatening circumstances, it is very clear that the legislature did not intend to protect the competitive advantage or monopoly of an existing service provider, but, rather, the legislature sought to protect the welfare of those in the community in need of those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The plaintiff further argues that other language in \u00a7 19a-180 (a) indicates that the legislature intended for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>competitors to participate in the process of determining whether a need for a new or expanded service exists. Section 19a-180 (a) also provides: \u201cIn considering requests for approval of permits for new or expanded medical emergency services in any region, the Office of Emergency Medical Services shall consult with the emergency medical services council of such region and shall hold a <em>public hearing </em>to determine the necessity for such services. Written notice of such hearing shall be given to current providers in the geographic region where such new or expanded services would be implemented . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language was added to \u00a7 19a-180 (a) pursuant to No. 80-480, \u00a7 2, of the 1980 Public Acts. The legislative history regarding this language adds only that the formal notice of such a hearing would be given to \u201ccurrent providers in the region in order to give them an opportunity to come and comment on the expanded service.\u201d 23 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1980 Sess., p. 2425, remarks of Senator Richard Schneller. We are not convinced that, because the legislature sought to provide a forum for competitors to express their views concerning a new applicant, the legislature intended to protect a competitive advantage for an existing ambulance service company. The legislature intended the department to regulate ambulance services so as to provide the safest, most efficient services possible to the general public, and this amendment ensured that the department would have as much information as possible when making its decisions. Furthermore, because members of the public may participate in the application process to the same extent as existing competitors, the amendment does not elevate existing competitors to an aggrieved status.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The plaintiff points out that \u00a7 19a-180-7 (d)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>department to consider \u201c[t]he impact of the proposed service on existing services in the area.\u201d Given the language of the statute and its paramount purpose, the fact that the department proposed to consider the existence of such services and the impact on those services, along with the seven other factors, does not confer aggrievement on the plaintiff. When a statute and a regulation conflict, the statute must prevail. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 229, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Austin v. Housing Authority, </em>143 Conn. 338, 348-49, 122 A.2d 399 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The plaintiff also argues that \u00a7 19a-180 (c) expressly authorizes it to appeal from the department\u2019s decision because that section provides that an \u201cemergency medical service organization\u201d may appeal. This argument is unavailing. Following the plaintiffs logic would remove the requirement that emergency medical organizations must be <em>aggrieved </em>by a decision of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The plaintiff further contends that not allowing it to appeal would leave every decision of the department to grant new certificates and licenses free from judicial review and that the legislature could not have intended such a result. The legislature, however, entrusted the department with the role of establishing and maintaining a system of ambulance services to serve a vital and supremely important public need. Our decision does not conflict with the goals of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The plaintiff finally argues that, prior to the hearing on Access\u2019 application, the department routinely granted party status to existing competitors, and that the department\u2019s current position that existing competitors have no cognizable interest in the granting of a new license is contrary to its prior conduct. In reaching our decision here, we need not take a position on the prior conduct of the department. Moreover, even if the department had granted party status to the plaintiff, \u201c [m] ere status . . . as a party or a participant in a hearing before an administrative agency does not in and of itself constitute aggrievement for the purposes of appellate <em>review.\u201d Hartford Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>177 Conn. 616, 620, 419 A.2d 346 (1979); see also <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 178; <em>Bakelaar v. West Haven, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> The named plaintiff was formerly known as Ace Ambulance Service, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\"> The department of public health and addiction services was replaced by the department of public health on July 1, 1995.
