J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADP\">The certified issue in this appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s midtrial motion for a continuance to allow for DNA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> testing was an abuse of its discretion that entitled the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>to a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the interests of judicial economy, however, we also address the defendant\u2019s related claims that were not decided by the Appellate Court, namely, that: (1) the trial court improperly denied his posttrial motion for a new trial; and (2) the state\u2019s late disclosure of certain physical evidence deprived the defendant of several of his constitutional rights. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court as to the certified issue and affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the issues raised before, but not decided by, the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In mid-July 1983,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the victim placed an advertisement in a local newspaper seeking a roommate to share her condominium in Suffield. At 10:45 a.m. on July 24, the defendant, Robert M. Brown, called the victim and indicated that he was inquiring about the condominium for his sister, a legal secretary who was relocating to this area from Florida. At the end of the conversation, the defendant told the victim, \u201cwe\u2019ll be over\u201d around noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">At noon, the victim saw the defendant walking briskly toward her front door. By the time she was able to get to the door, he had already entered the foyer. The defendant explained that he had called earlier concerning the condominium. The victim then spent several minutes showing the defendant around the condomin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ium. When they were on the second floor, where the bedrooms were located, the defendant appeared disinterested when the victim showed him the empty bedroom to be rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">After briefly using the bathroom off the empty bedroom, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s bedroom and stood in the doorway. He asked if the bedroom was the victim\u2019s and whether certain of the doors were closet doors. After the victim responded that it was her bedroom and that there were walk-in closets behind the closed doors, she began to feel uncomfortable and attempted to leave the room. As she passed the defendant in the doorway, he grabbed her from behind with his left arm and cupped his left hand over her mouth. In his right hand, he held a knife with a five or six inch curved blade that he displayed to the victim. After a brief struggle, the defendant ordered the victim to remove her eyeglasses. After she had done so, the defendant dragged her approximately six feet into the nearest walk-in closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Once in the closet, the defendant continued to hold the victim with his left arm. With his right arm, he began rummaging through her clothes and found a tie to a tunic top. He then led her out of the closet and removed a pair of tube socks from a dresser drawer. The defendant ordered the victim to lie face down on her bed. After pressing the victim\u2019s face into the bed, he gagged her with one of the socks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also tied her hands behind her back with the tie he had taken from the closet. He then ordered her to turn onto her back. While he was binding and gagging the victim, he repeatedly ordered her not to scream.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The defendant then proceeded to he on the victim and, after forcibly removing her jeans and underwear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>had vaginal intercourse with her. After some time, the defendant abruptly separated himself from the victim and went into the bathroom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In the bathroom, the defendant searched the cabinets until he located a disposable douche. After ordering the victim to squat down over the toilet he twice unsuccessfully attempted to insert the douche applicator into her vagina. On the third attempt, he succeeded and released the fluid contained therein into the victim. The defendant then removed the applicator and wiped the victim\u2019s vaginal area with a yellow hand towel. When he had finished, he ordered the victim to return to the bedroom and lie on the bed. The defendant then wiped down the toilet with the towel. He also asked the victim for a bag in which he could put the used douche applicator, and she provided him with a bag for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The defendant then returned to the bedroom and sat down next to the victim. At that point, she told him that she suffered from hypoglycemia, that her blood sugar level was low and that she felt nauseated and dizzy. In response, the defendant told her that she was only afraid. He also remarked that they could get into a lot of trouble for what they had just done. He further told the victim that he did not want to hurt anyone, but that if he got into trouble he had \u201cfriends\u201d who could \u201ctake care of things\u201d for him. After some brief additional conversation, the defendant pushed the victim down onto the bed and announced that he was considering raping her again. The defendant then covered the victim\u2019s eyes with a pillowcase and penetrated her digitally. She told him that it hurt, and he stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">At that point, he asked the victim if she was expecting anyone. In response, she reminded him of the advertisement in the newspaper. The defendant then picked up the bag containing the douche applicator and hurriedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>left the condominium. Shortly thereafter, the victim was taken by a neighbor to a nearby hospital where a rape kit was constructed. While the victim was at the hospital, hospital personnel called the police and, shortly thereafter, a member of the Suffield police arrived to take a statement from the victim. The next day the victim met with a police sketch artist who composed a picture of her attacker based on her description. The victim also looked at several hundred police photographs that day but did not select any of the photographs as being that of her assailant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Approximately ten weeks later, after the defendant had responded to another classified advertisement in another town placed by a woman seeking a roommate,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the victim was shown an array of five photographs, including one of the defendant. At that time, the victim positively selected the defendant\u2019s photograph as a photograph of her assailant. The defendant subsequently was arrested and tried by a jury on three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a), one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) and one count of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>returned a verdict of guilty on each count, and the trial court subsequently sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of imprisonment of fifty-one years, suspended after thirty-nine years, and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We first address the state\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court erred in concluding that the trial court had abused its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s midtrial motion for a lengthy continuance so that DNA testing could be performed on a stain found in the crotch area of the jeans that the victim had been wearing before and after she was assaulted. The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion by denying the continuance and allowing the jury to deliberate and to reach a verdict in this case before DNA testing of the stain had been completed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>41 Conn. App. 317, 323, 675 A.2d 1369 (1996). We disagree with the Appellate Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u201c \u2018The determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>202 Conn. 385, 394, 521 A.2d 555 (1987). A reviewing court is bound by the principle that \u2018[e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made.\u2019 <em>Ridgeway </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>180 Conn. 533, 538, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>429 A.2d 801 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>[198 Conn. 43, 47, 501 A.2d 752 (1985)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 239-40, 636 A.2d 760 (1994). When determining whether a new trial is required as the result of a trial court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance, we first must determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision denying the request for a continuance was \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cunreasonable].\u201d Id., 240-42. This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, with particular reference to the circumstances presented to and known by the trial court at the time of its ruling. Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u201cThere are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 240. Under the particular facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s action was not only reasonable, but represented a thoughtful balancing of the numerous competing interests known to the court at the time it rendered its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The following additional facts are relevant. At trial, the presentation of the state\u2019s witnesses took from Tuesday, July 13, until Thursday, July 15, 1993. At the end of the day on July 15, after the state had presented its final witness, the defendant was allowed to place on the record information regarding the whereabouts of the jeans that the victim had worn before and after the sexual assaults. The defendant informed the court, through counsel, that: (1) the jeans had been located only recently at the Suf\u00f1eld police department; (2) there was a stain on them containing seminal fluid protein; and (3) the stain had never been tested for blood type or DNA to determine its source. The defendant represented to the court that it was still unknown whether testing would be of any use because of the ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>that had elapsed since the jeans had been collected but that the state was looking into the matter. The court informed the parties that because so little was known about the jeans or the stain at that time and because no formal motion had been made, he was inclined to continue with the presentation of evidence until more helpful information became available and a motion was made. Neither side voiced any objection to the court\u2019s approach at that point.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Before the defendant began to present evidence on the morning of Friday, July 16, there was an additional colloquy on the record between the court and counsel. Both attorneys indicated that they had been operating under the assumption that the jeans had been lost, but that it had recently come to their attention that the jeans were in fact in the possession of the Suffield police department. The defendant then made an oral motion to have the jeans tested for DNA. He represented to the court that he believed that a \u201cpreliminary report\u201d could be prepared within twenty-one days. The state objected, stating that it did not believe that a continuance for several weeks was necessary at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The court denied the requested three week continuance stating that, from its knowledge of DNA testing, it was highly \u201cpessimistic of any meaningful results from the test . . . .\u2019\u2019In denying the continuance, however, the court indicated that after a verdict was returned, the defendant should file a motion for a new trial and that, in connection with that motion, the court would order the testing of the jeans. The court also stated that it would delay sentencing until the testing on the jeans had been completed. In summing up its basis for proceeding to a verdict and ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial once the test results, if any, were known, the court stated that \u201cif the DNA test produces a result one way or the other, we can make sure that justice is served at that point, and the net impact will not be a delay at all. And, indeed, it will resolve the matter quicker than continuing this case, which would, in essence, be a mistrial. And I don\u2019t think it would be fair to bring a jury back in a month or two months. Surely, if the test \u2014 if the state does it \u2014 if I continue the case, and the state does a test, and it says the DNA material is the defendant\u2019s material, then it would not surprise me for the defense to ask for a test, a separate test, and I\u2019d probably grant that. And then the jury would be back here in, perhaps, October or November. And to ask them to remember the July testimony, having gone back to their lives, would not be very fair to them. . . . All of this assumes that there\u2019s going to be a sample in these ten-year-old jeans, that has not been refrigerated in any manner, that\u2019s going to be able to be meaningfully tested. So we are way down the factual pike, and further down the pike than we\u2019ll ever get. But, in any event, we can deal with each of those facts as it goes.\u201d Finally, the court acceded to the defendant\u2019s request to permit him to delay formally resting his case until the following Tuesday, July 20, which was the next scheduled court date, so that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>could present to the jury any new evidence pertaining to the jeans that might become available over the weekend.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The defendant then began to present his defense. He called to the stand Sanders Hawkins, the state\u2019s chief toxicologist. In response to the defendant\u2019s questioning, Hawkins testified that no semen had been found in the rape kit samples that had been taken from the victim\u2019s mouth, rectal area and vaginal area shortly after the assaults. Hawkins stated that his laboratory had examined the victim\u2019s bedspread, as well as the hand towel that had been used to wipe the victim\u2019s vaginal area after the douching had been completed, and that neither item contained any seminal fluid. Hawkins also testified that his laboratory had examined the victim\u2019s shirt and jeans, and that a seminal stain had been found on the crotch area of the victim\u2019s jeans, but that that stain had not been tested for blood type when the evidence was first received in 1983.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The jeans thereafter apparently had been returned to the Suffield police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The defendant then questioned Hawkins regarding the fact that no DNA testing had been performed on the stain on the jeans. Hawkins testified that DNA testing had not been available for rape cases in 1983, but that DNA testing had become available sometime thereafter. He added, however, that he could not give an opinion as to whether the stain on the jeans in this case could have been tested because he had not seen it and, therefore, did not know the condition or size of the sample. On cross-examination, Hawkins testified that all of the work on the evidence in this case had been done in August, 1983, and that any test results and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>procedures used by his laboratory are equally available to the defense and the state.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On Tuesday morning, before the jury was brought into the courtroom, counsel for both the state and the defendant presented the court with updated information pertaining to the stain on the jeans. The state represented to the court that some preliminary blood grouping testing had been done on the jeans but that, because the victim and the defendant shared the same blood grouping, the results were inconclusive with respect to identifying the defendant as the depositor of the stain. The state also noted that blood subgrouping tests, which might provide more useful results, could be done but that such testing would take an additional two to three days. The state also pointed out that no DNA testing had been done up until that point, and that it was not known whether there was a sufficient sample to conduct such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The defendant then renewed his motion for a continuance. In response to an inquiry from the court regarding the projected length of the proposed continuance, the defendant made clear that he sought sufficient time for both the blood subgrouping testing as well as DNA testing. In response, the court pointed out to the parties that the state was at a greater risk if the case proceeded to a verdict because the state would not be allowed to retry the defendant if he was acquitted and the DNA testing subsequently yielded inculpatory results. In con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>trast, if the defendant was convicted and the DNA test results were exculpatory, the defendant probably would succeed on his motion for a new trial. The state represented that it understood the risk and that it had communicated that risk to the victim, who was then residing in Germany but had returned to Connecticut to testify at the trial, and that the state and the victim agreed that the case nonetheless should be given to the jury without further delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The court again denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance \u201con the theory that subsequent testing will be done in the context of the court\u2019s orders in conjunction with a motion for a new trial, because I think we have a fair and complete set of evidence that both parties were prepared to try the case on. I know this is the second time this case has started, having started earlier in March, only to be mistried by some other piece of evidence which had arisen in an unusual fashion. So that I think the interest of justice is served by letting this jury, some of whose members we had promised to finish this week or next at the latest, so that they won\u2019t be rushed, to let this jury go to verdict with the evidence that they have. And if there is, indeed, evidence of significance that did not come before them, we\u2019ll deal with that in a motion for a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Shortly thereafter, the jury was brought in and closing arguments were presented by counsel. In closing, the defendant emphasized to the jury the lack of scientific evidence connecting him to the crime. \u201cI would suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that it\u2019s the forensic, the scientific evidence, which is not like human testimony in the sense that it rarely, if ever, makes a mistake. You have the hospital records of [the victim]. They indicate that no sperm was found. . . . You heard evidence concerning the toxicology reports, the lab reports. There is not one piece of physical evidence in this entire case that ties [the defendant] to this crime. The yellow towel that [the victim] indicated was used to clean her was tested and nothing was found on that yellow towel, according to Dr. Hawkins. The jeans that had a semen stain were apparently never tested. The state, apparently, has not introduced evidence concerning any kind of testing, whether it be blood typing or DNA. And the defense, as pointed out by the state, had equal availability for the evidence. But the burden of proof, ladies and gentlemen, is on the state, not on the defense. Just please keep that in mind when you consider that piece of evidence.\u201d The following day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">As the defendant points out, we concluded in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 242, that \u201can appellate court should limit its assessment of the reasonableness of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to a consideration of those factors, on the record, that were presented to the trial court, or of which that court was aware, at the time of its ruling on the motion for a continuance.\u201d The unique facts of this case known to the trial court at the time it ruled on the defendant\u2019s final motion for a continuance on the last day of evidence point ineluctably to the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s decision not to grant the requested continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The first relevant fact before the trial court was that the seminal fluid protein found on the jeans logically could not be connected to the sexual assault in issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 160, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990) (no indication that witness for whom continuance was sought would provide testimony favorable to defendant); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 395-96 (\u201ccounsel's representation that [the witness] was willing to analyze the hair evidence and \u2018would be in a position to testify\u2019 \u201d speculative and insufficient to require continuance). It is uncontroverted that the attacker removed the victim\u2019s jeans and underwear and threw them on the floor before the first assault occurred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is further uncontroverted that the attacker forced the victim to submit to douching after he had intercourse with her and that he subsequently wiped her vaginal area with a towel. Only after the attacker had engaged in these precautions to ensure that no semen was present and had left the condominium did the victim put her jeans back on. The trial court also knew, at the time it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, that the attacker\u2019s efforts to remove any trace of semen from the victim and the scene apparently had been successful, given the fact that no trace of semen was found in or around the victim\u2019s vaginal area and that there was no semen on either the towel or the victim\u2019s bedspread. The trial court, therefore, reasonably could have concluded that the stain on the jeans was wholly unrelated to the sexual assaults in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>In addition to the lack of evidence connecting the victim\u2019s attacker to the stain, the trial court had before it the fact that the jeans had been in police custody for ten years and that there was no indication that any steps had been taken to preserve the stained area for future testing. At the time that it ruled on the defendant\u2019s final request for a continuance, the trial court had no information before it indicating whether DNA testing was possible or whether such testing would shed any light on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The trial court also had knowledge that it would be some time, even if testing was possible, before any DNA testing could be completed. See <em>State </em>v. Hamilton, supra, 228 Conn. 240 (likely length of delay relevant consideration when deciding request for continuance). The defendant himself estimated that it would take twenty-one days for \u201cpreliminary\u201d DNA testing and three months for \u201cfull blown\u201d DNA testing. The court estimated that if it granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance for DNA testing, the trial before the jury would not be resumed until October or November.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Taking into consideration the length of the requested continuance and its potentially negative effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>jury, combined with the minimal chance that the testing, if performed, would provide information either connecting the defendant to the crime or exonerating him, the trial court informed the defendant that the case would proceed to a verdict and that sentencing would be delayed until any testing requested by the defendant had been completed. The court also indicated that, in the event that the test results were exculpatory, it would be inclined to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The defendant essentially had the best of both worlds. He was able to argue to the jury that the state, which bore the burden of proof, had presented no scientific evidence connecting him to the crime, and he specifically highlighted the lack of testing on the jeans. The defendant made that argument with the knowledge that, even if he was convicted, he probably would be granted a new trial if the test results proved exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">On the basis of the unique circumstances of this case, we cannot agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> after DNA testing had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>been completed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On March 30,1994, more than eight months after the jury had returned its verdict, the state and the defendant appeared in court to be heard concerning the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The parties at that time presented a written stipulation to the court regarding the testing of the jeans. They stipulated that, during the pretrial stages of the defendant\u2019s case, they both had believed that the jeans in question had been lost by the Suffield police department and that the availability of the jeans did not come to their attention until the middle of the trial. They further stipulated that a cutting from the stained area of the jeans found to contain seminal fluid protein was sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) laboratory in Washington, D.C., for RFLP<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> DNA testing, but that the DNA was either insufficient or too degraded to yield results. A second cutting from the stained area of the jeans was subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>quently sent to the FBI laboratory with a request that both cuttings be subjected to PCR<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> DNA testing. The results of those tests revealed that the defendant could not be excluded as the depositor of the fluid on the first cutting from the stained area, but that he could be excluded as the depositor of the fluid on the second cutting. The parties stipulated that the victim, her husband, who at the time of the assaults had been her boyfriend, and the defendant were all \u201cpossible donors of the DNA detected in [the first] cutting.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In explaining the meaning of the written stipulation to the court, defense counsel stated: \u201cI think that what this stipulation that we\u2019ve offered to Your Honor essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>tially boils down to mean \u2014 and if I thought that it meant more or less, I would suggest that we probably needed expert testimony \u2014 I am satisfied, after my discussions with Agent Dedman of the FBI, Elaine Pegliaro from the state lab, as well as talking to people from the Life Codes lab, that the work that the FBI did is certainly acceptable to the defense \u2014 and that <em>the bottom line is an inconclusive result. </em>This does not exonerate [the defendant]. It does not identify [the defendant] as being the depositor of that stain. I think that, essentially, that\u2019s what our stipulation means and should mean to you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The court then asked the defense if the testing results, in view of their inconclusive nature, would have been admissible. In response, defense counsel stated: \u201cWell, I would suggest, first of all, that, in all probability, it would <em>not </em>\u2014 this <em>evidence would not have been proffered by the defense. </em>It would have been proffered by the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After further discussion with the court, during which the court plainly indicated that it would not have allowed the state to offer the inconclusive DNA results at trial, defense counsel attempted to clarify to the court whether the defense would have sought to introduce the inconclusive test results on behalf of the defendant. \u201cI simply don\u2019t know. I simply don\u2019t know. I suspect \u2014 if everything had gone as had gone, I suspect not. But I \u2014 that\u2019s real hard. And it\u2019s just as if \u2014 it\u2019s real hard to know what questions I would have asked Dr. Hawkins, if any, concerning this evidence, with this information \u2014 you know, armed with this information. I mean, clearly, in this case, the defense was misidentification and the defense was that this was not [the defendant] \u2014 and this was not [the defendant\u2019s] stain. And so it\u2019s real hard for me to call these shots now, except with regard to how we saw the evidence come in. So I suspect that, yes, if that scenario took place, that it probably <em>would not be likely </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>that the defense would proffer it. </em>But I think that the state would. I really do.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Understandably confused, the trial court asked: \u201cBut in any event, you\u2019re hypothecating that [if] the state would have had this evidence that you anticipate it would have introduced to point the finger at your client?\u201d Alter the defendant responded in the affirmative, the court followed up by asking: \u201cAnd because the state didn\u2019t have this, you were somehow hurt?\u201d The defendant then responded in the negative, and explained that the problem was that he had been forced, during trial, to ask Hawkins about the lack of testing on the jeans in order to highlight the fact that the state had not had them tested. In response, the state had inquired on cross-examination whether the testing procedures and results from Hawkins\u2019 laboratory would have been equally available to the defense and Hawkins testified that they would have been so available. The defendant claimed that he was harmed by his lack of knowledge regarding DNA because it had led him to make a tactical decision that had opened the door to the state\u2019s inquiry about the availability of testing to the defense. The defendant argued that, from the state\u2019s cross-examination, the jury might have inferred consciousness of guilt because the defendant did not have the jeans tested.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The trial court was unpersuaded. \u201cThe Hobson\u2019s choice that the defense claims it was forced to make is, in the opinion of the court, nothing more difficult or troubling than the hundreds of instantaneous tactical decisions that trial counsel make in the course of a hotly-contested piece of litigation. And, indeed, with the benefit of that 20-20 hindsight that is the clearest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>vision in the world, the evidence could not have come out any better for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u201cWhether, after months of reflection, the defense might have wished to have pointed out to the jury that the availability to the defense was more limited than the availability to the prosecution ... is no large thing. This is a case where the evidence, quite compellingly, identified the defendant. It also had powerful testimony that the defendant committed one of the three sexual assaults that he committed on the victim in this case that same day, with the use of a douche applicator to remove, the jury was entitled to infer, evidence of semen from the scene of the crime, if you will. So that, in that context, in this case, the fact that seminal stains that may or may not have been on these ten year old jeans were not tested, could not have been factored in the jury\u2019s mind at all. The defense did an absolutely world-class job between tooth repair<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the calling of Dr. Hawkins to point out that the DNA flags that the defense was waving around the courtroom had not been unfurled by the state. And the defense, again, with hindsight could not have had a better shot at raising reasonable doubt than if the testing had been done, and we mistried the case, and we started all over again, because we certainly couldn\u2019t have kept the jury from July until the following March waiting for this testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cThe court has considerable doubt as to whether or not, in view of the inconclusive tests, that the testing results would have been admissible, if offered. And so the case, in playing out, would have had the same testimony as it did have without the questions about the fact that there were no tests on the seminal stains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>in the jeans, which, in spite of the state\u2019s cross-examination question of Dr. Hawkins, that the defense might have been able to have those tests done as well as the prosecution. That testimony was helpful to the defense, on balance, far more helpful than injurious. So the motion for a new trial portion of the motion for order of testing and new trial, dated July 23, 1993, is denied, since the court finds that there was no error that the defense has established which was materially injurious to the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Appellate review of the denial of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902 is governed by an abuse of discretion standard. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>210 Conn. 199, 213, 554 A.2d 1048 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 264, 487 A.2d 545 (1985). We disagree with the defendant that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Section 902 (2), upon which the defendant relied in his motion to the trial court, requires a criminal defendant seeking a new trial to establish that a claimed trial error was \u201cmaterially injurious\u201d to him. Reduced to its essence, the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal is that the trial court\u2019s rulings that deprived him of the opportunity to offer DNA evidence at trial were materially injurious. The defendant cannot demonstrate from the record that his inability to present the DNA evidence to the jury was materially injurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">In his briefs to the Appellate Court and to this court, the defendant has changed dramatically his position regarding the nature of the -DNA test results. When arguing his motion for a new trial, the defendant represented to the trial court that, after consulting with three independent experts, he was satisfied that the DNA test results were inconclusive. In response to direct questions from the trial court, the defendant also repeatedly asserted that he probably would not even have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>attempted to introduce the test results into evidence. When asked by the trial court to clarify his position, the defendant responded that his argument pertaining to the DNA testing was that he had been forced to prepare his cross-examination of Hawkins without the benefit of the knowledge of the test results. He argued that he was somehow prejudiced by Hawkins\u2019 testimony on cross-examination to the effect that any testing results and procedures were equally available to the defense as well as to the state. In his brief to this court, the defendant now claims that the DNA evidence was \u201cexculpatory\u201d and \u201ccertainly would have been useful to the defense at the time of trial . . . .\u2019\u2019In his brief to the Appellate Court, the defendant argued that that court should reverse the trial court\u2019s decision on his motion for a new trial because the \u201cexculpatory evidence which [the defendant] obtained, post-trial, was so compelling that the trial court improperly refused to rule that the verdict was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence produced by the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">It is difficult to fathom, in light of the record before the trial court, how the defendant can argue that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a new trial. It would have been strange, indeed, for the trial court to have ordered a new trial when the defendant himself stated that the results were inconclusive and that, in any event, he probably would not have introduced those results into evidence. By espousing arguments that he failed to make at trial and that are completely at odds with the arguments that he did make at trial, the defendant cannot now demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. The defendant cannot meet his burden of proving material injury under \u00a7 902 on the basis of his inability to present to the jury test results that he himself characterized as inconclusive and that he probably would not have introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Even if we were to allow the defendant to switch arguments on appeal and to assert that the evidence was exculpatory and that he would introduce that evidence on a retrial, he still cannot show an abuse of discretion. First, as discussed at some length in our treatment of the defendant\u2019s first claim, there is no evidence in the record connecting the victim\u2019s assailant to the stain on the jeans. The assailant forcibly removed the victim\u2019s jeans before any sexual contact was made and the victim did not put the jeans back on until after her attacker had gone to extreme lengths to remove any trace of semen. No semen was found on any of the vaginal swabs taken from the victim, nor was any semen found on the victim\u2019s bedspread or on the towel that the attacker had used to wipe the victim\u2019s vaginal area after he had first, cleansed the vaginal area with a douche. The defendant\u2019s argument on a hypothetical retrial would have to be that despite the absence of semen anywhere else, some of the assailant\u2019s semen somehow had found its way solely to the victim\u2019s jeans that had been on the floor of the victim\u2019s bedroom while the sexual assaults were taking place on the victim\u2019s bed and in her bathroom. He also would have to concede to a new jury that one of the two cuttings from the single stain did contain DNA consistent with his own DNA. As the trial court aptly noted, such arguments would be weaker than those presented by the defendant at the first trial.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We consequently are unpersuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the defendant\u2019s inability to present such evidence was materially injurious. This is particularly so in light of the overwhelming nature of the state\u2019s evidence, including, but not limited to, the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant that the defendant himself described in his Appellate Court brief as \u201cvivid\u201d and \u201cdetailed, direct and forceful.\u201d We cannot say, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u2019The defendant\u2019s final unresolved claim is that he was deprived of due process and his rights to a fair trial and to present a defense by the state\u2019s untimely disclosure of the existence of the jeans. It is undisputed that \u201c[t]he principles of due process require the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence that is material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>[373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.

On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court should have granted him either a continuance or a mistrial, and the Appellate Court concluded that either remedy would have been appropriate. For the same reasons that we conclude that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance was reasonable, we also conclude that the trial court did not rule improperly in denying the motion for a mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 282, 612 A.2d 45 (1992) (decision to grant mistrial within sound discretion of trial court, and defendant bears heavy burden of proving occurrence was so prejudicial as to vitiate proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> We are puzzled at the assertion of the dissent, <em>Berdon, J., </em>that there is no evidence in the record as to whether the jeans were in such proximity to the assailant that the stain could have been deposited during the incident.

In its argument to the court on the final motion for a continuance, the state clearly stated that no steps had been taken with regard to DNA testing and that it would \u201ctake some time\u201d to determine \u201cif there is a sufficient sample, or sufficient material within the sampling to do a DNA test . . . .\u201d Defense counsel did state that \u201cwe know that there is at least some testing that can be done on the blue jean[s],\u201d but defense counsel was clearly talking about blood subgrouping tests, not DNA tests. Such an agreement, had one existed, would have directly controverted the testimony of Hawldns, the only witness who had any knowledge of the testing of the jeans.

Trial defense counsel made those representations to the court, howmver, only after speaking with representatives from the FBI, the state lab and the Life Codes lab. Although the contents of those three conversations are not part, of the record, we presume that the experts told defense counsel that the results were inconclusive and that defense counsel merely communicated the consensus of the experts to the court. The dissent\u2019s dissatisfaction with trial counsel\u2019s representations is based entirely upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the fact that one of the two cuttings that was tested contained DNA that was not deposited by the defendant, but may well have been deposited by the victim and/or her husband. Although the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel is not before us, we simply note that trial defense counsel apparently was unwilling to purchase the marginal benefit to be derived from the evidence pertaining to the second cutting at the cost of placing before the jury evidence that the first cutting contained DNA consistent with the defendant\u2019s DNA. On its face, such strategy, after consultation with three independent experts, provides no basis for the dissent\u2019s perceived implicit finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, or of \u201cdamned foolishness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b489-9\">MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnB\">concurring and dissenting.

This court has answered that question in the negative. Now, \u201c[i]n the interests of judicial economy,\u201d this court also upholds the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial after his conviction based on those DNA results and affirms the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">This court did not choose to decide this appeal itself when it was originally filed, but chose, instead, to transfer it to the Appellate Court. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c); Practice Book \u00a7 4023. The Appellate Court acted only upon the issue of whether a midtrial continuance for DNA testing should have been granted.

The majority today commits a grave injustice by misconstruing the trial record and by concluding that the defendant is not entitled to a new trial despite the discovery of exculpatory evidence that was not available during trial. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a continuance and for a mistrial when the defendant sought to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on seminal stains found on the blue jeans worn by the victim at the time of the assault, when the whereabouts of the jeans were discovered for the first time during the trial. Furthermore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial once the results of the DNA testing became available following the trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In my view, when the defendant advised the trial court of the state\u2019s discovery of the jeans worn by the victim at the time of the assault, the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance or, in the alternative, should have granted the motion for a mistrial, in order for the defendant to obtain the results of DNA testing on the seminal stains found on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the crotch area of the jeans. I recognize that the granting of a continuance is generally a matter of discretion; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haye, </em>214 Conn. 476, 483, 572 A.2d 974 (1990); but when the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to present a defense and to a jury trial are implicated, that discretion either evaporates or is severely limited. The sole issue in the trial was one of identification and this objective identification DNA evidence was crucial. Although I can understand the trial court\u2019s concerns that this was a crime that occurred in 1983, that there previously had been a mistrial at the request of the state because of the unavailability of the victim,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the victim had already testified in this trial, these concerns pale in comparison to the deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and the subsequent loss of his liberty for fifty-one years \u2014 the sentences he received in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The results of the DNA testing that was eventually performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and that was available to the trial court when it decided the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial are not disputed. The DNA testing was performed on two cuttings containing seminal stains taken from the jeans. The testing consisted of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) tests, which are highly specific, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are less specific, but still reliable. Although there were no results on the first cutting under the RFLP test because the seminal stain was insufficient or too degraded,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the PCR test did produce results. The PCR test on the first cutting revealed that the defendant could not be excluded as the depositor of the semen, nor could the victim\u2019s husband, who at the time of the assault had been her boyfriend, or 20 percent of the population. The PCR test on the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>cutting, however, <em>did exclude </em>the defendant as a possible depositor of the semen. The following chart, set forth in the defendant\u2019s brief, summarizes these tests:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">Although the testing results on the first cutting could not exclude the defendant as a possible depositor, the testing results on the second cutting clearly exonerated him as the depositor of that semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-19\">The majority concludes that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance essentially by performing its own fact-finding. Specifically, the majority states that \u201c[t]he first relevant fact before the trial court was that the seminal fluid protein found on the jeans logically could not be connected to the sexual assault in issue.\u201d The trial court, however, never made this finding, and the majority fails to demonstrate where, in the record, the trial court took this into consideration. Indeed, the reason that the trial court did not make this finding is simple. If it were known that there were seminal stains on the jeans the victim was wearing and that one of the stains was exculpatory, <em>both </em>the state and defense counsel would have focused the examination of the victim on whether the exculpatory stain could have been deposited during the encounter. If that had occurred, there would have been a record in order to determine whether the jeans were in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>proximity to the assailant that the stain could have been deposited during the incident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Furthermore, the majority claims that, \u201c[a]t the time that it ruled on the defendant\u2019s final request for a continuance, the trial court had no information before it indicating whether DNA testing was possible or whether such testing would shed any light on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. \u201d Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the state and defense counsel both agreed that it was possible to perform testing on the seminal stains.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the majority rationalizes its conclusion that the trial court properly denied the motion for a continuance in light of the amount of time necessary to complete the testing, stating that \u201c[t]he defendant himself estimated that it would take twenty-one days for \u2018preliminary\u2019 DNA testing and three months for \u2018full-blown\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>DNA testing.\u201d In fact, defense counsel argued for, at a minimum, a continuance for two to three days in order to perform subgrouping tests, claiming that \u201c[i]t would seem to me that, as a matter of two to three days, rather than twenty-one days for preliminary DNA testing, or the three months for a full-blown DNA testing, that it would be worth, in the interest of justice, taking those two to three days to see what the results of that testing would be.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">This is not a case of a defendant who sought a continuance because of some failure on his part to muster the evidence or as a result of any other personal responsibility for the delay, but, rather, he sought the continuance because of the state\u2019s negligence. It was during the defendant\u2019s trial that the state disclosed, for the first time, that the jeans the victim was wearing when she was assaulted were discovered, and that those jeans showed a positive finding of semen. Therefore, in my view, the motions for a continuance and for a mistrial must be viewed through the lens of the state negligently failing to produce the jeans prior to trial, and thereby denying the defendant an opportunity to perform DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Not only was the defendant deprived of his constitutional rights to a jury trial and to present a defense; see part II of this dissent; but he was also deprived of his statutory rights. General Statutes \u00a7 54-86k (a) provides in relevant part that DNA testing \u201cshall be deemed to be . . . reliable scientific . . . evidence [and] may be admitted to prove or disprove the identity of any person.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, this court has held that the results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>DNA testing can be compelling evidence in a case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 279, 604 A.2d 793 (1992) (\u201c[b]lood typing tests, at least insofar as they exclude someone from sexual contact, are generally acknowledged to be absolutely reliable when the sample is not contaminated\u201d). Irrespective of which standard of review is to be applied, the trial court improperly denied the motion for a continuance or the alternative motion for a mistrial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Moreover, the trial court improperly refused to grant a new trial once the results of the DNA testing became available subsequent to the jury verdict finding the defendant guilty. The majority, in its recitation of the hearing on the motion for a new trial, takes trial defense counsel's comments out of context and disregards the plain language of the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding the results of DNA testing performed on the two cuttings taken from the victim\u2019s jeans. The majority disingenuously states that \u201c[t]he results of those tests revealed that the defendant could not be excluded as the depositor of the fluid on the first cutting from the stained area, but that he <em>could be excluded </em>as the depositor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the fluid on the second cutting.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In fact, the stipulation entered into by the defendant and the state provide in relevant part that \u201c[t]he defendant <em>is excluded </em>as being a possible donor of the DNA detected in the seminal stain found in the second cutting.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Indeed, the plain language of the stipulation reflects that the results of the DNA testing were clearly exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The majority, however, asserts that defense counsel conceded that the testing results were not exculpatory. This simply is not the case. In explaining the significance of the stipulation, defense counsel stated: \u201cI think that what this stipulation that we\u2019ve offered to Your Honor essentially boils down to mean \u2014 and if I thought that it meant more or less, I would suggest that we probably needed expert testimony \u2014 I am satisfied, after my discussions with [both an FBI agent], Elaine Pegliaro from the state lab, as well as talking to people from the Life Codes lab, that the work that the FBI did is certainly acceptable to the defense \u2014 and that the bottom line is an inconclusive result. This does not exonerate [the defendant]. <em>It does not identify [the </em>defendant] <em>as being the depositor of that stain. </em>I think that, essentially, that\u2019s what our stipulation means and should mean to you.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Taking into consideration defense counsel\u2019s argument to the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>together with the clear language of the stipulation, it becomes clear that defense counsel must have meant that the DNA testing on the first cutting did not exonerate the defendant because it did not exclude him, the victim, the victim\u2019s husband or 20 percent of the population. But, clearly, the testing on the second cutting excluded the defendant and, for this reason, it was exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The majority attempts to make much of the fact that defense counsel characterized the DNA testing results as \u201cinconclusive.\u201d According to the majority, because defense counsel stated that the results were inconclusive, the results are therefore inadmissible and of no value. The majority, however, simply misses the point. Defense counsel obviously recognized that the results were inconclusive as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence because the seminal stain on the second cutting could have been deposited by a third party. This, however, does not mean that the testing results could not raise a reasonable doubt with a jury with respect to whether the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The majority further justifies the denial of the motion for a new trial because of defense counsel's alleged concession before the trial court that he would not have attempted to introduce the results of the DNA testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>into evidence anyway. Contrary to the majority\u2019s recitation of the proceedings, defense counsel actually stated that he would not have proffered the evidence because he would have expected that the prosecution would have done so as part of its case-in-chief: \u201cWell, I would suggest, first of all, that, in all probability, it would not \u2014 this evidence would not have been proffered by the defense. <em>It would have been proffered by the state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Furthermore, when the trial court attempted to have defense counsel explain what might have happened had the results been available, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201cThe Court: But, in any event, you agree with me the defense would not have proffered this evidence, had it been available to the defense in July of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I can\u2019t say that.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u201cThe Court: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I simply don\u2019t know. I simply don\u2019t know. I suspect \u2014 if everything had gone as had gone, I suspect not. But I \u2014 that\u2019s real hard to know. And it\u2019s just as if \u2014 it\u2019s real hard to know what questions I would have asked [Sanders Hawkins, the state\u2019s chief toxicologist], if any, concerning this evidence, with this information \u2014 you know, armed with this information. I mean, clearly, in this case, the defense was misidentification and the defense was that this was not [the defendant] \u2014 and this was not [the defendant\u2019s] stain. And so it\u2019s real hard for me to call those shots now, except with regard to how we saw the evidence come in.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u201cSo I suspect that, yes, if that scenario took place, that it probably would not be likely that the defense would proffer it. But I think that the state would. I really do.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Nevertheless, even if defense counsel\u2019s statements could be construed as a concession that he would not have proffered the evidence, a new trial is still required. In my view, any agreement by defense counsel that he would not have attempted to proffer the testing results would be one of those \u201ctruly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 25, 664 A.2d 719 (1995); and, therefore, constitutes plain error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, if defense counsel had represented to the trial court that he would not have sought to introduce the exculpatory DNA evidence, it would have gone beyond plain error\u2014 it would have been, based upon the record before us, damned foolishness.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The trial court\u2019s failure to grant a continuance, a mistrial or a new trial deprived the defendant of his right to present a defense and to a jury trial under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has made it clear that the right of an accused to present testimony that is relevant and material may not be denied arbitrarily. <em>Washington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 23, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 161, 698 A.2d 739 (1997) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 277, 113 S. Ct. 2078, 124 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1993), the United States Supreme Court stated, in a unanimous decision, that the sixth amendment right to a jury trial is \u201c \u2018fundamental to the American scheme of justice,\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, is applicable to the states. The court further held: \u201cThe right includes, of course, as its most important element, the right to have the jury, rather than the judge, reach the requisite finding of \u2018guilty.\u2019 \u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 210, 445 A.2d 314 (1982) (\u201c \u2018[i]t must always be borne in mind that litigants have a constitutional right to have issues of fact decided by the jmy and not by the court\u2019 \u201d). The court in <em>Sullivan </em>emphasized that \u201c [i]t would not satisfy the Sixth Amendment to have a jury determine that the defendant is probably guilty, and then leave it up to the judge to determine . . . whether he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 278. In the present case, however, that is essentially what happened: the jury heard some of the evidence and decided guilt, and then the judge heard the additional evidence relating to the DNA testing results. This precluded the jury from hearing this clearly exculpatory evidence. This, in my view, does not satisfy the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Moreover, as the court in <em>Sullivan </em>held, harmless error analysis would be inapplicable. \u201cHarmless-error review looks, we have said, to the basis on which \u2018the jury actually rested its verdict.\u2019 . . . The inquiry, in other words, is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error. That must be so, because to hypothesize a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>verdict that was never in fact rendered \u2014 no matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might be \u2014 would violate the jury-trial guarantee.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 279. In the absence of a proper jury verdict \u2014 which in this case means a verdict rendered by a jury that also heard the evidence relating to the DNA testing results \u2014 \u201c[t]here is no object, so to speak, upon which harmless error scrutiny can operate.\u201d Id., 280. \u201cThere being no jury verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt, the question whether the same verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The trial court in this case denied the defendant the opportunity to present to the jury the exculpatory evidence of the DNA testing results. Because the trial court\u2019s denial is presumptively prejudicial to the defendant, and because harmless error review is not applicable, a new trial is required.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I would affirm the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>of the Appellate Court and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> agree with Justice McDonald, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, with respect to his assertion that this court should not reach the question of whether the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial because the parties have not had the opportunity to brief this issue fully before this court. Indeed, this court certified this appeal, limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s <em>motion for a continuance </em>for DNA testing, and (2) the error was so prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial?\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>238 Conn. 901, 677 A.2d 1376 (1996). In other words, the court today reaches the issue regarding the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial despite the fact that the issue was neither addressed in the parties\u2019 briefs submitted to this court nor during oral argument. Simply put, \u201cthe majority of this court has deprived the defendant of his fundamental right of due process to be heard before this court \u2018in a meaningful manner.\u2019 <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S. Ct. 1187, 14 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1965).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 556, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994) (Berdon, <em>J., </em>dissenting). Nevertheless, because the majority reaches and decides this issue on the merits, I am compelled to express my disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The majority professes to reach this issue \u201c[i]n the interests of judicial economy . . . .\u201d Curiously, the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue turns the principle of judicial economy on its head in light of the fact that this case surely will return to the judicial system on a meritorious petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a result of this court\u2019s implicit finding of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

That test would take a minimum of two days, probably three, and we have not done anything with respect to DNA yet. It is my understanding that the process has to be begun and, at some point in the process, they can make a determination, if there is a sufficient sample, or sufficient material within the sampling to do a DNA test, but that would also take some time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Furthermore, defense counsel stated: \u201cI think that we have gotten to a point where, number one, we know that there is at least some testing that can be done on the blue jean item that tested for a semen stain.

The court shall, regardless of the results of the DNA analysis, if any, consider such other relevant evidence of the identity of the accused as shall be admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">\u201c(b) If the results of the DNA analysis tend to exculpate the accused, the prosecuting authority shall disclose such exculpatory information or material to the accused in accordance with section 54-86c. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b496-14\"> It is paradoxical that the state previously had been granted a mistrial because it did not have its evidence available \u2014 that is, the victim was not available to testify, whereas, in this trial, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial when the defendant was unable to produce all of his evidence because of the state\u2019s negligence in\u2019 not producing the victim\u2019s jeans. Furthermore, I note that, although the issue is not before us, in the absence of the defendant\u2019s consent to a new trial, the first mistrial would raise serious questions with respect to the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell, </em>221 Conn. 407, 413-14, 605 A.2d 539, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 904, 113 S. Ct. 297, 121 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1992) (\u201c[j]eopardy attaches once the jury has been selected and sworn\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> The parties\u2019 stipulation provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u201c5. The defendant is excluded as being a possible donor of the DNA detected in the seminal stain found in the second cutting.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\u201c6. The defendant cannot be excluded as a donor of the DNA detected in the stain in the first cutting.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u201c7. The defendant is among six groups of people having alleles with a DNA DQ Alpha Type 2. The frequency of these subgroups in the Caucasian population totals approximately 20 percent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86k (a) establishes not only the admissibility of DNA testing results, but also provides that \u201c[t]he court shall, regardless of the results of the DNA analysis, if any, consider such other relevant evidence of the identity of the accused as shall be admissible in evidence.\u201d See footnote 7 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion; see footnote 24 of the majority opinion; I express no dissatisfaction with defense counsel\u2019s representation to the trial court that the testing was inconclusive \u2014 in fact, defense counsel\u2019s statement is entirely accurate with respect to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence based on the results of the DNA testing. I mention ineffective assistance of counsel in footnote 1 of this dissent, not on the basis of what defense counsel did or did not do at trial, but, rather, on the majority\u2019s mischaracterization of the defense. Simply put, if defense counsel had conducted the defense in the manner characterized by the majority, that is, by conceding that the results of the DNA testing were not exculpatory and that he would not have proffered those results, that would serve as the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\"> Indeed, the confusion concerning defense counsel\u2019s remarks strongly supports Justice McDonald\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion in which he states that this court should not decide the issue regarding the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>for a new trial without the benefit of complete briefing. See footnote 1 of this dissent. This iryustice to the defendant is underscored by the fact that the majority interprets defense counsel\u2019s comments to the trial court by \u201cpresuming\u201d what defense counsel\u2019s conversations with the experts entailed. See footnote 24 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\"> The majority states that, even if the defendant were allowed to \u201cswitch\u201d his argument regarding the testing results on appeal, the defendant is nevertheless unable to demonstrate an abuse of discretion. The majority reaches this conclusion by determining, in hindsight and with allegedly unassailable acumen, that the seminal stains found on the victim\u2019s jeans could notpossibly have been deposited by the defendant. In my view, the majority is simply acting as a thirteenth juror \u2014 a role that is not within the province of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> In <em>Sullivan, </em>the court further recognized another mode of analysis that would lead to the same conclusion that harmless error analysis would not apply. The court noted that, in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 307, 309, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991), a distinction was drawn between \u201cstructural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by harmless-error standards,\u201d and trial errors that occur \u201cduring the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 281. The court concluded: \u201cDenial of the right to a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is certainly an error of the former sort, the jury guarantee being a basic protectio [n] whose precise effects are unmeasurable, but without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function .... The right to trial by jury reflects, we have said, a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered. . . . The deprivation of that right, with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, unquestionably qualifies as structural error.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 281-82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> Even if the defendant were required to show prejudice, the wrongful exclusion of the evidence of the DNA testing results is clearly prejudicial. Although it is not conclusive because the seminal stain could have been deposited by another male, it is clearly powerful exculpatory evidence in a case in which, as here, the sole issue is one of identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
