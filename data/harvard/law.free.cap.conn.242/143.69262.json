A jury found the defendant, John Dash, guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sion of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k. The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to consecutive prison terms of eleven years on the first degree assault count and five years on the count charging commission of a felony with a firearm, for a total effective sentence of sixteen years. On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant claims that, although the trial court properly sentenced him to a consecutive five year prison term pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, the court nevertheless improperly rendered judgment convicting him of a separate crime under \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant and, consequently, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53-202k must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 1:30 p.m. on August 18,1994, the victim, Terry Coleman, and his fifteen year old cousin, Rashad Green-Younger, drove into the Meadow Gardens housing project in the city of Norwalk. As the victim was exiting his car, the defendant, whom the victim had met for the first time earlier that day, approached the car, pointed a gun at the victim\u2019s temple, and stated, \u201cThis is a stickup, kid.\u201d A struggle ensued, during which the defendant overpowered the victim, shot him in the back, and fled. Both Green-Younger and the victim, who suffered permanent injuries as a result of the shooting, positively identified the defendant as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>At trial, the state presented the testimony of several police officers regarding the investigation of the altercation, including the gathering of evidence and the preparation and presentation of photographic lineups viewed by the victim and Green-Younger. None of these police officers, however, provided eyewitness testimony. At the trial\u2019s conclusion, the court instructed the jury that \u201cit is permissible for you to consider the special training and experience which a police officer receives when you are judging his ability to observe and remember and record events while he is engaged in these duties.\u201d The defendant did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The jury thereafter convicted the defendant of first degree assault and commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The defendant claims that his separate conviction under \u00a7 53-202k was improper because that statutory section is a sentence enhancement provision rather than a separate offense. Although the defendant concedes that the five year consecutive sentence imposed on him by the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k was proper, he maintains that his separate <em>conviction </em>under that statutory section must be vacated. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Our analysis is governed by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996). Several additional tenets of statutory construction guide our interpretation of a penal statute. First, we must take care not to impose criminal liability where the legislature has not expressly so intended. <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 268-69, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989). Second, \u201c[c]riminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 340, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995). Finally, \u201cunless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 200, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Although the plain language of \u00a7 53-202k does not illuminate whether that statute is a sentence enhancement provision, the title of \u00a7 53-202k, \u201cCommission of a class A, B, or C felony with a firearm: <em>Five year nonsuspendable </em>sentence\u201d (emphasis added), suggests that the legislature\u2019s overriding purpose in enacting \u00a7 53-202k was not to create a separate offense but, rather, to establish an enhanced penalty for persons who commit a class A, B or C felony with a firearm. Furthermore, unlike other provisions in which the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>lature has penalized aggravated conduct of the kind contemplated by \u00a7 53-202k; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-216 and 53a-217;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00a7 53-202k contains no language to indicate that it is, in fact, a separate felony offense. Although not dispositive of the issue presented, this fact lends further support to the conclusion that \u00a7 53-202k is not a separate crime but, rather, a sentence enhancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Our review of the relevant legislative history persuades us that \u00a7 53-202k was intended to serve as a sentence enhancement provision. Section 53-202k was enacted as part of a comprehensive legislative plan for dealing with assault weapons. See Public Acts 1993, No. 93-306 (P.A. 93-306), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53-202a through 53-202k. During the debate on P.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>93-306, Representative Michael P. Lawlor described General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53-202j and 53-202k as establishing, <em>\u201cnew enhanced mandatory minimum penalties </em>for the commission of a felony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 32, 1993 Sess., p. 11,540. Representative Lawlor also explained that \u00a7 53-202k was intended, \u201c[to add] five years to the end of whatever other sentence [a defendant is] receiving as a consequence of these acts. . . . This legislation requires five years to be tacked on to the end of [the] sentence [for the underlying felony] which must run consecutively and which cannot be suspended or reduced in any manner. So that would be in addition to the minimum mandatories that are already in existence for whatever the underlying crime was. So, it is <em>five additional years on top of the other </em>sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 33, 1993 Sess., pp. 11,727-28. Similarly, Representative Reginald L. Jones, Jr., stated that this legislation \u201cdeal[s] with mandatory sentences that run consecutively and cannot be plea bargained. The purpose, of course, <em>is to make the penalties greater and greater </em>if you use these weapons.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 11,725. Finally, Senator Alvin W. Penn explained that the legislation \u201crequires a mandatory five year sentence . . . in addition and consecutive to any imprisonment for the [underlying] felony.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1993 Sess., p. 4956.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">These comments strongly suggest that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 53-202k, merely sought to establish an additional penalty for a person who commits a class A, B or C felony with a firearm. Moreover, nothing in the legislative history suggests that the legislature intended that \u00a7 53-202k constitute a separate offense independent of the commission of the underlying felony. Indeed, at oral argument, the state indicated that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>pressing its claim that \u00a7 53-202k constituted a separate offense rather than a sentence enhancer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">For these reasons, and in the absence of any indication to the contrary, we conclude that \u00a7 53-202k is a sentence enhancement provision and not a separate crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, although the defendant\u2019s total effective sentence of sixteen years was proper, the judgment must be modified to reflect the fact that \u00a7 53-202k does not constitute a separate offense. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to have his conviction under \u00a7 53-202k vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The defendant also claims that he was deprived of his due process right to a fair and impartial jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>sider the \u201cspecial training and experience\u201d of police officers in assessing their credibility as witnesses. The defendant claims that the instruction was improper because it bolstered the police officers\u2019 credibility, thereby diminishing the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The defendant concedes that he neither filed a request to charge nor excepted to the jury instruction that he now maintains was improper. He therefore seeks review of his unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), wherein we held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Although the record before us is adequate to review the defendant\u2019s claim, the defendant has failed to meet the second prong of the <em>Golding </em>test because his claim of instructional impropriety is not one of constitutional magnitude. \u201cJust as every claim of evidentiary error by the trial court is not truly constitutional in nature; see, e.g., id., 241; every claim of instructional error is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>truly constitutional in nature. We have recognized, for example, that claimed instructional errors regarding the elements of an offense; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 543, 6 13 A.2d 770 (1992); and claimed instructional errors regarding the burden of proof or the presumption of innocence; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 289, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); are constitutional in nature, so as to satisfy the second <em>Golding </em>requirement. We have also recognized, however, that claimed instructional errors regarding general principles of credibility of witnesses are not constitutional in nature. <em>State v. Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 738, 595 A.2d 322 (1991). Indeed, it would trivialize the constitution to transmute a nonconstitutional claim into a constitutional claim simply because of the label placed on it by a party or because of a strained connection between it and a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 64-65, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). Because the defendant\u2019s claim implicates only general principles of credibility, we decline to review it because it does not meet the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53-202k and to resentence the defendant to a total effective term of imprisonment of sixteen years in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k provides: \u201cCommission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm: Five-year nonsuspendable sentence.
