HUFF, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b535-21\">On October 24, 2013, Defendant Kashi Company (\u201cKashi\u201d) filed a motion to modify the Court\u2019s July 30, 2013 class certification order based on new evidence. (Doe. No. 182.) On November 11, 2013, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Kashi\u2019s motion. (Doe. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>187.) On November 18, 2013, Kashi filed its reply. (Doc. No. 146.) On November 18, 2013, the Court submitted the motions on the papers. (Doc. No. 198.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Kashi\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">This is a consumer class action lawsuit brought on behalf of people who have purchased Kashi food products. Plaintiffs claim the products contained deceptive and misleading labeling and advertisements. (Doc. No. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendant packaged, marketed, distributed, and sold Kashi food products as being \u201cNothing Artificial\u201d or \u201cAll Natural.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs claim certain ingredients or processes used to manufacture Kashi food products are not \u201cnatural,\u201d but rather are synthetic. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs identified 10 specific Kashi products containing one or more of the challenged ingredients with labels claiming \u201cNothing Artificial\u201d and 91 products with labels claiming \u201cAll Natural.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Doc. No. 108.) Defendant contends that consumers and producers have no uniform definition of \u201cnatural\u201d and, accordingly, the representations are not materially false. (Doc. No. 127 at 19-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">On July 30, 2013, the Court issued its order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. (Doe. No. 148.) The Court certified a class of California purchasers of Kashi products marketed and labeled as containing \u201cNothing Artificial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 25-26.) Additionally, the Court certified a class of California purchasers of Kashi products marketed and labeled as \u201cAll Natural\u201d that contained one or more of the following ingredients: pyridoxine hydrochloride, calcium pantothenate, or hexane-processed soy ingredients. <em>(Id. </em>at 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On August 14, 2013, Kashi filed for permission to appeal the Court\u2019s class certification order to the Ninth Circuit. (Doc. No. 150.) On October 24, 2013, the Ninth Circuit denied Kashi permission to appeal the Court\u2019s class certification order. (Doc. No. 178.) Additionally, on August 28, 2013, Kashi moved to modify the Court\u2019s class certification order, arguing that calcium pantothenate and pyridoxine hydrochloride should be eliminated from the \u201cAll Natural\u201d class definition. (Doe. No. 160.) On September 18, 2013, the Court denied Kashi\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 173.) On October 24, 2013, Kashi filed the present motion seeking to modify the \u201cAll Natural\u201d class definition with respect to hexane-processed soy ingredients. (Doe. No. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">I. Legal Standard for Modification of Class Definition</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1)(C) permits a court to alter or amend an order granting class certification at any point prior to the entry of final judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(C). Therefore, the district court retains flexibility and is free to modify a class definition in light of developments during the course of litigation. <em>See, e.g., Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982); <em>United Steel, Paper &amp; Forestry, Rubber, Mfg. Energy, Allied Indus. &amp; Serv. Workers Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO, CLC v. ConocoPhillips Co., </em>593 F.3d 802, 809 (9th Cir. 2010); <em>Norris-Wilson v. Delta-T Grp., Inc., </em>270 F.R.D. 596, 601 (S.D.Cal.2010); <em>Andrews Farms v. Calcot, Ltd., </em>268 F.R.D. 380, 384 (E.D.Cal.2010). \u201cIn considering the appropriateness of [modification or] decertification, the standard of review is the same as a motion for class certification: whether the Rule 23 requirements are met.\u201d <em>Marlo v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>251 F.R.D. 476, 479 (C.D.Cal.2008) <em>aff'd, </em>639 F.3d 942 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">II. Kashi\u2019s Motion for Modification of Class Definition</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">Kashi asserts that new evidence makes modification of the Court\u2019s class certification order appropriate. (Doe. No. 182.) But Kashi\u2019s evidence is a 2006 letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) to Kashi\u2019s primary supplier of soy-hexane processed ingredients. (Doc. No. 182-5.) In the letter, the USDA informs the supplier that certain soy protein isolates and soy protein concentrates manufactured with hexane are acceptable as ingredients in meat and poultry products. (Doc. No. 182-5.) Therefore, Kashi argues, the USDA has approved of Kashi using the term natural to describe its products containing hexane-processed soy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ingredients sourced from the same manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Kashi is mistaken in asserting that the USDA letter settles the issue of whether hexane-processed soy ingredients are natural as a matter of federal law. (Doc. No. 182 at 9-10.) First, the USDA letter repeatedly states that it applies only to meat and poultry products.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Doc. No. 182-5); <em>Barnes v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>C 12-05185 JSW, 2013 WL 5530017, at *6 (N.D.Cal. July 25, 2013) (holding USDA authority is limited to meat and poultry products). Second, for the products at issue in this suit that contain poultry, Kashi has not adequately established that the labels \u201cclearly and conspicuously identify the non-natural ingredient ... directly beneath or beside all natural claims or, if elsewhere on the principal display panel; an asterisk should be used to tie the explanation to the claim.\u201d (Doe. No. 182-8, Ex. 7 \u201cUSDA Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book\u201d.) Third, a letter from the USDA is not presumptively controlling authority. \u201cInterpretations such as those in opinion letters \u2014 like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law \u2014 do not warrant Chevron-style deference.\u201d Wos <em>v. E.M.A. ex rel. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1391, 1402, 185 L.Ed.2d 471 (2013) (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000)). \u201cThese documents are entitled to respect in proportion to their power to persuade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Additionally, Kashi\u2019s reliance on USDA regulations to exclude soy-hexane processed ingredients from the \u201cAll Natural\u201d class runs afoul of its own website. On the \u201cWhat <em>Is </em>Natural?\u201d section of Kashi\u2019s own website, Kashi asserts that it must create its own standard for the term natural because the USDA definition applies only to meat and poultry. (See Doc. No. 127-6 at 10.) Furthermore, Kashi\u2019s own definition of minimal processing is that which \u201cinvolves only kitchen chemistry, processes that can be done in a family kitchen____\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Kashi, in attempting to cast the USDA opinion letter as dis-positive, ignores its own definition and the effect that definition may have had on consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Kashi errs by arguing that the USDA\u2019s letter regarding labeling of certain hexane-processed soy ingredients in meat and poultry products is dispositive of how consumer class members would view hexane-processed soy ingredients in Kashi products. As the Court has noted before, the \u201cCourt\u2019s class certification order was not predicated on a technical parsing of the federal regulations. ...\u201d (Doe. No. 173 at 3.) Rather, the Court certified the \u201cAll Natural\u201d class for three ingredients that reasonable consumers could plausibly consider to be material misrepresentations. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">After examining the 2006 USDA letter, the Court is not persuaded that it presents sufficient authority to alter the definition of the class. Accordingly, the Court declines to remove products with soy-hexane processed ingredients from the \u201cAll Natural\u201d class.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Kashi\u2019s motion to modify the July 30, 2013 class certification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">. The USDA regulates meat and poultry and the FDA regulates all other types of food. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 452 (providing for the inspection of poultry and poultry products to prevent misbranding and adulteration); and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 603 (providing for the inspection of meat and meat products to prevent misbranding and adulteration); with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 393(b)(2)(A) (empowering the FDA with responsibility to protect the public health by ensuring that \u201cfoods are safe, wholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled\u201d but exempting meat and meat food products from the FDA to the extent that the Meat Inspection Act applies).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
