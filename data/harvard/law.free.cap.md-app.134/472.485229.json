Thomas Noel presiding) returned a verdict in favor of appellee, and appellants now present the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">I. Did the trial court err in permitting impeachment testimony by Dr. Hill regarding Dr. Hill\u2019s lectures and writings related to risk management and did the trial court err by denying a new trial on that basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">II. Did the trial court err by excluding testimony of appellants\u2019 expert witness, Dr. Orlando, regarding appellee\u2019s broken chair, because the trial court erroneously determined that the matter had not been discussed in Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition, and did the trial court err by denying appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">III. Did the trial court err by failing to grant appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment regarding appellee\u2019s contributory negligence, and did it further err by denying appellants\u2019 motion for judgment, motion for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">IV. Did the trial court err by giving a jury instruction regarding the patient\u2019s ability to rely on statements by a doctor that were not a complete statement of the law, because it did not state that a patient\u2019s reliance must be reasonable and justified in order for a patient to satisfy his obligation to exercise reasonable care in safeguarding his own health and safety?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d to each question and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Appellee has been paralyzed from the waist down since 1987. On August 30, 1994, he went to the emergency room at Good Samaritan Hospital, complaining of nausea, cloudy urine, and an ulcer on his lower back. Dr. Hill was his emergency room physician. According to appellee, Dr. Hill did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>inquire about the duration or history of the ulcer, did not \u201cmanually palpate or otherwise touch the ulcer,\u201d and made an incorrect diagnosis on the basis of an inadequate examination. Appellee testified that Dr. Hill merely lifted the bandage that appellee had placed on the ulcer at home, glanced at the sore and placed the bandage back on, commenting to appellee that the ulcer was \u201cnot your problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Dr. Hill had no independent recollection of appellee\u2019s visit, and his testimony was based on the notes he wrote on appellee\u2019s chart at that time. According to Dr. Hill, his examination revealed that appellee had a \u201clarge sacral ulcer without surrounding erythema,\u201d and he diagnosed appellee as suffering from a urinary tract infection. He prescribed antibiotics to last 10 days, and instructed appellee to (1) make an appointment with a plastic surgeon \u201cwhen available\u201d for treatment of the ulcer, (2) obtain a reculture of the urine in two weeks, and (3) \u201csee your doctor if worse.\u201d Even though appellee\u2019s record contained no express reference to what kind of examination was performed, Dr. Hill testified that he performed a complete evaluation of appellee because his standard practice is to perform such an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Appellee testified that he followed Dr. Hill\u2019s advice. When he got home, he made an appointment with a plastic surgeon, Dr. Orlando, whose first available appointment was two weeks away. He also took the prescribed medicine and cleaned and dressed the ulcer every day. Approximately a week after his emergency room visit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellee noticed that an unusual odor was coming from the ulcer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He returned to the hospital on September 14,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Upon his arrival, appellee was diagnosed as suffering from a severe infection,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was then admitted. Due to complications from the infection, above the knee amputations had to be performed on both of appellee\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">I. Impeachment of Dr. Hill</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Appellants assert that Judge Noel erred in allowing appellee\u2019s counsel to cross-examine Dr. Hill about certain of his writings and lectures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Hill is the author of a chapter, in a risk management manual for doctors, and has also lectured on how emergency room medical charts should be prepared and documented from a \u201crisk management or a legal perspective.\u201d Appellants filed a Motion in Limine to prohibit the admission of these materials, asserting that the materials were (1) not relevant, and (2) prejudicial to appellants\u2019 case. Judge Noel concluded that the materials would be admissible for impeachment purposes, and perhaps on the issue of appellee\u2019s contributory negligence, but could not to be used to prove that Dr. Hill breached the standard of care in his treatment of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">During Dr. Hill\u2019s cross-examination, several bench conferences took place, the first occurring when Dr. Hill was being cross-examined with respect to his medical credentials. Judge Noel concluded that (1) he was going to deal with the issues raised by the materials on a question to question basis, and (2) appellee\u2019s counsel could inquire about the contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>writings. Appellee\u2019s counsel could not, however, use the writings to establish the requisite standard of care, and could not inform the jury that the writings were primarily directed at the goal of avoiding lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Counsel for appellee also used the materials to question Dr. Hill on the issue of contributory negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the materials, Dr. Hill had commented that directions to the patient to see your physician for follow-up \u201cas necessary\u201d or \u201cas worse\u201d were insufficient because of a lack of understanding by the patient as to the specific time frame. Because of the notes that Dr. Hill made in appellee\u2019s chart, Judge Noel allowed Dr. Hill to be questioned on the apparent inconsistency between what he had documented and what he had advised others to document. Judge Noel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">I cannot let this jury not hear this examination. I think it would be patently unfair to just say that it was written based upon a theory of risk management; therefore, the jury should not hear it. If for no other bottom line reason is that it would demonstrate the defendant\u2019s knowledge in this area alone. And on that basis alone, I think it becomes admissible ... Also, <em>when someone writes something in an area, I think it only fair that they be held accountable to what they write. </em>Now, if [counsel for appellants] wants to have this jury advised of the purpose of the writing, its intent, the fact that it was written for risk management, and have your client or witness explain it, you can do so. If you prefer the jury not hear anything about the distinction between risk management and standard of care, then I can advise counsel not to delve into that area. But I don\u2019t see that once someone writes something that they can say, \u2018Well, I am not going to have a trier of fact be privy to my writings because I wrote it with a different intent in my mind.\u2019 It is the doctor\u2019s owm writing, and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>think it only appropriate that he be permitted to be cross-examined on what he has written.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We agree with that analysis. During her closing argument, counsel for appellee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Frankly, what I really think Dr. Hill is saying is that he hopes he gave more elaborate discharge instructions than what are written on this record because that is what he should have done. He testified, you\u2019ll remember, that he gives lectures and talks to other doctors, and what he tells them is that no patient understands the instruction, \u2018see your doctor if worse,\u2019 or \u2018see your doctor if not better.\u2019 He tells them that discharge instructions must be time and action specific, and he tells them that they should document these time and action specific instructions. But though he tells other doctors that no patient can be expected to understand instructions of the type he gave in this case, he asks you to impose that expectation on Mr. Wilson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">There is nothing unfair in that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Appellants claim that the materials were not relevant. Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or-less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md.Rule 5-401. The materials were relevant to the issue of credibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">A witness generally may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to the issues, and the witness\u2019s credibility is always relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\"><em>DeLilly v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 676, 681, 276 A.2d 417 (1971). The <em>DeLilly </em>Court went on to state that it is proper to allow \u201cany question which reasonably tends to explain, contradict, or discredit any testimony given by the witness in chief, or which tends to test his accuracy, memory, veracity, character or credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the \u201cscope, range and extent of such interrogation rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Kruszewski v. Holz, </em>265 Md. 434, 440, 290 A.2d 534 (1972) (citing <em>Shupe v. State, </em>238 Md. 307, 311, 208 A.2d 590 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(1965)). We \u201cwill only reverse upon finding that the trial judge\u2019s determination was \u2018both manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lomax v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>88 Md.App. 50, 54, 591 A.2d 1311 (1991) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Judge Noel did not err or abuse his discretion in allowing Dr. Hill to be impeached by his own prior statements, as they were relevant to his credibility as a witness. Maryland law provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">... upon the laying of a proper foundation ... the credit of a witness may be impeached by showing that he has made statements which contradict his testimony in respect to material facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><em>Jenkins v. State, </em>14 Md.App. at 5, 285 A.2d 667. As Dr. Hill wrote the manual and lectured accordingly, there was nothing unfair about impeaching him with his own words.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">II. The \u201cBroken\u201d Wheelchair Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Dr. Orlando examined appellee on September 16, 1994. During that examination, Dr. Orlando noticed that several ulcers had developed at numerous locations on appellee\u2019s body.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During his deposition, Dr. Orlando opined that the infected ulcer that necessitated the amputations \u201cdeveloped from a bar which ran across the back of [appellee\u2019s] wheelchair.\u201d Dr. Orlando was prepared to testify at trial that appellee\u2019s wheelchair was \u201cbroken.\u201d Judge Noel ruled, however, that Dr. Orlando \u201cmay comment that the bar rubbed [appellee\u2019s] back causing the lumbar ulcer [but could not opine] that the chair was broke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Appellants contend that Judge Noel should not have prohibited Dr. Orlando from testifying that appellee\u2019s wheelchair was \u201cbroken.\u201d They recognize the well established rule that a trial judge has the power to exclude trial testimony that constitutes a material departure from what the witness testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>fied to at deposition. They argue, however, that this rule does not apply to the \u201cbroken\u201d wheelchair testimony because (1) appellee never filed a motion to compel discovery of the basis for Dr. Orlando\u2019s opinions, and/or (2) although Dr. Orlando did not use the word \u201cbroken\u201d during his deposition, \u201che did tell [appellee\u2019s counsel] that the wheelchair was broken.\u201d Judge Noel did not agree with those arguments. Neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Appellee\u2019s interrogatories requested that appellants provide the factual basis for any contentions that \u201cany act or omission of Kevin Wilson in any way contributed to the damages he now complains of in this action.\u201d Appellants\u2019 response asserted that appellee \u201ccaused and /or contributed to his alleged injuries by his failure to follow the instructions given to him by his physicians.\u201d This answer was never supplemented to include a contention that appellee\u2019s injuries were caused by a broken wheelchair.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees also propounded the following interrogatory to Dr. Hill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\"><em>Interrogatory No. 11: </em>The Defendant is to state the name and professional address of each expert who may be called at the hearing and/or trial hereof, attaching to these Answers copies of each experts curriculum vitae, as well as copies of all reports received. Further, the Defendant is to indicate the specialty and/or subspecialty of each expert named. With respect to each and every expert named, the Defendant is to state in detail the subject matter on which each such witness will testify, the substance of the facts considered and opinions held by each such expert, and the ground/or basis for each opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Dr. Hill answered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">[t]he naming of expert witnesses will be done in accordance with the Scheduling Order of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Thereafter Dr. Hill filed a DESIGNATION OF EXPERT WITNESSES in which he advised that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Dr. Orlando is a plastic surgeon who is expected to provide factual testimony and offer opinions on causation. He is expected to testify that there were two separate wounds on Plaintiffs back, that the wounds were not connecting with one another and that the sacral ulcer present on 8/30/94 was not in the same location as the Stage V ulcer found in September, 1994. He will additionally opine that the second ulcer on the iliac crest could have developed between the period when the Plaintiff was seen by Dr. Hill on 8/30/94 and his presentation in September of 1994.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Rather than move for an order compelling discovery of the \u201cground and/or basis for\u201d Dr. Orlando\u2019s opinions, appellee noted Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition. During his discovery deposition, however, Dr. Orlando never testified that the wheelchair was \u201cbroken\u201d or in poor condition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Prior to the introduction of Dr. Orlando\u2019s testimony, appel-lee\u2019s counsel expressed concern that the doctor was going to testify to matters not raised in deposition or otherwise disclosed during discovery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This request for a ruling that would confine the witness to opinions expressed during his deposition was the functional equivalent of a motion to sanction appellants for their failure or refusal to provide discover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>able information requested in Interrogatory No. II.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t has long been recognized in Maryland that \u2018substance rather than the form of the pleading is the controlling consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne v. Payne, </em>132 Md.App. 432, 439, 752 A.2d 1209 (2000), (citing <em>Lapp v. Stanton, </em>116 Md. 197, 199, 81 A. 675 (1911))(internal citations omitted). During a bench conference on this issue, the following discussion took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:] Your honor ... [counsel for appellants] intends to call Dr. Orlando. Dr. Orlando was named as an expert witness in this case, and his deposition was taken. [Counsel for appellants] has hinted that the testimony she expects to elicit from him on the witness stand is somewhat different and more expansive than the testimony he offered under oath at deposition. I have no idea what she is talking about. I object to that. And I think that it would violate fundamental rules of fairness as well as the rules of discovery....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS:] I talked to Dr. Orlando. There are issues that will come to light at the witness stand that [counsel for appellee] frankly didn\u2019t ask about. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m obligated to say, \u201cHey. [Counsel for appel-lee], you forgot an issue.\u201d He was specifically identified as a fact witness, and a witness to testify on causation, the evolution of decubitus ulcer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">THE COURT: [to counsel for appellee] Well, what is the area that you contend that we\u2019ll [sic] be explored that was not dealt with in deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:] I don\u2019t know. Your Hon- or, that is my problem. I have no idea what it is except [counsel for appellants] has hinted very broadly that there will be additional different testimony other than that covered at deposition.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgCl\">THE COURT: [to counsel for appellants] Is there anything that he [Dr. Orlando] is going to talk about or try to talk about that he didn\u2019t talk about in the deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3p\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS:] In a generic sense, he talked about it all in his deposition. He will expand\u2014 THE COURT: Well, in a specific sense, can you tell me the difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS:] Well, I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019ll say if that helps the Court and [counsel for appellee]. THE COURT: I\u2019d like to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS:] Okay. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. He\u2019s going to come in here. He\u2019s going to tell exactly what happened to Kevin Wilson during that admission. He\u2019s going to testify as to what he saw and what he did. He\u2019ll testify to what calls he made to get additional assistance for him. He\u2019s [sic] testify as to the evolution of a decubitus ulcer, how it goes from start to finish. He\u2019ll testify that there were two ulcers on this gentleman\u2019s low back, which is exactly what he said in his deposition. He\u2019ll testify that the sacral ulcer was not infected. He\u2019ll testify that they did not communicate with one another, and he\u2019ll tell the jury why. He will testify that, in his opinion, the sacral ulcer was older than the lumbar ulcer. He will testify how the lumbar ulcer got to be there in the first place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">THE COURT: Were all these areas covered in the deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:] Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">THE COURT: Well, let\u2019s see what happens then instead of trying to go through this, and I\u2019ll deal with it accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">During Dr. Orlando\u2019s direct examination, the following transpired when he used the word \u201cbroken\u201d for the first time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS:] Doctor, please, if you will, what I\u2019d like you to do is express an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability as to what happened to Mr. Wilson....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">[DR. ORLANDO:] ... his wheelchair was broken when I saw it on the 16th. There was no\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:] Objection, Your Honor. Judge Noel ultimately ruled as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">\u201cThere will be no further testimony in this case whatsoever that the chair was broken.. .. [To Dr. Orlando:] You are not to make another reference or comment to the effect that the chair was broken. You may comment that the bar rubbed his back causing the lumbar ulcer. But you cannot say under any circumstances that the chair was broke.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aum8\">Judge Noel subsequently engaged in the following conversation with appellants\u2019 counsel regarding the \u201cbroken\u201d wheelchair theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">THE COURT: Did you know that Dr. Orlando was going to offer testimony yesterday that the wheelchair was broken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Absj\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Did I know that the wheelchair was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">THE COURT: Yes.... Did you know yesterday [the date of the first bench conference quoted above] that Dr. Orlando was going to offer testimony that the wheelchair was broken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">THE COURT: When I asked you yesterday [at the first bench conference] to disclose to me if there was anything that he would testify to beyond that which was covered in the deposition, why didn\u2019t you advise me of that then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV1\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Because from my perspective, in reading his deposition, he did tell them that the wheelchair was broken. From my perspective, in reading the medical records, that information is readily available in the medical records. As a matter of fact, I recall [appellee\u2019s counsel] asking a question of one of the experts as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>whether it\u2019s important to look at the environmental factors such as whether or not there\u2019s a problem with the wheelchair; I, in a million years, did not suspect that they did not know that fact. The man testified in his deposition that he was astounded. When he testified in his deposition, he explained to [appellee\u2019s counsel] that the rod was rubbing into his back. That\u2019s the point, that\u2019s the only point that I wanted to make with that issue, not that he was somehow contributorily negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">THE COURT: My question again to you is did you know that he was going to say the wheelchair is broken, not that the rod was protruding into his back, but that the wheelchair was broken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: To me, that\u2019s one in the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">THE COURT: Did you know when I asked you if he was going to offer any testimony beyond that which was in the deposition, did you know then that he was going to offer testimony that the wheelchair was broken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Yes. And that was the same testimony from my perspective that had been elicited during his deposition. If [appellee\u2019s counsel] did not understand that concept when Dr. Orlando explained that the rod was going into his back, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think in a million years that I needed to articulate that any better than Dr. Orlando did. I understood that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">THE COURT: I have listened to every portion of that deposition, I believe, that there was a statement relative to that wheelchair. And from my perspective, to say that there was a problem with the rod on the back of the wheelchair rubbing against his back does not connote that the wheelchair was broken. I don\u2019t think that the average person would interpret the problem with the wheelchair was that there was a rod rubbing into his back to mean that it was broken. I think that that is a completely different topic, and I am most concerned about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>You know the integrity of this process is extremely important to me ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel], it seems to me that there could have been more candor to the Court in your disclosure when I asked the question. Because saying that there was a problem with the rod or that the rod rubbed against his back does not connote to me that something is broken. There may be many situations that would affect a person in a particular way, but it doesn\u2019t say that something is broken. I think that\u2019s really stretching the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"> When the question is whether there is a material variance between what the witness testified to at deposition and what the witness will testify to at trial, the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact will be affirmed on appeal unless the reviewing court is persuaded that the trial judge\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous. We are not persuaded that Judge Noel was clearly erroneous in finding that Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition testimony about the condition of appellee\u2019s wheelchair \u201cdoes not connote that the wheelchair was broken.\u201d When the question is whether the trial court selected an appropriate remedy for the type of discovery violation found in this case,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s remedy of choice will be affirmed on appeal unless the reviewing court is persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Colter v. State, </em>297 Md. 423, 426, 466 A.2d 1286 (1983). \u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s resolution of a discovery dispute is quite narrow; appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess the decision of a trial judge to impose sanctions for a failure of discovery.

Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., </em>73 Md.App. 54, 62, 533 A.2d 9 (1987). In fact, Maryland case law suggests that submission to the jury was proper \u201cif there be any evidence, however slight, <em>legally sufficient </em>as tending to prove negligence, and the weight and value of such evidence will be left to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62-63, 533 A.2d 9. Moreover, we must \u201cgive due consideration not only to all inferences of fact tending to support the opposite view, but also to the important presumption that [the plaintiff] exercised ordinary care for [his] safety.\u201d <em>Saponari v.

This Court has also stated that \u201c... even if the act done [by the plaintiff as claimed as his contributory negligent action] turns out to be an error of judgment, this alone does not make the act negligent if an ordinarily prudent person may have made the same error.\u201d <em>Faith v.

For example, in <em>Chudson v. Ratra, </em>76 Md.App. 753, 548 A.2d 172, <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 628, 552 A.2d 894 (1989), the plaintiff was also told by her doctor to see him again if her condition got worse, and she noticed changes in her medical condition between the time of her appointment with her doctor and when she ultimately sought treatment. The lapse of time in that case, however, was over one year rather than two weeks. In the present case, appellee\u2019s failure to go to the hospital one week before his next scheduled appointment does not establish that he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Reasonable minds could differ on the level of understanding of the instructions given to appellee by Dr. Hill as well as on the time frame of his worsened condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Moreover, there are other material facts in serious dispute. Appellants claim that appellee had several different ulcers on his back, and that he contributed to his own condition by waiting a week to seek medical care. On the other hand, appellee asserts that his infection was caused by the one ulcer he had as of his first visit, and that his legs would not have been amputated if Dr. Hill had not breached the standard of care. Giving due consideration to the facts tending to \u201csupport the opposite view,\u201d we are persuaded that appellee was not contributorily negligent as a \u201cmatter of law.\u201d Thus, Judge Noel\u2019s decision to deny summary judgment was \u201clegally correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Similarly, Judge Noel did not err in denying appellants\u2019 Motions for Judgment and Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict. A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \u201ctests the legal sufficiency of the evidence and is reviewed under the same standard as a motion for judgment made during trial.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Tufts, </em>118 Md.App. 180, 190, 702 A.2d 422 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>104, 707 A.2d 89 (1998) (citing <em>Houston v.

Therefore, the appropriate standard of review is: \u201cIf there exists any legally competent evidence, however slight, from which the jury could have found as it did, we must affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 674 A.2d 87 (internal citations omitted). On review, we are to \u201cassume the truth of all credible evidence and all inferences of fact reasonably deductible from the evidence supporting the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 674 A.2d 87. We hold that there was \u201clegally competent evidence from which the jury could have found as it did.\u201d Assuming the truth of the evidence from the position of appellee, there was \u201csufficient evidence for the jury to conclude as it did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We are also persuaded that Judge Noel did not err or abuse his discretion in denying appellants\u2019 Motion for a New Trial. \u201cThe question whether to grant a new trial is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Aron v. Brock, </em>118 Md.App. 475, 511, 703 A.2d 208, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 629, 697 A.2d 913 (1997) (citing <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em>328 Md. 51, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992)(internal citations omitted)). The nature of Judge Noel\u2019s discretion on whether to grant appellants\u2019 motion was \u201cthe broadest range\u201d of discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">The emphasis has consistently been upon granting the broadest range of discretion ... whenever the decision ... depended upon ... evaluation of the character of the testimony and of the trial when the judge is considering the core question of whether justice has been done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em>Id. </em>Judge Noel was the presiding judge at the trial, had the opportunity to evaluate both the credibility of the witnesses and the evidence, and was thus in the best position to decide whether \u201cjustice had been done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">IV. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Appellants contend that Judge Noel erred by giving an incomplete jury instruction involving appellee\u2019s reliance on statements made by Dr. Hill. Appellee requested a specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ic jury instruction based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Simmons v. Urquhart, </em>106 Md.App. 77, 664 A.2d 27 (1995). Judge Noel delivered the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">Now, in general, patients are entitled to rely on their physician\u2019s advice. That reliance must be reasonable and justified. A patient is not in a position to diagnose his own ailments. As a consequence, it is not contributory negligence for a patient to follow a doctor\u2019s instructions or rely on the doctor\u2019s advice, to fail to consult another doctor, or to fail to diagnose his own illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Appellants objected to that instruction on the basis that it was incomplete in light of <em>Simmons. </em>Appellants\u2019 counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcCp\">... I didn\u2019t think it was complete. The case that she [appellee\u2019s counsel] cites as the support for it actually had the words, \u201cthe reliance must be reasonable and justifiable in order for patients to satisfy their own obligations to exercise reasonable care in safeguarding their own health and safety.\u201d And I would ask that that language be added.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"am--dedup-0\">Judge Noel noted and overruled that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In <em>DiLeo v. Nugent, </em>88 Md.App. 59, 592 A.2d 1126, <em>cert. granted, </em>325 Md. 18, 599 A.2d 90 (1991), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>327 Md. 627, 612 A.2d 257 (1992), the appellant contended that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1iE\">it is not contributory negligence for a patient to follow a doctor\u2019s instructions or rely on his advice when that patient has no reason to suspect the doctor\u2019s treatment or advice is the cause of the patient\u2019s injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\"><em>DiLeo, </em>88 Md.App. at 73, 592 A.2d 1126. This contention was rejected on the ground that \u201cthe instruction conforms precisely with Maryland law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the <em>DiLeo </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">fW]e have recognized in the past that a patient is not in a position to diagnose her own ailments, appreciate the risks of medication or evaluate whether the prescribed course of treatment is in her best interest. As a consequence, it is not contributory negligence for a patient to follow a doctor\u2019s instructions or rely on the doctor\u2019s advice, to fail to consult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>another doctor when the patient has no reason to believe that- the doctor\u2019s negligence has caused her injury, or to fail to diagnose her own illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Citing <em>Santoni v.

Lamy, </em>320 Md. 33, 43, 575 A.2d 1235 (1990). Maryland law provides that \u201ca litigant is entitled to have his or her theory of the case presented to the jury if that theory is a correct exposition of the law and if there is evidence in the case which supports that theory.\u201d <em>Zeller v. Greater Baltimore Medical Center, </em>67 Md.App. 75, 80, 506 A.2d 646 (1986). The instruction given by Judge Noel also conformed with Maryland law. In reviewing whether Judge Noel was correct in denying appellants\u2019 requested instruction, we must conduct a three part inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">first, whether the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law, second, whether the law is applicable to the facts in the case, and third, whether the trial judge fairly covered with the same law by other instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\"><em>Fearnow v. The Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland, </em>342 Md. 363, 385, 676 A.2d 65 (1996) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIf any one part of the test is not met, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the request for instruction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Maryland Rule 2-520(c) governs the manner in which jury instructions are to be given and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">The court may instruct the jury, orally or in writing or both, by granting requested instructions, by giving instructions of its own, or by combining any of these methods. The court need not grant a certain instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions already given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Md.Rule 2-520(c). Judge Noel\u2019s instruction used the identical language that was sufficient in <em>DiLeo, </em>while adding the <em>Simmons </em>requirement \u201cthat [the patient\u2019s] reliance must be reasonable and justified.\u201d Therefore, the instruction at issue was a \u201ccorrect statement of the law.\u201d Moreover, because appellants\u2019 trial counsel \u201ccould, and did, present the very arguments to the jury that [she] would have made had [the requested] instructions been given, the matter was fairly, and adequately, covered in the instructions actually given.\u201d <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v.

I can't say for sure that there aren\u2019t two ulcers back there....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Now, Doctor, in the description of your opinions here there\u2019s also a notation that it is your belief that a second ulcer <em>on </em>the iliac crest could have developed between August 30 and September 14, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">[DOCTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Tell me how a large ulcer such as is seen on September 14 could develop over that period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>[DOCTOR]: Very easily.

It\u2019s hard to say. It depends on the patient\u2019s nutrition, blood supply, it depends on other factors. I mean this fellow is already septic from his urinary tract infection, so there's a lot of things that are going against Kevin at this point and he\u2019s very susceptible to developing a pressure ulcer, and this ulcer developed from a bar which ran across the back of the wheelchair.

There, the Court upholds the trial judge\u2019s ruling that precluded appellants from offering evidence to establish that, at the relevant time, appellee\u2019s wheelchair was \u201cbroken\u201d and caused an ulcer on the lumbar area of appellee\u2019s back.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">At trial, the parties disputed the location and condition of the ulcer on appellee\u2019s back when he went to the emergency room at Good Samaritan Hospital on August 30, 1994. They also disagreed about the number, location, and condition of the ulcers on Mr. Wilson\u2019s back when he returned to the hospital on September 14,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Mr. Wilson contended that, on August 30, 1994, when he was treated by Dr. Hill at the emergency room, he had an infected ulcer on his back, but Dr. Hill misdiagnosed him as suffering from a urinary tract infection. Two weeks later, on September 14, 1994, Mr. Wilson was admitted to the hospital because his condition had worsened. Dr. Joseph Orlando, who had treated Mr. Wilson in the past, examined appellee on September 16, 1994, and was offered by the defense as both a fact witness and as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Appellants maintained that Dr. Hill correctly diagnosed the urinary tract infection on August 30, 1994. They also sought to establish that the ulcer on appellee\u2019s back on that date was located in the sacral area, and that after August 30, 1994, appellee developed a second ulcer in the lumbar area of his back. According to appellants, it was the lumbar ulcer that became infected and ultimately led to the amputations. Additionally, the defense sought to show that the lumbar ulcer was caused by appellee\u2019s wheelchair, which allegedly had a metal rod protruding from the back that penetrated Mr. Wilson\u2019s lumbar area, enabling bacteria to invade his body.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In analyzing Issue II, it is important to review the facts that culminated in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Appellants disclosed in answers to interrogatories that they intended to call Dr. Orlando as both a fact witness and an expert witness as to causation. To be sure, appellants\u2019 disclosure did not reveal Dr. Orlando\u2019s position that the lumbar ulcer was caused by appellee\u2019s defective wheelchair. Based on the content of the interrogatory answer, however, appellee noted Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">At his deposition, Dr. Orlando stated that appellee had an infected lumbar ulcer when he examined him on September 16, 1994. Moreover, he opined that the lumbar ulcer was caused by the transverse bar located on the back of appellee\u2019s wheelchair. As footnote 3 of the majority opinion reveals, appellee\u2019s counsel did not pose any follow-up questions to Dr. Orlando concerning the condition of the wheelchair, even after Dr. Orlando \u201cinvite[d]\u201d appellee\u2019s counsel to look at the wheelchair, stated that he was \u201castounded\u201d when he saw its condition, and claimed that Mr. Wilson \u201crode\u201d the metal bar on the back of the wheelchair \u201cright into his back.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>At trial, appellee\u2019s counsel expressed concern to the court that Dr. Orlando\u2019s trial testimony might be \u201csomewhat different and more expansive than the testimony he offered under oath at deposition,\u201d based on a \u201chint\u201d she received from the defense lawyer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s attorney also argued that any deviation in testimony would violate \u201cfundamental rules of fairness as well as the rules of discovery....\u201d In response, the court asked appellee\u2019s counsel about the \u201carea\u201d that she thought might be \u201cexplored that was not dealt with in deposition.\u201d Appellee\u2019s attorney replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Your Honor, that is my problem. I have no idea what it is except [defense counsel] has hinted very broadly that there will be additional different testimony other than that covered at deposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Based on defense counsel\u2019s response to questions posed by the court, the judge initially did not restrict the testimony of Dr. Orlando. When appellants\u2019 counsel posed her questions to Dr. Orlando during his direct examination, he responded on several occasions by describing appellee\u2019s wheelchair as \u201cbroken.\u201d Appellee\u2019s attorney did not immediately object to the questions that prompted those responses, nor did appellee\u2019s counsel move to strike the answers. Because of my view of the importance of the early testimony of Dr. Orlando, which came into evidence without objection, it is set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgHK\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Okay. I want you to tell the jury, if you will, what caused that upper [lumbar] ulcer. What caused this ulcer at this level that you\u2019ve never seen in your 25 years of practice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">[DR. ORLANDO]: Well, not only had I never seen it, but I don\u2019t think anybody on the chart had ever seen an ulcer in that area. And when I first saw [appellee] on the afternoon of September the 16th, 1994, and I examined this area, and examined [appellee], and examined his feet, and made note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of those ulcers, I was perplexed. I could not understand why he had a lumbar ulcer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">His wheelchair was by the side of his bed, and I turned around, and I looked at his wheelchair. And I was literally astounded. I mean, I really was. And I said to [appellee], \u201cKevin, have you been sitting in this wheelchair? This is the reason why you\u2019ve got this ulcer back here.\u201d I even said to him, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything in the lumbar area like this. HowM you get\u201d\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: What did you see in Mr. Wilson\u2019s wheelchair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">[DR. ORLANDO]: <em>The back of his wheelchair was broken back. </em>He had a sports wheelchair. It has a lumbar support. When you\u2019re in \u2014 if you ever sit in a bucket seat in a car, it has a support. It helps to support your lumbar area. <em>And it presses against your lumbar area.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\"><em>The back of his wheelchair was broken. The lumbar support, which I think was one bar, was now broken in the middle. And the stainless steel bar, which was about the size of a </em>\u2014 a <em>little bigger than a pencil, but maybe not quite as big as my little finger </em>\u2014 was <em>squished forward about an inch to maybe even </em>\u2014 well, <em>let\u2019s say an inch, but it could have been more. And the astounding thing was the vinyl or leather that was over it was not even over it. It had pushed right through the vinyl.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\"><em>So he had been in that wheelchair for seven days, or ten days, or so, and it was broken. And it had been </em>pushing\u2014 <em>that bar had been pushing right here over that period of </em>time....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">E.1238-1240 (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: So the sacral ulcer was not infected. What ulcer was infected?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">[DR. ORLANDO]: The first ulcer, the lumbar ulcer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adv\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: The one up here? (Indicating.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>[DR. ORLANDO]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: That was caused by the wheelchair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">[DR. ORLANDO]: A little bit lower. Right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: <em>The one caused by the wheelchair?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">[DR. ORLANDO]: Right. You have to remember though that iliac crest is protecting everything below that so when that bar was coming in, it had to come above the iliac crest. You\u2019re still a little bit too high. Just take a pencil and point\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Why don\u2019t you show them. I\u2019m not an\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">THE COURT: Doctor, describe for the record where you\u2019re pointing exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">(The witness approached Defense Exhibit Number 9.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">[DR. ORLANDO]: Yes. As I mentioned before, the iliac crest protects the top part of the sacrum. And also there\u2019s a fair amount of tissue in this area. That helps to protect the lumbar area. <em>So you need something sharp to get through here, and his [wheelchair] bar on his right side had come across here, and it was above the level of the ilium, and it was pressing right here. </em>(Indicating.) It was right about at this level here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">E.1252-1253 (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">[DR. ORLANDO]: On the 80th of August, Mr. Wilson developed a pressure ulcer in this area from sitting in his wheelchair which is the prominent area in which sacral ulcers develop. When you\u2019re lying in bed for a long time, the ulcers tend to develop more in this area. This is a low sacral ulcer. And it also involves the coccyx, which is this small bone down here. It\u2019s called a sacral ulcer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR' APPELLANTS]: Let me stop you just for a second because I\u2019m not sure that the jury can appreciate what the different body parts are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">E.1262.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: Doctor, please, if you will, what I\u2019d like you to do is to express an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability as to what happened to Mr. Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">[DR. ORLANDO]: That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS]: I know. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ax5-dedup-0\">[DR. ORLANDO]: Well, we know [the sacral ulcer] wasn\u2019t infected because [appellee] said \u2014 Mr. Wilson said \u2014 there was no blood on the dressing. He also said that there was no foul odor. So those are two things that indicate to me that it wasn\u2019t a deep ulcer, and that it wasn\u2019t infected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">We also know that he came there because he had cloudy urine for one week\u2019s duration, which is one of the Hallmark\u2019s [sic] of a urinary tract infection, especially if it changed from the week before to that. So he was treated for a urinary tract infection, and he was sent home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">Somewhere subsequent to that, and according to Kevin\u2019s deposition\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Mr. Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">[DR. ORLANDO]: I\u2019m sorry. According to Mr. Wilson\u2019s deposition, and <em>somewhere subsequent to that </em>\u2014 strike what I said about <em>subsequent </em>\u2014 his <em>wheelchair was broken when I saw it on the 16th [of September]. </em>There was no\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adv-dedup-0\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyeA\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahh\">E.1264-1265 (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">When counsel for appellee finally objected, she complained at the bench only about the factual basis for Dr. Orlando\u2019s suggestion that appellee\u2019s wheelchair broke sometime between appellee\u2019s two hospital visits. She argued that Dr. Orlando <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>was \u201cfactually ... suggesting that Mr. Wilson\u2019s wheelchair was broken sometime between the 30th of August and the 14th of September. There has been no evidence of that.\u201d Thus, although appellee\u2019s attorney challenged the basis for Dr. Orlando\u2019s knowledge as to when the wheelchair became broken, she did not dispute his assertion that the wheelchair was, in fact, broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Thereafter, the court raised, <em>sua sponte, </em>the issue of the broken wheelchair, stating: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about where you would like to go with this issue of this broken wheelchair.\u201d Only then did counsel for appellee assert that she had \u201cnever heard about a broken wheelchair before [Dr. Orlando] took this witness stand.... He didn\u2019t mention it at anytime under oath in his deposition. The first time I heard about it was here today.\u201d The matter was discussed on several occasions during the trial, and appellee\u2019s counsel later complained that she had been \u201csandbagged\u201d because the defense \u201cinjected\u201d a new issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In its discussions with the attorneys, the court inquired: \u201cDoes the record indicate anything about the wheelchair being broken, or does the record indicate that his back was rubbing against a certain place in the wheelchair?\u201d Appellee\u2019s counsel informed the court that there was \u201cno reference anywhere in the medical records to the wheelchair being broken,\u201d and that Dr. Orlando did not so state at his deposition. Appellants\u2019 attorney asserted that the medical records disclosed the defective condition of the wheelchair. She pointed to Dr. Orlando\u2019s note in the medical records on September 16, 1994, as follows: \u201cExtensive posterior lower trunk ulcer secondary to pressure from bar when sitting.\u201d Further, on September 16, 1994, a \u201crehab\u201d doctor wrote a note in the medical records, indicating that appellee had an ulcer caused by \u201cproblems secondary to undue pressure from the wheelchair frame.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, however, the reference to \u201csecondary to the bar\u201d was not the equivalent of stating that the wheelchair was broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Moreover, the court stated that testimony at the deposition about pressure to appellee\u2019s back caused by a bar on the back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of his wheelchair was not the same as testimony about a broken wheelchair. Rather, the court viewed the doctor\u2019s reference to the bar at his deposition as \u201cquite different\u201d from any representation that the wheelchair was \u201cbroken,\u201d and said it was not \u201cfair warning whatsoever that the chair was broken.\u201d Further, the court said that whether the wheelchair was broken constituted \u201ca completely new element in this case that [is] rather critical.\u201d The court reasoned: \u201cIf he testified that he saw the wheelchair in a condition that was not the appropriate condition, is one issue. But to testify that it was broken and the plaintiff used a broken wheelchair for an extended period of time, is altogether different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The defense attorney disagreed, claiming that, \u201cfrom [her] perspective, in reading [Dr. Orlando\u2019s] deposition, he did tell them that the wheelchair was broken.\u201d She pointed to various portions of Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition testimony, consistent with the content of footnote 3 of the majority opinion. Appellants\u2019 lawyer also maintained that it was not her \u201cjob\u201d at the deposition to ask follow-up questions. Although the court expressly declined to determine \u201c[w]hose job it was to pursue [the issue] during the deposition,\u201d the judge stated that he was \u201cabsolutely surprised\u201d and \u201cactually shocked\u201d that \u201cneither side bothered to ask\u201d additional questions to explore what it was about the bar or its condition that caused the lumbar ulcer. In addition, the court said: \u201cCounsel, it\u2019s easy to sit here after everything is said and done and second guess. But with the legal power in this courtroom, and for him to say that the bar caused the ulcer, I\u2019m shocked that nobody said, \u2018How?\u2019 or \u2018Why?\u2019 \u201d Later, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">And how this could not have been gone into on the deposition really surprises me. Once the doctor said in two locations in the deposition that the lumbar ulcer was caused because of the bar riding against Mr. Wilson\u2019s back in the same position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">It would have seemed that both sides would have pursued this area a little further by asking how or why did it do this.... And the plaintiff would have wanted to know why in preparation for their case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Moreover, the court reiterated: \u201cWhen the doctor made several references to the bar, I\u2019m actually shocked that neither side bothered to ask, \u2018what about the bar doing this? Why did the bar do it? Or how did the bar do it?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Additionally, appellants\u2019 counsel insisted that she was not attempting to establish that appellee was contributorily negligent in using the defective wheelchair. Instead, she claimed that the condition of the wheelchair was relevant to the issue of causation of the ulcer on the lumbar area of appellee\u2019s back.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellants\u2019 counsel indicated to the court that she had no opposition to an instruction to the jury to the effect that Mr. Wilson\u2019s use of a broken wheelchair was not evidence of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Out of the presence of the jury, the court also questioned Dr. Orlando about his testimony. The doctor advised the court that he thought he had testified at his deposition that the wheelchair was broken. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve never offered this opinion that the wheelchair was broken either in your deposition or in any of your discussions; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">[DR. ORLANDO]: Well, no, I did, sir. It\u2019s in my deposition. As a matter of fact, I think in my exact words it says, \u201cI was astounded when I looked at the wheelchair.\u201d And the word \u201castounded\u201d is in my deposition. Because that\u2019s the reason Mr. Wilson got his lumbar ulcer. I was quite emphatic about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The court concluded that appellants\u2019 conduct contravened the purpose of discovery, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">The purpose of discover[y] is so we do not have situations like we\u2019re having right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>So on one hand, to say that the wheelchair caused the problem is one thing. To say that Mr. Wilson, who has knowledge about this condition, knowingly sat in a broken wheelchair is a completely different situation.... Because it is a very critical issue in [appellee\u2019s] case that [appellee\u2019s counsel] was not apprised of in discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">To say that something is secondary and something results from pressure is quite different from saying someone sat in a broken wheelchair knowingly and let this happen. It\u2019s quite different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Ultimately, the court ruled: \u201cThere will be no further testimony in this case whatsoever that the chair was broken.\u201d In precluding appellants from offering evidence that the wheelchair was broken, the court found that the defense had not adequately disclosed that information at the deposition of Dr. Orlando. The court reasoned: \u201cI don\u2019t see how anyone is going to be able to infer from this [deposition] testimony that the bar caused this problem. I have no idea how someone can infer that the chair was broken from that testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Nevertheless, the judge instructed Dr. Orlando that he could \u201ccomment that the bar rubbed [appellee\u2019s] back causing the lumbar ulcer. But you cannot say under any circumstances that the chair was broken.\u201d Thereafter, in its instructions to the jury, the court said: \u201c[Y]ou are instructed that there is no evidence in this case that Mr. Wilson\u2019s wheelchair was broken, and you are not to consider any evidence of this nature or that nature in your deliberations whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">In the many colloquies that the trial court had with counsel concerning the wheelchair, it is clear that the trial court did not consider Dr. Orlando\u2019s description of the condition of the wheelchair at his deposition the equivalent of his claim at trial that the wheelchair was broken. The majority concludes that the trial judge \u201cwas not clearly erroneous in finding that Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition testimony about the condition of appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>lee\u2019s wheelchair \u2018does not connote that the wheelchair was broken.\u2019 \u201d In my view, under the circumstances attendant here, the harsh sanction imposed by the court amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">At his deposition, Dr. Orlando disclosed that he saw the wheelchair, and he provided his opinion that the wheelchair caused appellee\u2019s lumbar ulcer. It was also apparent from the doctor\u2019s testimony that he believed the wheelchair was defective, although he did not describe it as \u201cbroken.\u201d In light of the doctor\u2019s assertions, it was incumbent on appellee\u2019s counsel to explore, pursue, and develop the doctor\u2019s contentions. Yet, even after Dr. Orlando remarked that he was \u201castounded\u201d when he \u201csaw the wheelchair,\u201d and stated that Mr. Wilson \u201crode\u201d the bar into his back, plaintiffs counsel never pursued the matter. Therefore, if his attorneys were not more fully aware of the defense position, it is not because they were \u201csandbagged.\u201d To the extent that appellee did not know specifically that appellants claimed the wheelchair was \u201cbroken,\u201d it is because appellee\u2019s attorney at the deposition never asked even one follow-up question to explore Dr. Orlando\u2019s many comments about the wheelchair. Thus, appellee\u2019s claim at trial of unfair surprise was unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">A deposition \u201cis the most powerful and complete means of discovery.... \u201d Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>270 (2d ed.1992) (hereinafter, \u201cNiemeyer &amp; Schuett\u201d). Through a process of probing questions, an attorney who conducts a deposition is ordinarily able to \u201cdiscover\u201d information relevant to the case. Certainly, a deponent must respond accurately to questions that are asked, and not hide information responsive to a particular question. But, it falls squarely on the lawyer conducting the deposition to pose the proper questions to ascertain relevant information that may prove vital to the case, and to gain an understanding of an opponent\u2019s theory, contentions, and factual predicates. That did not happen here.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Although Dr. Orlando never used the word \u201cbroken\u201d at his deposition, the witness\u2019s failure to use that word is not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>standing alone, fatal to the use of that word at trial, considering that neither deposition nor trial testimony of a witness is supposed to be scripted. What is important is whether the witness truthfully and accurately answered questions that were properly posed. There is no suggestion here that the witness willfully withheld information responsive to the lawyer\u2019s questions. Dr. Orlando disclosed adequate information about the condition of the wheelchair to have prompted appel-lee\u2019s attorney to inquire further. Yet, appellee\u2019s counsel never asked any questions about the wheelchair. Therefore, Dr. Orlando\u2019s characterization at trial of a \u201cbroken\u201d wheelchair was not the kind of unfair deviation from his deposition testimony that warranted such a harsh sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>Bartholomee v. Casey, </em>103 Md.App. 34, 651 A.2d 908 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 Md. 557, 659 A.2d 1293 (1995), a lead paint case, is misplaced. Indeed, that case suggests to me that the court below abused its discretion. There, the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence at trial squarely contradicted their answers to interrogatories. As a result, we concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court abused its discretion \u201cby admitting evidence that did not conform to the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 651 A.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In <em>Bartholomee, </em>only four days before trial, in a case that had been pending for more than four years, the plaintiffs filed affidavits alleging for the first time that the property owner knew of peeling lead paint on the exterior of the property in issue, that the owner\u2019s attempted abatement was ineffective, and that the dangerous condition persisted even after the attempted abatement. Those averments conflicted with the plaintiffs\u2019 answers to interrogatories. In light of the belated disclosure, the defense unsuccessfully sought a postponement or, alternatively, a ruling barring evidence relating to the abatement efforts and the condition of the exterior of the house. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 651 A.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">On appeal, we recognized that \u201c[a] trial court clearly has the power to exclude evidence <em>willfully </em>withheld by one party in violation of properly filed discovery requests.\u201d <em>Bartholomee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>103 Md.App. at 48, 651 A.2d 908 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-433(a); <em>Starfish Condominium Ass\u2019n. v. Yorkridge Serv. Corp. Inc., </em>295 Md. 693, 712, 458 A.2d 805 (1983) (recognizing court\u2019s discretion to exclude testimony of expert witness who was not identified in response to interrogatory request, even if failure to disclose \u201cwas not willful or contumacious.\u201d). We also distinguished in <em>Bartholomee </em>a failure to supply information properly requested in an interrogatory, evident early in a case, which could be \u201ceasily remedied by an order compelling disclosure\u201d under Md. Rule 2-432(b), from a belated disclosure on \u201cthe eve of trial.\u201d <em>Bartholomee, </em>103 Md.App. at 48, 651 A.2d 908; <em>see State Roads Comm\u2019n v. 370 Ltd. Partnership, </em>325 Md. 96, 109, 599 A.2d 449 (1991) (upholding judge\u2019s discretion to bar expert testimony because expert was not disclosed in answers to interrogatories, no information as to expert\u2019s opinion was provided before trial, and proposed testimony was not based on what occurred in courtroom; witness could have formed opinion based on information available before trial and opponents were unfairly denied \u201cmeaningful pretrial discovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">As to the court\u2019s failure to exclude evidence regarding the exterior of the house, we found no error because the Health Department\u2019s notice had disclosed that the exterior paint contained lead and was flaking. <em>Bartholomee, </em>103 Md.App. at 49, 651 A.2d 908. Nevertheless, we concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence concerning the abatement method and post-abatement condition of the property, in light of previous statements by the plaintiffs in discovery, which we characterized as \u201ctantamount to a concession\u201d that the abatement was satisfactory and that the defendant had fulfilled any duty owed to the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 651 A.2d 908. We focused on the disputed evidence, which \u201cflatly contradicted\u201d the answers to interrogatories and constituted \u201cthe kind of unfair surprise that careful adherence to the discovery process was intended to avoid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">This case is altogether different from <em>Bartholomee </em>and the other cases cited above. Here, there is no contention that appellants failed to make timely disclosure of their expert or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>their claim that the lumbar ulcer was caused by the condition of the wheelchair. Nor did they ever \u201cflatly contradict\u201d at trial the position advanced at the deposition. The semantic difference in the deposition and trial testimony was, at worst, a difference of degree. Dr. Orlando clearly stated at his deposition that the condition of the wheelchair caused the lumbar ulcer. If appellee had explored that assertion, and the doctor then failed to expand on his testimony in such a way as to convey more clearly that the wheelchair was \u201cbroken,\u201d I might agree with the majority. That exploration never occurred, however. Therefore, what we said in <em>Bartholomee </em>should apply here: \u201c \u2018A party seeking discovery may not expect his opponent to construe discovery requests as broadly as possible, in essence, to volunteer information beyond the request, on pain of preclusion of evidence at trial as a discovery sanction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartholomee, </em>108 Md.App. at 49, 651 A.2d 908 (quoting John A. Lynch, Jr. &amp; Richard W. Bourne, <em>Modem Maryland Civil Procedure, </em>\u00a7 7.8(c), at 597 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Moreover, in my view, appellee waived his claim of error because of an untimely objection at trial. Notwithstanding the concern of appellee\u2019s counsel that Dr. Orlando\u2019s trial testimony might differ from what Dr. Orlando had said at his deposition, appellee\u2019s lawyer did not object to Dr. Orlando\u2019s testimony that the wheelchair was broken until after he had so testified on several occasions. Thus, the majority is plainly wrong in stating that, during Dr. Orlando\u2019s direct examination at trial, appellee\u2019s counsel objected the first time that the witness used the word \u201cbroken.\u201d Interestingly, if, as appellee argues, the testimony of Dr. Orlando regarding the broken condition of the wheelchair was such a surprise, and was materially different from that which had been offered by Dr. Orlando at the deposition, surely appellee\u2019s skilled and experienced attorney would have noticed and would have promptly objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Based on some of the responses of appellant\u2019s counsel to various questions posed by the court during the many discussions about the matter, the judge was understandably frustrated by what he perceived as defense counsel\u2019s lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>candor and too much gamesmanship. I do not condone such conduct. Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of the totality of the situation. Appellee was placed on notice at Dr. Orlando\u2019s deposition of the defense contention that the wheelchair was defective, and that its condition caused a lumbar ulcer. At the deposition, appellee\u2019s attorney never pursued that contention by asking even a single follow-up question. Even after the deposition, I am not aware of any specific attempt by appellee to obtain clarification of the doctor\u2019s testimony. Moreover, appellee initially failed to object to the repeated testimony of Dr. Orlando at trial that the wheelchair was broken. For these reasons, I believe the court abused its discretion when it barred appellants from pursuing the defense theory that the lumbar ulcer developed after appellee was seen at the emergency room on August 30, 1994, and was caused by appellee\u2019s defective wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Although the court indicated that it would permit Dr. Orlando to testify at trial as he had at his deposition, I cannot conclude that appellants were able adequately to present their defense. To reach that conclusion, I would have to overlook the court\u2019s instruction to the jury, admonishing it not to consider any evidence that the wheelchair was broken. The jury was not necessarily able to distinguish between a \u201cbroken\u201d wheelchair and a transverse bar on the back of the wheelchair that rubbed appellee\u2019s back, especially if, as the defense argued, the deposition testimony was tantamount to an assertion that the wheelchair was broken. In effect, then, the jury was told to disregard the testimony as to the condition of the wheelchair, and appellants were put in an untenable position with respect to their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\">. Above-the-knee amputations were required as a consequence of the severe infection surrounding the ulcer, as it occluded the blood supply to appellee's lower extremities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. The attorney who conducted the deposition for appellee was not the attorney who expressed concern to the court about Dr. Orlando's anticipated testimony or who made the various arguments to the court about the trial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-11\">. As noted, the defense maintained that the lumbar ulcer did not exist when Mr. Wilson was first seen at Good Samaritan Hospital on August 30, 1994, and it developed thereafter as a result of the condition of the wheelchair.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
