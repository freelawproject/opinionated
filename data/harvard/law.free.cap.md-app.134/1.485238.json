Tina Hill, appellant and the plaintiff below, brings this appeal from a post-trial Order by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County reducing a jury verdict in her favor to zero dollars ($0.00) and entering judgment for the appellees/defendants Ricardo L. Scartascini, M.D. and his professional corporation. On appeal, Hill asks this court to address whether the trial court erred in entering judgment for the defendants rather than entering the plaintiffs judgment as \u201csatisfied.\u201d Appellees maintain that Hill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>argument is contrary to the language of the Joint Tort-Feasor\u2019s Release which she executed, is contrary to the \u201ctrue outcome\u201d of the case, and that the appeal should be dismissed as moot. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the judgment was incorrectly entered by the trial court and that it should be amended to reflect more accurately how this case was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On August 14,1995, Hill underwent an emergency Cesarean section in the Prince George\u2019s Medical Center, in which she suffered a ruptured uterus and bladder, as well as other injuries. She brought suit against the physician, Dr. Seartas-cini, his professional corporation, and Dimensions Health Corporation (\u201cDimensions\u201d), which owns the hospital, alleging negligence and lack of informed consent. On August 9, 1999, Hill settled her claim against Dimensions for $100,000 and signed a Joint Tort-Feasor\u2019s Release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case against Dr. Scartascini and his professional corporation (collectively, \u201cDr. Scartascini\u201d) proceeded to trial, and at the conclusion of the five day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict for Hill in the amount of $72,056.87. Because the jury award was less than the amount paid by Dimensions, Dr. Scartascini filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment seeking to have the judgment reduced to zero dollars ($0.00), or, alternatively, to have judgment entered in the.defendants\u2019 favor. Hill opposed the motion, arguing that the judgment should be marked \u201csatisfied\u201d in the amount of the judgment, $72,056.87, as set forth in <em>Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 476 A.2d 197 (1984). Dr. Scartascini filed a Response to Hill\u2019s Opposition and requested a hearing. Without conducting a hearing and stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201c[t]his truly appears to be an esoteric issue of no practical importance to anyone, ... [with which] the Court will spend no significant amount of time or effort ...\u201d the lower court granted the defendants\u2019 motion by reducing the judgment to zero dollars ($0.00) as well as entering judgment in favor of Dr. Seartascini.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">We first address Dr. Scartascini\u2019s argument that the case is moot because there is no controversy to which this court could provide a remedy. \u201cA question is moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d <em>Attorney General v. Anne Arundel County School Bus, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749 (1979). We do not find the issue to be moot because not only does a controversy still exist between the parties, but this Court can provide an effective remedy by reversing the judgment below and modifying the judgment. As this Court said in <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>63 Md.App. 220, 226, 492 A.2d 649 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>305 Md. 1, 501 A.2d 432 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">Were we to dismiss this appeal [for mootness], those [court] orders would remain spread out among the records of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for all to see. While they may not ever be utilized and while their effect beyond mere existence is not known, and may be none, that existence, uncontradicted, gives substance to this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az\">Similarly, in this case, the judgment for Dr. Seartascini remains in the records of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for all to see, despite the jury\u2019s finding that Dr. Seartascini was hable to Hill for medical malpractice. We therefore reject appellees\u2019 argument of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">We now turn to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors\u2019 Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Under the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">A release by the' injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, <em>does not discharge the other tort-feasor unless the release so provides, but it re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>duces the claim </em>against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ\">Md. Code (1998 Repl.Vol.) Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404 (emphasis added). In other words, unless the injured party\u2019s release discharged the non-settling tort-feasor, the Act provides only that the claim be reduced. Neither the Act nor Maryland case law allows for judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant. Therefore, we conclude that the lower court erred in entering judgment for Dr. Scartascini and his professional corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Dr. Scartascini argues that the lower court\u2019s Order was consistent with the language of the release, which stated that Hill \u201cagree[d] to reduce any award, judgment or recovery.\u201d He contends that because Hill sought compensatory damages only, as opposed to punitive damages, an injunction, or specific performance, the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201ctantamount to a judgment in favor of the defendants.\u201d Dr. Scartascini cites no authority for such proposition, however. In addition, he does not argue that the release discharged him from liability. In fact, the first sentence of the release states that Hill \u201centers into this Joint Tort-feasor Release for the purpose of discharging <em>solely the settling Defendant </em>[Dimensions] from all liability, in tort, contract or otherwise, for any injury or damage of any kind arising out of the disputed medical care (as defined therein).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The release further states, \u201cThe Plaintiff does not, however, release the non-settling Defendant in any respect whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Our holding is consistent with the result in <em>Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 476 A.2d 197 (1984). In <em>Martinez, </em>a minor and her parents filed a medical malpractice claim against the treating physician and the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 476 A.2d 197. The plaintiffs settled with the hospital for $725,000 and executed a joint tort-feasors\u2019 release. Trial proceeded as to the doctor and the jury returned a verdict for $600,000. Despite the fact that the settlement amount exceeded the jury verdict, the trial court held the doctor liable for $300,000, one-half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the jury verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 95, 476 A.2d 197. This Court affirmed the trial court. However, the Court of Appeals reversed, stating that \u201cthe trial court should have granted [the doctor\u2019s] motion for the entry of a credit satisfying judgment against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 476 A.2d 197. Although <em>Martinez </em>did not explicitly discuss whether the proper judgment entry should be \u201csatisfied\u201d or entered in favor of the defendant, the language used in the opinion makes clear that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff as the prevailing party, even though the damage award is less than the amount paid by the settling defendant. The Court of Appeals framed the issue as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">... whether the amount paid by the settling defendant in excess of a pro rata share generally operates to reduce the total claim and, ... whether the excess paid operates to <em>satisfy </em>any judgment to be entered for the injured party against the nonsettling tortfeasor. For reasons hereinafter stated <em>we shall hold that the total claim is satisfied....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">The issue is the effect which the release given by the Plaintiffs to Suburban has on <em>any judgment to be entered against Martinez. </em>On that issue [the Act] is dispositive. It tells us that the Plaintiffs\u2019 release of Suburban \u2018reduces the claim against\u2019 Martinez.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 94, 476 A.2d 197 (Emphasis added). The Court of Appeals remanded the case to this Court for \u201cremand to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with instructions to enter as \u2018satisfied\u2019 the judgment____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 476 A.2d 197. <em>See also Keene Corp. v. Levin, </em>330 Md. 287, 293, 623 A.2d 662 (1993) (citing <em>Martinez </em>for the proposition that \u201cit is conceivable that the amount of money already paid to the plaintiffs by settling defendants may exceed the amount of compensatory damages awarded them in these cases, in which event <em>the claims of the plaintiffs for compensatory damages would be wholly satisfied.\u201d) </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The facts in this case are similar to those in <em>Martinez. </em>Here, the jury did not find in Dr. Scartascini\u2019s favor, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>court\u2019s order suggests, but rather determined that he had damaged the plaintiff to the extent of more than $72,000. An entry of zero dollars ($0.00) and a judgment in his favor pursuant to a release he did not \u201cpurchase\u201d or sign should not be used to vindicate his actions. The defendants are not required to pay the amount found due by the jury because Dimensions earlier had paid the plaintiff more than the award. However, the doctor was certainly not exonerated nor was he absolved of responsibility for the plaintiffs injuries simply because the jury awarded less than had already been paid pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasor\u2019s Release. Therefore, a judgment in his favor is not accurate. This Court finds that the most accurate entry to the docket entries of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, and that which is consistent with the statute, the release, and the verdict, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"am-dedup-0\">Judgment for plaintiff. Jury award of $72,056.87 reduced and satisfied pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasor\u2019s Release dated August 9, 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
