ALPERT</author>\n<p id=\"AtO\">(Ret., specially assigned), Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">The marriage has ended, but the litigation lingers on. In this domestic relations case between Barbara J. McCall, appel-lee, and James F. Rauch, appellant, in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Montgomery County, appellant now presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">I. Where a contract provides that the party in breach shall be responsible for all attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by the party that is successful in enforcing the contract, and the amount spent in attempting to remedy the breach is documented to the trial court, is the court compelled to award that figure against the breaching party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">II. Did the trial court err in dismissing appellant\u2019s counts for conversion and detinue under his third amended complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">III. Did the trial court have authority to prohibit appellant from filing any pleading or document pro se?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">IV. Did the trial judge have authority to require that all information concerning Ms. McCall\u2019s deferred employee compensation plan be released only to appellant\u2019s counsel and not to appellant contrary to the parties\u2019 agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand on question I., and affirm on question II. In light of our decisions on questions I. and II., we need not address questions III. and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The parties were married on May 6, 1967. Two children were born to the marriage, both of whom are above the age of majority. The marriage began to disintegrate in early 1990. Appellee filed for divorce on June 13, 1990, but returned home and dismissed the divorce action soon thereafter. The parties separated permanently in December of 1990. A Separation Agreement was signed by both parties on October 16, 1991, as a prelude to the divorce, which was granted by the circuit court on February 16, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Although litigation between the parties has been almost continuous since 1990, this case arises out of the terms of the Separation Agreement, namely: (1) money owed to appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>from the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\u201cQDRO\u201d) and (2) appellee\u2019s possession of appellant\u2019s personal property. On July 29, 1991, the parties reached an oral agreement on the record that (1) their personal possessions would be divided in half, and (2) appellee would move out of the marital home by October 15, 1991, taking her personal property and leaving appellant\u2019s personal property. Appellee left the home by October 15th; an examination of the property revealed, however, that some of appellant\u2019s personal property was taken by appellee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to signing the October 16 th Settlement Agreement, appellant provided appellee with a list of the missing items to be returned by October 17th. Over the next few months, only a few of the items were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The parties also disputed the lack of a QDRO concerning appellant\u2019s rights to appellee\u2019s pension and profit sharing plans with Bell Atlantic, her employer, as called for in the Separation Agreement. Appellee had failed to disclose, or authorize Bell Atlantic to turn over, the contents of these plans. There was also evidence that appellee took a Hardship Withdrawal from her 401 (k) in the amount of $44,800.00 sometime in early 1991 without disclosure to appellant, which was allegedly in direct violation of the Separation Agreement. Appellant did not learn of the withdrawal until March 30,1993. Appellee also continually refused to sign the QDRO submitted by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The procedural history of these disputes is extensive; thus, to put the facts into context, we provide a brief historical overview.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Voluntary Separation Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On October 16, 1991, the parties signed a separation agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d), to be incorporated but not merged into the divorce decree. With regard to the personal property and furnishings of the parties, the Agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">The parties have already divided between them, to their mutual satisfaction, all personal effects, household furniture and furnishings, and all other articles of personal property which heretofore have been held by them in common. Neither party shall make a claim to any such items which are now in the possession or under the control of the other party. Henceforth, each of the parties shall own, have and enjoy, independent of any right or claim of the other, all items of property of any kind, nature and description, and wheresoever situated, which are now owned or held by him or her with the full power to him or her to dispose of the same as fully and effectually in all respects and for all purposes as if he or she were unmarried. (See attached [computerized]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inventory list).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The Agreement provided for counsel fees and the right to counsel. Both parties agreed to be <em>\u201cresponsible for their own legal fees incurred in the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement.\u201d </em>[emphasis added]. Furthermore, <em>\u201cin the event of a breach of the Agreement by either party, the party at fault shall be responsible for payment of all attorney s\u2019 fees and costs including expert witness fees </em>____\u201d [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Section IX of the Agreement dealt with pensions of appel-lee, who was a \u201cparticipant in deferred employee compensation plan(s) sponsored or offered by her employer.\u201d The Agreement related that appellant was to be the alternate payee of the plans \u201caccording to the percentages provided in this paragraph (50/50),\u201d and that any future court judgment or order \u201cshall be in the form of or shall contain a ... (QDRO) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>which shall meet the requirements of a QDRO as defined by ... ERISA ... as from time to time amended.\u201d This section further provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">Husband\u2019s equitable interest in each of Wife\u2019s plans is hereby declared to be fifty percent (50%) of the total benefits due to the Wife at any time ... Husband shall receive 50% of the Wife\u2019s interests in any plan(s), including any joint and survivor annuity or death benefits, if, as, and when such payments are made.... <em>The Wife has not taken any action since May 17, 1991 and shall take no further action to decrease any account balance in any plan(s) or diminish the employee or employer rate or percentage of contribution </em>(e.g. currently 10% of wife\u2019s gross salary, in regard to the Wife\u2019s 401 plan) without the prior written consent of Husband. Wife shall not cause any change in any provision of any plan either by action or inaction without advance notice and the written consent of Husband. Wife agrees to authorize all plan administrators to respond to Husband\u2019s request for plan status, plan financial reports or account statements within ten (10) days of a request. <em>Wife expressly agrees to cooperate and to execute such other documents as may be necessary to give effect to this provision of this </em>Agreement____ The parties further agree that until a Court Order of assignment is accepted and approved by the Wife\u2019s employer, the Court of appropriate jurisdiction shall retain jurisdiction to modify its order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Hearing on February 17, 1995</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">On February 17th, a hearing on appellant\u2019s first amended complaint transpired to resolve the issues of the QDRO and the personal property. Based on the enormous amount of pleadings that appellant had filed in the case, the circuit court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">the division of all the personal property belongs, and everything [in the] separation agreement, precludes him from now proceeding either in this domestic case or in any type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of replevin action, any claim to any further division of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Appellant had filed a replevin action in the district court, which was removed to the circuit court, where there was no jurisdiction. The court noted that the claim arose from the Agreement and was not appropriately phrased as a replevin action. The court went into a lengthy discussion with counsel over appellee\u2019s pension plans and the QDRO provided for in the Agreement, however, deferred ruling because not all of the evidence was before the court to render <em>a </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In July of 1997, an appeal was noted to this Court from the circuit court\u2019s denial of a Motion for Appropriate Relief, requesting the judge to sign a QDRO pursuant to the Agreement. In <em>Rauch v. McCall, </em>No. 1764, Sept. Term 1996, 116 Md.App. 745 (filed July 24, 1997), this Court held that the circuit court\u2019s order of June 20, 1996 was not a final judgment, and accordingly dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">This Court noted, however, that appellee \u201chas already bargained away a 50 percent interest in the QDROs in this case. It would appear that the actual purpose of any restrictions or limitations ... is to protect the payor of the pension (Bell Atlantic) as opposed to the participant spouse.\u201d We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">Under the circumstances of this matter, prior to signing the QDRO in question, the chancellor may wish to determine whether Ms. McCall\u2019s failure to cooperate and her attorney\u2019s refusal to act was done so in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-10\"><em>Id. </em>(slip op. at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Appellant had included an issue in the appeal regarding the replevin action; namely the circuit court\u2019s failure to afford him a hearing prior to its dismissal. This Court held that because the appeal filed was strictly related to the denial of the motion regarding only the QDRO, the court\u2019s failure to award a hearing on the replevin action was beyond its scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Hearing on October 9, 1998</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Yet another hearing transpired on October 9 th to resolve the QDRO disputes, specifically appellant\u2019s request that appellee sign the order. The court heard the evidence regarding the Agreement and dealings between the parties since its inception. The court concluded, however, that the only time period that was relevant in determining whether appellee withdrew from the funds in violation of the Agreement was after May 17,1991.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">With regard to appellee\u2019s failure to disclose to appellant any information concerning the amounts in the accounts and any withdrawals <em>after </em>May 17, 1991, the court held that appellant was entitled to this information because the Agreement provided for a 50% share to each party. Thus, appellee was required to submit to appellant on these issues and authorize Bell Atlantic to disclose the contents of her plans. The court ordered that both parties prepare a QDRO that they could agree upon within 10 days, and if the parties could not agree, that the court would appoint an independent third party to prepare a QDRO at the parties\u2019 expense and submit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The court also refused to impose sanctions on either party because both parties \u201chave through their actions perpetuated this and made this last longer than it needed to.\u201d Thus, the parties were required to each \u201cbear the expense and cost of this continued litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The issue regarding appellee\u2019s alleged failure to return appellant\u2019s personal property under the terms of the separation Agreement was raised again to the court. The court specifically stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">based on the testimony I have taken today, I am satisfied that Ms. McCall has none of the property in her possession. That does not mean that she didn\u2019t breach the contract. She may have. That is another proceeding. But, as a' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>replevin action, if she doesn\u2019t have it, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 unless she has it, I don\u2019t know how I could help ... I cannot order her to give back what she testified she doesn\u2019t have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The court noted that appellant was entitled to \u201chis day in court,\u201d to have a hearing on whether appellee breached the Agreement. In order to do so, the court needed appellant to produce all relevant information and evidence in order that the court could finally dispose of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Hearing on April 6, 1999</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The parties convened again in the circuit court on April 6th on appellee\u2019s failure to answer interrogatories and motion to compel. The court refused to impose sanctions or hold either party in contempt of court. Rather, the court denied the motion and ordered (1) appellant to provide appellee with a list of the items belonging to him that he is claiming she had, and (2) gave appellee 15 days to answer these claims after receipt of the list. The court also noted for the record that this was not a tort case, involving conversion or trespass, but rather a cause of action arising from an alleged breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Hearing on July 8, 1999</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">On July 8, 1999, a hearing regarding the personal property took place. By this time, several of the items, if not all, had been returned to appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court took testimony from both parties, and received exhibits, including an extensive list of items divided up by the parties in the separation. The court went down the list, item by item, in rendering its decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">I accept some of the evidence offered by Mr. Rauch, some of the evidence offered by Ms. McCall....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">These are items that were to be distributed to him or held by him in accordance with the parties\u2019 separation agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and the attached list of personal property to be divided on October the 16th, 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">It is clear from the record that Mr. Rauch over the years has requested the return of that property or requested that property....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">The items that were of particular concern today are those items that were either returned damaged to him or not returned at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">I have also considered the contends of Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 2, which is a letter Mr. Rauch wrote to ... Ms. McCall\u2019s attorney, on August 29, 1992, demanding property that he believed was due him then and still was an issue at today\u2019s trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">And I have tried to compare all of the exhibits and the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">I find that <em>Ms. Mc.Call did in fact breach the parties\u2019 separation agreement </em>by removing certain property that was to be property of Mr. Rauch\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">And the issue then is what damage or relief Mr. Rauch should get for the property either returned damaged or not returned at all....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">The court went on to say that the list was included as part of the Agreement and that appellee, despite its supposed unfairness, agreed to and signed it. \u201cMs. McCall\u2019s testimony was that she doesn\u2019t know if she read it or if she didn\u2019t, but it was adopted and became part of the agreement she did sign, and she is bound by it.\u201d Thus, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">She has not to this point filed any petition to set the agreement aside or clarify it. So, she is bound by what she did sign. Ms. McCall\u2019s testimony was that she took this property when she left and moved into her town house in Silver Spring sometime in October of 1991, but after the signing of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Her testimony was that she did that for reasons involving the harassment that she believed was being put on her by Mr. Rauch at that time and the record \u2014 the public record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>then of court orders \u2014 some court orders ordering Mr. Rauch to stay away from her, the pressure she felt, and other reasons that she put on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">Nonetheless, she had agreed that they would be Mr. Rauch\u2019s property. So, to that extent, I find that she is in breach of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The court then went into an extensive discussion regarding each item on the list, taking into consideration (1) valuation, (2) age, (3) depreciation, and (4) wear and tear of the property. The court found that the value of these items totaled $1,863.00 and entered judgment to appellant in that amount. Attorney\u2019s fees were awarded to appellant in the amount of $1,000.00, taking into consideration the entire proceedings, the history of the parties, and the extensive ten year long litigation involving the return of this property. Appellant\u2019s complaints for conversion, trespass, detinue, constructive trust, fraud and deceit, and punitive damages were dismissed by the court, as they were tort claims and this case involved a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">An order to this effect was entered by the court on July 30, 1999. The QDRO was signed by both parties and is now in effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant had also sought to strike ex parte orders entered against him preventing him from acting pro se and filing any pleadings or motions in the case with the court without legal representation. This motion to strike was denied by the court on September 9, 1999, along with all other outstanding motions. This appeal followed on September 27, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">I. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Appellant asserts that the provision regarding attorney\u2019s fees in the Agreement governed the trial judge\u2019s discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>necessitating application of only the contractual standard, and precluding the judge from applying the reasonableness standard. We are persuaded that the trial judge must enforce the contractual standard set forth in the Agreement, but from a reasonableness standpoint. In other words, the trial judge, on remand, is to consider the reasonableness of the documentation provided by counsel for appellant in reaching the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that appellee is required to pay as a result of her breach of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">At the July 8, 1999, hearing, the court engaged in the following analysis in reaching the conclusion that appellant was entitled to $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">Mr. Rauch is also making a claim for attorney\u2019s fees. I have considered his claim and the amount of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">I have considered the entire proceedings in this matter, and I have considered this particular issue that was tried here today and weighed it against all of the other pleadings that have been filed and the setting under which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\"><em>And I do give credence </em>\u2014 even <em>though [appellee], I believe, did breach the contract by taking this property, I do give some credence to her motivation, if you will, not necessarily to breach a contract, </em>but just the state of affairs that did exist at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">And I take into consideration the public history of this litigation and the litigation initiated on this issue by Mr. Rauch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">And after considering all of the factors, I am going to award him an attorney\u2019s fee of $1,000, and I will make that part of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">The court found that appellee breached the Agreement with respect to the return of appellant\u2019s property. These holdings were noted at the July 8, 1999 hearing. The Agreement provided that \u201cin the event of a breach ... by either party, the party at fault shall be responsible for payment of all attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the court awarded appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>only $1,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, when counsel had provided the court with documentation evidencing a substantial amount more incurred in fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Family Law, \u00a7 8-101, parties in a domestic case may form enforceable separation agreements. See <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>14 Md.App. 263, 286 A.2d 778 (1972) (courts <em>are </em>\u201cempowered to recognize and enforce\u201d separation agreements). A provision regarding attorney\u2019s fees may be included in the separation agreement. <em>See Peterman v. Peterman, </em>14 Md.App. 310, 286 A.2d 812 (1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In resolving disputes regarding enforcement of separation agreements, courts are required to apply the law of contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">A separation agreement being a contract between the parties is subject to the same general rules governing other contracts, and particular questions must be resolved by reference to the particular language of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">See <em>Pumphrey v. Pumphrey, </em>11 Md.App. 287, 273 A.2d 637 (1971); <em>Eigenbrode v. Eigenbrode, </em>36 Md.App. 557, 373 A.2d 1306 (1977). A settlement agreement, like the one in the present case, that has been incorporated but not merged into the divorce decree, may be enforced by the court as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>independent contract. See <em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 681 A.2d 568 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">There is no appellate decision in Maryland on the specific question of whether a provision regarding payment of attorney\u2019s fees without mention of \u201creasonableness,\u201d means that the court is to award the full amount of fees requested by the non-breaching party without an analysis into its reasonableness. We, therefore, analogize this case to <em>Holzman v. Fiola Blum, Inc., </em>125 Md.App. 602, 726 A.2d 818 (1999), where a real estate broker brought an action against the sellers of a home to recover his commission and attorney\u2019s fees. The contract between the parties provided that if the broker prevailed in a court action against the seller, he would be \u201centitled to recover in such action his/her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d 125 Md.App. at 611, 726 A.2d 818. The broker prevailed, and the circuit court awarded him $12,408 in attorney\u2019s fees, which was the amount pursuant to the one-third contingency agreement. The issue in the case was whether this amount was binding as a reasonable fee, as the parties did not agree to pay \u201cwhatever legal fee appellee [the broker] might agree to pay its attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 726 A.2d 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">This Court stated that while, \u201c[o]rdinarily, a prevailing party is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees ..., a trial court generally may award attorney\u2019s fees only when statutorily authorized or when, as here, a contract between the parties specifically authorizes such fees.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>see <em>Hess Construction Co. v. Board of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 159, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996); <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Dev. Ltd. Partnership, </em>100 Md.App. 441, 452, 641 A.2d 977 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees by the court is a \u201cfactual matter which lies within the \u2018sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 452, 641 A.2d 977 (citing <em>Reisterstown Plaza Associates v. General Nutrition Ctr., Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 232, 248, 597 A.2d 1049 (1991)).

The circuit court did not rely on an evaluation into the reasonableness of the fees as required by applicable contract law.

At the July 8, 1999 hearing, the court dismissed appellant\u2019s claims for conversion, detinue, constructive trust, fraud and deceit, and punitive damages based on the conclusion reached on April 6th. Appellee was required to return appellant\u2019s property based on the terms set forth in the Agreement. Any failure to do so raises a breach of that Agreement, not an action in tort. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Appellant relies on <em>Bender v.

The various reasons presented for moving these items is irrelevant to this appeal.
