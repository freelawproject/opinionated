After the Honorable Michelle D. Hotten granted appellees\u2019 motions (1) in limine and (2) for summary judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this appeal-followed, in which appellant presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">I. Did the circuit court err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">II. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion by granting appellee\u2019s motion in limine and excluding the testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d to each question and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Appellant claimed that on April 25, 1995, while driving her Tercel, she was involved in an automobile accident during which she suffered chemical burns to her cheek when she was struck in the face by the air bag on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant identified Michael D. Leshner as an expert witness who would testify that the chemical burns she sustained in the accident were caused by a design defect in the air bag.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Toyota moved in limine to exclude Mr. Leshner\u2019s testimony. Judge Hotten granted that motion. Toyota then moved for summary judgment on the ground that the cause of action asserted in this case requires the presentation of expert testimony. Judge Hotten granted that motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">I. Expert Testimony in Air Bag Cases When ruling on Toyota\u2019s motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Hotten stated the following explanation for her conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>sion of law that expert testimony is required to generate the issue of whether a person\u2019s injury was caused by a design defect in a vehicle\u2019s air bag:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">The standard is whether a fair minded jury could find for the plaintiff in light of the pleadings and the evidence presented, and there must be more than a scintilla of evidence in order to proceed to trial, as set forth in the case of <em>Seaboard Surety Company v. Richard Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 603 A.2d 1357, which was a 1992 appellate decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Additionally, if the facts are susceptible to more than one inference, inference must be drawn in favor of the moving party____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">The main issues before the court relative to the plaintiffs complaint and amendments thereto are issues relative to products liability negligence and breach of warranty, among others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">The plaintiffs assertion, which has been set forth in exhausting detail by the testimony of Mr. Leshner, and as set forth in the appropriate pleadings and arguments is that in fact as a result of a defect in the air bag system that she was injured, and that there was a causal connection between that defect and the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">As such, the plaintiff, to support her theories, must assert or establish that, one, a defect existed. Two, that somehow the defect was peculiarly within the perview of the defendant; that is, that the defect is somehow attributable to the defendant under the appropriate legal theory or standard, and that the plaintiff was injured, and that there is a causal relationship between this defect and her injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">The general rule is well established that expert testimony is only required when the subject of the inference is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>particularly related to some science or profession that it is beyond the ken of the average layman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Experts are not required, however, on matters on which the jurors would be aware by virtue of common knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Air bag technology is highly specialized, and while no Maryland cases have been decided on this issue, other jurisdictions have required an expert in air bag deployment and defect cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">Without expert testimony in this case the peculiar issues before the court are outside the realm of lay juror\u2019s understanding, and without it the theories asserted by the plaintiff are speculative at best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">The court does not believe that the theory of Res Ipsa Loquitur is appropriate under the circumstances and the issues presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">Accordingly, upon consideration of the arguments that have been presented relative to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court\u2019s review of the record and the pleadings, the court at this time grants the motion for summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">We agree with that analysis, which is consistent with other appellate courts that have considered the question, including <em>Britt v. Chrysler Corp., </em>699 So.2d 179 (Ala.1997), in which the Civil Court of Appeals of Alabama affirmed the entry of summary judgment against a plaintiff who had failed to proffer expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">The airbag system involved in this case is comprised of clock spring sensors, diagnostic units, and an airbag/inflator unit. Therefore, we hold that an airbag system is \u201cprecisely the type of complex and technical commodity that [requires] expert testimony to prove an alleged defect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\"><em>Britt, </em>699 So.2d at 181 (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">In a products liability case, the plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) the existence of a defect; (2) the attribution of the defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>to the seller; and (3) a causal relation between the defect and the injury.\u201d <em>Jensen v. American Motors Corp., </em>50 Md.App. 226, 234, 437 A.2d 242 (1981). It is well settled that expert testimony is required \u201cwhen the subject of the inference is so particularly related to some science or profession that it is beyond the ken of the average layman.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident and Indemnity Comp. v. Scarlett Harbor Assoc. Limited Partnership, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 257, 674 A.2d 106 (1996), aff'd. 346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997) (citing <em>Virgil v. \u201cKash N\u2019 Karry\u201d Service Corp., </em>61 Md.App. 23,23, 484 A.2d 652 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 681, 490 A.2d 719 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Although \u201c[e]xpert testimony is not required ... on matters of which the jurors would be aware by virtue of common knowledge,\u201d <em>Babylon v. Scruton, </em>215 Md. 299, 307, 138 A.2d 375 (1958), the issue of whether an air bag was defectively designed is well \u201cbeyond the ken of the average layman.\u201d The correct resolution of that issue requires the application of science, mechanics, and engineering, rather than of matters that jurors \u201cwould be aware [of] by virtue of common knowledge.\u201d We therefore hold that the products liability plaintiff who claims to have been injured due to the defective design of an air bag must present expert testimony to generate a jury issue on whether the air bag was defective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>II. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Judge Hotten stated the following explanation for her decision to grant Toyota\u2019s motion in limine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">Maryland Rule 5-702 governs expert testimony, and provides such testimony will be admitted if it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence, or determine a fact in issue, and if, one, the witness is qualified to render the expert opinion by virtue of knowledge, skill, training or experience or education; and two, that there is a sufficient factual basis to support the expert factual opinions made by that witness; and three, that the expert testimony is appropriate on this subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">Mr. Leshner\u2019s testimony, unfortunately, does not meet the requirements of Maryland Rule 5-702 in terms of his qualifications and sufficiency of the factual basis for his opinions or assumptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Had Mr. Leshner been minimally qualified to render the expert opinions proffered, I would have agreed with plaintiffs counsel that any objections by the defendant relative to Mr. Leshner\u2019s training, expertise or basis of knowledge would go to the weight of the evidence, and not to its admissibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Unfortunately, such is not the case at bar. Accordingly, reluctantly, upon consideration of testimony, the motion at this time is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Appellant asserts that this ruling was incorrect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded, however, that Judge Hotten\u2019s decision consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tuted an unfairly prejudicial abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">A. The Qualifications Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Mr. Leshner has been a mechanical engineer for twenty-six years and has a state license in professional engineering. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in science and completed one year of graduate studies. He worked as mechanical engineer for several companies on systems such as automotive cooling and heating, air conditioning, defrosting, engine electronics, control systems, and hospital- equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Mr. Leshner is a member of several societies, including the National Society of Professional Engineers, National Forensic Center, National Association of Professional Accident Reconstruction Specialists, and National Academy of Forensic Engineers. He had held 15 U.S. patents and some corresponding foreign patents on automotive electronic control systems, medical products, stoves, and combustion. Mr. Leshner admitted that none of these patents related to air bag systems or components. He has also published several articles, but none of the articles involved air bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Mr. Leshner has never been accepted as an expert witness in a trial involving air bag design. His knowledge of air bags was mostly (if not entirely) derived from his employment as a litigation consultant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He is not a medical doctor and has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>medical training. He does not have any \u201chands on\u201d experience relating to air bag technology, and none of the courses he has taken involved \u201cair bag design, manufacture or assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Although Mr. Leshner held himself out as a \u201cexpert in air bag technology,\u201d \u201cair bag denting,\u201d and \u201cair bag folding patterns,\u201d he has never (1) designed an air bag system, (2) designed a component for an air bag system, (3) \u201cbeen to a plant where air bags or air bag components are manufactured,\u201d nor (4) seen a video of air bag components being installed into a vehicle. Mr. Leshner had not personally \u201cseen an air bag system or any of its components being installed into a car,\u201d nor had he been to any automotive assembly plans since the mid 1980\u2019s. He also never (1) \u201cdesigned a protocol or a methodology for analyzing an air bag system or an air bag component,\u201d (2) personally saw an air bag deployed, nor (3) \u201cpersonally conducted or participated in any type of crash test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Although an expert is \u201cqualified\u201d if he or she demonstrates a \u201cminimal amount of competence or knowledge in the area in which [he] purports to be an expert,\u201d <em>Naughton v. Bankier, </em>114 Md.App. 641, 655, 691 A.2d 712 (1997), we are not persuaded that Judge Hotten erred or abused her discretion in concluding that Mr. Leshner was not qualified to express the proffered opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">B. The \u201cFactual Basis\u201d Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Mr. Leshner\u2019s opinion was based on: (1) general engineering principles, (2) his examination of the subject air bag and other components from appellant\u2019s car,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (3) his interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tation of a photograph taken of appellant two days after the accident (looking at the \u201ccircular mark on her cheek [which was the] same size and shape as the vents in the air bag,\u201d (4) his review of appellant\u2019s medical records, (5) his analysis of other air bag cases, (6) his understanding that appellant was wearing her seat belt when the accident occurred,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Toyota\u2019s supplemental responses to appellant\u2019s request for admissions, in which Toyota stated that \u201ca minute amount of sodium hydroxide\u201d was generated during deployment, and that air bags might have caused \u201cminor burns, or abrasions and swelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In addition, Mr. Leshner examined photographs of crash tests conducted with a crash dummy, where red make-up was placed on the face of the dummy. He claimed that he was able to determine where the air bag hit the dummy\u2019s face from observing where the red make-up ended up on the air bag. Although the make-up had also been placed on the dummy\u2019s arms, hands, knees, and steering wheel, Mr. Leshner stated that he could nonetheless distinguish \u201cwhat red, on these air bags, comes from the face as opposed to the arms, the hands, or the knees, or the steering wheel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Mr. Leshner reviewed expert testimony presented in other air bag cases, and he conducted a search of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website and determined that several persons had complained about being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cburned\u201d by air bags. He did not, however, conduct a followup investigation of any of these complaints, none of which mentioned the word \u201cchemical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">It is well settled that the trial judge \u2014 not the expert witness \u2014 determines whether there exists an adequate factual basis for the opinion at issue. <em>Madden v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>27 Md.App. 17, 44, 339 A.2d 340 (1975). We are not persuaded that Judge Hotten was clearly erroneous in finding that Mr. Leshner\u2019s opinion was based on an incomplete factual predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">C. The Methodology Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Even if we were to assume that Mr. Leshner were (1) minimally qualified to express an opinion, and (2) had an adequate factual basis for the opinion he was prepared to express, we would nonetheless affirm Judge Hotten\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mr. Leshner never explained how the data upon which he relied led him to the conclusion that the size of the vent holes caused appellant\u2019s injuries. Thus, his opinion was properly excluded under Maryland Rule 5-702 and the cases interpreting that rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No trier of fact could conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that vent holes in an air bag caused an injury merely because an expert said that they did. Mr. Leshner\u2019s theory provided no rational explanation for why the size or location of the vent holes had anything to do with the injuries that appellant sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Mr. Leshner had admitted at deposition that it \u201cwould be impossible to estimate\u201d the precise direction that the vent holes were facing before, during, and after contact with appellant\u2019s face. He reviewed a test report prepared by Toyota \u201cwhich compares the potential for [thermal ]bums, based on different vent locations....,\u201d but he conducted \u201c[n]o testing to determine the effect on the gas flow of moving the vent holes from their present location on the 1993 Tercel air bag,\u201d and \u201cno testing, of any kind, to determine whether moving the vent holes to a 9:00 and 3:00 position would increase or decrease the possibility of burn injuries.\u201d Mr. Leshner also admitted that he did not have an opinion as to whether one of his exhibits \u2014 an alternative airbag \u2014 was defective in design, or whether it was part of a defective system.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">At the time Mr. Leshner formed his opinions and prepared his report, he had not (1) \u201cinterviewed nor spoken to the plaintiff,\u201d (2) read plaintiffs deposition, (3) talked to any of the witness or any other parties, or (4) reviewed the police report. In fact, Mr. Leshner\u2019s total inspection \u201cof the air bag in this case ... was one half hour or maybe even less,\u201d during which time he examined the air bag itself, examined the module, and disassembled the module from the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">With regard to the 1993 Tercel, Mr. Leshner did not know (1) where the sensors were for the air bag system, (2) how many sensors there were for that system, (3) the \u201cprecise threshold at which the air bag is designed to deploy,\u201d (4) \u201cwhat chemical charge is used in the igniter for the\u201d air bag system, (5) \u201cwhether, after that charge ignite[d] the sodium azide, there [were] any bi-products left over from the chemical charge,\u201d (6) whether any of the chemical bi-products were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>toxic, (7) the amount of sodium azide ignited, (8) the size of screens on the air bag\u2019s inflator, or (9) the size of the particles emitted through the screens of the filter. He had not measured (1) how far apart the vent holes were from one another, or (2) the distance between appellant\u2019s cheeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Mr. Leshner agreed that (1) the Tercel air bag complied with governmental standards,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (2) an air bag can be non-defective and still cause injury, (3) there was no manufacturing defect in the Tercel, and (4) the air bag operated in conformance with its design. He also agreed that \u201cnone of the components on this particular air bag were improperly assembled,\u201d and that \u2014 as of 1993 \u2014 he knew of no alternative to sodium azide as the premier chemical charger for air bags. Moreover, he conceded that in every air bag system \u201cthere will always be some amount of sodium hydroxide that will pass through the filter and into the air bag,\u201d because no filter could trap all the particles.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993), the Court of Appeals affirmed a summary judgment entered against a plaintiff who proffered the testimony of a qualified expert who could offer no \u201cscientific evidence ... [or] sound data to buttress his opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740, 625 A.2d 1005. In that case, the expert had in essence furnished a \u201cbecause I say so\u201d explanation for his conclusion that a device installed on a motor vehicle was \u201cunsafe.\u201d The <em>Beatty </em>Court rejected that explanation on the ground that \u201c[o]ur cases hold that \u2018an expert\u2019s opinion is of no greater probative value than the soundness of his reasons given therefor will warrant.\u2019 <em>Surkovich v. Doub, </em>258 Md. 263, 272, 265 A.2d 447 (1970), and cases there cited.\u201d <em>Beatty </em>requires that we affirm Judge Hotten\u2019s decision to exclude the opinion at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Cases in other jurisdictions support our holding that Judge Hotten did not abuse her discretion. For instance, in <em>Demar-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>ee v. Toyota Motor Corp., supra, </em>the plaintiff sustained injuries to her wrists and arms when her driver\u2019s side air bag deployed in a motor vehicle collision, and presented expert testimony that the air bag was defective because it should have deployed at 20-25 miles per hour in a \u201cfrontal, fixed barrier collision,\u201d not the way it did deploy. The United States District Court for the District of Kentucky held that the expert\u2019s opinion was based solely on conjecture and speculation and was not grounded in any scientific bases. Although the court applied the Daubert<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> test for admissibility of expert testimony, its analysis is helpful to the case <em>sub judice. </em>The expert in <em>Demaree </em>(1) had not published on the theory he was promulgating, (2) did not personally perform crash tests to support his theory, (3) presented no mathematical calculations, and (4) offered no specific test data on the particular subject presented, thus indicating a lack \u201cof the usual indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 963-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In <em>Britt, supra, </em>the Civil Court of Appeals of Alabama \u2022 affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a plaintiffs expert testimony in an air bag case because the expert did not provide an adequate explanation for the basis of his opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> During his deposition, the expert conceded that he had not (1) been to the scene of the accident, (2) seen the car involved in the accident, (3) known the speed plaintiff was traveling before the crash, (4) known the angle of the impact of the crash, nor (5) known the cause of the plaintiffs injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 180-82. Although the expert submitted a post-deposition affidavit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>contradicted his deposition testimony, the appellate court concluded that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the opinion on the ground that the expert had failed to offer an adequate explanation for his \u201copinion that the air bag system was dangerous and defective.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Likewise, Mr. Leshner\u2019s testimony was properly excluded for lack of an adequate methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-13\">. The appellees in the case are (1) Toyota Motor Corporation (manufacturer), (2) Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.(distributor), (3) Central Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc.(distributor), and (4) Rosenthal Land-over Enterprises, Inc. (dealer). For purposes of this appeal, we refer to appellees jointly as \"Toyota.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">. Although appellant suffered no broken facial bones in the accident, she claimed that, in addition to the chemical burns, she received other injuries to her cheeks, nose, and upper lip.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\">. Mr. Leshner was prepared to express the following opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">I believe that the location of the vent holes and the method of folding the bag made it much more likely that hazardous materials that exit the bag would come into contact with the driver. And, in fact based on the location of the vent holes, and the folding pattern, more likely that it would come into contact with the driver\u2019s face. And based on the folding pattern that there also would be some additional risk of the driver being struck by the bag in concert with getting hazardous chemicals deposited on their face which would aggravate the reaction and the effect of those chemicals. So, based on all the things that we\u2019ve discussed, I think the location of the vent holes, and the method of folding of the bag constitute defects.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-11\">.
