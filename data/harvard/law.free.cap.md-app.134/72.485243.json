On appeal, appellant presents us with the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">1. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury, \u201cIf you find that at the time of testing, the Defendant had .10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood, the Defendant was intoxicated,\u201d where Mr. Meanor was not charged with the offense of driving while intoxicated per se?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">2. Did the trial court err in denying the motion to suppress the results of the breath test?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">On 11 February 1999, appellant and a friend, Charles Dixon, enjoyed numerous alcoholic beverages at the Silver Shadows nightclub in Columbia, Maryland. As they were leaving the club at about 2:30 a.m., it was decided that Dixon would drive because appellant had had \u201ctoo much to drink.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Officer Mui of the Howard County Police Department observed a car being driven erratically on Route 29, and stopped it. Both Officer Mui and Sgt. Christis, who arrived on the scene as Officer Mui\u2019s back-up, noticed an odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Dixon\u2019s breath, and that his speech was slurred. After Dixon had performed rather poorly on several field sobriety tests and had blown into the tube, he was arrested, charged with driving while intoxicated, and taken to the police station. Before leaving the scene, the officers several times warned appellant not to drive, and offered to transport him either to a pay phone or to the police station to call for a ride. In addition, the officers offered to arrange to have the car towed. Appellant insisted on remaining with the car, however, and said that he would use his cellular phone to call for a ride. Although Officer Mui left the scene, Sgt. Christis drove a short distance and pulled off onto the shoulder in order to keep appellant and the car in view. Just as Sgt. Christis expected, in no more than twenty min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>utes, the car pulled onto the traveled portion of Route 29 driven by appellant. Sgt. Christis followed and stopped the car, after observing that it had crossed over the center line. After appellant had gotten out of the car and performed poorly on several field sobriety tests, he was arrested and issued a Maryland Uniform Complaint and Citation form, for violating \u201c21-902 Driving While Intoxicated &amp; Under Influence Alcohol <em>&amp; </em>Under Influence of Drugs and &amp; Drugs &amp; Alcohol &amp; Controlled Dangerous Substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Not only was appellant offered a breathalyzer test, he was read his rights from a \u201cDR-15 Advice of Rights form.\u201d Appellant first refused to take the test, but later changed his mind and took the test. The test result was \u201c[p]oint one three grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">After being convicted by a jury of driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence of alcohol, and failure to obey a traffic control device, appellant was sentenced to a term of ninety days in the county jail for driving while intoxicated, after the remaining charges were merged for sentencing purposes. As we have noted, the term of ninety days was suspended in favor of two years supervised probation with special conditions, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The questions with which we are presented appear to be questions of first impression in Maryland. We have not been directed to, nor have we found a reported Maryland case that involves driving while intoxicated per se, or one that involves the failure of the 1994 DR-15 Advice of Rights form to mention the Ignition Interlock System Program. Although there have been several cases involving the advice required to be given concerning the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical test for intoxication, prescribed by \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, we are concerned only, in the case at hand, with use of the 1994 DR-15 form. We now turn to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>I. Driving While Intoxicated Per Se</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Appellant first contends that, as he was not charged with driving while intoxicated per se, the trial court erred in instructing the jury, \u201cIf you find that at the time of testing, the defendant had .10% or more by weight of alcohol in the blood, the defendant was intoxicated.\u201d We do not agree. Before beginning our discussion, we shall first review the offenses with which appellant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">As we have, noted, appellant was charged with having violated \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In filling out the Maryland Uniform Complaint and Citation form, Sgt. Christis circled violation number 33, which read, \u201c \u00a7 21-902 Driving While Intoxicated <em>&amp; </em>Under Influence Alcohol <em>&amp; </em>Under Influence of Drugs, &amp; Drugs &amp; Alcohol &amp; Controlled Dangerous Substance.\u201d According to appellant, violation number 33 does not encompass driving while intoxicated per se. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Section 21-902 of the Transportation Article is titled \u201cDriving while intoxicated, while intoxicated per se, under the influence of alcohol, or under the influence of a drug, a combination of alcohol and a drug, or a controlled dangerous substance,\u201d and includes the following four subsections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">(a) <em>Driving while intoxicated or intoxicated per se. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">(2) A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while the person is intoxicated per se.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">(b) <em>Driving while under the influence of alcohol. </em>\u2014 A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">(c) <em>Driving while under influence of drugs or drugs and alcohol. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not drive or attempt to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>any vehicle while he is so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that he cannot drive a vehicle safely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">(d) <em>Driving while under influence of controlled dangerous substance. </em>\u2014 A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while he is under the influence of any controlled dangerous substance, as that term is defined in article 27, \u00a7 279 of the Code, if the person is not entitled to use the controlled dangerous substance under the laws of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">According to appellant, although the citation he was issued charged him with violating \u00a7\u00a7 21-902(a)(l), (b), (c) and (d), he was not charged with violating \u00a7 21-902(a)(2). Appellant insists that driving or attempting to drive any vehicle while the person is intoxicated per se constitutes a separate offense from driving while intoxicated, and must be written on the citation in the section titled: \u201cVIOLATION NOT LISTED ABOVE CHARGE.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, however, \u201cthe definition of \u2018intoxicated per se\u2019 sets forth an evidentiary standard and does not create a crime distinct from driving while intoxicated; it is the same crime proven by a scientific test of evidence.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 21-902(a)(2) demonstrates that what once was \u201cprima facie evidence of intoxication,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is now legally intoxicated. Prior to October 1995, \u00a7 21-902(a) provided <em>\u201cDriving while intoxicated. </em>\u2014 A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while intoxicated.\u201d Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 10-807 also provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(e) <em>Prima facie evidence of intoxication. </em>\u2014 If at the time of testing a person has an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, as determined by an analysis of the person\u2019s blood or breath, it shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant was driving while intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>In October of 1995, subsection (e) of \u00a7 10-307 was repealed, and \u00a7 21-902(a) was amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">(a)(1) A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">(2) A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while the person has an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more as measured by grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as determined at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 498. During the following term, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 21-902(a)(2) to read, as it now reads, \u201c(2) A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while the person is intoxicated per se,\u201d and enacted \u00a7 11-127.1 which defines intoxicated per se as \u201chaving an alcohol concentration at the time of testing of 0.10 or more as measured by grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\u201d 1996 Md. Laws, Chap. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">This 1996 amendment substituted \u201cis driving while intoxicated per se\u201d for \u201chas an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more as measured by grams of alcohol per 100 millimeters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as determined at the time of testing.\u201d 1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 652. Thus, the General Assembly chose to add the language, \u201cA person may not drive or attempt to drive while the person is intoxicated per se\u201d to \u00a7 21-902(a) to define a person who was driving a vehicle while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The terms \u201cdriving while intoxicated and intoxicated per se\u201d are treated consistently throughout the Transportation Article. For example, \u00a7 27-101 provides that \u201cIt is a misdemean- or to violate any of the provisions of the Maryland Vehicle Law ...\u201d and refers only to \u00a7 21-902(a),(b),(c), and (d). Section 27-101(k) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">(k) <em>Violation of \u00a7 21-902(a). </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in subsection (q) of this section, any person who is convicted of a violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7 21-902(a) of this article (\u201cDriving while intoxicated or intoxicated per se\u201d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>(i) For a first offense, shall be subject to a f\u00edne of not more than $1,000, or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">(2) For the purpose of second or subsequent offender penalties for violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) of this article provided under this subsection, a prior conviction of \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(b), (c), or (d) of this article, within 5 years of the conviction for a violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) of this article, shall be considered a conviction of \u00a7 21-902(a) of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We emphasize that \u00a7 27-101 refers only to \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 21-902(a) of this article (Driving while intoxicated or intoxicated per se),\u201d then specifically refers to prior convictions of \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(b), (c) or (d) in providing penalties for subsequent convictions of violating \u00a7 21-902(a). Moreover, the penalties for \u201cDriving while intoxicated or intoxicated per se\u201d are precisely the same, further indicating that \u00a7 21-902(a) includes both driving while intoxicated and intoxicated per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We look now to the violations lodged against appellant in order to determine whether those violations include driving while intoxicated per se. On the Uniform Complaint and Citation issued to appellant, he was simply charged with violating \u00a7 21-902. Section 26^405 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\"><em>Lesser included offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 21-901.1 and 21-902 </em>\u2014If a person is charged with a violation of \u00a7 21-901.1 of this article (\u201cReckless and negligent driving\u201d) or \u00a7 21-902 of this article (\u201cDriving while intoxicated, while intoxicated per se, under the influence of alcohol, or under the influence of a drug, a combination of alcohol and a drug, or a controlled dangerous substance\u201d), the court may find him guilty of any lesser included offense under any subsection of the respective section. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Moreover, \u00a7 26-405 permits one charged only with violating \u00a7 21-902 to be convicted of violating one or more of its subsections. As noted, these subsections include: \u201cDriving while intoxicated, while intoxicated per se, under the influence of alcohol, or under the influence of a drug, a combination of alcohol and a drug, or a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Although appellant was simply charged with violating \u00a7 21-902, as trial began, the prosecutor said, \u201cThe State would ask the Court to proceed on \u00a7 21-902(a) and (b).\u201d While the verdict sheet submitted to the jury listed driving while intoxicated and driving while under the influence of alcohol, driving while intoxicated per se was not listed. Accordingly, as appellant was convicted only of driving while intoxicated and driving while under the influence of alcohol, there was no need to refer to \u00a7 21-902(a)\u2019s separate provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Appellant relies on <em>Beckwith v. State, </em>320 Md. 410, 578 A.2d 220 (1990), to persuade us that he was not charged with \u00a7 21-902(a)(2). <em>Beckwith </em>was charged with violating \u00a7 21-902(a), but convicted of \u00a7 21-902(b) and the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">If the police officer had intended to charge the greater offense of driving while intoxicated so as to embrace the lesser offense of driving while under the influence, number 34 would have specifically covered that situation. The police officer, however, did not circle number 34. Instead, number 35, charging only the greater offense driving while intoxicated was circled, as well as underscored. Under these circumstances, a reasonable defendant would conclude that he was being charged with the greater offense and only the greater offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">The charging document expressly and clearly showed how the greater offense of driving while intoxicated was to be charged so that it would include the lesser offense of driving while under the influence. The defendant was not charged in this manner. Instead, the State charged the defendant with driving while intoxicated in a way which clearly appeared to exclude the lesser charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 415, 578 A.2d 220. Hence, Beckwith\u2019s conviction of the lesser charge was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Beckwith </em>is misplaced. As noted, Sgt. Christis circled violation number 33, which includes all of \u00a7 21-902\u2019s lesser included offenses. We do not agree that driving while intoxicated per se was excluded. It was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>necessary for the officer to have specified that charge in the section of the citation entitled \u201cVIOLATION NOT LISTED ABOVE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We note that if appellant had been specifically charged with violating \u00a7 21-902(a)(2), driving while intoxicated per se, the State would have been limited to the \u201call or nothing\u201d approach described in <em>Insley v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 46, 48, 358 A.2d 246, 247 (1976) (By specifically charging a defendant with \u00a7 21-902(a) Driving while intoxicated, the State \u201cforwent the right to drop down to a lesser charge, should its proof fail to result in a conviction of the greater charge.\u201d) The general charge is permitted because it would be impractical to require the arresting officer to make a roadside determination as to whether a suspected drunk driver is intoxicated or under the influence, that is above or below .10 alcohol concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Driving while intoxicated and driving under the influence of alcohol \u201cdiffer only in the grade of proof required to support a conviction,\u201d <em>See Thompson v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 442, 450, 338 A.2d 411 (1975) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>278 Md. 41, 359 A.2d 203 (1976). In enacting \u00a7 21-902(a)(2), the General Assembly provided a method of convicting an accused of driving while intoxicated by a reduced \u201cgrade of proof\u2019. Scientific evidence has been presented that the alcohol concentration in the blood of an accused is 0.10 or more, the State has established that the accused was driving while intoxicated per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In sum, we hold that when an offender has simply been charged with violating \u00a7 21-902, the offender may be convicted of violating \u00a7 21-902(a), (b), (c) or (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as follows: \u201cif you find that at the time of testing, the defendant had a point one zero percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood, the defendant was intoxicated.\u201d As we have just noted, driving while intoxicated per se is a lesser included offense under \u00a7 21-902. The meaning of \u201cintoxicated per se\u201d is \u201chaving an alcohol concentration at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>time of testing of 0.10 or more ...\u201d \u00a7 ll-127.1(a). As the State had presented evidence that appellant\u2019s breath test result revealed .13 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, it was, therefore, proper for the jury to be instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">Now you\u2019ve heard evidence in this case that the Defendant\u2019s breath was tested for the purposes of determining the alcoholic content of the Defendant\u2019s blood. The affect of such results is as follows. If you find that at the time of testing, the Defendant had point one zero percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood, the defendant was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>See </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (MCPJI) 4:10.2. The \u201cNotes on Use\u201d comments following MCPJI Cr 4:10.2 suggest: \u201cUse this instruction if the defendant is charged with ... driving while intoxicated and/or driving under the influence of alcohol under Maryland Transportation Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (1992 &amp; Supp.1996), and the defendant took a blood or breath test.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">II. DR-15 Advice of Rights Form</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Appellant also urges that the trial court should have suppressed his breath test results because he was not properly advised of his rights from the form DR-15 used by the arresting officer. Form DR-15 was developed by the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) for use in giving a driver charged with driving while intoxicated and/or under the influence of alcohol the rights to which he or she is entitled concerning the possible suspension of his or her driver\u2019s license for refusal to take a breath test as provided for in \u00a7 16-205.1(b) of the Transportation Article. Section 16-205.1(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">(b)(2) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, if a police officer stops or detains any person who the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while intoxicated ... the police officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">(i) Detain the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">(ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">(iii) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test, including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) or (2) of this section, and for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Subsection (n) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">Modification of suspension. \u2014 (1) The Administration may modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">(i) The licensee did not refuse to take a test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">(ii) The licensee has not had a license suspended under this section during the past 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">(iii) The licensee has not been convicted under \u00a7 21-902 of this article during the past five years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">(iv) 1. The licensee is required to drive a motor vehicle in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">2. The license is required for the purpose of attending an alcoholic prevention or treatment program; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">3. It finds that the licensee has no alternative means of transportation available to or from the licensee\u2019s place of employment and, without the license, the licensee\u2019s ability to earn a living would be severely impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-16\">(2) In addition to the authority to modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license under paragraph (1) or (4) of this subsection, the Administration may modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license, including a restriction that prohibits the licensee from driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle unless the licensee is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>participant in the Ignition Interlock System Program established under \u00a7 16-404.1 of this title, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">(i) The licensee did not refuse to take a test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">(ii) The licensee has not been convicted under \u00a7 21-902 of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">(iii) The license is required for the purpose of attending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">1. A noncollegiate educational institution ... or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">2. A regular program at an institution of postsecondary education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">(3) If the licensee refused to take a test, the Administration may not modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license except as provided under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">(4) In addition to the authority to modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, the Administration may modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license to a licensee who participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program ... for at least 1 year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">In the instant case, Sgt. Christis read the following to appellant from the 1994 DR-15 form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-13\">You have the right to refuse to submit to the test. Your refusal shall result in an administrative suspension of your Maryland driver\u2019s license or your driving privilege if you are a non-resident. The suspension by the Motor Vehicle Administration shall be 120 days for a first offense and one year for a second or subsequent offense. <em>If you refuse to submit to the test, you will be ineligible for a modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive- license. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">Appellant believes this to be both inadequate and inaccurate, because \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(iii) requires that an accused be advised that, even if the test is refused, MVA may modify suspension of the driver\u2019s license or issue a restrictive license if the offender agrees to a one year participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program. In other words, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>lant believes the Form DR-15 used by the arresting officer should have included an explanation of \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(4). In addition, appellant believes \u00a7 16-205(n)(4) renders inaccurate the final emphasized sentence on Form DR-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">After closely reviewing \u00a7 16-205.1 together with the Form DR-15 used by the arresting officer, we conclude that the provisions of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)(iii) were satisfied. Section 16-205.1 requires appellant to be advised of \u201cadministrative sanctions\u201d for refusing the test. It does not require the inclusion of subsection (n)(4). It requires only the inclusion of (n)(l) and (2). Since the latter subsections describe options unavailable to one who refuses the breath test, the DR-15 form includes such \u201csanctions.\u201d As the State correctly points out, the \u201cmere possibility that an offender might qualify to participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program\u201d is a privilege or a bonus, not a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Our conclusion is supported by \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s legislative history, as well as the cases that interpreted \u00a7 16-205.1 prior to being amended in 1993 and 1998. Prior to being amended in 1993, \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)(iii) required an arresting officer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test and for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In 1993, \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)(iii) was amended to require that an arresting officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test, <em>including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license, </em>and for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 407. This amendment was in response to <em>Hare v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>326 Md. 296, 604 A.2d 914 (1992), and <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. 306, 604 A.2d 919 (1992), in which the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>considered the advice intended by the legislature to be given a driver by an arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In <em>Hare, </em>the appellant insisted that he was required to be advised by the arresting officer that if he refused to take the test, he would not be entitled to modification of suspension of his license or to a restrictive license. 326 Md. at 300, 604 A.2d 914. The Court concluded that \u201c[a] driver need not be told of every conceivable incentive for taking a chemical test[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 604 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In <em>Chamberlain, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">Aside from \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(1), the critical provisions of the statute refer to \u201cadministrative sanctions that shall be imposed;\u201d it is only those of which a driver is required to be informed. Mere potential eligibility for modification of suspension or for a restrictive license is not an \u201cadministrative sanction that shall be imposed.\u201d Eligibility for modification of suspension or for a restrictive license becomes reality only if the driver meets the statutory prerequisites, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16-205.1(m) [now subsection n] and, then, only if the ALJ, in the exercise of discretion, finds modification of suspension or issuance of a restrictive license appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">326 Md. at 318, 604 A.2d 919. As the General Assembly chose not to agree, an arresting officer is now required to inform an accused that the refusal to submit to the test will affect the driver\u2019s eligibility for a modification of suspension or a restrictive license.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">When Chapter 526 of the Acts of 1998 was enacted to expand the use of the Ignition Interlock System Program, \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(iii) was amended to its current language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">Advise the person of the administrative sanction that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test, including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license <em>under subsection (n)(l) or (2) of this section, </em>and for test results ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>This amendment arose from changes to subsection (n) concerning the Ignition Interlock System Program. The following emphasized language has been added to subsection (n):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">(2) In addition to the authority to modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license under paragraph (1) or (4) of this subsection, the Administration may modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license, including a restriction that prohibits the licensee from driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle unless the licensee is a participant in the Ignition Interlock System Program established under \u00a7 16-404.1 of this title, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(3) If the licensee refused to take a test, the Administration may not modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license except as provided under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">(4) In addition to the authority to modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, the Administration may modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license to a licensee who participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program established under \u00a7 16-404.1 of this title for at least 1 year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The MVA now has authority to modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license to a driver who has submitted to the test under subsection (n)(l), (2) or (4) and to a driver who has refused the test only under subsection (n)(4). In other words, a driver whose license is suspended pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1 is eligible for the Ignition Interlock System Program, even if the test is refused. Nevertheless, participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program depends on whether an Administrative Law Judge determines that the offender\u2019s participation is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">As we see it, \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(iii)\u2019s amendment did not affect the Form DR-15 advice. An accused must still be advised by an arresting officer of the \u201cadministrative sanctions\u201d for refusing to submit to the test, and not of the full panoply of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>possibilities left to the' discretion of the MVA. The 1998 amendment to \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)(iil) was the result of an amendment to subsection (n). An arresting officer is not required to explain an offender\u2019s eligibility for the Ignition Interlock System Program. If that had been the intent of the legislature, \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)(iii) would refer to entire subsection (n), rather than to just two of its portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We now turn to appellant\u2019s assertion that he was not given accurate advice from the Form DR-15 used by the arresting officer. We agree that \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(4) renders inaccurate the following language: \u201cIf you refuse to submit to the test, you will be ineligible for a modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but we do not agree that it requires suppression of the results of the breath test administered to appellant. Under these circumstances, appellant suffered no prejudice, nor does appellant claim that this inaccurate information in any way interfered with his decision to take the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">After having been given Form DR-15 advice, appellant first refused to take the breath test, then changed his mind and took it. The administrative sanctions that apply to an offender who refuses to take the breath test apply no longer when the offender decides to take the test. Since the Interlock Ignition System Program is now available to an accused whether or not the test is taken, appellant suffered no prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-13\">.
