Appellant\u2019s mark, \u201cP P P G,\u201d ivas registered September 25th, 1883, No. f0,!5,99.: ,. The-,appellee registered its mark, \u201cP P P,\u201d March-23d,-. 1886, No. 13,128. . It now seeks registration under the act of 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">The' Examiner \u2022 of Interferences found that \u201cthe testimony establishes, in a fairly satisfactory manner, that the predecessor of each party was using its mark during at least a portion of the year 1855, and that such use has been continued to date . without loss by either party, or its predecessor, of the right of use, if such right ever obtained.\u201d The Examiner found, however, that neither party was able satisfactorily to establish its prior right of use, and hence \u201cthat neither should have the right to exclude the other.\u201d The Commissioner, after a careful review of applicant\u2019s evidence relating to adoption and use-of its mark prior to 1855, the earliest date to which appellant is entitled, held that \u201cthe William Lea &amp; Sons Company adopt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ed and used its mark \u2018F F F\u2019 prior to any date of adoption and use which, can be accorded to H. C. Cole &amp; Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Preston Lea, whose father was a member of the firm of T'atnall -&amp; Lea, originators of appellee\u2019s mark, first became connected with that firm as a clerk in 1858. He produced old account books which he testified were used in the business of Tatnall <em>&amp; </em>Lea and other predecessors of appellee. The entries in the first book he was unable to identify, since they were made prior to his connection with the firm. The entries in the other books, however, he was able to identify. In the oldest book are entries under date of Jan. 31st, 1853, showing shipments of about 2,000 barrels \u201c3 F Flour.\u201d The other books contained similar entries, but need not be considered here. The entries in this old book were properly received in evidence. The book was more than thirty years old, was found in proper custody, and was free from all grounds of suspicion. It therefore proved itself. <em>Applegate </em>v. <em>Lexington &amp; C. County Min. Co. </em>117 U. S. 255, 29 L. ed. 892, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742; <em>Hamerschlag </em>v. <em>Duryea, </em>172 N. Y. 622, 65 N. E. 1117; <em>Bullon </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>2 Price, 399; <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Tyrwhitt, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 376. In the circumstances of this case, such entries are to be considered a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>rather than as a mere x\u00e9citation of past events. Such is the force of the cases cited. \u2018 ' \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Frank Cloud, a retired miller, seventy-eight years old, and an entirely disinterested witness, testified that the firm of Tatnall &amp; Lea, for whom he then worked, used the trademark \u201cF F F\u201d upon flour in 1852 and thereafter, and that he had done much branding himself. The witness was asked what caused him to remember the date 1852, and replied: \u201cThe year that I got the situation at Stanton mills the mills were under repair, and that is the time the brand whs started; I cannot remember the month.\u201d The entries in the old book, sirpplemented by the testimony of this witness, we think fully justified the conclusion reached by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We have eliminated from our consideration the testimony elicited by leading questions, the record showing that timely objection was noted. <em>American Stove Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit Stove </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Works, </em>31 App. D.
