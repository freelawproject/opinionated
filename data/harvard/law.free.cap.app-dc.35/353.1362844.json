C. 268, is authority for such registry. That decision seems to us to support the ruling of the Commissioner in refusing registry in this case. \u201cBlack Caps\u201d are words which are understood in the trade to be equivalent to \u201cBlack Capsules,\u201d and they are held in said case to be descriptive of the goods, and counsel does not now ask for registration of said words as a technical trademark, but only as one entitled to registry under the ten-year clause, claiming the .same to have been used exclusively by the applicant and its predecessors, for the statutory period of ten years before the passage of the trademark act.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">That question, we think, cannot now be raised by the applicant. Registration was refused to the Canton Pharmacy Company, under whom the applicant claims title, in the interference between Planten and said Company, No. 27,610 Trademark Interferences, on all grounds, and from the decision of the Commissioner in that case, the said Company took no ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>peal. Planten alone appealed, and this court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We think there is no answer to the argument of counsel for \u25a0 the Commissioner in this case, that the decision of the Commissioner in said cause No. 27,610, is <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">To allow the assignee of said Canton Pharmacy Company to have the right to raise the same questions again that were decided in that case, would make a continuous performance, and there could never be an end of litigation, provided new assignees might be found willing to receive title and to renew the application in their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The decision of the Commissioner in this case will therefore be <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
