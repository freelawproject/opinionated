King argues that Amendment 706 reduced his base offense level, because he was sentenced under the crack cocaine guidelines, rather than the career offender guideline. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">King pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). The pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) initially set King\u2019s base offense level at 34, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because King\u2019s offense involved the equivalent of at least 3,000 kilograms, but less than 10,000 kilograms, of marijuana. However, the PSI also indicated that King qualified as a career'offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. His total offense level after applying the career offender enhancement was also 34. King received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a), resulting in a total offense level of 31. King had 11 criminal history points, which would have placed him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>criminal history category V. However, because King was a career offender, his criminal history category was enhanced to VI. King\u2019s offense level of 31 combined with criminal history category VI to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months. King filed objections to the PSI arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that he should not be considered a career offender. At the sentencing hearing, King again argued that he should not be considered a career offender, but the court overruled his objection. The court adopted the guideline applications set forth in the PSI, and determined that King was subject to a total offense level of 31, criminal history category VI, and a guideline imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months. The court sentenced King to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 48 months\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In March 2009, the district <em>sua sponte </em>appointed counsel to represent King and ordered the government and King to address whether King was entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The government responded that King was not entitled to a reduction, because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and, therefore, Amendment 706 had no bearing on his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">King responded that he was entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706, because he was sentenced based on the crack cocaine guidelines, and not as a career offender. He asserted that section 4Bl.l(b) provides that the career offender enhancement applies only if the enhanced offense level is greater than the offense level that is otherwise applicable. King contended that, in his case, the career offender offense level was equal to his otherwise applicable guideline range, because his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 was also 34. Thus, King asserted that his base offense level should be reduced to 34, because he was sentenced based on a guideline range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Alternatively, King argued that he was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction even if he was sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The district court agreed with the government\u2019s position, incorporated the government\u2019s response by reference, and refused to reduce King\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">As an initial matter, King was, in fact, sentenced as a career offender. The PSI determined that King qualified as a career offender, and it enhanced his criminal history category to VI based on application of the career offender guideline. At the sentencing hearing, the district court specifically overruled King\u2019s objection to the application of the career offender guideline, adopted the PSI\u2019s guideline calculations, and determined that King\u2019s guideline sentencing range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on his offense level of 31 and his enhanced criminal history category of VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Because King was sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1 and Amendment 706 only affects base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, the amendment does not reduce King\u2019s sentencing range, and he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d). Furthermore, King cannot challenge, in this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court\u2019s original sentencing determination that he qualified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>a career offender. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that, in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d) (emphasis in original). Finally, even if King\u2019s original sentence had been based on \u00a7 2D1.1 and Amendment 706 had reduced that base offense level to 32, his guideline range would not change, because he would face an offense level of 34 under the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B) (providing that offense level 34 applies to career offenders who face a statutory maximum sentence of 25 years or more, if level 34 \u201cis greater than the offense level otherwise applicable\u201d). Accordingly, Amendment 706 did not reduce King\u2019s guideline sentencing range and we affirm his 188-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
