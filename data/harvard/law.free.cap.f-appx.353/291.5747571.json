On appeal, Ford argues that she qualified for a sentence reduction but the district court denied her request without explanation. She asserts that she was entitled to a sentence reduction under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). She also argues that the district court sentenced her incorrectly because she was coerced into pleading guilty, and the amount of drugs attributed to her was incorrect. She further asserts that her due process rights were violated because there was no evidence to prove her guilt, and the drug amount was not properly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced \u201cto a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not err in denying Ford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Ford\u2019s sentence was ultimately based on the statutory mandatory minimum rather than the amount of crack cocaine attributed to her, Amendment 706 did not lower the guideline range that determined her sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)) (prohibiting a reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\u201d)); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant a sentence reduction to the defendant because Amendment 706 had no effect on his statutory minimum term of imprisonment, which had become his guideline range). The downward departures that Ford received pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), do not affect this analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 1340-41 (holding that a downward departure, pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, does not waive a statutory mandatory minimum sentence and, thereby, entitle a defendant to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706). Furthermore, our decision in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), where we held that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>do not affect the limitations in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 on a judge\u2019s discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding forecloses Ford\u2019s <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>arguments. Additionally, the district court did not err by holding that it could not consider Ford\u2019s arguments concerning the drug amount and the voluntariness of her plea because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only permitted the court to determine whether Amendment 706 lowered Ford\u2019s guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Ford\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
