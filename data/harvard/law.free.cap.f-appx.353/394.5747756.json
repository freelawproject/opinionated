Specifically, Sullivan contends (1) the ALJ did not have good cause to give more weight to limitations noted by a consulting physician, Dr. Russell Clifton, than to those noted by a treating physician, Dr. Emily Hoon, and (2) the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert (VE) regarding Sullivan\u2019s mental limitations failed to include all significant limitations set forth in Dr. Clifton\u2019s assessment. We address each issue in turn and affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Sullivan contends the ALJ erred by discounting the medical opinion of one of his treating physicians, Dr. Hoon, because good cause did not exist to reject the opinion and because both doctors concluded Sullivan suffered from severe mental health limitations. The ALJ may reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 884, 885 (11th Cir.1985). Absent the existence of \u201cgood cause\u201d to the contrary, however, the ALJ must give substantial weight to the opinion, diagnosis, and medical evidence of a treating physician. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d). \u201c \u2018[Gjood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was con-clusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">If the ALJ disregards the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate his reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. We have found no reversible error \u201c[w]here our limited review precludes reweighing the evidence anew, and [where] the ALJ articulated specific reasons for failing to give [the treating physician\u2019s] opinion controlling weight\u201d and these findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005). When the ALJ does not give the treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight, the ALJ applies other factors such as the length of treatment, the frequency of examination, the nature and extent of the relationship, the supportability of the opinion, its consistency with other evidence, and the specialization of the physician. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(2)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Substantial evidence in the record supports the conclusion the ALJ discounted Dr. Hoon\u2019s opinion for good cause because the ALJ found Dr. Hoon\u2019s opinion was not persuasive and was contradicted by the opinions of other physicians. Specifically, the ALJ gave Dr. Hoon\u2019s assessment \u201clittle evidentiary weight\u201d for four major reasons: (1) she was \u201cclearly sympathetic\u201d to Sullivan; (2) she did not \u201cdoc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ument objective mental status findings\u201d; (3) her diagnosis that Sullivan suffered from chronic depression and PTSD was contradicted by the findings of three other doctors; and (4) she only treated Sullivan a few times in the span of six years. Because her opinion was unsupported by objective medical evidence and the record as a whole, the ALJ properly discounted Dr. Hoon\u2019s opinion regarding Sullivan\u2019s medical conditions. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Sullivan contends the hypothetical posed to the VE was improper because it failed to include all significant limitations set forth in Dr. Clifton\u2019s assessment. When a claimant cannot perform a full range of work at a given level of exertion or has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills, the ALJ can determine whether a claimant can perform other jobs through the testimony of a VE. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240. For a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>See Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1220 (11th Cir.2001) (reversing and remanding because the ALJ did not give proper weight to the opinions of the petitioner\u2019s physicians and did not pose thorough hypothetical questions to the VE). However, the ALJ is not required to include findings in the hypothetical the ALJ properly rejects. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1160-61 (holding the ALJ properly gave less weight to a physician who had only examined the petitioner once).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Substantial evidence supports the mental limitations included in the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the VE. The ALJ explained in the decision he gave \u201climited evidentiary weight\u201d to Dr. Clifton\u2019s description of Sullivan\u2019s ability to make occupational adjustments as \u201cPoor\u201d in five areas because the assessment was unsupported by Dr. Clifton\u2019s own narrative and clinical exam findings, and also by Sullivan\u2019s statements during the hearing. Accordingly, the ALJ converted Dr. Clifton\u2019s five \u201cPoor\u201d mental limitations to \u201cFair\u201d in the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the VE. Even though Dr. Clifton was a consulting physician whose medical opinion the ALJ should normally give great weight, the ALJ in this instance was not required to include findings in the hypothetical question he had properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Because the ALJ did not err in (1) discounting Dr. Hoon\u2019s opinion for good cause and (2) according \u201climited evidentiary weight\u201d to Dr. Clifton\u2019s five \u201cPoor\u201d mental limitations, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s final finding Sullivan was not disabled for purposes of SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">. Sullivan has abandoned his DIB claim by failing to challenge it on appeal. <em>Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">. When \"the ALJ denies benefits and the [Appeals Council] denies review, we review the ALJ's decision as the Commissioner's final decision.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the Commissioner's factual findings with deference, and the \"factual findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence, consisting of such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). However, we review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
