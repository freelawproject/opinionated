Gonzalez-Molina contends that the district court committed plain error by applying a 16-level increase to his offense level based on its finding that his 2000 Pennsylvania conviction for aggravated assault was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The Government concedes that neither the law nor the record establishes that Gonzalez-Molina\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence for purposes of the enhancement and that it was plain error to increase Gonzalez-Molina\u2019s sentence based on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">After reviewing the record and the applicable law, we agree that the district court committed plain error by using Gonzalez-Molina\u2019s Pennsylvania aggravated-assault conviction to increase his sentence. See <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 327-29 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we vacate Gonzalez-Molina\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing. <em>See Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
