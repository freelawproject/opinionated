Bronnenberg argues that his within-guidelines sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He does not suggest that the computation of the applicable guidelines was error, but he contends that the sentencing court plainly erred by failing to provide specific reasons for rejecting his argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, the sentencing guideline for child pornography, is not empirically based; the court gave improper weight to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; and his sentence is substantively unreasonable because \u00a7 2G2.2 is entitled to little or no deference and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors do not warrant a 78-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-21\">A within-guidelines sentence is accorded a presumption of reasonableness regardless whether the guidelines provision upon which it is based is empirically grounded. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). By imposing a sentence within the applicable sentencing guidelines, the district court implicitly rejected Bronnenberg\u2019s challenge to the validity of \u00a7 2G2.2. Bronnenberg has not shown that the district court plainly erred by failing to address this argument specifically. <em>See Mondragcm-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365-67. The district court\u2019s extensive sentencing reasons show that the court imposed a reasonable sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>569 F.3d 523, 528 (5th Cir.2009). The fact that Bronnenberg\u2019s within-guideline sentence is based on a sentencing guideline that is not supported by empirical data does not render it unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Lemus-Gonzalez, </em>563 F.3d 88, 94-95 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied sub nom Gonzalez-Fernando v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 132, 175 L.Ed.2d 86 (2009). Accordingly, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
