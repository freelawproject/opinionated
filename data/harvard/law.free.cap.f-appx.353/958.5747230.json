Olivo argues that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him as an armed career criminal because one of the convictions used to enhance his sentence, a 1992 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation, is not a violent felony within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(1). He also argues that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995); however, he properly concedes that this issue is foreclosed by this circuit\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">In response to Olivo\u2019s challenge to the propriety of his enhanced sentence, the Government has supplemented the record with a written stipulation of testimony entered by Olivo in connection with his guilty plea to the 1992 burglary charge. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 353, 172 L.Ed.2d 138 (2008). Olivo\u2019s stipulation makes it clear that his prior offense was a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585-87 (5th Cir.2008); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), (3) (Vernon 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
