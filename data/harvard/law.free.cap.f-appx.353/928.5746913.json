Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-18\">Li is a Chinese citizen who overstayed her visa. Faced with deportation, she applied for asylum. The immigration judge denied her application for asylum, and she appealed to the BIA. On February 7, 2008, the BIA affirmed the decision. Having missed the thirty-day deadline to appeal, Li moved for reopening to have the BIA reissue its opinion with a new date on September 5. The BIA denied that motion on November 14, and Li appealed to this court on December 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-19\">Li first asks us to reverse the BIA\u2019s February 7 asylum denial. Because more than thirty days passed between the BIA\u2019s asylum decision and her December 10 appeal, we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 406, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-20\">We can, however, consider Li\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen her case. The BIA can reissue an opinion with a new date to allow an immigrant the opportunity to appeal. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 136 (5th Cir.2004). The question here is under what circumstances it must. We can overturn the BIA\u2019s decision not to reissue a decision only when it abuses its discretion. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Li argues the BIA should have reissued the opinion with a new date to allow her to appeal because she never received the opinion. She points to two possible causes: the BIA and her attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Li first contends that the BIA erred by-sending its opinion to her lawyer\u2019s old address in Monterey Park, California, instead of the lawyer\u2019s address in San Gabriel, California. After the BIA decides a case, it must serve the decision upon the alien. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.13(f). When an alien has an attorney, the BIA can send the decision to the alien\u2019s attorney. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1292.5(a). The BIA serves a decision upon an alien by \u201cmailing a document to the appropriate party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.13. Whether Li\u2019s attorney received the decision is only relevant insofar as it is circumstantial evidence that the BIA never sent the opinion. <em>See Jahjaga v. Att'y Gen. of the U.S., </em>512 F.3d 80, 84-85 (3d Cir.2008) (considering nonreceipt only as evidence that the BIA failed to send its decision); <em>Gaberov v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 590, 594-95 (7th Cir.2008) (same); <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>502 F.3d 73, 76-77 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam) (\u201cOnce the BIA has performed its duty of serving the order, the time for appeal and motions to reopen begins to run, even if the order miscarries in the mail or the alien does not receive it for some other reason that is not the BIA\u2019s fault.\u201d); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cIf the decision was properly mailed, then the BIA fulfilled its statutory duty of service.\u201d); <em>Radkov v. Ashcroft, </em>375 F.3d 96, 99 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201cEven if, as the petitioners contend, the mailing in this case somehow went awry without any fault on the part of the BIA, that circumstance alone would not excuse the failure to file a timeous motion to reopen.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">In this case, whether Li\u2019s attorney received the decision is irrelevant. She acknowledges that the BIA sent it and only objects to the address. Although her attorney received earlier correspondence at the San Gabriel address, the attorney later listed the Monterey Park address on her appearance of counsel form for the BIA appeal. The Monterey Park address was the last address provided to the BIA. By sending the decision to the Monterey Park address, the BIA fulfilled its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Li next argues that if it was not the BIA\u2019s fault, it was her attorney\u2019s fault for listing an old address. That mistake, she argues, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Because Li did not ask the BIA to use its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen based on ineffective assistance, we cannot consider the claim. <em>Wang, </em>260 F.3d at 452-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Finding no <em>error, we </em>hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reissue its decision. Li\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-21\">. Li's brief may also be read to question whether the BIA ever sent the decision, although it is unclear on this point. If that is a third argument, she cannot make it to us for the first time. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001) (\"An alien fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA \u2014 either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.'')
