On appeal, Gastelum argues that the government breached the plea agreement by arguing in favor of a two-level increase for money laundering under \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(B). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">Whether the government breached a plea agreement is a legal question that we review <em>de novo. United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1668, 173 L.Ed.2d 1035 (2009). However, if the defendant did not raise the issue before the district court, we apply a plain error standard of review. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Gaste-lum did not object to the government\u2019s conduct during the sentencing hearing. Under plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Romano, </em>314 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant has the burden of persuasion as to prejudice. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-22\">We use an objective standard in interpreting plea agreements. <em>In re Arnett, 804 F.2d 1200, 1202 (11th </em>Cir.1986). We will not accept any \u201chyper-technical\u201d or \u201crigidly literal\u201d interpretations of a plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1203. The government must carry out the promises that it makes in the agreement. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-23\">In the plea agreement, Gastelum and the government agreed that the government would dismiss the other counts, and the government would recommend an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. With regard to sentencing recommendations, the parties agreed that: (1) the applicable offense guideline was \u00a7 2D1.1; (2) the criminal activity undertaken by Gaste-lum and others, acting in concert, foresee-ably involved 9,007 kilograms of marijua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>na; (3) because a dangerous weapon was involved, a two-level enhancement would apply pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1); and (4) a two-level enhancement based upon Gaste-lum\u2019s participation in the conspiracy would apply pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1. The plea agreement also contained a clause which provided that \u201c[t]here are no other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings between the Defendant and the Government.\u201d However, the plea agreement contained no language which prohibited the government from arguing that the enhancement found in \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(B) for the money laundering conviction should apply. Because the government\u2019s conduct at the sentencing hearing was consistent with its obligations under the plea agreement, the government did not breach the plea agreement and there is no error, much less plain error. <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\">.
