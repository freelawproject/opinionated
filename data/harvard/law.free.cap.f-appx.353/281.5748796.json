After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AsD\">A. State Criminal Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">In October 2001, Bell was charged in Florida state court with (1) burglary of a dwelling while armed; (2) aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; (3) sexual battery; (4) first-degree arson; and (5) violation of an injunction. The first-degree arson count stated that Bell \u201cdid willfully and unlawfully ... by fire or explosion, damage or cause to be damaged a dwelling ... or its contents, located at or in the vicinity of 4092 Jackson Community Road.\u201d The evidence produced at trial follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Petitioner Bell and his wife, Sara Car-line Bell, owned a home at 4092 Jackson Community Road. After they separated, Bell moved out of the house. On June 6, 2001 Sara Bell obtained a preliminary injunction prohibiting contact by Bell. The next day, June 7, 2001, Bell appeared at the home with a knife and forced Sara Bell to perform sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Shortly thereafter, Bell\u2019s sister, Johnny Mae Peterson, arrived at the house. Sara Bell told her that Bell had a knife. Peterson helped Sara Bell take her four children out of the house and drove them to Sara Bell\u2019s mother\u2019s house, where Sara Bell called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Sgt. Michael Ray Qualls responded to the call. When he and Sara Bell returned to the house, they saw smoke coming out. Sgt. Qualls called the fire department. While the fire was being put out, Bell arrived. Sgt. Qualls took him into custody. Bell told Sgt. Qualls that he did not know anything about the fire, but that he had been at the house earlier and had consensual sex with Sara Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">After the fire was out, Sara Bell entered the house to recover clothes for herself and her children. Sara Bell found that clothes from her closet had been piled in the middle of the floor and set on fire. The fire damaged much of her furniture. A fire investigator later testified that the fire was intentionally set in four areas of the house, including the living room couch, the mattress of a bunk bed in one bedroom, the foot of the bed in another bedroom and the mattress and a pile of clothing in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">Ten days after the fire, Bell called Sara Bell twice. During these telephone calls, which were recorded by law enforcement, Bell apologized to his wife. His wife asked him why he \u201cburned the house.\u201d Bell responded, \u201c[bjecause I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Bell also said he would help her rebuild if she dropped some of the charges against him. The government introduced the telephone recordings and photographs of the fire-damaged house.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">After the government rested, the state trial court granted Bell\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the burglary count, but denied his motion as to the remaining counts. Bell rested without introducing any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">During the charge conference, Bell\u2019s counsel requested jury instructions on the lesser-ineluded offenses for sexual battery and aggravated assault counts. As to the first degree arson count, Bell\u2019s counsel stated that the lesser-ineluded offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>were \u201carson of a structure; attempt; criminal mischief,\u201d but advised the court that he was not requesting an instruction on any of them. During closing arguments on the arson count, Bell\u2019s counsel argued that there was insufficient evidence to show that the fire was intentionally set and suggested the fire may have started due to faulty wiring or by Bell\u2019s children while they were unsupervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The jury convicted Bell of: (1) assault, a lesser-included misdemeanor for the charged offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; (2) battery, a lesser-included misdemeanor for the charged offense of sexual battery; (3) first degree arson, as charged; and (4) violation of an injunction, as charged, also a misdemean- or. The state trial court sentenced Bell to time served on the three misdemeanors and to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment on the first degree arson conviction. On direct appeal, the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed Bell\u2019s arson conviction and sentence. <em>Bell v. State, </em>849 So.2d 298 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">B. Rule 3.850 Evidentiary Hearing in State Court</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Bell filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for post-conviction relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. Bell argued that his trial counsel was ineffective as to the arson conviction by failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of criminal mischief. At the Rule 3.850 evi-dentiary hearing, Bell testified that his trial counsel never consulted him about whether to submit a lesser-included offense jury instruction for the arson charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">However, Bell\u2019s trial counsel, Floyd Griffith, testified that he did not request a jury instruction for the lesser-included offense of criminal mischief because he \u201cfelt that [he] would have a hard time arguing that someone intentionally damaged someone\u2019s property and there wasn\u2019t a fire.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Griffith did not think the facts supported a criminal mischief jury instruction and that such an instruction would not have helped his argument that the fire was accidental. Griffith explained that Bell\u2019s failure to deny starting the fire in the recorded telephone calls \u201cboxed [defense counsel] in\u201d in terms of what counsel could credibly argue to the jury. In light of the trial evidence, Griffith chose to argue that the fire had \u201cnothing at all to do with [Bell] or [was] an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">On cross-examination, trial counsel Griffith explained that \u201cfire fits arson, it doesn\u2019t fit criminal mischief.\u201d Because the state court would instruct the jury that \u201cif the State hasn\u2019t proven the highest crime charged they should consider the next one and on down,\u201d Griffith believed he would have had \u201cto convince the jury that the State had not proven that the dwelling was damaged by fire. Then you look at arson of [a] structure, then you look at criminal mischief.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given the evidence at trial, Griffin did not think a jury logically could have found Bell guilty of criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>After the hearing, the state court denied Bell\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion. The state court found that Bell\u2019s counsel, as a matter of trial strategy, chose not to request a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense for the arson charge because he felt the testimony the jury had heard would make it extremely difficult for counsel to argue the applicability of the lesser offenses without losing credibility with the jurors. The state court found that Bell\u2019s counsel had not requested a criminal mischief instruction \u201cbecause one of the elements would require that he prove the property damaged belonged to another, and the evidence obviously showed the dwelling belonged to the defendant. Instead the trial attorney chose to defend based on a theory that the cause of the fire was attributable to someone or something other than the defendant\u2019s intentional act.\u201d The state court noted that Bell\u2019s counsel\u2019s success in obtaining lesser-included offense convictions on the aggravated assault and sexual battery charges hinged on convincing the jury to question Sara Bell\u2019s credibility and that \u201c[n]o such avenue was available to trial counsel on the arson charge.\u201d The state court concluded that Bell\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was without merit because \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s decision to not seek lesser included instructions was proper given the facts adduced at trial.\u201d The Florida District Court of Appeal summarily affirmed the denial of Bell\u2019s ineffective trial counsel claim. <em>Bell v. State, </em>941 So.2d 1263 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">C. Section 2254 Petition in Federal Court</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition, Bell again argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a criminal mischief jury instruction. The magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending denial of Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The R &amp; R concluded that the state court\u2019s ruling as to Bell\u2019s ineffective trial counsel claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The R &amp; R agreed with Bell\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s assessment that a criminal mischief instruction would have been inconsistent with the theory that the fire was accidental. The R &amp; R also concluded that Bell had not shown a reasonable probability that the jury would have come to a different result on the arson count had the criminal mischief instruction been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The district court adopted the R &amp; R and denied Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. This Court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201c[wjhether the district court erred [in] concluding that Bell\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to request jury instructions on lesser-included offenses to first degree arson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) forbids a federal court from granting habeas relief on claims that were previously decided in state court, unless the state court decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>When a convicted defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s assistance was constitutionally ineffective, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cFor performance to be deficient, it must be established that, in light of all the circumstances, counsel\u2019s performance was outside the wide range of professional competence.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1243 (11th Cir.2001). Courts must be highly deferential in reviewing counsel\u2019s performance, and must apply the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). Under the prejudice prong, the defendant must show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Our standard of review is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when \u201ca <em>Strickland </em>claim [is] evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard____\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). \u201cThe question is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination under the <em>Strickland </em>standard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable \u2014 a substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Under Florida law, a person is guilty of first-degree arson if he \u201cwillfully and unlawfully ... by fire or explosion, damages or causes to be damaged ... any dwelling, whether occupied or not, or its contents.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 806.01(l)(a). A person is guilty of criminal mischief when he \u201cwillfully and maliciously injures or damages by any means any real or personal property belonging to another.\u201d Fla Stat. \u00a7 806.13(l)(a). It is undisputed that criminal mischief may be a lesser-included offense of first degree arson in certain circumstances. <em>See Moore v. State, </em>932 So.2d 524, 528 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">However, the state court applied Florida law, which divides lesser-included offenses in two categories: category 1 and category 2. <em>Id. </em>at 527. The state trial court must instruct the jury on all category 1 lesser-included offenses. <em>See Hayes v. State, </em>564 So.2d 161, 163 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990). The other felonies with which Bell was charged, sexual battery and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, have category 1 lesser-included offenses. Thus, the trial court was required to, and did, instruct the jury on those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">First degree arson, on the other hand, has no category 1 lesser included offenses. Criminal mischief is a category 2 lesser-included offense. The state court is required to give a category 2 lesser-included offense instruction upon request, but only if the indictment or information alleges all the statutory elements of the lesser offense, and the evidence at trial established each of those elements. <em>Jones v. State, </em>666 So.2d 960, 963 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996); <em>see also Amado v. State, </em>585 So.2d 282, 282-83 (Fla.1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The state court concluded that Bell\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to request the criminal mischief instruction was a matter of reasonable trial strategy. Griffith, Bell\u2019s trial counsel, testified that he chose not to request a criminal mischief instruction because that offense required a showing of intent (the damage must be done maliciously and willfully), which was inconsistent with his argument to the jury on the first-degree arson charge that the government had not proven that the fire was intentional, rather than accidental. Griffith further explained that he could not credibly argue for a criminal mischief conviction given the evidence presented to the jury. Bell has not shown that the state court\u2019s conclusion that this was sound trial strategy is an unreasonable application of the <em>Strickland </em>standard. This is especially true given that <em>Strickland </em>requires the court to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2052. Under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of the law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690,104 S.Ct. at 2066.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In any event, the state court noted that the other felony charges (aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sexual battery), for which lesser-included offense instructions were given, hinged on Sara Bell\u2019s credibility. The arson charge did not. Sgt. Qualls testified that he returned to the house with Sara Bell and saw smoke. A fire investigator testified that the fire was intentionally started in four different areas of the house. In the recorded phone calls with Sara Bell, Bell did not deny setting the house on fire when his wife asked him why he did it. In other words, even if the state trial court had agreed to give the criminal mischief instruction, Bell has not shown that the jury probably would have convicted him of criminal mischief rather than first degree arson. <em>Cf. Sanders v. State, </em>946 So.2d 953, 959-60 (Fla.2007) (concluding that \u201c[t]he possibility of a jury pardon cannot form the basis for finding prejudice\u201d under <em>Strickland </em>when a defendant claims ineffective assistance resulting from counsel\u2019s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction). Under these circumstances, the state court reasonably could conclude that Bell had not shown a reasonable probability of a different outcome had his counsel requested the criminal mischief instruction. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In sum, Bell has not shown that the state court\u2019s decision rejecting his ineffective trial counsel claim was contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>or other established federal law. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">. Under Florida law, a person commits first-degree arson when he willfully damages a dwelling by fire or explosion, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 806.01(1 )(a), and commits criminal mischief when he willfully and maliciously damages property belonging to another by any means, Fla Stat. \u00a7 806.13(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\">. <em>See Sanders v. State, </em>946 So.2d 953, 958 (Fla.2006) (explaining that, although jury is instructed on lesser-included offenses, it is also instructed to consider them <em>\u201conly </em>if it decide[s] that the main accusation has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>Bufford v. State, </em>473 So.2d 795, 796 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985) (upholding trial court\u2019s instruction to jury, in response to jury question regarding lesser-included offense, that it should find the defendant guilty of the highest offense the evidence supports).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. We review a district court's grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>while the court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination whether the state court acted contrary to clearly established federal law, unreasonably applied federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>or made an unreasonable determination of fact. <em>Hall v. Head, </em>310 F.3d 683, 690-91 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">. Under Florida law, second degree arson\u2014 arson of a structure \u2014 is also a lesser-included offense of first degree arson. Although Bell argued in his Rule 3.850 proceedings in Florida state court and in his \u00a7 2254 petition that his trial attorney should have requested a second degree arson instruction, Bell does not make this argument on appeal to this Court and thus has abandoned it. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-5\">. The state court also concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to request the criminal mischief instruction was not unreasonable given the evidence presented at trial. Under Florida law, a criminal mischief offense requires that a defendant willfully and maliciously injure or damage property \"belonging to another.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 806.13(l)(a). The criminal information against Bell alleged that the dwelling at 4092 Jackson Community Road belonged to Sara Bell and that Bell damaged the dwelling and its contents. However, at trial Sara Bell testified that she and Bell actually owned the home together. Thus, the trial evidence did not support a criminal mischief charge based on the damage to the house. We recognize that Bell points to the burned clothes found in a pile in the master bedroom, which Sara Bell testified were hers. However, the criminal information against Bell did not allege who owned the contents of the dwelling, much less who owned the clothes burned in the bedroom. Thus, the criminal information against Bell did not contain one of the required elements of criminal mischief and did not support a criminal mischief charge based on the damage to Sara Bell\u2019s clothes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
