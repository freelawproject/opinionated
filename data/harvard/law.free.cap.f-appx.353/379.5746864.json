Lambros for claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and for conversion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">The State of Georgia brought a civil action in the Superior Court of Camden County, Georgia, against Fairley Cisco asserting that Cisco violated the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\u201cRICO\u201d) Act. Due to the RICO action, the superior court appointed Lam-bros receiver over the property of Cisco. In his capacity as receiver, Lambros took possession of certain fuel stations that had been owned and operated by Cisco. Pateo claims they own some of the inventory located within those fuel stations. Without first seeking the permission of the superior court to file suit against its court-appointed receiver, Pateo filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against Lambros in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia alleging that the seizure of the inventory violated the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Their complaint also included a state law conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">One week after Pateo filed suit in district court, Lambros moved the superior court for permission to sell, at auction, the property claimed by Pateo. Pateo then moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, asking the district court to enjoin the superior court from approving the auction. Patco\u2019s motion was denied, and they appealed. Less than one week later, Lambros moved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>district court to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim for relief because Lam-bros was entitled to immunity from suit. The district court dismissed the case, ruling that because Pateo failed to obtain permission from the superior court to sue Lambros, its court-appointed receiver, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Pateo appealed the dismissal, and that appeal was consolidated with the appeal of the denial of the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The <em>Barton </em>doctrine is a creature of both Georgia law and federal common law; it teaches, \u201cthat before a suit can be maintained against a receiver ... it is necessary that the consent of the court appointing him be first obtained.\u201d <em>Bugg v. Lang, </em>35 Ga.App. 704, 134 S.E. 623, 623 (1926) (citation omitted); <em>Barton v. Barbour, </em>104 U.S. 126, 127, 26 L.Ed. 672 (1881). This rule applies equally whether a state court appointed receiver is sued in state court, or as in this case, the receiver is sued in federal court. <em>See Carter v. Rodgers, </em>220 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2000) (applying <em>Barton </em>doctrine to suit against a bankruptcy trustee and holding \u201cwhen leave is required, it is required before pursuing remedies in either state or other federal courts.\u201d) Where a plaintiff neglects to obtain leave from the appointing court, a suit filed against the receiver in another court must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Patco\u2019s complaint does not allege that they sought leave of the Superior Court of Camden County before filing suit against Lambros in the district court. So, unless some exception to the <em>Barton </em>doctrine applies to this case \u2014 and one does not \u2014 the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Patco\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">An exception to the <em>Barion </em>doctrine permits suits against receivers without leave of the appointing court with respect to acts or transactions \u201cin carrying on the business connected with such property.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>220 F.3d at 1254 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(a)). This exception contemplates \u201cactions redressing torts committed in furtherance of the debtor\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). For example, if a customer of a gas station operated by a receiver slips and falls while shopping and alleges the fall was caused by negligence attributable to the receiver, the customer could bring suit against the receiver without first seeking permission from the appointing court. Here, however, Patco\u2019s allegations arise from liquidation of gas station assets, not the operation of the gas stations. Because they did not relate to any \u201cbusiness connected with such property,\u201d this exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Pateo contends they were not required to obtain permission from the appointing court because a recent Georgia Supreme Court opinion invalidated a portion of the RICO statute that formed the basis for the state\u2019s action against Fairley Cisco. <em>See Cisco v. State, </em>285 Ga. 656, 680 S.E.2d 831 (2009). Lambros\u2019s appointment as receiver was prompted by that RICO action. Whether or not the <em>Cisco </em>decision affects Lambros\u2019s status as receiver, it is not relevant to this appeal. When Lambros committed the acts of which Pateo complains, when Pateo filed this lawsuit, and when the district court dismissed this case, Lam-bros was a duly appointed receiver. Nothing in the <em>Cisco </em>case relieves Pateo of the duty to seek leave from the appointing court before filing suit against Lambros in a second court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Pateo were required, yet neglected, to obtain consent from the Superior Court of Camden County before filing suit in the district court. The district court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Patco\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to address Pat-co\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, we vacate the denial of this motion and dismiss the motion for want of jurisdiction. (R.l-17 at 20.) With the record so modified, we affirm the final judgment dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">ORDERS ON MOTION VACATED and DISMISSED; FINAL JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
