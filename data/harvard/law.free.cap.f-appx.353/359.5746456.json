Dixon\u2019s motion was based on Amendments 706 and 599 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Dixon challenges the denial of his motion on three grounds, but his arguments fail. First, Dixon acknowledges that he was sentenced as a career offender, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), but he argues that he falls within an exception to <em>Moore </em>because his prior convictions were for \u201clow-level, nonviolent, small time drug offenses.\u201d Regardless of how Dixon classifies his crimes, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his sentencing range. Second, Dixon argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), but those decisions do not apply to a motion to reduce a sentence. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009). Third, Dixon argues that the district court should have applied Amendment 599, but that Amendment became effective before Dixon was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">The denial of Dixon\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
