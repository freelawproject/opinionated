In his motion, Chu contended that because he was \u201ca person held in custody for violating probation or supervised release,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(a)(1) required that he be brought before a magistrate judge for an initial appearance hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Chu\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). If the appeal is frivolous, we may dismiss it sua sponte under 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Rule 32.1(a)(1) provides that \u201c[a] person held in custody for violating probation or supervised release must be taken without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge.\u201d Chu was not entitled to a Rule 32.1 initial appearance hearing because Chu is not in federal custody because he violated the terms of his supervised release. <em>See </em>Rule 32.1(a)(1). Rather, he is in federal custody pursuant to his federal convictions for smuggling and trafficking. The plain language of Rule 32.1(a)(1) requires that the person be \u201cin custody for violating probation or supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Chu has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Accordingly, Chu\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b979-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
