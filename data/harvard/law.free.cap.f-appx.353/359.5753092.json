On appeal, Toler argues the district court erred by denying his motion for a sentencing reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). \u201c[D]eterminations made during the original sentencing [cannot] be reconsidered or altered\u201d during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009). A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction if his guideline range is not changed by the applicable retroactive guideline amendment. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). When the otherwise applicable guideline range is lower than the applicable mandatory minimum, \u201cthe statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Therefore, a defendant sentenced to a mandatory minimum is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">After Toler\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine and crack with intent to distribute, the district court imposed a mandatory life sentence. Toler can not challenge the applicability of the mandatory minimum life sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding. <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927. Because Toler was sentenced to a mandatory minimum, his guideline range can not be changed by Amendment 706 or any other guideline amendment and he is ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding it lacked jurisdiction to reduce Toler\u2019s sentence due to his mandatory minimum life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">. Toler also claims: (1) pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the court could reduce his sentence below the guidelines range because the guidelines are no longer mandatory, and (2) under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court was permitted to consider the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity. These contentions are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), which held <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-22\">.
