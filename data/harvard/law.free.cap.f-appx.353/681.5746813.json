For the reasons below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-27\">The procedural history of this case and the details of Levi\u2019s claims are set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Levi alleged in his \u00a7 2241 petition that his custody classification score was wrongly calculated. He requested that he be transferred to a prison camp or low-security prison. The District Court determined that Levi\u2019s claims were not cognizable and dismissed the petition. Levi filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We agree with the District Court that Levi\u2019s claims concerning the determination of his custody level do not lie at the \u201ccore of habeas\u201d and, therefore, are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Learner v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 542-44 (3d Cir.2002). None of his claims challenge the fact or length of his sentence or confinement. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Moreover, prisoners have no constitutional right to a particular classification. <em>Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. See Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
