The district court denied IFP status and certified that Hall\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Hall is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). However, Hall has not demonstrated any nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-20\">The notice of appeal filed by Hall was timely with respect to only the denial of Hall\u2019s \u201creurged second motion to vacate\u201d the district court\u2019s judgment. Hall\u2019s brief filed in support of his IFP motion does not contain any argument that indicates that the district court abused its discretion in denying this motion. <em>See Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. City of Galveston, </em>898 F.2d 481, 481 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">This appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits, and it is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Hall\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
