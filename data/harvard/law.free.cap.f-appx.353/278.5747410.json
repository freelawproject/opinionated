After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">Celed\u00f3n was a courier for a large drug organization that imported cocaine from Mexico to the United States. Celed\u00f3n made ten trips transporting drugs from Texas or Mexico to Houston, Texas or Atlanta, Georgia. Celed\u00f3n also transported drug proceeds back to Texas. After receiving a tip from a confidential source, law enforcement stopped Celedon\u2019s tractor-trailer at a Texas border checkpoint and found a shipment of cocaine. Celed\u00f3n cooperated with law enforcement and completed a controlled delivery of \u201csham\u201d cocaine under the supervision of law enforcement agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">Celed\u00f3n pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(ii), and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Celedon\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction, but granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion based on Celedon\u2019s substantial assistance. The district court sentenced Celed\u00f3n to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 12, 2008, the district court entered its judgment and commitment. Celed\u00f3n filed a notice of appeal on September 17, 2008, but voluntarily dismissed her appeal on October 27, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-20\">On October 29, 2008, Celed\u00f3n filed a \u201cMotion for New Sentencing,\u201d citing Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Cele-d\u00f3n argued that her Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses was violated because one of her co-defendants testified at his sentencing hearing and exaggerated Celedon\u2019s culpability in the cocaine conspiracy. Because the co-defendant\u2019s sentencing preceded Celedon\u2019s, Celed\u00f3n claimed that the co-defendant\u2019s testimony led the district court to refuse to give Celed\u00f3n a lower sentence. Celed\u00f3n argued that she was entitled to a resentenc-ing \u201cbased on the new evidence that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>discovered after her sentencing.\u201d The district court denied Celedon\u2019s Rule 33 motion, concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to modify her sentence. Celed\u00f3n appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except: (1) upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d); (2) when \u201cexpressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\u201d; or (3) when the \u201cterm of imprisonment [is] based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). It is undisputed that there has been no motion by the BOP Director to modify Celedon\u2019s sentence and no amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that subsequently lowered Celedon\u2019s sentencing range. Thus, the district court had jurisdiction to modify Celedon\u2019s sentence only if permitted by statute or Rule 35, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). This Court has concluded, based on \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), that district courts lack \u201cinherent authority\u201d to modify a sentence. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316-18 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, district courts may modify a sentence only via (1)Rule 35, or (2) the express statutory authority conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316-18 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding it lacked jurisdiction to modify Celedon\u2019s sentence. Celed\u00f3n brought her motion under Rule 33. However, \u00a7 3582(c) prohibits a district court from modifying her sentence except when permitted by Rule 35(a) or \u00a7 2255. Thus, the district court did not have authority to modify Celedon\u2019s sentence under Rule 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">Further, even if Celedon\u2019s motion for a new sentencing is construed as a Rule 35(a) motion, the district court did not commit reversible error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 35(a) permits the district court \u201c[w]ithin 7 days after sentencing\u201d to \u201ccorrect a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). Celedon\u2019s motion was not filed within the requisite seven-day period and does not present an arithmetical or technical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">We also reject Celedon\u2019s argument that her alleged Sixth Amendment violation constitutes \u201cclear error.\u201d Clear error within the meaning of Rule 35(a) is limited to obvious errors that either resulted in an illegal sentence or those errors that would almost certainly result in a remand on appeal. <em>See United States v. Lett, </em>483 F.3d 782, 788 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 31, 172 L.Ed.2d 18 (2008); <em>United States v. Yost, </em>185 F.3d 1178, 1181 (11th Cir.1999). Cele-don\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim cannot meet this standard under our precedent, which recognizes that the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses is a trial right, not a sentencing right. <em>See United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">Celed\u00f3n argues that her motion should have been granted as a motion for reconsideration. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not provide a mechanism for filing a motion for reconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>eration. <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1413-14 (11th Cir.1992). We have considered motions for reconsideration in criminal actions in the limited context of considering whether they may act as tolling motions for purposes of filing a timely appeal. <em>See id. </em>In any event, the district court lacks \u201cinherent authority\u201d to modify a sentence after it is imposed. <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1316-18. Thus, under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court does not have authority to modify a sentence through a motion for reconsideration in the direct criminal proceedings. <em>United States v. Dotz, </em>455 F.3d 644, 648 (6th Cir.2006) (rejecting defendant\u2019s \u201ccreative characterization\u201d of his Rule 35(a) motion as a motion for reconsideration and concluding that under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cthere is simply no such thing as a \u2018motion to reconsider\u2019 an otherwise final sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Celedon\u2019s motion for a new sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-17\">. Celed\u00f3n does not dispute her original advisory guideline range was 262 to 327 months' imprisonment. The \u00a7 5K1.1 motion resulted in a 135-month sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">. Whether the district court had jurisdiction to resentence a defendant \u201cis a legal question subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-18\">. Celed\u00f3n does not argue that her motion should have been recharacterized as a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
