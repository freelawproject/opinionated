After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">According to Austin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 complaint, in March 2007, Austin, who is African-American, was involved in a two-car accident. The unnamed police officer who responded at the scene, \u201cin concert with\u201d Major Dixon and the City, failed to interview witnesses or file a written report with the Director of Public Safety within 24 hours, as required by Alabama Code \u00a7 32-10-7. Austin later sued the driver of the other vehicle in the Montgomery Circuit Court, but lost after a jury trial presided over by Judge Reese.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-18\">According to Austin\u2019s complaint, under Alabama law, \u201cthe remedy [he] was seeking could only occur when a report is made to [the] Director who has jurisdiction under \u00a7 32-7-5, to make [a] decision.\u201d Austin\u2019s complaint alleged that by failing to file the written accident report, the defendants deprived him of his rights under state law \u201cby failing to apprise that the [Alabama] Circuit Court was powerless in the matter at this stage.\u201d Austin\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants deprived him of: (1) his rights under Article I, Section 6 of the Alabama Constitution; (2) his due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and (4) his rights against \u201cabuse of process\u201d and \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-19\">The defendants moved to dismiss Austin\u2019s complaint for, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to state a claim. A magistrate judge filed a report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending that the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss Austin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>complaint <em>for </em>lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The R &amp; R concluded that Austin\u2019s complaint failed to assert any viable federal or constitutional claim and that there was no diversity jurisdiction because all of the parties were citizens of Alabama. The R &amp; R also noted that Judge Reese was entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over Austin\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed Austin\u2019s complaint. The district court order states: (1) \u201c[t]he plaintiffs state law claims are DISMISSED without prejudice,\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]his case is DISMISSED pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Austin filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Subject-matter jurisdiction in federal court can be based upon either federal question jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, or diversity jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAbsent diversity of citizenship, a plaintiff must present a \u2018substantial\u2019 federal question in order to invoke the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Wyke v. Polk County Sch. Bd., </em>129 F.3d 560, 566 (11th Cir.1997). A claim is \u201cinsubstantial\u201d and may be dismissed if it \u201chas no plausible foundation, or if the court concludes that a prior Supreme Court decision clearly forecloses the claim.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe test of federal jurisdiction is not whether the cause of action is one on which the claimant can recover. Rather, the test is whether the cause of action alleged is so patently without merit as to justify the court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. Ingram Equip. Co., Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir.1990) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Austin argues that the district court had federal question jurisdiction because Austin brought his action under \u00a7 1983. Construing Austin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, Austin alleges that defendants violated his due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to comply with \u00a7 32-10-7 of the Alabama Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">It is axiomatic that in order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, \u201ca plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a <em>federal </em>right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis added). From the face of Austin\u2019s complaint, it is clear that his claims are wholly frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>For example, Austin\u2019s allegation that the defendants violated Alabama Code \u00a7 32-10-7 does not provide a basis for a \u00a7 1983 due process claim. The violation of a state statute that does not create a liberty or property interest cannot be the basis for a due process claim. <em>Harris v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., </em>817 F.2d 1525, 1527 (11th Cir.1987). Section 32-10-7 imposes a purely procedural requirement upon an investigating law enforcement officer to file a report with Alabama\u2019s Director of Public Safety and does not create any sort of constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Likewise, Austin\u2019s allegation that defendants violated \u00a7 32-10-7 does not provide a basis for an equal protection claim. To properly plead an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must allege that, through state action, similarly situated persons are treated disparately. <em>Thigpen v. Bibb County, </em>223 F.3d 1231, 1237 (11th Cir.2000), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). Austin\u2019s complaint does not allege that the defendants, in failing to comply \u00a7 32-10-7, treated him differently based on his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that Austin\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are wholly without merit and too insubstantial to raise a federal question. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Austin\u2019s entire complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we do not reach Austin\u2019s argument that the district court erred in concluding that Judge Reese is entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\">. In addition, the R &amp; R concluded that to the extent Austin challenged the outcome of the state court civil action against the other driver in Montgomery Circuit Court, his claims were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and should be dismissed with prejudice. The district court dismissed this claim with prejudice. Austin does not challenge this ruling on appeal, and we do not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) permits the defense of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction to be raised in a pre-answer motion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3) requires the district court to dismiss an action if it \u201cdetermines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). \"A dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a not a judgment on the merits and is entered without prejudice.\u201d <em>Stalley ex rel. United States v. Orlando Reg\u2019l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 524 </em>F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">. Austin argues only that federal question jurisdiction exists and does not challenge the district court's diversity jurisdiction ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-14\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's determination that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1998). Any factual findings concerning subject-matter jurisdiction made by the district court are overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>Barnett v. Okeechobee Hosp., </em>283 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">. Section 32-10-7 of the Alabama Code provides that \u201c[e]veiy law-enforcement officer who in the regular course of duty investigates a motor vehicle accident, either at the time of and at the scene of the accident or thereafter by interviewing participants or witnesses, shall, within 24 hours after completing such investigation, forward the necessary completed written report or copy thereof of such accident to the director on the uniform accident report form supplied by the director.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 32-10-7. The term \u201cthe director\u201d refers to \"the Director of Public Safety of Alabama.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 32-1-1.1(12).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
