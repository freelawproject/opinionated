The Government has moved for summary affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision. For the reasons that follow, we grant the motion and will deny Padgett\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">Padgett is a native and citizen of Honduras. She entered the United States unlawfully in 2002, and was served with a Notice to Appear in October 2007. We summarized the bulk of Padgett\u2019s procedural history in a previous opinion, <em>see Padgett-Zelaya v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 Fed.Appx. 797 (3d Cir.2009), and incorporate that history here by reference. It suffices to say that after we denied Padgett\u2019s prior petition for review, she filed her second motion to reopen proceedings with the Board. That motion was predicated on new evidence regarding the 2003 arrest warrant from Honduran authorities, and a related extradition request, that implicated Padgett in the murder of a man in her native country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Padgett alleged that this new evidence \u201cshows that the government of Honduras, in late 2008 had exonerated [her] from all wrongdoing in the death of [the murder victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-22\">The Board determined that Padgett\u2019s motion was barred by procedural rules governing the time and number limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>for motions to reopen, and that the \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d exception to those rules did not apply. The Board also determined that Padgett \u201chas not shown that an \u2018exceptional situation\u2019 exists that would warrant the Board\u2019s exercise of its limited discretion to reconsider or reopen these proceedings sua sponte.\u201d Padgett appealed. The Government has moved for summary affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision, and Padgett has filed her opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005); <em>see also Cruz v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>452 F.3d 240, 242 (3d Cir.2006). Under this standard, we may reverse the Board\u2019s decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002). Summary affirmance is reserved for situations where, for example, \u201cno substantial question\u201d is presented by the appeal, or where \u201csubsequent precedent ... warrants such action.\u201d <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6; <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">We will grant the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance because this appeal presents no \u201csubstantial question.\u201d Barring exceptions not applicable to the facts of this case, motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days from the date \u201cthe final administrative decision was rendered,\u201d and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Though it erred in determining that Padgett\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely, the Board did not abuse its discretion in determining that Padgett\u2019s second motion to reopen exceeded the statutory numerical limitations. Padgett\u2019s first motion to reopen, filed on June 10, 2008, 2008 WL 3861929, was denied by the Board on July 10, 2008. Her second, filed on July 1, 2009, sought to reopen proceedings that were terminated by the Board on June 3, 2008, 2008 WL 2401020, when it ordered Padgett removed to Honduras.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that Padgett\u2019s second motion to reopen was number-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, and as the Government correctly points out, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>not to reopen proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 475 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201c[b]eeause the BIA retains unfettered discretion to decline to sua sponte reopen or reconsider a deportation proceeding, this court is without jurisdiction to review a decision declining to exercise such discretion to reopen or reconsider the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion is granted, and we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-15\">. The Board had weighed the arrest warrant, along with other factors, in determining that Padgett was not entitled to a discretionary grant of adjustment of status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>. </em>Petitioner argues that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) provides an applicable exception for claims based on \"new evidence,\" but that provision is not an exception to the procedural rules governing motions to reopen. Instead it provides that a motion to reopen \"shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" <em>Id.; see also Filja v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 241, 253 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">. The Government incorrectly asserts that the Board\u2019s February 5, 2008, 2008 WL 655798, decision, which merely remanded proceedings to the Immigration Judge, is the lodestar for determining timeliness. In fact, the \"final administrative decision\u201d for \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) purposes is the date that the Board terminates the proceedings, either by, for example, a final order of removal, <em>see Orekhova v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir.2005), or the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Nevarez v. Holder, </em>572 F.3d 605, 607 (9th Cir.2009). When Padgett filed her second motion to reopen on July 1, 2008, the \"final administrative decision\u201d was the Board's June 3, 2008 order of removal and, as a result, Padgett's motion was filed well within 90 days from that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-15\">.While Padgett argues that she is entitled to have the motion to reopen procedural limitations equitably tolled, she did not raise this issue below. We thus lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Hoxha v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 157, 159 (3d Cir.2009)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
