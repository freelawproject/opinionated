Vardanyan argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>According to the presentence investigation report, Alex Shevgert, through an intermediary, Lark Cholak, paid Vardanyan to injure Shevgert\u2019s in-laws, Grigori and Galina Komissarchuk, because they refused to give Shevgert money. Cholak paid Vardanyan $2000 to travel from Tampa, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey, to attack the Komissarchuks. Vardanyan intended to enter the Komissarchuks\u2019 home disguised as a delivery man, but Grigori refused to admit Vardanyan. The next day, Shevgert and Vardanyan followed Grigori to a Home Depot and Vardanyan attacked Grigori who suffered multiple facial fractures and lacerations, serious abdominal injuries, and a ruptured pancreas. Grigori underwent surgery and remained in the hospital for a week to recover from his injuries. After his release, Grigori continued to suffer from dizziness and ringing in his ears.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Shevgert retained Cholak a second time to attack the Komissarchuks. Cholak again paid Vardanyan $2000, and Vardan-yan traveled to New Jersey and watched the Komissarchuks\u2019 residence for several days, but was unable to find an opportunity to assault the couple. The next month, while the Komissarchuks were in their Florida home, Vardanyan entered their garage as they returned home from a party at Shevgert\u2019s house. Vardanyan beat Gri-gori and Galena with a hammer, fractured Grigori\u2019s skull, and caused Galena to suffer multiple lacerations and severe bruising.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Shevgert later asked Cholak to attack the Komissarchuks a third time. Cholak agreed to contact Vardanyan. For $2000, Vardanyan flew from Florida to New Jersey and attacked Galina on the street outside her home. Vardanyan beat Galina with a blunt object \u201cso violently that her dentures flew out of her mouth.\u201d Galina was admitted to the hospital for three days to treat a fracture to her skull and a subdural hematoma, and she was placed on medication for seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The presentence report listed a base offense level of 14. United States Sentencing .Guideline \u00a7 2A2.2 (Nov.2008). The report increased the base level by four points because Vardanyan used a dangerous weapon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), by six points because the victims sustained serious injuries, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2A2.2(b)(3)(E), and by two points because Vardanyan was paid for the attacks, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2A2.2(b)(5), and decreased that level by three points <em>for </em>Var-danyan\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With a criminal history of II, the report listed a sentencing range between 78 and 97 months of imprisonment. Var-danyan did not object to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The government requested that the district court vary upward and sentence Var-danyan to 20 years of imprisonment. Var-danyan responded that the facts relied on by the government for the variance had been factored into the calculation of his sentence. Vardanyan argued that he was \u201con the hook\u201d to \u201cother people\u201d who were unhappy with the results of the first assault and required him to \u201cfinish the job.\u201d Vardanyan, a native of Russia, admitted to the district court that he had not \u201c[done] honest things in this country\u201d and he had failed to \u201clearn [a] lesson because [he] got off real easy\u201d a few years earlier for a credit card offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The district court sentenced Vardanyan to 20 years of imprisonment. The court found that the vicious \u201cattacks indicated that [Vardanyan] had a total disregard for those people\u201d and he \u201cdemonstrated ... a depraved mind ... for human life.... \u201d The district court also found that Vardan-yan could have refused to participate in later attacks. The court later explained that its decision to vary upward was based on four sentencing factors: the nature and circumstances of Vardanyan\u2019s offense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>his history and characteristics; the seriousness of his offense; the need for adequate deterrence; and the need to protect the public from further crimes by Vardan-yan.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence above the range recommended by the Guidelines. Vardanyan beat an elderly couple viciously on three occasions, and they sustained head trauma and injuries to their internal organs. Those crimes evidence a callous disregard for the lives of others and for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court considered the sentencing factors and reasoned that the \u201cseriousness of [Vardanyan\u2019s] crime crie[d] out for\u201d a 20-year sentence. Although Vardanyan complains that the court based the variance on factors accounted for by the Guidelines, the Supreme Court has held that the Guidelines are advisory and the district court is obliged to consider all of the statutory factors for sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007). Vardanyan\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We AFFIRM Vardanyan\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
