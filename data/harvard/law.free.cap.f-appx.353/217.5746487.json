See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1326(d). Rodriguez-Martin argues that his removal proceedings were \u201cperfunctory\u201d and his removal was ordered \u201con the mistaken assumption\u201d that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of Rodriguez\u2019s collateral challenge to his prior removal proceedings. <em>United States v. Zelaya, </em>293 F.3d 1294, 1297 (11th Cir.2002). To prevail, Rodriguez-Martin had to prove that he had exhausted administrative remedies available to him to seek relief from the order of removal, he was deprived of an opportunity for judicial review during the removal proceedings, and \u201cthe entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id,. </em>at 1298. Rodriguez-Martin failed to satisfy these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Rodriguez-Martin declined to avail himself of administrative remedies or pursue opportunities for judicial review of the order of removal. Rodriguez-Martin failed to challenge the administrative closure of his appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and, even after the Board reinstated the appeal, Rodriguez-Martin did not appear in the proceeding or move for reconsideration after the Board dismissed his appeal. Rodriguez-Martin also did not seek a rescission of the order of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1297. The district court did not err by denying Rodriguez-Martin\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Rodriguez-Martin\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
