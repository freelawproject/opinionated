In the amended judgment, the district court directed that Fuller\u2019s federal sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm was to run consecutively to his state sentence for aggravated sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">After remand to the district court for assignment of reasons for the denial of the motion to correct, the district court withdrew the amended judgment. Because that withdrawal provides the relief that Fuller seeks on appeal, the appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). The motion to proceed IFP is also moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT; IFP DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
