Davis\u2019s action arises from an incident in which, by his own allegations, he resisted repeated orders of prison officials to submit to restraints by placing his hands behind him for such restraints to be affixed. Davis failed to meet his burden of alleging or adducing evidence to support the use of excessive force against him or injuries sufficiently severe and enduring to constitute a violation of his constitutional rights. Our review of the record on appeal and the applicable law satisfies us that all rulings of the district court are correct and free of reversible error. Accordingly, the judgment from which Davis appeals is affirmed, and his Motion For Appointment Of Counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
