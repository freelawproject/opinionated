Parks appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of her application for disability benefits, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Parks contends the ALJ committed reversible error by (1) giving reduced weight to the opinion of Dr. Re-heem, one of Parks\u2019 treating physicians, and (2) discounting Parks\u2019 subjective reports of pain. We address each issue in turn, and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-22\">Parks contends the ALJ erred by discounting the medical opinion of one of her treating physicians, Dr. Reheem, because good cause did not exist to reject the opinion and the ALJ failed to provide adequate reasons for rejecting the opinion. The ALJ may reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985). Absent the existence of \u201cgood cause\u201d to the contrary, however, the ALJ must give the treating physician\u2019s testimony substantial weight. <em>Phillips v. Barn-hart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c \u2018[G]ood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ing physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">If the ALJ disregards the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate his reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. We have found no reversible error \u201c[w]here our limited review precludes re-weighing the evidence anew, and [where] the ALJ articulated specific reasons for failing to give [the treating physician\u2019s] opinion controlling weight\u201d and these findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005). When the ALJ does not give the treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight, the ALJ applies other factors such as the length of treatment, the frequency of examination, the nature and extent of the relationship, the supportability of the opinion, its consistency with other evidence, and the specialization of the physician. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(2)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The ALJ expressly addressed the weight given to Dr. Reheem\u2019s opinion. Specifically, the ALJ found Dr. Reheem\u2019s opinion was not supported by his own records or the opinions of Drs. Inga and Kaplan who also treated Parks. In particular, Dr. Reheem repeatedly noted that pain medication controlled Parks\u2019 pain to a tolerable level. In August 2006, Dr. Reheem did not note a change in Parks\u2019 condition. Nonetheless, in September 2006, he opined that Parks was disabled. Moreover, Dr. Inga, another of Parks\u2019 treating physicians, opined in February 2006 that Parks could work in a sedentary type of job where she lifted nothing heavier than 20 pounds and avoided certain repetitive motions. Substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to give Dr. Reheem\u2019s testimony great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Parks asserts the ALJ erred by rejecting her credibility about her pain without any basis in the record. \u201c[A] claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain cannot in and of themselves serve as conclusive evidence of disability. The record must document by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques the existence of a medical impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the disabling pain.\u201d <em>Chester v. Bowen, </em>792 F.2d 129, 132 (11th Cir.1986). A three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through his own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). The pain standard requires: (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition, and either (2) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition, or (3) the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">When a claimant testifies to subjective complaints of pain, the ALJ must clearly articulate adequate reasons for discrediting the claimant\u2019s allegations of disabling symptoms. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). In articulating his reasons, the ALJ need not specifically refer to every piece of evidence, so long as the decision \u201cis not a broad rejection which is not enough to enable the district court or this Court to conclude that the ALJ considered [the] medical condition as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1210-11 (quotation omitted). A clearly articulated credibility determination supported by substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>dence will not be disturbed. <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1558, 1562 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Parks\u2019 claim the ALJ erred by discrediting her pain testimony and doing so without adequate explanation is without merit. The ALJ expressly based the credibility determination on Parks\u2019 ability to take care of her personal needs, including errands, driving, and attending church, and the fact that her medication was controlling her pain. The record supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion because it shows Parks was able to cook, clean, run errands, drive, and attend church weekly. Additionally, medical evidence shows Parks\u2019 medication reasonably controlled her pain. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Parks\u2019 subjective pain testimony was based on adequate reasons as the effectiveness of Parks\u2019 medication and her ability to perform chores, drive, and attend church are inconsistent with her testimony of debilitating pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-15\">. When \"the ALJ denies benefits and the [Appeals Council] denies review, we review the ALJ's decision as the Commissioner's final decision.\" <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the Commissioner's factual findings with deference, and the \"factual findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence, consisting of such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). However, we review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
