Anton argues that the district court erred at resentencing by finding that Anton possessed over 200 firearms by a preponderance of the evidence, which resulted in an offense-level enhancement of 10. Additionally, Anton argues that the district court failed to make a ruling on his claim for two sentence reductions based on the assertions that his firearms were used solely for sporting collection purposes and that he accepted responsibility for the offense in a timely manner. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, the district court did not err by enhancing Anton\u2019s sentence for possession of 200 or more firearms. However, because the district court failed to address Anton\u2019s objections concerning sporting collection and acceptance of responsibility reductions, we vacate the district court\u2019s order as to this issue and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">On appeal, Anton argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a ten-level enhancement for his alleged ownership of over 200 firearms under U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(E). Specifically, Anton argues that the law enforcement officers never found a large quantity of firearms that belonged to him, that his statement to Agent Barborini, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent (\u201cATF agent\u201d), that he had more than 347 guns was simply a \u201cbragging offhand remark,\u201d and that the ledgers the government introduced were unreliable because they did not establish that Anton actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>owned or possessed the guns described in the ledgers during the time the offense took place. The government responds that the firearm quantity enhancement was justified by Anton\u2019s ledgers, his statement to Agent Barborini that he owned more than 347 guns, and the 23,000 rounds of ammunition found at Anton\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Anton also argues that this alleged possession was not relevant conduct, as it occurred in 1999 and 2000, and therefore, it exceeded the scope of the charged offense in this case. Anton finally argues that the firearm quantity enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment because it was not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but [we review] its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999)). Under this deferential standard, a sentencing court\u2019s credibility findings are \u201cvirtually never\u201d reversible, so long as the pertinent witness\u2019s testimony was internally consistent. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201cWhen a defendant objects to a factual finding that is used in calculating his guideline sentence ... the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Agis-Meza, </em>99 F.3d 1052, 1055 (11th Cir.1996)). \u201cThe preponderance of evidence is a relaxed evidentiary standard, however, it does not grant the court a license to sentence a defendant in the absence of sufficient evidence when that defendant has properly objected to a factual conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The base offense level for a defendant who was convicted under \u00a7 922(g) is 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n.3. This base offense level is enhanced by 10 levels if 200 or more firearms were involved in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The district court did not clearly err by finding that Anton possessed over 200 firearms because: (1) Anton told an ATF agent that he possessed 347 firearms, and Anton did not refute that statement; (2) ledgers containing detailed descriptions of several hundred firearms were found in Anton\u2019s possession; and (3) 23,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered at Anton\u2019s residence. Anton\u2019s ledgers and the extremely large amount of ammunition discovered at Anton\u2019s residence corroborate Anton\u2019s statement to Agent Barborini that he possessed 347 firearms. Based on this evidence, a reasonable fact finder could have found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Anton possessed over 200 firearms, and this Court must defer to the district court\u2019s implicit rejection of Anton\u2019s testimony to the contrary. Therefore, the district court did not commit clear error by holding Anton responsible for possessing over 200 firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Anton\u2019s argument concerning the scope of the relevant conduct in this case is meritless. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), the Sentencing Guidelines can group together all relevant conduct that constitutes a violation of the felon in possession statute. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) (cross-referencing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d), which lists offenses under \u00a7 2K2.1 as being grouped together). In this case, the indictment covered conduct occurring, at least in part, in 2004 and 2005. During the resentenc-ing hearing, Agent Barborini testified that, in August 2005, Anton told him that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>347 firearms. Thus, Anton\u2019s ownership of over 200 firearms occurred within the time period covered by the indictment, and the district court properly considered it as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Turning to Anton\u2019s remaining argument, that the firearm quantity enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights because the underlying facts were not proven to a jury, this Court has held that a district court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines so long as it applies the guidelines in an advisory fashion. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301). Because Anton does not allege that the district court applied the guidelines in a mandatory fashion in this case, his Sixth Amendment argument is meritless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, it was not clear error for the district court to enhance Anton\u2019s sentence for possession of more than 200 firearms. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Anton next argues that he was entitled to an offense-level reduction for being a firearms collector because the only evidence on this matter was his unrebutted testimony that his firearms were used solely for sporting collection purposes. Anton further argues that he also deserved an acceptance of responsibility offense-level reduction because he timely pled guilty and fully admitted to the charged conduct. Finally, Anton asserts that the record in this case is incomplete because the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B) by failing to rule on his collecting firearms and acceptance of responsibility reduction arguments. The government\u2019s brief failed to address the issue regarding reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>legal questions concerning the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Noel, </em>231 F.3d 833, 836 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 gives the defendant the opportunity to challenge any alleged inaccurate statement in the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) before sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(f) (requiring defendant to object in writing within fourteen days of receiving the PSI and allowing probation officer to meet with defendant about the objections, investigate further and, if appropriate, revise the PSI). If the defendant challenges factual statements in the PSI, the government is required to \u201csupport its PSI statements by some reliable substantiation that is satisfactory to convince the sentencing court that the truth of the PSI statement is not unlikely.\u201d <em>United States v. Restrepo, </em>832 F.2d 146, 149 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Under Rule 32(i)(3)(B), when a PSI statement is under dispute, the sentencing court must either make a finding as to the controverted PSI statement or \u201cdetermine that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>907 F.2d 1096, 1101 (11th Cir.1990) (citing <em>United States v. Funt, </em>896 F.2d 1288, 1299 (11th Cir.1990)). For any finding that the district court makes under Rule 32(i)(3)(B), a written record of that finding must be appended to the PSI, which is thereafter made available to the Bureau of Prisons. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(C). The district court must strictly adhere to the dictates of Rule 32(i)(3) \u201cbecause the rule helps ensure that future decisions about a defendant\u2019s penal treatment are based on a fair and accurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>PSI.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>907 F.2d at 1101 (citing <em>Funt, </em>896 F.2d at 1300) (addressing former rule 32(c)(3)(D), which contained the same requirements regarding objections to the PSI). Here, the disputed matter was pertinent to the accurate calculation of Anton\u2019s advisory guideline range, and so a ruling was mandatory. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Anton\u2019s PSI did not provide him with reductions for collecting firearms and acceptance of responsibility. Anton filed written objections in the absence of those reductions, and he restated those objections during his resentencing hearing. During his resentencing hearing, Anton also presented new evidence, in the form of his testimony, to support his eligibility for these reductions. However, during the resentencing hearing, the district court did not rule on Anton\u2019s arguments concerning the sentence reductions, and it did not address the new evidence that Anton presented during this hearing. This was the case, even though toward the end of the hearing, Anton explicitly reminded the court that it had not yet ruled on his sentence reduction arguments. Therefore, because the district court improperly failed to rule on Anton\u2019s arguments concerning acceptance of responsibility and collecting firearms sentence reductions, it violated Rule 32(i)(3)(B). Accordingly, we vacate and remand the district court\u2019s decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We note that this is a limited remand so that the district court can comply with the requirements of Rule 32(i)(3)(B). If the district court on further consideration decides that either reduction is merited, it then should consult the amended guideline range and resentence Anton.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
