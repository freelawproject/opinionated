R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to vacate. Elawad filed the Rule 60(b) motion to challenge the district court\u2019s prior denial of his Fed. R.Crim.P. 36 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-27\">On appeal, Elawad argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because it did not make factual findings or explain its conclusion. He argues that the district court\u2019s conclusory order was an abuse of discretion because it \u201cdenied this Court meaningful review by failing to issue an opinion in support of [the] order.\u201d Appellant Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cWe review questions concerning a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo, </em>and we may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Rule 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d under certain circumstances. Rule 60(b), however, does not provide for relief from a criminal order in a criminal proceeding. See <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Mosavi, </em>the defendant appealed the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a criminal forfeiture proceeding, and we determined that \u201cthe district court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction necessary to provide Rule 60(b) relief\u2019 and affirmed the denial of that motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1365. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">The judgment and order that the defendant contests were entered, not in a civil case, but in a criminal case, and a proper appeal of the forfeitures should have been raised in the defendant\u2019s criminal appeal of his conviction and sentence. Rule 60(b) simply does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case, and as such the defendant cannot challenge the criminal forfeitures at issue under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Elawad\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion because, as a rule of civil procedure, it is unavailable to challenge the denial of a motion in his criminal case. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the Rule 60(b) motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
