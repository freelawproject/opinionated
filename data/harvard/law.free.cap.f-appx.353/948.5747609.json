Henriquez contends that the non-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. Because Henri-quez did not object in the district court to the reasonableness of the sentence, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). In reviewing the reasonableness of the sentence we consider the totality of the circumstances and the extent of the district court\u2019s variance from the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>We give \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 812 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Henriquez argues that it was improper for the district court to make assumptions about the reasons for the imposition of the sentence related to a prior illegal-reentry conviction. Henriquez speculates that the 70-month sentence in that case may have been \u201cimproperly calculated\u201d and that the record did not establish that the more lenient guidelines sentence in the instant case resulted from a change in the law, as the district court supposed. Henriquez argues that the guidelines sentence accounted adequately for the statutory sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The district court\u2019s express reasons for imposing the 60-month term of imprisonment in this case reflect that it considered the seriousness of the offense, Henriquez\u2019s lack of respect for the law, and the need to provide just punishment for the offense and to deter and protect the public from future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Henriquez has not shown that the district court committed plain error in imposing the sentence. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 350. Henriquez contends also that, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the sentencing enhancement of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. Hen-riquez acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); he has raised the issue to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Fambro, </em>526 F.3d 836, 851 &amp; n. 96 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 626 (5th Cir.2007). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
