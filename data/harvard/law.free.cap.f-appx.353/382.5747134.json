The District Court granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on three grounds. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On appeal, petitioner argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence of his paranoid schizophrenia and for failing to investigate the condition adequately. In addition, the petitioner argues that the District Court abused its discretion by ruling against his motion to dismiss without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We review the District Court\u2019s ruling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 de novo. <em>Agan v. Singletary, </em>12 F.3d 1012, 1017 (11th Cir.1994). The district court examines the state court\u2019s decision to determine if it was \u201c(1) contrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or (2) involved an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1519, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Defendant raises two ineffective assistance of counsel claims. These claims are linked, and so we will analyze them at the same time. The Defendant\u2019s lawyer made a decision, supported by case law and later approved by Georgia\u2019s courts, that presenting evidence of paranoid schizophrenia would be counter productive. He decided that (1) the evidence was not sufficient to support an insanity defense under Georgia law, and (2) that it would undermine his main theory of self-defense, which under Georgia law is an objective standard. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>270 Ga. 891, 515 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The defendant\u2019s lawyer made a decision, in consultation with the defendant, not to present the defendant\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia to the jury. The state court\u2019s analysis of the lawyer\u2019s conduct was not contrary to federal law. We will not disturb that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Before the state trial, the petitioner\u2019s lawyer acquired the petitioner\u2019s medical history, talked to the petitioner about his mental health, and talked to the petitioner\u2019s mental healthcare provider. After this investigation, the lawyer believed no further investigation would be beneficial. Defendant presents no new evidence that his lawyer would have found, nor does the defendant present law or precedent that would require his lawyer to investigate more than he did. The state court ruling is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The petitioner\u2019s third claim deals only with the District Court. We review for an abuse of discretion the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant a motion to dismiss without prejudice. <em>Pontenberg v. Boston Scientific Corp., 252 </em>F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2001). The District Court ruled that later habeas petitions filed by the defendant would be untimely, because the petitioner filed the motion more than one year since his conviction became final: exceeding the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. The defendant fails to provide a reason that the statute of limitations would toll. Because the defendant would not be able to file later habeas petitions, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to rule on the habeas petition before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
