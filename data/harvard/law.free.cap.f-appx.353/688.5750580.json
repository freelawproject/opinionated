We construe the Government\u2019s Motion for Summary Affirmance as a motion to summarily deny the petition for review, and so construed, we will grant the motion and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-25\">Dervisevic is a citizen of Montenegro, who entered the United States in 2002 and stayed beyond the time allowed by his visa. Dervisevic applied for asylum and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>related relief, but an Immigration Judge denied relief on August 18, 2004. The BIA affirmed without opinion on December 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Dervisevic filed a motion to reopen on January 8, 2009, based on a pending Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition filed on his behalf by his wife, who had been granted asylum. A motion to reopen must normally be filed within 90 days of a final order, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); but Dervisevic argued that his motion should be construed as a motion filed jointly with the Government, not subject to the 90-day limit, in light of his efforts to contact the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) to obtain their consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA \u201cdecline[d] to treat the motion as a joint motion in the absence of an affirmative statement from the DHS that it agrees to reopening.\u201d BIA decision at 1. The BIA thus found the motion untimely and denied it. We agree with the BIA that the motion was not \u201cjointly filed,\u201d and we thus hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen as untimely. <em>Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994) (discretionary decisions of BIA not disturbed unless they are arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In affirmations attached to his stay motion, Dervisevic and his attorney both assert that although Dervisevic\u2019s wife and three sons all received political asylum in the United States, the BIA erred by not considering these developments as \u201cnew facts\u201d that would permit reopening. All motions to reopen require a showing of \u201cnew facts,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); thus, simply having \u201cnew facts\u201d does not make the motion timely. Dervisevic does not otherwise address the issue of the untimeliness of his motion to reopen in his filings in this Court, nor in the motion to reopen itself, A.R. 40-41. Dervisevic does not base his motion on a change in country conditions, which could excuse an untimely filing, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); nor does he refute the BIA\u2019s finding that his motion was not \u201cjointly filed,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(iii). We can discern no other applicable basis on which Dervisevic could claim that his motion was not subject to time limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Because no substantial issue is raised by the petition for review, we will summarily deny the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">. A motion \u2018\u2018[a]greed upon by all parties and jointly filed\u201d is not subject to the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\">. We decline to consider Dervisevic\u2019s filing of August 30, 2009, which appears to be a series of exhibits without an accompanying motion or response. Dervisevic did not respond to the Clerk\u2019s noncompliance order entered November 2, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Avjm\">.Dervisevic\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
