He alleges that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We find no abuse of discretion and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">White was indicted in count one for being a convicted felon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in knowing possession of three firearms on 20 May 2008. One of these firearms, an unregistered modified Remington shotgun, formed the basis for count two. White admitted at his guilty plea hearing that he knowingly had the firearms in his vehicle when he was stopped for driving under the influence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">At the sentencing hearing, White objected to a four-level enhancement in the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) based on his alleged participation in an armed robbery and aggravated assault in Savannah, Georgia on 10 May 2008. The evidence connecting White to the latter crimes included (1) the robbery victim\u2019s identification of White from a photographic line-up; (2) the recovery of the victim\u2019s watch and cell phone from White during his 20 May 2008 arrest; and (3) a shell casing from the robbery that matched one of the pistols found in White\u2019s possession on 20 May 2008. Although a warrant for White\u2019s arrest was issued, he had not been indicted for the Savannah crimes as of his sentencing hearing in March 2009. The district court overruled White\u2019s objection to the sentencing enhancement, finding that a preponderance of the evidence showed White committed the Savannah offenses using a firearm found in his possession on 20 May 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">After disposing of the parties\u2019 objections <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the district court calculated a total offense level of 28, which yielded a revised guidelines range of 87 to 108 months of imprisonment. White apologized for his mistakes, and his attorney requested a downward variance to 51 months based on White\u2019s character, his personal history, and his conviction for a mere status offense. In response, the government requested a high-end sentence of 108 months in light of White\u2019s possession of three loaded firearms, the Savannah incident, and his prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">The district court sentenced White on each count to 96 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release, with the terms to run concurrently. The court explained that it had considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that a mid-range sentence sufficiently addressed those factors, including those of deterrence and punishment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>court further emphasized its consideration of White\u2019s prior homicide conviction, the fact that he was found in possession of a modified shotgun that could easily be stowed in a bag with other firearms, the Savannah incident, and the apparent lack of interest among state authorities in prosecuting White for his role therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On appeal, White argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court utilized unreliable and uncharged information concerning the Savannah incident to determine his sentence. White also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence on grounds that his sentence does not reflect White\u2019s personal characteristics, his difficult childhood, and his attempts to be a good parent and mentor young people. White suggests that the court focused unreasonably on punishment and deterrence, to the exclusion of other \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court consulted, considered, and properly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1190. A sentence is substantively reasonable if, considering all the circumstances, it achieves the sentencing purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See id. </em>at 1191. Although a court must consider all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it need not discuss each factor individually.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1191 n. 8. We may apply a presumption of reasonableness to sentences that fall within the guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 1190. \u201c \u2018The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Rather, reversal under the abuse-of-discretion standard requires \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. The onus of demonstrating that a sentence is unreasonable lies on the party challenging the sentence. <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Section 2K2.1(b)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines permits a four-level sentencing increase if a defendant convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm has \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov.2008). \u201cFelony offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, <em>regardless of whether a criminal charge ivas brought, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>or a conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(C)) (emphasis added). Moreover, we have stated that a court may \u201cconsider relevant facts concerning a defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct when imposing a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). This includes consideration of a defendant\u2019s uncharged criminal acts so long as those acts are proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1294-95 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in considering defendant\u2019s alleged conspiracy to commit bank robbery); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We find no procedural error in the district court\u2019s calculation of White\u2019s sentence based on its consideration of the Savannah incident. As the record shows, the district court properly found by a preponderance of the evidence that White committed the Savannah armed robbery and aggravated assault using a firearm involved in the instant case. Not only did the Georgia Bureau of Investigation match a shell casing found at the scene of the Savannah incident to one of the pistols found in White\u2019s possession, but White was also identified by the victim and had the victim\u2019s watch and cellular phone. This information was obtained by a probation officer who interviewed a Savannah police detective. Thus, contrary to White\u2019s assertion, the information linking him to the incident was reliable and substantiated by the record. The fact that White had not yet been indicted for the Savannah offenses did not preclude the court\u2019s consideration of this incident. <em>See Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d at 1294. Accordingly, the district court correctly increased White\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">White has also failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. First, because his sentence fell within the guidelines range, it is subject to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. Second, we find no support for White\u2019s assertion that the district court paid little attention to White\u2019s personal characteristics. A \u201cdistrict court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d; it is not required to explicitly discuss each one. <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the district court satisfied this requirement by expressly stating that it had considered the various factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Although the court did not mention the mitigating factors suggested by White, such as his difficult upbringing or efforts at reform, the fact that the court rejected the government\u2019s request to sentence White at the high end of his guidelines range indicates that the court weighed these factors in fashioning White\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that the court\u2019s failure to discuss mitigating evidence did not mean that the <em>court </em>erroneously ignored this evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Finally, we disagree with White\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s concern with the Savannah incident resulted in a misunderstanding of the instant offense and an exclusive focus on punishing and deterring White. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832 (quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). Given White\u2019s criminal history, which included second-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>degree murder with a firearm and armed robbery with a firearm, the court did not place undue weight on White\u2019s similar use of a firearm in the Savannah offenses. Furthermore, the court\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of other facts, such as White\u2019s prior murder conviction and his possession of a modified shotgun and other firearms in a gym bag. These facts pertain to \u00a7 3553(a)(l)\u2019s consideration of the history of the defendant as well as the nature and circumstances of the instant offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). White has not shown that the district court made a clear error in judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. Accordingly, we conclude that White\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Based on the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion in White\u2019s sentence. The district court committed no procedural error in enhancing White\u2019s sentence based on his uncharged conduct in Savannah. The court also properly weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a reasonable sentence in the middle of White\u2019s advisory guidelines range. We therefore AFFIRM White\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\">.
