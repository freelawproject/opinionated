Hooks became involved in an undercover law enforcement operation where an officer used the persona of a 13-year-old girl in an online chatroom. Hooks, using the name \u201csuperfreak2096,\u201d chatted with \u201cKaitlyn\u201d (a.k.a. Duncan Her-rington, Project Safe Childhood task force) and set up a meeting for sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">On appeal, Hooks argues that, based his testimony regarding the age Kaitlyn looked in a photograph the undercover officer sent to him, as well as his own testimony regarding his intention not to have sex with anyone underage, it was unreasonable for the jury to find him guilty of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds where, as here, the issue is preserved below. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>438 F.3d 1307, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(en banc). </em>The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005). We must affirm the convictions unless the jury could not have found, under any reasonable construction of the evidence, the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, when a defendant chooses to testify, it is the jury\u2019s prerogative to either believe or disbelieve his testimony. <em>United States v. Sharif, </em>893 F.2d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) traveled to another state; (2) for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct; (3) with just a person under 18 years old. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) and (f). A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) requires proof that the defendant \u201cusing the internet [or a cellular telephone], acted with a specific intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in unlawful sex.\u201d <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir.2004); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Hooks\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The evidence showed that Hooks traveled from Mississippi to Alabama to meet Kaitlyn; that the recorded chats indicate that Hooks thought Kaitlyn was 13 years old; and that Hooks asked Kaitlyn to have sex with him. Furthermore, there is no dispute that Hooks used a computer and cell phone to engage in unlawful sex. Accordingly, we affirm Hooks\u2019s convictions because under a reasonable construction of the evidence a jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
