Norman appeals his sentence of 24 months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release imposed upon revocation of his supervised release. Norman contends that the district court erred when it determined that he committed a Grade A violation of his supervised release because the court failed to determine the value of the property involved in his supervised release violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-23\">There are three grades of supervised release violations. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7Bl.l(a) (Nov. 2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The grade of a supervised release violation, in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s criminal history category, determines the range of imprisonment applicable under the guidelines upon revocation of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Grade A violations, which are the most serious ones, include \u201cany ... federal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding twenty years.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Florida law divides the offenses of grand theft and organized fraud into degrees based on the amount of property obtained. The degree of the crime controls the severity of the punishment. Under Florida law, if a person steals property \u201cvalued at $100,000 or more,\u201d he commits \u201cgrand theft in the first degree.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.014(2)(a). Florida law provides for a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment for anyone convicted of grand theft in the first degree. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(b). A person commits organized fraud in the first degree under Florida law when he \u201cengages in a scheme to defraud and obtains property thereby ... [i]f the amount of property obtained has an aggregate value of $50,000 or more.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.034(4)(a)(l). Like grand theft in the first degree, organized fraud in the first degree is punishable by a maximum term of 30 years in prison. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(b). Both grand theft in the first degree and organized fraud in the first degree, as defined by Florida law, qualify as Grade A violations under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), upon finding [by a preponderance of the evidence] that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering the specific factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). The district court concluded that Norman committed a Grade A violation of his supervised release. This conclusion, when coupled with Norman\u2019s criminal history category I, resulted in a recommended guideline sentence of twelve to eighteen months. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201c[A] district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (same). The district court then considered factors laid out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before sentencing Norman to 24 months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (after determining the appropriate range under the guidelines, a district court must consider factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing a reasonable sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Norman contends that the district court erred when it found that he committed a Grade A violation of his supervised release without determining the value of the property involved in the violation. He emphasizes that Florida law divides the crimes of grand theft and organized fraud into degrees, with each degree having a corresponding statutory maximum punishment, based on the value of the property involved in the crime. He also notes that the grade of a supervised release violation depends on the length of imprisonment authorized to punish the crime constituting the violation. According to Norman, this means that a court cannot determine the grade of a supervised release violation taking the form of Florida law grand theft or organized fraud without making a finding as to the specific value of the property involved in the violation. Norman argues that the district court\u2019s failure to make such a finding requires that his sentence be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Norman leans heavily on the following statement made by the district court: \u201cI will not today and do not today engage in a precise figure. It is very difficult to do that. But I am well satisfied that Norman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>was stealing money[ ] from the company.\u201d Norman places more weight on that statement than it can bear. By contrast, he gives no weight to the district court\u2019s statement that \u201c[Norman\u2019s violation] is an A violation, the amount of moneys stolen well in excess of $100,000.00 and accordingly I am ready to impose a sentence in this regard.\u201d The district court\u2019s factual finding that the amount of money stolen by Norman totaled well in excess of $100,000 was not clearly erroneous. The record provides ample support for it. There is evidence of $212,941.96 in fraudulent online transactions alone. On top of that hefty sum, the record contains evidence that Norman forged checks on two different bank accounts in amounts totaling $59,283.46 and $13,487.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Based on its factual finding that Norman\u2019s violation involved well over $100,000 and therefore qualified as a felony in the first degree under Florida law, the district court concluded that Norman committed a Grade A violation and calculated the guidelines range accordingly. Because the factual findings underlying its calculations are not clearly erroneous, the district court did not improperly calculate the applicable guidelines range. Norman\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable. Because Norman\u2019s contention that his sentence is substantively unreasonable is based on his failed argument that the district court improperly determined that he committed a Grade A violation, it too fails. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-15\">. Norman's original sentence of supervised release was imposed under the 2000 guidelines. The district court did not specify which year\u2019s guidelines it used in imposing the sentence challenged in this appeal. Norman cites the 2007 guidelines in his brief to this Court. In any event, the provisions of the guidelines material to this appeal are the same in 2007 as they were in 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
