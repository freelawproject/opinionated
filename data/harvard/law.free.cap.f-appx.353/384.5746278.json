No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-24\">Defendant contends that the district court erred in the calculation of his guideline sentence when it applied a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(E) based on three or more earlier convictions for misdemeanor drug-trafficking offenses. With the enhancement, the guidelines range was 10 to 16 months. According to Defendant, some of the state-court drug convictions used to support the enhancement were obtained without the assistance of counsel or an interpreter. The district court overruled Defendant\u2019s objections to the application of the four-level section 2L1.2(b)(l)(E) enhancement; a within guidelines range sentence of 12 months was imposed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-26\">At sentencing, the district court stated: [I]f I have calculated the sentencing guidelines incorrectly by applying the misdemeanor offense when it should not be applied, the Court would still find that a 12-month sentence is a reasonable sentence considering all of the factors I just set forth [defendant\u2019s repeated violations of the law and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>peated illegal reentries], his likelihood of recidivism and apparent unwillingness to abide by the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We review the district court\u2019s guidelines interpretation <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005). Where \u2014 as is the case here\u2014 the district court states that it would have imposed the same sentence irrespective of the disputed guidelines calculation, we need not resolve the guideline issue if the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. And \u201c[i]n determining whether it is reasonable we must assume that there was a guidelines error \u2014 that the guidelines issue should have been decided in the way the defendant argued and the advisory range reduced accordingly \u2014 and then ask whether the final sentence resulting from consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors would still be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in deciding whether and the extent to which a variance is appropriate under the section 3553(a) factors; and we must accord the district court\u2019s decision \u201cdue deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). We may vacate a sentence on the basis of a variance only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Had the district court decided the enhancement issue in Defendant\u2019s favor, the advisory guidelines range would have been two to eight months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The 12-month sentence imposed represented a four-month upward variance from the high end of the guidelines range and was well below the statutory maximum of ten years. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (considering statutory maximum in the course of reasonableness assessment). The district court supported the variance by reference to Defendant\u2019s recidivism and apparent unwillingness to abide by the law. The justifications cited by the district court amply support the four-month upward variance imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">If there was a misapplication of the section 2L1.2(b)(l)(E) enhancement, \u201cthe error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992); the error was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">. Even after factoring out all four of the offenses that Defendant claims should not be considered in calculating his sentence (three misdemeanor drug convictions and one trespass conviction), Defendant's criminal history category was III \u2014 not II as Defendant mistakenly calculates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. Undisputed prior convictions and orders of removal from the United States on at least three occasions before the instant offense, support the district court\u2019s conclusions about likely recidivism and apparent unwillingness to abide by the law. <em>See United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.) (district court may rely on undisputed statements found in the PSI), <em>cert. </em>denied-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 272, 175 L.Ed.2d 183 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
