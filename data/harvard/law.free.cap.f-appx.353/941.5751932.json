He was sentenced to 240 months of imprisonment on the crack cocaine offense and 60 months of imprisonment on the firearm offense, to run consecutively for a total of 300 months of imprisonment. Robinson now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a sentencing reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the United States Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Commission\u2019s amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Robinson argues that he is eligible for resentencing under the recent amendment; his amended guidelines range of imprisonment is advisory; the district court\u2019s refusal to change his base offense level prejudiced him \u201cregardless of any change in his sentence;\u201d and his initial sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a sentencing range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Robinson\u2019s 240-month sentence was the statutory minimum sentence available under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)(A) because Robinson had a prior felony drug conviction. His sentence cannot be further reduced based on a guideline amendment. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 411 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 212, 172 L.Ed.2d 157 (2008) (holding that district courts may not sentence below statutory minimum absent Government motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) or defendant\u2019s meeting criteria of \u00a7 3553(f)); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)(ii)). Robinson has not has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a sentencing reduction. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
