The district court ruled that Bank of America had to use an interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal to calculate the adjustable interest rate for Kaplan\u2019s promissory note. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">In 2003, Kaplan obtained from Bank of America an adjustable rate mortgage. The promissory note stated that the Bank would adjust Kaplan\u2019s interest rate yearly beginning on May 1, 2008. Kaplan\u2019s adjustable interest rate was calculated using the \u201cCurrent Index,\u201d which was defined as \u201cTHE MOST RECENT INDEX FIGURE AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE 45 DAYS BEFORE EACH\u201d first day of May. The note defined the Index as \u201cTHE ONE-YEAR LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) ... AS PUBLISHED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.\u201d The Interbank Rate is set every business day by the British Bankers\u2019 Association in London, England, and transmitted worldwide by online service companies. The Wall Street Journal publishes the Interbank Rate from the previous business day.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">In March 2008, Bank of America notified Kaplan of his new adjusted interest rate, which was \u201cbased on a current index of 2.51250 %, which was published on 3-15-08.\u201d The Interbank Rate used by the Bank was set by the Bankers\u2019 Association on Friday, March 14, 2008, and published in The Wall Street Journal on both Saturday, March 15, 2008, and Monday, March 17, 2008. Kaplan\u2019s interest rate had to be based on the Interbank Rate \u201cas of the date 45 days before\u201d May 1, 2008, or on March 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">Kaplan filed a complaint that Bank of America breached its mortgage contract by using the wrong Interbank Rate to calculate his mortgage payments. Kaplan argued that the term \u201cCurrent Index\u201d had been defined independent of and had to be interpreted separately from the term \u201cIndex.\u201d Based on this reasoning, Kaplan argued that his interest rate was based on \u201cthe most recent Index figure available\u201d from, or set by, the Bankers\u2019 Association on March 17, 2008, which was 2.17813 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">Bank of America moved for summary judgment. The Bank argued that the note stated Kaplan\u2019s interest rate was based on the Interbank Rate published in The Wall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Street Journal on March 17, 2008. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment should be entered when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Kaplan argues that the plain language of the promissory note required that Bank of America use the Interbank Rate set by the Bankers\u2019 Association on March 17, 2008, but that is not a plausible reading of the note. Kaplan\u2019s argument requires that we read the term \u201cCurrent Index\u201d independent of the term \u201cIndex,\u201d but \u201c[ejvery word in [an] agreement must be taken to have been used for a purpose, and no word should be rejected as mere surplusage if the court can discover any reasonable purpose thereof which can be gathered from the whole instrument.\u201d <em>Bayshore Ford Truck Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>380 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.2004). The note provides that the \u201cCurrent Index\u201d is computed using the \u201cIndex figure available\u201d on March 17, 2008, which is the Interbank Rate as \u201cpublished in the Wall Street Journal.\u201d The note provides that Kaplan\u2019s adjustable interest rate is based on the Interbank Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on March 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The summary judgment in favor of Bank of America is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
