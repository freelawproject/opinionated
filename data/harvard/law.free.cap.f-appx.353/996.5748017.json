After the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, he did not seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Instead, in November 2008, he filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion seeking to vacate his convictions and sentences on due process grounds. The district court denied relief without providing reasons. Murphy has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-20\">We are unable to discern whether the district court construed Murphy\u2019s pleading as sounding under Rule 60(b) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and also unable to determine the basis on which the court denied relief. Rather than speculate on the district court\u2019s reasoning, we hold the appeal in abeyance and remand the matter to the district court for the entry of reasons consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">APPEAL HELD IN ABEYANCE; LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
