Burrell, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil action for violations of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, disability benefits under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), and state law claims for fraud and interference with contractual rights. On appeal, Burrell argues that the Teacher\u2019s Retirement System of Alabama (TRSA) violated ERISA and other federal laws by modifying his wife\u2019s retirement benefits after her death. He also asserts that the district court violated his due-process rights by dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Castro v. Sec\u2019y of Homeland Sec., </em>472 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d <em>Williams v. Dist. Bd. of </em>Trs. <em>of Edison Cmty. Coll., </em>421 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cThe Eleventh Amendment protects a State from being sued in federal court without the State\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Manders v. Lee, </em>338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAlthough the express language of the [Eleventh] [A]mendment does not bar suits against a state by its own citizens, the Supreme Court has held that an un-consenting state is immune from lawsuits brought in federal court by the state\u2019s own citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308 n. 8 (quoting <em>Carr v. City of Florence, </em>916 F.2d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir.1990)). \u201cIt is also well-settled that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars suits brought in federal court when ... an \u2018arm of the State\u2019 is sued.\u201d <em>Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1308. \u201cTo receive Eleventh Amendment immunity, a defendant need not be labeled a \u2018state officer\u2019 or \u2018state official,\u2019 but instead need only be acting as an \u2018arm of the State,\u2019 which includes agents and instrumentalities of the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Although Burrell asserts that the district court denied his due-process rights by dismissing his complaint, he does not argue that it erred by finding that his federal claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. (See <em>generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Br). Moreover, he does not argue that the district court erred by dismissing his supplemental state law claims, failing to convert the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment after he submitted additional documents with his amended complaint, or failing to rule on his motion to amend. (See <em>generally id.). </em>Thus, these issues should be deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>See Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that issues not briefed on appeal by <em>pro se </em>litigants are deemed abandoned on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Regardless, the district court did not err in dismissing his federal claims based on Eleventh Amendment immunity because TRSA is an instrumentality of the state as provided by Ala.Code \u00a7 16-25-2(b). <em>See Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1308-09; <em>see also Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2310, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (noting that Congress did not abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity with the passage of \u00a7 1983). Although Burrell\u2019s complaint requested \u201cequitable relief,\u201d he did not request any prospective equitable relief to end continuing violations of federal law. <em>See Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, </em>180 F.3d 1326, 1336 (11th Cir.1999) (recognizing an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity \u201cfor suits against state officers seeking <em>'prospective </em>equitable relief and to end <em>continuing </em>violations of federal law\u201d). Burrell\u2019s due-process argument also fails because he did not raise the issue below. <em>See Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cArguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this Court.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
