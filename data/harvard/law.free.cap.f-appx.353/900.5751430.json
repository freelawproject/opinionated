She argues that the district court erred in (1) applying the obstruction-of-justiee adjustment, (2) denying the acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment, and (3) denying a minor-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The district court did not plainly err in enhancing Torres\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice because she impeded the administration of justice by failing to comply with the conditions of her release and failing to appear at a judicial hearing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(e)); <em>United States v. Ronquillo, </em>508 F.3d 744, 748 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2458, 171 L.Ed.2d 253 (2008). In addition, the district court\u2019s ruling denying a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not without foundation because Torres failed to comply with the conditions of her release and failed to appear at a judicial hearing. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003). Finally, the district court did not clearly err in denying the minor-role adjustment because courier status does not automatically entitle Torres to minor participant status. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 434 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
