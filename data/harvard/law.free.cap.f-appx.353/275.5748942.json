Register, III, Edwin F.

First, he contends that the district court sentenced him without adequately considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), and failed to give an adequate explanation for the sentence it imposed. Second, he contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable under the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the ease of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose a new sentence under the recalculated guideline range or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. When considering whether and to what extent a reduction is warranted, the district court shall consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and public safety concerns, and it may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)). \u201c[A] district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability-if any-of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that the district court adequately considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and provided an adequate explanation for the sentence it imposed on Taylor. We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in reducing Taylor\u2019s sentence to 270 months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, we affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
