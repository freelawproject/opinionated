Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a sentence reduction because, even though the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) found him responsible for 53 kilograms of cocaine base, he was sentenced based on a broader finding of only 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base, so Amendment 706 reduced his guideline range. He also argues that his due process rights were violated, and that Amendment 706 preserves the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368. \u201cUnder Amendment 706, the guidelines now provide a base offense level of 36 for defendants who are responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1369; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). \u201cHowever, a base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). Thus, if a defendant is responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not reduce his applicable guideline range. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. A defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if his guideline range is not reduced by a guideline amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">The district court properly denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 did not affect his guideline range. Because the sentencing court held Rodriguez accountable for the conspiracy\u2019s estimated distribution of 53 kilograms of cocaine base, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s denial of Rodriguez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not violate his due process rights because the court was required to preserve the original sentencing determinations, and Rodriguez had the opportunity to contest the drug amount at his original sentencing. Lastly, this appeal is not the proper forum to contest the Sentencing Commission\u2019s manner of implementing Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
