Goo-den then brought this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-19\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\">Gooden, a Muslim inmate confined to a unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\u201cTDCJ\u201d), brought this suit alleging that TDCJ\u2019s grooming policy, which prohibits all inmates from wearing beax'ds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>unless they have a medical exception, violated his rights under RLUIPA. Specifically, Gooden argues that the grooming policy substantially burdened his ability to exercise his faith by preventing him from wearing a beard as his faith demands. In order to satisfy the demands of his faith, Gooden brought this suit and sought in-junctive relief to allow him to wear a quarter-inch beard.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Gooden consented to a bench trial of his RLUIPA claim before a magistrate judge. After trial, the judge found that the grooming policy \u201cimposes a substantial burden on [Gooden\u2019s] exercise of his religious beliefs.\u201d <em>Gooden v. Crain, </em>No. 6:04-cv-00127, 2008 WL 3271557, *13 (E.D.Tex. Aug.6, 2008). However, she also found that Appellees had not violated RLUIPA and entered judgment in their favor because the policy was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest in security of prisoners. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Under RLUIPA, \u201c[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of [an inmate] ... unless the <em>government demonstrates </em>that imposition of the burden on that person' \u2014 (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that ... interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The trial court entered judgment for Appellees, because it found that they had proved that the grooming policy was the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental interest, namely TDCJ\u2019s interest in security. Gooden challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions in support of this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">\u201cThe standard of review for a bench trial is well established: findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Kona Tech. Coup, v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>225 F.3d 595, 601 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">\n<em>B. Compelling Governmental Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Arb\">Gooden challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that the grooming policy furthers TDCJ\u2019s compelling governmental interest in security.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellees had the burden of proving that the grooming policy furthered a compelling government interest. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc-l, 2000cc-2(b) (stating that the government bears the burden of persuasion on every element of a RLUIPA claim except substantial burden). To meet their burden of proof, Appellees only had \u201c \u2018to take the unremarkable step of providing an explanation for the policy\u2019s restrictions that takes into account [their] institutional need to maintain good order, security, and discipline or to control costs.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith v. Ozmint, </em>578 F.3d 246, 252 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Lovelace v. Lee, </em>472 F.3d 174, 190 (4th Cir.2006)). Courts are required to apply the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d analysis with \u201c \u2018due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cutter v. Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 723, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (quoting 146 Cong. Rec. 16699 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">According to the trial court, the grooming policy furthers TDCJ\u2019s interest in security because it allows TDCJ to accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>rately identify inmates and it eliminates the threat that \u201ccontraband and weapons\u201d could be carried in beards. <em>Gooden, </em>2008 WL 3271557 at *13. Gooden challenges both the court\u2019s factual findings and the court\u2019s conclusion, based on those findings, that the grooming policy furthers TDCJ\u2019s compelling interest in security.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The trial court\u2019s findings of facts regarding TDCJ\u2019s identification and contraband concerns are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. William Stephens, a regional director for TDCJ, testified that inmates are identified by their clean-shaven photos on their prison identification cards, and the grooming policy, which requires inmates to be clean-shaven, allows correctional officers to easily identify inmates based on their photos. Director Stephens testified that identification furthers the goal of security by allowing correctional officers to ensure that inmates do not enter areas of the prison where they do not belong, which prevents problems such as theft and the extortion of other inmates. He also testified that identification furthers public safety concerns, because beards would make it difficult to quickly identify and recapture inmates if they escape. In addition, Director Stephens testified that weapons, like razor blades, and contraband, such as handcuff keys, could be secreted in beards. This testimony by Director Stephens shows that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are substantially supported by the record, so its findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>Water Craft Mgmt. LLC v. Mercury Marine, </em>457 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir.2006) (stating \u201c[c]lear error exists if ... the findings are without substantial evidence to support them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The court\u2019s factual findings, based on the testimony of Director Stephens, show that the grooming policy is related to and furthers TDCJ\u2019s interest in security; therefore, the trial court did not err in finding that Appellees met their burden in proving that the grooming policy furthers a compelling governmental interest. <em>See Fegans v. Norris, </em>537 F.3d 897, 906 (8th Cir.2008) (finding that a similar grooming policy furthered the government\u2019s interest in security because it was related to identification and contraband concerns); <em>see also Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 125 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a policy furthered a compelling interest when the government proved that it was related to maintaining good order and controlling costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">\n<em>C. Least Restrictive Means</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Gooden also challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that TDCJ\u2019s grooming policy is the least restrictive means of achieving its interest in security. Gooden asserts that TDCJ\u2019s interest in security could be furthered by a grooming policy that provides a religious exception for quarter-inch beards. Appellees had the burden of disproving Gooden\u2019s assertion by explaining \u201cwhy [his] alternative [policy] would be unfeasible, or why [it] would be less effective in maintaining institutional security.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc-1, 2000cc-2; <em>Spratt v. R.I. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>482 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir.2007); <em>see Sossamon v. Texas, </em>560 F.3d 316, 335 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cSome of these options might not prove feasible.... \u201d); <em>Hamilton v. Schriro, </em>74 F.3d 1545, 1556 (8th Cir.1996) (interpreting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which used the same test as RLUIPA, as requiring the government to refute alternatives suggested by a plaintiff). The trial court found that Appellees satisfied the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d prong by demonstrating that Gooden\u2019s suggested alternative was not administratively or financially feasible. <em>Gooden, </em>2008 WL 3271557 at *13.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The trial court found that a quarter-inch beard religious exception would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>feasible, because it would require the prison to \u201chave to build additional barber shops in order to allow Muslim inmates to use clipper shavers.... The process of issuing clipper shave passes ... would also place an additional burden on chaplains, who are already burdened by the strain of their administrative duties at the expense of their ministerial duties.\u201d <em>Gooden, </em>2008 WL 3271557 at *13. Gooden offered no contrary testimony. Thus, some evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the exception would not be feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Even if we found that the evidence did not support this finding, the court\u2019s findings of fact show that Appellees proved that such an exception \u201cwould be less effective in maintaining institutional security.\u201d <em>Spratt, </em>482 F.3d at 41. The trial judge did not expressly use this language in her opinion, but this conclusion can be fairly inferred from her findings and her decision to deny relief. It is a firmly established rule that this court may \u201c \u2018affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any grounds supported by the record,\u2019 \u201d even if \u201cour affirmance is upon grounds not relied upon by the district court.\u201d <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (stating that a \u201cdecision of a [district] court ... must be affirmed if the result is correct\u201d and if there are no additional findings of fact to be made); <em>Sobranes Recovery Pool I, LLC v. Todd &amp; Hughes Constr. Corp., </em>509 F.3d 216, 221 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992)); <em>Foreman v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., </em>117 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">As stated earlier, there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the accurate identification of inmates based on their clean-shaven photos furthers TDCJ\u2019s interest in security, because accurate identification allows correctional officers to ensure that inmates are not out of place and it assists in the recapture of escapees. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B. In addition to these findings, the court found that granting Muslim inmates the right to wear \u201cone-fourth inch beards\u201d would \u201cmake[ ] identification more difficult.\u201d <em>Gooden, </em>2008 WL 3271557 at *13. Again, Gooden offers little in the way of response to this point, other than to note that some inmates are given a medical exception to the policy and that the policy is not always uniformly enforced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The trial court\u2019s finding that quarter-inch beards would increase the difficulty of identifying inmates is not clearly erroneous because it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Water Craft Mgmt. LLC, </em>457 F.3d at 488. Director Stephens testified that if inmates were allowed to grow quarter-inch beards, they could resemble other inmates and use their identification cards to get into areas of the prison where they do not belong. He also testified that quarter-inch beards would make it harder for correctional officers to identify inmates when transferring them within the prison. Finally, Director Stephens testified that, in his opinion, the \u201csecurity concepts ... outweigh the fact of allowing everybody [to walk] around with a quarter inch beard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The trial court\u2019s findings of fact show that Appellees, based on this evidence, proved that an exception for quarter-inch beards would be less effective in maintaining prison security, because such beards would make identification more difficult.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Since Appellees met their burden, the trial court did not err in denying Gooden relief in this case upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Ap-pellees. Accordingly, Gooden\u2019s motion for injunctive and declaratory relief is DENIED. Gooden\u2019s motion to appoint appellate counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b912-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-21\">. Gooden has moved for appointment of appellate counsel. However, he has not demonstrated the sort of exceptional circumstances that permit appointment of such counsel. See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\">. We have held that \"security\u201d is a compelling governmental interest, and Gooden does not contest that \"security\u201d is a compelling governmental interest. <em>Diaz v. Collins, </em>114 F.3d 69, 73 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe agree with our colleagues in the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits that a prison regulation on hair length is related to security and, as such, involves a compelling state interest.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. Thus, we make no broad holding that the grooming policy, as it applies to quarter-inch beards, will always be upheld. Our decision is based solely upon the evidence presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b915-12\">. While we have observed that \"the identification problem\u201d posed by beards generally \"would be significantly reduced\u201d in the context of quarter-inch beards, we did not deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>mine that quarter-inch beards must always be permitted. <em>Green v. Polunsky, </em>229 F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.2000). On the record here, we cannot hold that the trial court\u2019s findings were \"clearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
