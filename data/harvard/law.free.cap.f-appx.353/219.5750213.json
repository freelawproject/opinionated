On appeal, Vesy argues that: (1) the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) assessment of her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) is not supported by substantial evidence; (2) substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit her subjective testimony concerning her symptoms; (3) the ALJ failed to adequately develop the administrative record; and (4) the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) failed to include all of her impairments. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">In a social security case, we review the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983). We do not \u201cdecide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence we must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996). We review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">First, we disagree with Vesy\u2019s argument that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is not supported by substantial evidence. The Social Security regulations establish a five-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>step sequential process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. Under the first two steps, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity, and whether the claimant has a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(b) and (c). Under the third step, the ALJ must decide whether the claimant\u2019s impairments meet or medically equal a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(d). If the claimant has a severe impairment that does not meet or equal a listed impairment, the ALJ must then determine whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(e) and (f). \u201c[R]esidual functional capacity is an assessment, based upon all of the relevant evidence, of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite his impairments.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545. If the claimant cannot perform her past relevant work, the ALJ must then determine whether the claimant may perform other work that exists in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Generally, the opinion of a treating physician \u201cmust be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. \u201cWhen electing to disregard the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate [his] reasons.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We have found good cause for disregarding a treating physician\u2019s opinion where: \u201c(1) [the] treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2)[the] evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3)[the] treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In this case, the ALJ conducted a review of all of the medical evidence in the record, and his RFC assessment is supported by the medical evidence. As an initial matter, in determining Vesy\u2019s exertional impairments, the ALJ relied primarily on the opinions of Drs. Johnson and Seo. Dr. Johnson reported that Vesy was limited by fatigue and arthralgia, but could sit or stand for up to 6 hours in an 8-hour workday, and could lift and carry up to 15 pounds. Similarly, Dr. Seo found that Vesy could sit or stand for 30 minutes without interruption, was able to walk for a few blocks, and could lift and carry up to 20 pounds. Because Dr. Johnson was a long-term treating rheumatologist, the ALJ properly gave significant weight to her opinion. <em>See Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. Moreover, Dr. Johnson\u2019s and Dr. Seo\u2019s assessments were consistent with the medical evidence in the record, which suggested that Vesy retained the ability to perform a limited range of light work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We also find no support for Vesy\u2019s argument that Dr. Pollack\u2019s report \u2014 which concluded that her examination of Vesy was \u201cessentially unremarkable,\u201d and that Vesy did not have any exertional limitations\u2014 failed to properly consider her fibromyal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>gia and IBS symptoms, and, therefore, should not have been considered by the ALJ. Indeed, Dr. Pollack did note that Vesy had a history of IBS, Lyme Disease, and knee and back pain. She simply concluded that those conditions did not cause any exertional impairments. And in any event, it does not appear that the ALJ placed great reliance on Dr. Pollack\u2019s assessment, as the ALJ found that Vesy did, in fact, have exertional impairments that restricted her to a limited range of light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As for Vesy\u2019s claim that the ALJ should not have relied upon the functional capacity evaluation of Dr. Ilkay, the ALJ\u2019s written opinion noted that Dr. Ilkay\u2019s opinion was \u201cobviously limited to a urological standpoint only.\u201d Thus, it does not appear that the ALJ gave significant weight to Dr. Ilkay\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Vesy also argues that the ALJ should have given more weight to the opinion of Dr. Sell, a treating physician, who concluded that she: (1) could not sit or stand for more than 1 hour in an 8-hour work day; (2) could occasionally or never lift or carry items weighing less than ten pounds; (3) could not push or pull with either arm; (4) could occasionally reach above shoulder level, but could never bend, squat, kneel, or crawl. However, Dr. Sell\u2019s assessment was inconsistent with the opinions of Drs. Johnson and Seo. In addition, although Dr. Sell\u2019s treatment notes indicated that he treated Vesy for lower back pain, fibromyalgia, and IBS, they did not suggest that Vesy was limited to the extent found by Dr. Sell in his functional capacity evaluation. Therefore, the ALJ was not required to give significant weight to Dr. Sell\u2019s opinion. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Further, although Vesy argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment should have included non-exertional limitations, the medical evidence does not reveal any non-exertional impairments that affected Vesy\u2019s ability to work. Vesy testified that her IBS caused diarrhea and vomiting, which required her to take frequent bathroom breaks. But Drs. Bernstein, Vogt-land, and Sell reported that Vesy\u2019s IBS was controlled when she was taking Fiber-Con. And while Vesy suffered from pain, fatigue, and stiffness caused by arthralgia and fibromyalgia, Dr. Johnson concluded that those symptoms did not affect her ability to perform light duty work. As a result, the ALJ did not have to include any non-exertional symptoms in his RFC assessment. For all of these reasons, the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">We likewise find no merit in Vesy\u2019s claim that the ALJ erred by declining to credit her subjective testimony concerning her symptoms. In a case where a claimant attempts to establish disability through his or her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective systems, we apply a three-part \u201cpain standard.\u201d <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cThe pain standard requires (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (2) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition or (3) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">If the ALJ decides not to credit a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony, \u201che must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the ALJ fails to articulate reasons for discrediting the claimant\u2019s testimony, then that testimony must be accepted as true. <em>Id. </em>In evaluating a claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ant\u2019s credibility, the ALJ may consider, among other things, the claimant\u2019s daily activities and the \u201ctype, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects\u201d of any medication that the claimant uses to relieve her symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i), (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Here, the ALJ found that Vesy\u2019s subjective testimony regarding the frequency and intensity of her symptoms could not be fully credited because it was inconsistent with Vesy\u2019s daily activities and with the medical evidence. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s reasoning is consistent with the evidence in the record, and as a result, his credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Further, because Vesy\u2019s subjective testimony was inconsistent with the record, the ALJ\u2019s error in noting that Vesy had not requested any bathroom breaks during the hearing when she had in fact requested and received one break was harmless. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that an ALJ\u2019s factual error is harmless if it does not affect the ALJ\u2019s conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Next, we reject Vesy\u2019s argument that the ALJ failed to properly develop the administrative record by ordering additional consultative examinations, re-contacting Drs. Seo and Sell for clarification of their functional capacity assessments, and making an inquiry into whether side effects from her medications contributed to her disability. In a social security case, the ALJ has an affirmative duty to develop a full and fan record. <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 931, 934 (11th Cir.1995). This obligation applies regardless of whether the claimant is represented by counsel, but it rises to the level of a special duty when the claimant is unrepresented. <em>Id. </em>at 934-35. Nevertheless, the ALJ\u2019s obligation to develop the record does not relieve the claimant of the burden of proving that she is disabled. <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). Consequently, it is the claimant\u2019s responsibility to introduce evidence in support of her application for benefits. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether it is necessary to remand a case for development of the record, we consider \u201cwhether the record reveals evidentiary gaps which result in unfairness of clear prejudice.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>44 F.3d at 935 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>the claimant, who was unrepresented at the hearing but had not waived her right to counsel, testified that she was taking a number of medications which caused her to be \u201ckind of zonked most of the time.\u201d 662 F.2d 731, 737 (11th Cir.1981). Based on those facts, we held that the ALJ had a duty to investigate the side effects of the claimant\u2019s medications and to determine whether those side effects had an impact on her ability to work. <em>Id. </em>Yet, we have also held that the ALJ need not inquire into the side effects of a claimant\u2019s medications where the claimant was represented at the hearing, and did not assert that side effects from her medications contributed to her disability. <em>Cherry v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1186, 1191 n. 7 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Under the Social Security regulations, the ALJ may order additional consultative examinations if the medical evidence submitted by the claimant does not provide enough information about an impairment to determine whether the claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.917. But the ALJ is not required to order additional examinations if the evidence in the record is sufficient to allow for an informed decision. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1269. In general, the ALJ should re-contact a medical source when the evidence received from that source is inadequate to determine whether the claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(e). Under Social Security Ruling 96-5p, the ALJ must make \u201cevery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>reasonable effort\u201d to re-contact a medical source when the medical evidence does not support the source\u2019s opinion, and the ALJ cannot ascertain the basis for that opinion from the case record. S.S.R. 96-5p (Cum. Ed.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In this case, the ALJ developed a full and fair record. Although there was some evidence that Vesy suffered from side effects caused by her medications, she did not allege that those side effects contributed to her disability and notably, was represented by counsel. As a result, the ALJ did not have a special duty to make a further inquiry into the effects of Vesy\u2019s medications. <em>See Cherry, </em>760 F.2d at 1191 n. 7. Moreover, the ALJ was not required to re-contact Drs. Seo and Sell or to order additional consultative examinations because the record already contained sufficient evidence for the ALJ to made an informed decision regarding whether Vesy was disabled. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1269. Vesy therefore has not shown any error with respect to the ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Vesy\u2019s claim that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the VE failed to include her non-exer-tional impairments. As noted above, under step five of the sequential evaluation process, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is able to perform other work that exists in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g). If the ALJ finds that the claimant is able to perform other work, he \u201cmust articulate specific jobs that the claimant is able to perform, and this finding must be supported by substantial evidence, not mere intuition or conjecture.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). One way in which the ALJ may determine whether the claimant is able to perform other jobs is by posing a hypothetical question to a VE. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical need not include a claimant\u2019s asserted impairments that are not supported by the medical evidence, or that are controlled or alleviated by medication. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">As the record shows, the ALJ\u2019s first hypothetical to the VE included all of the impairments which the ALJ found to be supported by the record. Further, the ALJ did not have to include any symptoms related to IBS because the medical evidence indicated that Vesy\u2019s IBS was being controlled through the use of FiberCon. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the ALJ properly relied upon the VE\u2019s testimony as substantial evidence to support his conclusion that Vesy could perform other work that existed in the national economy. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-5\">. As the record shows, in 1996, before the alleged disability onset date, Dr. Ekstrom placed Vesy off of work for approximately three months due to her Irritable Bowel Syndrome (\u201cIBS\u201d) symptoms, but he later allowed her to return to light duty work, with no excessive bending or lifting. Drs. Bernstein, Dadrat, and Vogtland did not identify any functional impairments caused by Vesy's IBS. The state agency physician who reviewed Vesy's application concluded that she retained the capacity to perform light work. In 2001, Dr. Fernando reported that Vesy's fibromyalgia was \"controlled,\u201d and that Vesy was able to occasionally exercise by walking or by riding a bike. Dr. Rodgers did not list any specific limitations on Vesy\u2019s ability to work in his treatment notes or medical evaluation forms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
