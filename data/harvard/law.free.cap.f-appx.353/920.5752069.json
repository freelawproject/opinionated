Adler, Bellaire, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>Before GARZA, CLEMENT, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b947-5\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Anthony Wayne Clark, federal prisoner # 87836-079, pled guilty to four counts of distribution of cocaine base, two counts of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, one count of carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, and one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. He was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C amend. 706 (2007). The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Clark argues that although he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court nevertheless had discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He also contends that a mandatory application of the policy statements set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 would violate the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court\u2019s obligation to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He further asserts that the district court erred in initially sentencing him as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">We review Clark\u2019s arguments de novo. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d.-(2009). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Eligibility for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment that lowers the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">Clark\u2019s Guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career-offender status. The district court therefore was correct in concluding that a sentence reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, Clark\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>Booker </em>is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238; <em>see also United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that issues that do not apply to retroactive Guidelines amendments are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 239 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Clark furthermore may not use his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to challenge the appropriateness of the district court\u2019s application of the career-offender enhancement in its calculation of his original sentence. As we have previously stated, \u201c[a] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995), The application of \u00a7 1B1.10 is mandatory, <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238, and \u00a7 1B1.10 requires a district court to \u201cleave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\u201d in reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED; the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED; and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
