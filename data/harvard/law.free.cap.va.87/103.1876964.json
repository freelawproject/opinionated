There is much controversy and disppte between the parties; but both sides admit and claim under the deed creating a trust, which has been set forth at length above, as the deed of William Harding, and the court is called on to construe and enforce this trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">To this end, w\u00e9 look to the terms of the deed creating the trust set forth above. The terms are for the purpose of Methodist Protestants, and for no other use' or purpose whatever. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The grant is to trustees of the Methodist Protestant Church; the trust is \u201cfor the sole and exclusive use and benefit of the religious congregation of regular orthodox Methodist Protestants which may hereafter assemble there to worship.\u201d Must the court enforce the trust according to its terms, to the end designated in the instrument creating it? It is the province of the courts to construe contracts as they are made.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">One party claims to be the persons described in the deed; the other admits that they are not, but claim that a majority of the congregation, whom they represent and claim under, have left the Methodist Protestant Church and joined the other church denomination named above, and taken the church property with them. Did the majority of the congregation have the power to alter and change the terms of the trust; if so, whence was it derived ? Certainly not from the terms of the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">These Christians could change their religious faith, had the right to go to any denomination to which their belief or choice led, and they could'take with them all property which belonged to them; but they were without power to change the character of the trust in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The question at issue here is not new in the courts of this Commonwealth, and cannot be said to be an open question in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In the case of <em>Boxwell </em>v. <em>Affleck, </em>79 Va. Rep., 407, this court, citing with approval <em>Hoskinson </em>v. <em>Pusey, </em>32 Gratt., 431, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">\u201cThis court has said upon a similar question, in <em>Hoskinson </em>v. <em>Pusey: </em>The deed is the same in substance as the deed in <em>Brooke </em>v. <em>Shacklett, 13 </em>Gratt., 301, and the construction must be the same. According .to that construction, the conveyance is not for the use of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in a general sense\u2014such a conveyance in this State would be void; but it is a conveyance for the use of the particular congregation of that church, in the limited and local sense of the term\u2014that is, for the members, as such, of the congregation of the Methodist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Episcopal Church who, from their residence at or near the place of public worship, may be expected to use it for that purpose. Such a conveyance is valid under our statutes. See Code 1873, ch. 78, sec. 8. Who are the beneficiaries entitled to the control and use of the church building? Looking to the deed alone, the answer would be: Those who are members of the congregation or local society, and, as such, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In this case the appellees do not claim to belong to the Methodist Protestant Church at all, but they claim that a majority of the congregation has decided to belong to a different denomination altogether, and they no longer answer the requisites of the trust; and they, under the terms of the deed, can claim no benefit under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Who, then, are the <em>cestuis que trust </em>under .the deed in question\u2014the beneficiaries entitled to the trust estate? Looking to the deed alone, the answer would be those who are members of the congregation or local society, and, as such, members of the Methodist Protestant Church. Opinion of Burks, J., in <em>Hoskinson </em>v. <em>Pusey, </em>32 Gratt., 431. And again, according to the test applied in <em>Deu </em>v. <em>Batton, </em>7th Halst. (N. J.), 215, cited with approval in the opinion of Judge Daniel, in <em>Brooke </em>v. <em>Shacklett, supra, </em>\u201cto constitute a member of any church, two points at least are essential, without meaning to say that others archpot so\u2014a profession of its faith and a submission to its government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In this case, as in that, questions are raised as to the membership of these persons; but it is clear that, although few, they are members of that church and congregation professing that faith and a submission to that government. Professing its faith, they receive its pastors, and submit to its discipline and government.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">But the appellees make no such claim. They profess to adhere to a different denomination, and deny the government and discipline of the Methodist Protestant Church, and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>banded their church society, so far as they could do so, rather than submit to it; and, at the least, abandoned that church and adhered elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">There is no need of proof, which, however, is not wanting. They admit and claim to be members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, recognizing its authority, submitting to its government, and asserting for .themselves, and the ministers assigned by this church, a claim to the exclusive use of the church building.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The trust deed in this case must be held to be, under the Constitution and law of this Commonwealth, a valid and binding contract, enforceable as such according to its terms; and, according to its terms, it is a grant to the appellants, or those under whom they claim, and whom they represent, and should be enforced according to its terms, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The circuit court of Northumberland county dismissed the bill of the plaintiffs, by virtue of the provisions of the act of the Legislature of 1867, (Sess. Acts, pp. 649-50), providing that, in the contingency of a division of any religious society, it should be lawful for a majority to determine to which branch such congregation shall hereafter belong, which determination, duly reported to court, should conclude questions as to the property held in trust for such congregation. If this act affected this contract of Harding and wife at all, it impaired its obligation, deprived the <em>cestuis que trusts </em>named therein, and created by the trust, of their property rights, and conveyed the right to dispose of this property to others than those to whom it was granted, and vested in others the power to divest the right of property existing under its provisions, and dispose of these to other persons, and for a different purpose than that which the deed provided for. This was beyond the legislative power, and was in violation of the Constitution of the United States, sec. 10, Art. I., and of the Constitution of Virginia, Art. V., sec. 14, and is therefore void and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The terms of the deed must be followed and its trusts enforced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>as they are there created, and the beneficiaries thereunder can be no others than such as the deed provides for.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The decree of the circuit court of Northumberland, having been contrary to these views, is erroneous, and must be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded to the said circuit court for proceedings to be had therein in accordance with this opinion, and in order to a final decree in the cause, providing for the relief asked for in the bill of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Decree Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
