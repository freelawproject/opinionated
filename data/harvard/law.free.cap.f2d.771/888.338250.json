We affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the appellees, 597 F.Supp. 285, and because this appeal is so clearly frivolous, we assess expenses, attorneys\u2019 fees, and double costs against the appellants and their appellate attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">We note initially that for purposes of a motion for summary judgment all facts and inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>United States v. Diebold, </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962). Summary judgment evidence is generally composed of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any supporting affidavits. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Here, the district court ordered the parties to consolidate all factual contentions, claims for relief, defenses, and other affirmative matters in respective pretrial statements. The court specified in its order that any such matters not set forth in the pretrial statements would be deemed abandoned or withdrawn. We therefore evaluate the facts and contentions of the parties as reflected in the pretrial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Appellants, Olympia Company, Inc., and Olympia Roofing Company, Inc., (hereinafter jointly referred to as Olympia) engaged in the business of securing roofing jobs and furnishing roofing services within the New Orleans area. In doing so, Olympia purchased roofing materials from appellee the Celotex Corporation (Celotex) and its business predecessors. Among Olympia\u2019s competitors were appellees Standard-Taylor Industries, Inc., (whose chief executive officer was appellee Robbins Taylor) and Standard Roofing Company of New Orleans, Inc., (whose chief executive officer was appellee Pierre F. Carriere) (hereinafter all such entities and individuals are jointly referred to as Standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">For several years, Olympia was on Celotex\u2019s approved roofers list. This enabled Olympia to secure a Celotex roofing bond for any roof that was installed and repaired by an approved roofer using Celotex\u2019s materials in accordance with Celotex\u2019s specifications. According to Olympia, such roofing bonds were required by architectural specifications for virtually all large commercial roofing jobs, and by 1974 Celotex\u2019s roofing bonds were superior to those offered by competing suppliers of roofing materials in the New Orleans area.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Due to a dispute over credit terms, Celotex deleted Olympia from the list of approved roofers entitled to Celotex roofing bonds. According to Olympia, Celotex thereafter refused to deal with Olympia on the same terms offered Standard. Celotex continued to sell roofing supplies to Standard and to offer to Standard the Celotex roofing bonds. Olympia alleged that Standard was granted lower prices on certain materials by Celotex than those granted to Olympia, with an overall price differential of five percent. Olympia further alleged that Celotex obtained a dominant position in the relevant market, enjoying a more than sixty percent market share.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">Olympia filed this action in 1976. As consolidated in its pretrial statement, Olympia\u2019s allegations were that Celotex and Standard committed the following violations of the antitrust laws: (1) monopolization and attempted monopolization of the relevant markets, (2) unreasonable restraint of trade within the relevant markets, (3) unlawful price discrimination, and (4) unlawful tying of the furnishing of roof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ing bonds to the sale of roofing materials. Olympia\u2019s pretrial statement implied that Celotex and Standard conspired, but there was no specific allegation to that effect. Olympia sought treble damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The ensuing litigation had an extended history in the district court, as evidenced by eleven volumes of record and six boxes of exhibits. During the four years following 1976, the case produced extensive discovery, several amendments to the complaint, a number of changes in Olympia\u2019s counsel and numerous extensions and continuances. On January 7, 1980, Celotex\u2019s and Standard\u2019s motions for summary judgment were ordered continued to allow Olympia another change of counsel for the purpose of clarifying the issues. It was on June 17, 1980, that the district court ordered the parties to file pretrial statements relating all facts and legal contentions. The court accepted Olympia\u2019s pretrial statement, although it was filed over four months late and subsequently amended twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The district court entered summary judgment for Celotex and Standard on all of Olympia\u2019s claims. The accompanying exhaustive opinion found that Olympia failed to produce evidence of antitrust injury or damages, and that Olympia failed to produce evidence to establish two or more necessary elements of each of the substantive claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Olympia appealed and again changed attorneys. Additionally, Olympia has filed a \u201cMotion to Include Material Into the Appeal Record not Presented to District Court.\u201d Finally, Celotex and Standard request that this court impose sanctions against Olympia and its appellate counsel for filing a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">II. REQUIREMENT OF INJURY AND DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Section 4 of the Clayton Act limits treble damages to a private litigant \u201cwho shall be injured in his business or property by anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15. Such a plaintiff must prove not only an antitrust violation, but also \u201ccognizable injury attributable to the violation, and ... at least the approximate amount of the damage.\u201d <em>Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett Payne Co. Inc., </em>670 F.2d 575, 579 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 908, 103 S.Ct. 212, 74 L.Ed.2d 169 (1982). In particular, the plaintiff must prove <em>\u201cantitrust </em>injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S.Ct. 690, 697, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977) (emphasis in original). Injury is required in section 4 actions regardless of the nature of the underlying antitrust violation. <em>See Bayou Bottling, Inc. v. Dr. Pepper Co., </em>725 F.2d 300, 304-05 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 105 S.Ct. 123, 83 L.Ed.2d 65 (1984) (monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy in restraint of trade); <em>Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>670 F.2d at 579 (price discrimination); <em>Cash v. Arctic Circle, Inc., </em>85 F.R.D. 618, 622 (E.D.Wash.1979) (tying). While summary judgment is to be used cautiously in complex antitrust litigation, it is nevertheless available where no antitrust injury or damages have been presented. <em>See Bayou Bottling, </em>725 F.2d at 303-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">Olympia\u2019s theory of antitrust injury can be easily summarized. In its pretrial statement, the only element of injury or damages that Olympia attempted to identify and quantify was that attributable to the alleged price discrimination. Olympia stated that had it received the same five percent price reduction that Standard allegedly received, it would have made an increased profit of $38,157.65 from 1972 to 1976, and its sales would have increased by forty percent. However, in its pretrial statement Olympia failed to point to any evidence that would bear out this calculation. Instead, Olympia \u201cpropose[d] to offer proof of damages using this basic methodology and employing a ten year \u2018straight-line\u2019 projection of sales and loss [sic] net profits for a \u2018future\u2019 period of ten years from and after 1976.\u201d Olympia on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>has not presented any different theory of injury or damages, nor does it cite to any evidence that it contends creates a dispute of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Olympia\u2019s \u201cclaim of injury and for damages amounts to nothing more than unsupported assumptions, conclusory allegations, and undocumented hypotheses.\u201d Olympia has not produced any evidence tending to show antitrust injury beyond evidence of price difference. It states in its briefs, without any accompanying explanation, that affidavits that it filed in 1979 were sufficient to avoid summary judgment, but these materials contain no information relevant to injury or damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Olympia\u2019s proposed methodology is insufficient to survive a summary judgment motion absent allegations of, and evidence to support, the fact of injury, which are not to be found in this voluminous record. Because Olympia apparently chose to rest upon its pleadings on this issue rather than substantiate its claims with evidence, summary judgment is permissible. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Since Olympia created no genuine issue of the material matters of injury and damages, and since Celotex and Standard were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment was appropriate. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Moreover, evidence of price discrimination is not, by itself, adequate evidence of damages. \u201c[P]roof of a [price discrimination] violation does not mean that a disfavored purchaser had been actually \u2018injured\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 4\u201d of the Clayton Act. <em>J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>451 U.S. 557, 562, 101 S.Ct. 1923, 1927, 68 L.Ed.2d 442, 448 (1981). \u201cPrice difference without more does not indicate the amount of lost sales or profits.\u201d <em>Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>670 F.2d at 582. Olympia cannot rely on \u201cmere speculation and guesswork\u201d to substantiate its damages. <em>See id. </em>Olympia\u2019s bare projection of future profits is insufficient to meet its evidentiary burden. Any coincidental financial problems Olympia may have suffered at the time the alleged price discrimination occurred is not by itself enough to demonstrate antitrust injury. <em>See id. </em>at 581-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Even if Olympia had been able to factually substantiate its claims, its theory of damages would be unacceptable. Olympia may not base its damage claim on calculations showing what would have occurred had it received an allegedly discriminatory price. <em>See M.C. Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Texas Foundries, </em>517 F.2d 1059, 1063-65 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 968, 96 S.Ct. 1466, 47 L.Ed.2d 736 (1976). Instead, Olympia must show what would have happened had there been no discriminatory prices granted to Standard. <em>Id. </em>at 1064. Olympia cannot show damages merely by stating that it would have benefited by sharing in the lower, discriminatory prices with Standard. This is because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-9\">[Restoration of the competitive freedom which the Sherman Act is designed to protect through elimination of the anti-competitive practice is accomplished here by disregarding the special conspiratorial price ..., not by hypothetical broadening of the conspiracy to give [the defendant/buyer\u2019s] abnormally low price to [the plaintiff] as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1065.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">III. FRIVOLOUS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Standard and Celotex request the award of damages and double costs as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>sanctions against Olympia and its attorney for the filing of a frivolous appeal. Such an award may be made against an appellant under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 and Fed.R.App.P. 38, and against an attorney under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d 217, 221-22 (5th Cir.1984). A frivolous appeal is one which \u201cinvolves legal points not arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222 (citing <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983)). Sanctions against Olympia\u2019s appellate counsel are available if he has acted \u201cunreasonably and vexatiously\u201d to multiply the proceedings in this case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">We have no difficulty in concluding that Olympia and its appellate counsel should be jointly assessed the sanctions of expenses, attorneys\u2019 fees, and double costs in connection with this appeal. Olympia has failed to produce any evidence of antitrust injury and its theory of damages has been expressly rejected by this Court in prior case law. Olympia\u2019s appellate counsel has made virtually no effort to point to evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. His rambling briefs include citations to affidavits in the record which have little to do with the issues in this case, and which are unaccompanied by any explanation of what relevant evidence the cited affidavits supposedly contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">Additionally, Olympia\u2019s appellate counsel made no attempt to address most of the issues raised in the district court\u2019s opinion. While we realize that the lack of damages or injury was enough to dispose of Olympia\u2019s action, we note that Olympia did not address enough of the requisite elements to obtain reversal on any of its substantive claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, Olympia\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s main concern appears to be the possibility of succeeding in a future malpractice action against one of Olympia\u2019s prior attorneys. Olympia also calls on this court to, among other things, stay bankruptcy proceeding against a non-party in order to allow deposition of one of its employees, although it fails to explain how or why we should take such action. Many, if not most, of Olympia\u2019s arguments are similarly puzzling and exasperating. We are hard pressed to imagine a more meritless, vexatious, or unreasonable appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">We therefore grant the appellees\u2019 requests for expenses, attorneys\u2019 fees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>double costs against Olympia and its appellate counsel. However, rather than our determining the amount of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by appellees in this appeal, we remand to the district court for such determination. <em>See Hagerty, </em>749 F.2d at 223; <em>Lewis v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>722 F.2d 209, 210 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 104 S.Ct. 975, 79 L.Ed.2d 213 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">IV. SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the appellees. Due to the frivolous nature of this appeal, we grant appellees\u2019 requests to assess expenses, attorneys\u2019 fees, and double costs jointly against the appellants and their appellate counsel. We remand this case to the district court for a determination of the amount of expenses incurred on appeal and appellees\u2019 appellate attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Judgment AFFIRMED; REMANDED for assessment of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-6\">. Olympia summarized its arguments by claiming that \"countervailing affidavits\" filed in 1979 were sufficient to avoid summary judgment. These allegations were abandoned to the extent Olympia failed to include them in the pretrial statement, and in any event the materials Olympia referred to contain no information relevant to the issues of injury and damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\">. Olympia also makes the frivolous argument that a recently passed Louisiana statute, La.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 39:1963(C) (West Supp.1985), shows a five percent price differential to be a \"devastating advantage.\" This statute requires certain public contracts be awarded to minority businesses that bid within five percent of the lowest bidder. How this statute can show that Olympia suffered any damage escapes us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b941-6\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 entitled Counsel Liability for Excessive Costs provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-7\">Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 entitled Damages and Costs on Affirmance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-9\">Where a judgment is affirmed by the Supreme Court or a court of appeals, the court in its discretion may adjudge to the prevailing party just damages for his delay, and single or double costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure entitled Damages for Delay provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqAl\">If a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b941-11\">. Aside from the issue of damages, the district court dismissed Olympia\u2019s claims on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-12\"><em>Monopolization: </em>no adequate evidence of the relevant market, no evidence that Celotex possessed monopoly power, and no evidence that the alleged monopoly resulted from actions of Celotex rather than those of its competitors; <em>Attempted monopolization: </em>no evidence of intent and no evidence of relevant market; <em>Price discrimination: </em>no evidence of discriminatory prices, no evidence that alleged discrimination had a substantial effect on competition, no evidence that alleged price differences were not simply good faith attempts to meet competitors\u2019 prices, and no evidence that Standard was aware of any discrimination; <em>Tying: </em>the allegedly tied products were not separate products; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-17\"><em>Conspiracy to restrain trade: </em>no evidence of conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-18\">Olympia\u2019s arguments on appeal are very difficult to decipher, but the only issues other than damages that it expressly addresses are relevant market, the existence of price differences, and conspiracy. As to the latter, Olympia makes no attempt to point to evidence that a conspiracy existed. We do not reach the substantive claims and express no opinion thereon, but we note these issues to illustrate the frivolousness of the appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
