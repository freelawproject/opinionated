The plaintiff Freeman sues for the wrongful death, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-7-13 (1984 Supp.), of his infant daughter Laura, on behalf of himself and of four other statutory wrongful death beneficiaries (i.e., Laura\u2019s mother and her three minor siblings). Freeman appeals from the dismissal of these claims on the ground of collateral estoppel. The district court based its dismissal on the circumstance that \u2014 in a previous suit brought by Freeman individually against the present same defendants for his own personal injuries arising from the same accident in which Laura was killed\u2014 Freeman\u2019s individual suit had been dismissed, upon a jury verdict exculpating the defendants of negligence in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">We affirm the dismissal of Freeman\u2019s own wrongful death claim. However, finding no privity between him and the other wrongful death beneficiaries, we reverse the dismissal of the claims of the four other wrongful death beneficiaries, holding further that the doctrine of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d does not justify the application of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">This litigation arises out of a collision in Mississippi between a vehicle driven by Freeman and a truck driven by the defendant Deis in the course of his employment with the co-defendant Lester Coggins Trucking, Inc. As a result of the collision, Freeman and a passenger in his vehicle sustained personal injuries, and two other passengers, including the present decedent Laura, Freeman\u2019s infant daughter, were killed. Four suits were filed in federal court for personal injuries or wrongful death, of which for present purposes we need note only the present suit (by Freeman for himself and as representing four other claimants as Laura\u2019s wrongful death beneficiaries), and the earlier-tried one by Freeman individually for his own personal injuries. The latter suit was dismissed after an adverse jury verdict that by special interrogatory found the same two defendants free of the same negligence asserted by the present suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">Based upon this adverse jury finding and the resulting dismissal of Freeman\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>for his own personal injuries, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment grounded on collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Freeman\u2019s suit was dismissed in federal court. Consequently, although both it and the present suit are Mississippi diversity cases, \u201cthe doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel require application of the federal rule when, as in this case, a party seeks to estop a claim from being raised in a diversity action brought in federal court on the basis of an earlier determination made in a federal court sitting pursuant to its diversity jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stovall v. Price Waterhouse Co., </em>652 F.2d 537 (5th Cir.1981). Federal law determines the res judicata and collateral effect given a prior decision of a federal tribunal, regardless of the bases of the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">\u201cFederal common law permits the use of collateral estoppel upon the showing of three necessary criteria[.]\u201d <em>Hicks v. Quaker Oats Company, </em>662 F.2d 1158, 1166 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See also Holmes v. Jones, </em>738 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1984). The three criteria are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">(1) that the issue at stake be identical to the one involved in prior litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">(2) that the issue has been actually litigated in the prior litigation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-9\">(3) that the determination of the issue in the prior litigation has been a critical and necessary part of the judgment in that earlier action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-10\"><em>Hicks, supra, </em>662 F.2d at 1166; <em>Holmes, supra, </em>738 F.2d at 713. All three of these requirements have been satisfied in the present case. The issue here, as in the first case, was based on Deis\u2019 negligence. This issue was actually litigated in the first case, and its determination there was a critical and necessary part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">\u201c[A] right, question, or fact distinctly put in issue and directly determined as a ground of recovery by a court of competent jurisdiction collaterally estops a party or his privy from relitigating the issue in a subsequent action.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, </em>681 F.2d 334, 338 (5th Cir.1982). Freeman was clearly a party to the earlier suit for his own personal injuries. Despite Freeman\u2019s contention that the circumstance in the present suit that he is acting in a different capacity <em>(i.e., </em>as wrongful death claimant) somehow makes collateral estoppel unavailable to the defendants, it is plain that in the present suit \u2014 as to <em>his own </em>claim for wrongful death damages \u2014 he is likewise a party suing in his individual capacity to recover damages due him. <em>See Jones v. Texas Tech University, </em>656 F.2d 1137, 1143 (5th Cir.1981). Since Freeman had a full and fair opportunity in the first action to litigate the issue of Deis\u2019 negligence, we conclude that the district court acted properly in ruling that he is collaterally es-topped from doing so again, in his individual capacity, in this action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">We will therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on collateral estoppel grounds of Freeman\u2019s claim for damages due him individually because of Laura\u2019s allegedly wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">A different issue, however, is presented as to whether collateral estoppel should bar the wrongful death claims here asserted on behalf of the mother and siblings of Laura. They were not parties to the first suit by Freeman, brought by him individually for his own personal injuries. Although Free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>man himself as plaintiff brings the present action for their injuries in a representative capacity, the issue is whether <em>their </em>claims are precluded because of the adverse determination of Freeman\u2019s individual claims in the earlier suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The ordinary rule is that a party appearing in a representative capacity for others is not bound by the determination of an earlier suit in which he appeared only in an individual capacity. <em>Sayre v. Crews, </em>184 F.2d 723, 724 (5th Cir.1950) (determination of negligence in individual suit by the father had no preclusive effect in subsequent suit by father brought in representative capacity for his minor daughter); <em>Smith v. Hood, </em>396 F.2d 692, 693-94 (D.C.Cir.1968) (no collateral estoppel; earlier determination in mother\u2019s individual suit of non-traumatic cause of husband\u2019s death does not bar subsequent suit by mother in her representative capacity for her children for their wrongful death damages arising from accident); IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 110.411[3] (1984); 18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 4449, p. 414; Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 36(2) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Likewise, viewing these present wrongful death claims as asserted on behalf of the mother and siblings of Laura, they would not ordinarily be precluded as barred by the unfavorable judgment in the first suit brought by their husband-father Freeman, for close family relationships are not sufficient by themselves to establish privity with the original suit\u2019s party, or to bind a nonparty to that suit by the judgment entered therein. <em>See Leonhard v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 599, 616 (2d Cir.1980), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>451 U.S. 908, 101 S.Ct. 1975, 68 L.Ed.2d 295 (1981); <em>Smith v. Hood, </em>396 F.2d 692, 693 (D.C.Cir.1968); <em>Sayre v. Crews, </em>184 F.2d 723, 724 (5th Cir.1950); IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 0.411[11] (1984); 18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4459 (1981). As summarized with respect to the present issue by the cited Wright treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">Each [family member] has an independent cause of action for personal injuries, free from claim preclusion, just as other multiple plaintiffs are presumed to own separate claims. None is bound by issue preclusion in an action for personal injuries, for the same reasons as apply to preclusion among unrelated parties____ [Preclusion does not apply between litigation conducted by one family member in a personal capacity and litigation conducted by the same person as a representative of another family member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoy\">Wright, Miller, and Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4459 at pp. 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">The district court recognized these principles, but it felt that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s expanded notion of \u201cvirtual representation,\u201d <em>see </em>18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4457, permitted application of collateral estoppel to bar the present subsequent suit by the mother and siblings of Laura. Under this doctrine, \u201ca person may be bound by a [prior] judgment even though not a party if one of the parties to the suit is so closely aligned with his interests as to be his virtual representative.\u201d <em>Aerojet General Corporation v. Askew, </em>511 F.2d 710, 719 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 908, 96 S.Ct. 210, 46 L.Ed.2d 137 (1975) (local governmental unit\u2019s subsequent suit precluded by prior judgment involving state agencies asserting defenses in close relationship to local unit).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">In holding that the present \u201cprivy relationship\u201d was sufficiently close to justify application of collateral estoppel, the district court cited <em>Hardy v. Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, </em>681 F.2d 334 (5th Cir.1982) and <em>Southwest Airlines Company v. Texas International Airlines, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 84 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 832, 98 S.Ct. 117, 54 L.Ed.2d 93 (1977). In our view, for reasons to be explained, neither of these decisions support extension of the \u201cvirtual representation\u201d theory of collateral estoppel so as to bar the litigation by a mother and siblings of their independent wrongful death claim of a family member, because of a judgment rendered against the husband-father in an earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>action on his own individual claim for his own personal injuries, though stemming from the same accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">In <em>Southwest Airlines, supra, </em>we outlined generally the circumstances in which the relationship between the one who is party in the first, and the nonparty thereto sought to be bound or precluded by collateral estoppel in the second suit, may be sufficiently close as to justify preclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuF\">First, a nonparty who has succeeded to a party\u2019s interest in property is bound by any prior judgments against that party.... Second, a nonparty who controlled the original suit will be bound by the resulting judgment____ Third, federal courts will bind a nonparty whose interests were represented adequately by a party in the original suit____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-8\"><em>Southwest Airlines, supra, </em>546 F.2d at 95 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Since the mother and the siblings of the second suit obviously did not succeed in property to any interest of Freeman asserted in the first suit, and obviously did not control the original suit by Freeman,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court apparently concluded that the interests of the nonparty mother and siblings \u201cwere represented adequately\u201d by Freeman in the first suit. However, both from <em>Southwest Airlines </em>itself and the succeeding decisions of this circuit, the concept of \u201cadequate representation\u201d does not refer to apparently competent litigation of an issue in a prior suit by a party holding parallel interests;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather, it refers to the concept of virtual representation, by which a nonparty may be bound because the party to the first suit \u201cis so closely aligned with his [the nonparty\u2019s] interests as to be his virtual representative,\u201d <em>Aerojet General Corp., supra, </em>511 F.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Further, as the jurisprudence of this circuit after <em>Southwest Airlines </em>makes plain, for parties to be so \u201cclosely aligned,\" or that the party\u2019s representation in the first suit \u201cadequately\u201d represents the non-party\u2019s interests in the first suit so as to preclude a nonparty in subsequent litigation, requires more than a showing of parallel interests or, even, a use of the same attorney in both suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">The most recent decision of this circuit on the issue, <em>Hardy v. Johns-Mansville Sales Corp., supra, </em>extensively discusses the applicable principles at 681 F.2d 338-41. In holding that collateral estoppel did not bar a nonparty despite its identity of interests with the party in the first suit, the court\u2019s scholarly opinion sets forth governing principles and parameters on the use of virtual representation to bar a nonparty from his day in court in the second suit. Preliminarily the court points out that, while collateral estoppel bars a party or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>privy from relitigating the issue in a subsequent action, as to nonparties, \u201c[t]he right to a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue is, of course, protected by the due process clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d 681 F.2d at 338. The court notes that the nonparty collateral-estoppel exceptions enunciated by <em>Southwest Airlines </em>as arising from a sufficiently close relationship, were derived in rationale from the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 30, 31, 34, 39-41 (1982), and that the obvious underlying rationale is that \u201cin these instances the nonparty has in effect had his day in court.\u201d 681 F.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">After pointing out that the nonparties were not shown in <em>Hardy </em>to have participated directly or indirectly in the first suit, 681 F.2d at 339, the court then concluded that the doctrine of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d in the first suit could not apply under criteria enunciated in <em>Pollard v. Cockrell, </em>578 F.2d 1002, 1008-09 (5th Cir.1978), whereby \u201c \u2018[virtual representation demands the existence of an express or implied legal relationship in which parties to the first suit are accountable to nonparties who file a subsequent suit raising identical issues.\u2019 \u201d 681 F.2d at 340. The <em>Hardy </em>opinion concluded its virtual representation discussion by stating that \u201c \u2018privity is not established by the mere fact that persons may be interested in the same question or in proving the same set of facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">In <em>Pollard v. Cockrell, </em>578 F.2d 1002 (5th Cir.1978), relied upon by <em>Hardy, </em>we rejected the contention that one group of massage parlor owners were bound by a judgment in a prior lawsuit by another group. As we stated in <em>Hardy, Pollard </em>rejected virtual representation \u201cdespite nearly identical pleadings filed by the groups and representation by common attorneys.\u201d 681 F.2d at 340. Pertinently to the present case \u2014 where the attorney in the present suit for the wrongful death damages of Laura\u2019s mother and siblings is the same as the attorney in Freeman\u2019s earlier suit for his own personal injuries \u2014 we concluded in <em>Pollard </em>that, for collateral estoppel purposes, \u201c[rjepresentation by the same attorneys cannot furnish the requisite alignment of interest.\u201d 578 F.2d at 1009. Although <em>Pollard </em>involved unrelated plaintiffs who had retained the same attorneys, we perceive no reason why a different principle should here apply because the attorney for the father-husband in his earlier unsuccessful suit happens to be the same attorney who now represents the mother and children in their independent action for wrongful death damages. Nor do we see any principled justification for holding that virtual representation applies because of the identity of attorneys here, whereas it would not if Freeman, on the one hand, and the mother and children, on the other, had retained different attorneys to file suit on their separate and independent causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff Freeman\u2019s present action, insofar as in his capacity representing the wrongful death claims of Laura\u2019s mother and siblings, is not barred by the judgment based upon jury determination of non-negligence dismissing the earlier suit brought by Freeman individually to recover only for his own personal injuries sustained in the same accident. The mother and siblings were not parties to the first suit nor were they in privity with Freeman in his first suit, nor \u2014 within the contours of the limited exception of this court permitting non-parties to be bound because of their virtual representation in the first suit \u2014 were the mother and siblings so closely aligned in legal interest with Freeman as to justify a holding that their interests were adequately represented in the first suit. We are re-enforced in this conclusion because, so far as we can ascertain, no appellate decision has ever applied collateral estoppel in like circumstances, whereas its application has consistently been rejected in the few reported instances in which sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">An underlying principle is that \u201c[i]t is a violation of due process for a judgment [in a prior suit] to be binding on a litigant who was not a party or a privy and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>has never had an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Parkland Hosiery Company, Inc. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 327 n. 7, 99 S.Ct. 645, 649 n. 7, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). Collateral estoppel, with its purposes of protecting litigants from relitigating identical issues and promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation, <em>id., </em>439 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 649, may indeed be appropriate where the litigant has earlier had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity for judicial resolution of the same issue\u201d, <em>id., </em>439 U.S. at 328, 99 S.Ct. at 650. Nevertheless, \u201c[s]ome litigants \u2014 those who never appeared in a prior action \u2014 may not be collaterally estopped without litigating the issue. They have never had a chance to present their evidence and arguments on the claim. Due process prohibits estopping them despite one or more existing adjudications of the identical issue which stand squarely against their position.\u201d <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, </em>402 U.S. 313, 329, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1443, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971). The price of due process, thus, may include the possibility of conflicting adjudications in order to assure each litigant his or her day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it dismisses the plaintiff Freeman\u2019s individual claim for wrongful death damages, but we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it dismisses the claims asserted on behalf of the other wrongful death beneficiaries of Laura Freeman. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\">. Freeman also asserted in the present action that Lester Coggins Trucking, Inc. is liable for negligently entrusting a company vehicle to Deis. The record does not indicate whether Freeman asserted the same theory of recovery in the prior action. Under Mississippi law, however, liability cannot be imposed on an employer on a theory of negligent entrustment unless the employee is first found to be negligent. <em>Brown Oil Tools, Inc. v. Schmidt, </em>246 Miss. 238, 148 So.2d 685, 687 (1963); <em>Hood v. Dealers Transport Company, </em>459 F.Supp. 684, 685-86 (N.D.Miss.1978). Thus, whether or not Freeman raised the issue of negligent entrustment in the prior action is irrelevant for present purposes, since that issue is, for our purposes, the same as the issue of Deis\u2019 negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-11\">. Throughout this litigation, the parties have viewed Bobby Freeman\u2019s wrongful death claim solely in terms of collateral estoppel. The district court did the same in reviewing and ruling upon the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. This issue might perhaps better be viewed in terms of res judicata, since both suits concerned grounds for relief, though differing, that arose out of conduct complained of in the first action. <em>See Kilgoar v. Colbert County Board of Education, </em>578 F.2d 1033, 1035 (5th Cir.1978). As explained in the text, however, collateral estoppel bars Freeman\u2019s wrongful death claim even if res judicata does not. Consequently, we need not decide here whether res judicata applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-10\">. \"To have control of litigation requires that a person have effective choice as to the legal theories and proofs to be advanced in behalf of the party to the action. He must also have control over the opportunity to obtain review.\" <em>Hardy, supra, </em>681 F.2d at 339 (citations omitted). Typical examples of control that result in collateral estoppel can be found in <em>Dudley v. Smith, </em>504 F.2d 979 (5th Cir.1974) (president and sole shareholder controls his corporation) and <em>Astron Industrial Associates, Inc. v.
