The order confined\" the examination by such limits that it cannot now be said that the apprehended result must happen. In this case it is best that any question as to a privilege by defendant against inculpating himself be determined upon the examination, when his rights will be completely protected. Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
