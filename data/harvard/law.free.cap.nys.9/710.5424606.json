The judgment awarded plaintiff $1,452.68 damages and costs, and contained an injunction, unless within a time fixed defendants should pay $2,500 as the price of his Sixth-Avenue property taken for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>poses of the railroad, and $1,000 as the price of his Eighth-Avenue property-taken for said purposes.

Assuming that it was incompetent for the plaintiff to show that he was offered $42,000 for his Sixth-Avenue property before the defendants\u2019 railway was constructed, yet it sufficiently appears from the whole case that the defendants were not prejudiced by it. The testimony of defendants\u2019 experts seems to have been wholly discarded. Upon the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s experts, four times the amount which was awarded as damage to fee value might have been awarded. Upon testimony which was competent, sufficient, and found worthy of belief, the trial judge found, during a period of six years, an actual loss of rental value amounting to $150 for each year. It thus fully appears that the award of $2,500 for loss of fee value, which was made, is a reasonable one, under all the circumstances. It bears the usual relation between fee value and rental value, at the legal rate of interest. A somewhat similar question was presented to this court in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>8 N. Y. Supp. 495, decided during January, 1890, and it was held no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The testimony admitted as regards plaintiff\u2019s Eighth-Avenue property, to the effect that other owners of property in that neighborhood had difficulty in renting their flats after the construction of the elevated railroad, was proper, under all the circumstances. It tended to show the uniform operation of a general cause, and that plaintiff\u2019s loss of rents was not attributable to his own neglect, and consequently it also had a legitimate bearing upon the question of fee value as affected by loss of rents. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
