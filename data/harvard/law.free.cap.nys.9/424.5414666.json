Y. Supp. 679, that findings of fact such as appear in the decision of this case are in irreconcilable conflict. Adopting this as a proper conclusion, it seems that it is impossible, from the record before us, to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>which of the conflicting findings is correct. The error sought to be remedied by the order appealed from is therefore judicial, and cannot be corrected after judgment upon a motion made at a term other than that at which the judgment was rendered. <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>25 Hun, 529; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>14 Hun, 472; <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>Schwab, </em>34 Hun, 583; Freem. Judgm. \u00a7\u00a7 70, 101. The order should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
