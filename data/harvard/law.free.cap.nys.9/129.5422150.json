Driscoll, as receiver, against William W. Downer and others. Two orders were entered, one on May 13, 1889, and one on May 16, 1889. The order of May 13, 1889, after reciting that the case had been reached in its regular order, and moved by the plaintiff, and opened, and the defendants having moved that the complaint be dismissed on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and the court, having entertained the motion, and held that the complaint was defective, and thereupon the plaintiff asked leave to amend, which defendants objected to, ordered that plaintiff have leave to amend the complaint in certain particulars on condition that the trial stand over to May 16th, and that plaintiff pay $10 costs and witness\u2019 fees to each of defendants\u2019 attorneys appearing for different parties, such amendment to be made and costs paid on or before said May 16th, to which time the court and cause were adjourned, and that, if such amendment was not made and costs paid, then the complaint be dismissed, with costs to each defendant separately answering. The order of May 16, 1889, after referring to the previous order and its contents, stated that the cause was regularly called, and, it appearing that such order had not been complied with by plaintiff, and the plaintiff stating in open court that he did not intend to comply with it, ordered in confirmation of the order of the 13th, and, on motion of the defendants\u2019 attorney, that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s said complaint be and is hereby dismissed, with costs to each defendant separately answering.\u201d The judgment was in conformity with these orders. The action was brought by the plaintiff as receiver, in proceedings supplemental to execution, of the property and effects of the defendants William W. Downer, Marcellus Johnson, and Minard C. Fancher, to reach personal property alleged to have been transferred by Downer, Johnson, and Fancher in fraud of creditors, and especially in fraud of the plaintiffs in the judgment upon which the supplemental proceedings were taken. It was not alleged that the judgment was docketed in any county, nor an execution thereon issued to a county in which the judgment roll was filed or judgment docketed, nor to any county wherein the defendants, or either of them, resided. It was alleged that the defendants were partners \u201cdoing business at the village of Baldwins-ville, in said county;\u201d that \u201cjudgment was duly recovered in this court;\u201d \u201cthat on the 2d day of January, 1889, execution was duly issued on said judgment to the. sheriff of said Onondaga county, and on the 5th day of February the same was duly returned wholly unsatisfied;\u201d that afterwards, in proceedings supplementary to execution on said judgment, an order was duly made by the county judge of Onondaga county requiring the defendants to appear and answer, and on the 21st day of March, 1889, the plaintiff \u201cwas duly appointed receiver\u201d of the property and effects of said defendants, and the receiver duly accepted the trust, and entered upon the discharge of his duties. The case and exceptions, as settled, show that the case came on for trial at the Onondaga special term on 13th May, 1889. After the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had opened, and offered to prove the allegations of the complaint, the defendants\u2019 attorney moved to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds \u201cthat it did not show facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. It did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>not show a judgment docketed in any county of this state, nor an execution thereon issued to a county in which the judgment roll was filed or judgment docketed, nor to any county wherein the defendants, or either of them, resided.\u201d The court held that the objections were well taken, and that the motion must be granted. Thereupon the plaintiffs attorney asked leave to amend the complaint in the particulars objected to, which was granted, and the order of May 13,1889, made. On the 16th May the case was again called. It appeared that the complaint had not been amended; and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that he did not intend to do so, but requested to be allowed to make further arguments in regard to the sufficiency of the complaint, and to prove the allegations thereof. The defendants objected, and the court overruled the plaintiff\u2019s request, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney excepted thereto; whereupon the court, on motion of the defendants\u2019 attorney, made the order of May 16, 1889. Ho exception was taken by plaintiff to the ruling of the court on May 13th, holding that the defendants\u2019 objections to the complaint were well taken. Plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b154-5\">Argued before Hardin, P. J., and Martin and Merwin, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-6\"><em>William </em>G. <em>Trotter, </em>for appellant. <em>John C.

He, however, took no exception to such ruling. He applied for and obtained leave to amend; one of the conditions of the order being that, in case he did not amend and pay certain costs within a certain time, the complaint should be dismissed. In regard to such a case, it was held in <em>Weichsel </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>47 N. Y. Super. Ct. 223, affirmed 90 N. Y. 651, that the party plaintiff, upon whose request leave to amend was granted upon payment of certain costs, otherwise complaint to be dismissed as not containing facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, would not be heard to impugn the order as being irregular or erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">There is nothing to show that the amount of costs imposed as condition to the amendment was unreasonable; and, upon failure to amend, the dismissal of the complaint would follow. The plaintiff had the benefit of the leave given. Whether further discussion upon the adjourned day should be allowed upon the sufficiency of the complaint was entirely a matter of discretion with the trial court, and the exception to the refusal of the court to grant the request of the plaintiff on that subject is not here available. The order of May 16, 1889, was in effect the final decision of the court, upon xvhich the judgment is based. Ho exception to it was filed. It seems to me that the plaintiff is not in a position to have reviewed the ruling upon the sufficiency of the complaint. The action of the court thereon transpired at the trial. The plaintiff having asked and obtained leave to amend, and having had, to a certain extent, the benefit of the order, and not having excepted to the ruling, the only relief he was entitled to was to amend, and proceed with the action. It follows, the judgment and orders must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
