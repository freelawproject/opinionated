Defendants, chocolate manufacturers, residing and doing business in France, sent Edward Bickford, a clerk in their London house, to New York to receive consignments of their goods, sell, and remit. While in New York he borrowed \u00a31,200 of plaintiff, his sister, to meet the expenses of the business. Plaintiff recovered a judgment, which was reversed by the court of appeals, there being no evidence or claim that Bickford had written or verbal authority to borrow money for defendants, and no facts appearing from which such authority could be implied. At the second trial the court dismissed the complaint, and from the judgment thereupon entered in favor of defendants plaintiff appeals. For opinion of court of appeals reversing the former judgment, see 14 N. E. Rep. 438.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b799-13\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

Y. 490, 14 N. E. Rep. 438. We have carefully examined the two records, and are of opinion that the plaintiff, upon this second trial, supplied what was wanting upon the former trial, namely, evidence of her brother\u2019s actual authority to borrow money for the defendants. There were many circumstances in the case tending to throw doubt upon this fresh evidence, and to impair the credibility of the witness who gave it, Mr. Edward Bickford. It is, indeed, argued with some color of proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>bility that this testimony is a variation from that originally given, occurring to the witness only after the ruling of the court of appeals. We cannot say, however, that this new testimony is so inherently improbable, or that it was so radically impeached, as to justify a dismissal of the complaint. As to part of the amount sued for, (the two items of \u00a3200 each,) this witness Bickford declared that, as far back as the year 1879, he actually exhibited a book of account, indicating what he had done, to one of the defendants, and to their general agent in London, one Guenin; that this agent was specifically informed of the borrowing of this \u00a3400, and made no objection to it, simply inquiring whether it was necessary for the business, and being told that it was; -and that Mr. Gaston Menier had the opportunity to see it as entered in the book, and probably did so see it. On the latter head, the witness says: \u201cI showed it to Mr. Menier and to Mr. Guenin; showed it to both of them.\u201d And again: \u201cThe \u00a3400 is 'in that book, November. Guenin saw that page in that book in London, when I was there. Mr. Gaston Menier saw it. I exhibited it him.\u201d The witness, it is true, admits that he may not have pointed -out to Mr. Menier these specific items of \u00a3200 each, but there certainly was enough in his testimony to call for the submission to the jury of the question of ratification on that head, as well as the question of original authority, especially in view of the distinct statement that the money thus borrowed was used and expended in the defendants\u2019 business, and for their purposes. As to the remaining \u00a3800, Bickford testified to direct authority to borrow, when required. This authority he received from Guenin, but the defendants explicitly told him\u2014so at least he says\u2014to take his instructions from Guenin. This is his testimony on that head: \u201cMy instructions from them [the defendants] were to follow out Mr. Guenin\u2019s instructions. \u201d And again: \u201cMr. Emil Menier gave me the particulars to carry out what Mr. Guenin authorized me. \u201d Here was neither limit nor restriction, and Bickford was thereupon justified in taking all his authority from Guenin, including the authority to borrow money when required in the business. This testimony was substantially new, and, if credited or undenied, it was sufficient to authorize a recovery. Upon the first trial, it was not claimed, as observed by Huger, C. J., (107 N. Y. 492, 14 N. E. Rep. 438,) that Edward Bickford had \u201cany positive unwritten or verbal authority\u201d to borrow money for the defendants. Nor was there any evidence upon that trial that the loans were made to the defendants, or upon their credit, nor that the plaintiff relied upon any representation made by her brother that he had authority to borrow for the defendants. 107 N. Y. 498, 14 N. E. Rep. 441. Upon the present trial, however, Bickford testified that he \u201ctold his sister it was necessary to have some means,\u2014some money; that the accounts were not coming in; collections were not being made as rapidly as they should be to meet the necessary disbursements of the business, (and that she was perfectly safe in loaning that money to Mr. Menier.)\u201d The words in parentheses were stricken out by the learned court, but we see no reason for confining the witness to but a part of the representation upon which the loan was requested. It is thus evident that new and important testimony, upon more than one point, was given upon the present trial. The witness was closely interrogated as to his reasons for omitting such crucial testimony upon the previous trial, and we can see that his explanations might perhaps have been deemed unsatisfactory by a sensible jury. But that did not justify the refusal to submit the testimony with such explanations and the criticisms thereon to their consideration, and we think that the question of actual authority, and of the loans to the defendants thereunder, should have been so submitted. For these reasons, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
