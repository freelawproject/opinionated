Dalzell against the Fahys Watch-Case Company. Before serving a complaint, plaintiff obtained an order, under Code Civil Proc. FT. Y. \u00a7 872, for the examination of certain of defendant\u2019s officers and books, upon an affidavit, the material parts of which are as follows: \u201c (3) That the-action is brought to recover damages for breach of a contract dated April 21, 1886, made by plaintiff with defendant, in writing, whereby plaintiff agreed' to and did thereafter assign unto said defendant certain\" letters patent, and defendant agreed to manufacture and sell for joint account of this plaintiff and defendant the commodities covered by said letters patent, and to pay over to-this plaintiff the equal moiety of net profits.\u201d \u201c (5) That the defendant did, as-deponent is informed, verily believes, and alleges, manufacture under said agreement, and the letters patent so as aforesaid by this plaintiff assigned, large quantities of said commodities, and, they so being the joint property of this plaintiff and defendant, the defendant has disposed of them in some way,' but, as deponent verily believes, at a substantial profit, and now neglects and refuses to account thereof, and of the disposition of said common property, and pay over the proportion of net profits as agreed; that the substance of the-judgment demanded is damages for the breach aforesaid, measured by the amount found due therefor upon the final determination of this action.\u201d \u201c (7). That an examination of the defendant through its officers aforesaid, and as well of its books, to-wit, its ledger, journal, day-book, sales-book, cash-book, is material and necessary to deponent to enable him to ascertain the disposition by defendant of said joint property, and the method thereof, and, if the same prove to be by sales, then to ascertain the persons concerned therein, the character of the sales and terms thereof; which facts are material and necessary to be known, are at present unknown to deponent, and cannot, other than by the examination herein prayed, be discovered, and the plaintiff' enabled to frame his complaint. \u201d Defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the order was. denied, but the order was modified by striking out that part which permitted, \u201cplaintiff or his counsel\u201d to examine the books, though that part which allowed defendant\u2019s officers to be examined concerning the contents of the books-remained. From this order, except so much as modified the original order, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b738-6\">Argued before Sedgwick, O.

The motion was made (1) upon the alleged indefiniteness and insufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s affidavit; and (2) upon affidavits and exhibits showing cause against the order. The power of the court to vacate the order for either of the reasons stated cannot be questioned. Le<em>vy </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>44 N. Y. Super. Ct. 291, affirmed, 75 N. Y. 609. The plaintiff obtained the order before service of a copy of the complaint, and consequently he was bound to show that, at that stage of the case, the examination was material and necessary to enable him to frame his complaint. The object of allowing the examination to be had before the joinder of issue is not to enable the plaintiff to ascertain whether he has a cause of action, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>to enable him to elicit material facts necessary to be incorporated into the statement of the canse of action which he has. A careful inspection of the record shows, not only that the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, even if barely sufficient in the first instance, was very indefinite, but also that the plaintiff had sufficient facts for framing a complaint based upon defendant\u2019s refusal to account, and that he failed to establish any necessity for the order of examination. The case, as presented by the affidavits and exhibits of the defend ant, called upon the court to see to it that theplaintiff should establish the good faith of his application, and the materiality and necessity of the examination for the purpose of framing a complaint. This tile plaintiff failed to do, and consequently the order should have been vacated, and not merely modified as to the books. The order appealed from should be reversed, and the order of examination vacated, with $10 costs of the appeal, and disbursements to be taxed, and $10 costs of motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
