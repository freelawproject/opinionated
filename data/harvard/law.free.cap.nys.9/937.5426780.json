J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYZ\">1. Upon an inspection of the indictment, we are of the opinion that the grand jury of Oswego county had jurisdiction to find the indictment in question. By section 134 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it. is provided as follows: \u201cWhen a crime is committed partly in one county and partly in another, or the acts or effects thereof constituting or requisite to the consummation of the offense occur in two or more counties, the jurisdiction is in either county.\u201d People v. <em>Dimick, </em>41 Hun, 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\"><em>2. </em>Section 278 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down a rule that \u201cthe indictment must charge but one crime and one form, except as in the next section provided;\u201d and section 279 is as follows: \u201cThe crime may be charged in separate counts to have been committed in a different manner or by different means; and, where the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, such crimes may be charged in separate counts.\u201d By section 284 of the Penal Code, it is provided, .viz.: \u201cA person who, under the promise of marriage, seduces and has sexual intercourse with an unmarried female of previous chaste character is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by both.\u201d By section 282 of the Penal Code, it is provided, viz.. \u201cA person who * * * [subdivision 2] inveigles or entices an unmarried female, of previous chaste-character, into a house of ill fame or of assignation, or elsewhere, for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse, * * * is guilty of abduction, and punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by both.\u201d From an inspection of the indictment, we think \u201cthe acts complained of may constitute different crimes;\u201d and therefore, within the provisions of section 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, \u201csuch crimes may be charged in separate counts.\u201d It is quite manifest, from an inspection of the indictment, that the acts and circumstances referred to in the different counts of the indictment relate to the same transaction; and we may appropriately repeat the language of Talcott, J., in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>People, </em>12 Hun, 217, where he says, viz.: \u201cManifestly, but one transaction is intended to be described in all the counts contained in this indictment.\u201d In <em>People v. Menken, </em>3 N. Y. Crim. R. 233, we held, viz.: \u201cThe indictment may state the acts constituting the crime in different counts, appropriate to meet the evidence which may be presented on the trial. \u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lenhardt, </em>4 N. Y. Crim. R. 317, it was held that, \u201cunder section 279, Code Crim. Proc., two distinct misdemeanors, <em>e. g., </em>conspiracy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 168, subd. 5) and coercion, (section 653, subd. 3,) may be set up in different counts of the same indictment, wherein the acts complained of in each case are the same, and constitute the different crimes.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>29 Hun, 580, it was held \u201cproper to join in an indictment two counts,\u2014one charging robbery, and the other larceny,\u2014where each charge is founded upon the taking of the same articles of personal property from the same person, at the same time and place; one charging it to have been taken with, and the other without, violence to the person of the owner.\u201d And, in speaking of the indictment in that case, Smith, J., said: \u201cIt is to be inferred, from the identity of description, time, and place, that the two counts referred to one and the same transaction.\u201d By an inspection of the different counts of the indictment of the case in hand, we are of the opinion that the indictment refers to one transaction, and that the case falls within the provision of section 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that, \u201c where the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, such crimes may be charged in separate counts.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Infield, </em>1 N. Y. Crim. R. 146; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, 2 </em>N. Y. Crim. R. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We think the decision of the oyer and terminer of Oswego county, and the judgment entered thereon, should be reversed, and the demurrer overruled, \u201cwith the liberty to the defendant to plead to the indictment; and, in the. event of his failing to do so, a plea of \u2018 not guilty \u2019 must be entered, as pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Tided by section 330 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\u201d See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, supra. </em>Order and judgment reversed and demurrer overruled, with liberty to the defendant to plead, and the clerk directed to enter judgment, and remit a certified copy thereof, with the return and decision of this court, to the court of oyer and terminer of Oswego county, pursuant to sections 247 and 248 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Mebwin, J., concurs.
