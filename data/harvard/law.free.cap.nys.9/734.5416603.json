An amendment of the complaint was allowed, and defendants appeal. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure referred to in the opinion are as follows: \u201cSec. 723. <em>Amendments by the Court; Disregarding Immaterial Errors, eto. </em>[Amended by chapter 416, Acts 1877.] The court may, upon the trial, or at <em>any </em>other stage of the action, before or after the judgment, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as it .deems just, amend any process, pleading, or other proceeding by adding or striking out the name of a person as a party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting an allegation material to the case, or, where the amendment does not change substantially the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading or other proceeding to the facts proved; and in every stage of the action the court must disregard an error or defect in the pleadings or other proceedings which does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party. Sec. 724. <em>Relief against Omissions, etc.; Amendments to Conform Proceedings. </em>The court may likewise, in its discretion, and upon such terms as justice requires, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, or order, or other proceeding, taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and may supply an omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>sion in any proceeding. Where a proceeding taken by a party fails to conform. to a provision of this act, the court may in like manner, and upon like terms, permit an amendment thereof to conform it to the provision.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b759-3\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.

Hutchins, plaintiff\u2019s attorney herein, verified January 29,1890, and a proposed form of an amended complaint thereto annexed, and the order to show cause granted on said affidavit, returnable February 1,1890, with proof of due service thereof, and the affidavit of Theodore F. G. Demarest, of counsel for defendants, in opposition to the motion made by said order to show cause, and the transcript of the minutes of the official stenographer of this court of the proceedings had herein at the equity term of this court on January 21 and 22, 1890, submitted on the hearing of the motion, and upon all the pleadings and other proceedings herein, and after hearing Augustus S. Hutchins for the motion made by said order to show cause, and Theodore F. C. Demarest in opposition thereto, it is ordered that the complaint herein may be amended by inserting therein, after the words \u2018 greatly reduced their value,\u2019 in the eighteenth folio, the following allegation: \u2018 That the said structure, and the running of trains thereon, and the other acts of defendants hereinbefore alleged, are of a permanent, lasting, and continuous nature, and will be permanent, lasting, and continuous;\u2019 and also by inserting in the said complaint after the words \u2018greatly diminished,\u2019 in the twentieth folio, the following allegation: \u2022 That the plaintiff is obliged to seek the equitable assistance and interference of this court in order to prevent a multiplicity of actions.\u2019 And it is further ordered that, within twenty days after the service of a copy of the complaint, amended as aforesaid, upon the attorney for the defendants, the defendants shall serve their amended answer upon the attorney for the plaintiff, and that the issue herein shall remain as of the 15th day of November, 1888. This order is made conditional upon the payment of twenty dollars by the plaintiff to the defendants. And it is further ordered that the order permitting an amendment of the complaint heretofore entered in this cause on the 1st day of February, 1890, be revoked; the foregoing provisions of this order being in lieu and stead of the last-mentioned order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The chief grounds of the defendants\u2019 appeal are that the order imposes the terms on the defendants that they shall serve their amended answer on the attorney for the plaintiff within 20 days after service on them of a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint. Defendants did in fact serve such amended answer, but under protest. They do not claim that this order prevented them from demurring to the amended complaint, or that, but for the order, they would have demurred. The defendants also claim that they were prejudiced by the requirement in the order that they should answer within 20 days. That is the statutory time within which an answer must be served after service of summons. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 418, 422. The court at special term had power to make the order appealed from and it was matter of discretion. Id. \u00a7 723. The defendants, if aggrieved by the order, could have moved for resettlement, and called the attention of the court to such substantial detriment, if any, which they sustained by reason of the order. That would have been the proper and sufficient remedy. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 723, 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The other alleged grounds of appeal are without merit. The defendants\u2019 \u25a0 constitutional right to trial by jury, if such right appears on the pleadings to exist, cannot be denied; and defendant is not deprived of the exercise of that right by the order appealed from. It is a right that can be asserted at any time, and before any tribunal, unless waived. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 968,1009. The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
