Y. Supp. 804. The plaintiff credited the amount paid into court on entering his judgment. This was error. The judgment should have followed the verdict. The court below allowed the plaintiff to correct the mistake, and- conform the judgment to prescribed practice. The order so made was a proper exercise of judicial power, and the order denying the motion to vacate the judgment so corrected was right, and must be affirmed. The appellant cites sections 731 to 734 of the Code to sustain his position, but those sections refer to tender \u201cafter suit brought,\u201d and such a tender must include \u201ccosts of action\u201d to the date of the tender. The tender relied on here was one \u201cbefore suit brought;\u201d and the payment into court was to keep it good. It was \u201cwithout costs,\u201d and the rule applicable is that laid down in <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Dunning, </em>and kindred eases, before referred to. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
