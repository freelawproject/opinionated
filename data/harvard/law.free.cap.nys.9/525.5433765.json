Tyler, who took possession of the property under a bill of sale, was not a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value; that a chattel mortgage previously given upon the property was a valid lien on the same. The mortgage was filed but not renewed, and therefore, as against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers or creditors, was clearly invalid. The question of the <em>bona fldes </em>of the transaction was passed upon by the court below, and, as there was some evidence to sustain such finding, 1 do not think the judgment should be disturbed, but should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
