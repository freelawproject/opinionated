Wise--dollars on account of all goods consigned to them, the same to besold at their discretion, without limit as to-time and price. [Signed] William Rosenblatt. \u201d Plaintiffs claim that they did their best to sell the said goods, but were unable to do so, and notified the defendant he should come and take his goods away, returning the advance made by them. The defendants claim that the plaintiff guarantied that the goods should bring a certain stipulated amount, and counter-claims and demands judgment against the plaintiff for $257. The justice appears not to have allowed the counter-claim, and found judgment for the defendant without costs. If the defendant\u2019s testimony is to be believed, he was entitled to his counter-claim. The judgment, in its present form, is not authorized by the facts or practice, and should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
