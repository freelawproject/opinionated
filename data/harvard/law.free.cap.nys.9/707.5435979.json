Defendants\u2019 motion for a retaxation of costs, where the clerk taxed the cost of the stenographer\u2019s minutes used by the plaintiff in preparing amendments to the proposed case on appeal, was denied. The defendants\u2019 affidavits showed that the copy of the minutes had been procured after the trial, and before the decision of the court at the trial term. Defendants appeal. For former report, see 8 N. Y. Supp. 313.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Argued before Sedgwick, O.

To such a state of facts the opinion expressed in <em>Apparatus Co. </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>48 Hun, 154, to the effect that the fees of a stenographer for a copy of his minutes are not taxable, even when procured for the purpose of enabling a party to propose amendments to-a case, does not strictly apply. Moreover, the cases cited in support of said opinion are all cases where the fees were sought to be taxed on the entry of the original judgment, and not on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In addition, it was shown in the case at bar, in opposition to the motion for a retaxation, that the defendants had appealed to the court of appeals. This constituted, even under the decision of <em>Apparatus Co. </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>a waiver of the right to move for a retaxation. Under all the circumstances, the learned judge below was right in denying defendants\u2019 motion for a retaxation, and the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
