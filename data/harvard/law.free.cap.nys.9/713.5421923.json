The plaintiff, who was an attorney, left the court-room a short time before the case was called, \u201cleaving some one in attendance at \u25a0court to answer should the case be called during his [deponent\u2019s] absence.\u201d The plaintiff was absent from court about 15 minutes, and \u201cupon his return he learned that his case was dismissed on motion of defendants\u2019 attorney. \u201d This does not show any excuse. It is vague. It does not assert even that the plaintiff was ready and intended to go to trial. It does not give the name of plaintiff\u2019s representative in his absence, and show what that representative did, or the immediate circumstances of the dismissal of the complaint. The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
