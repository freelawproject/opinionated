The appellate court will not reverse a judgment of the court below on a mere conflict of testimony, if there is sufficient evidence to support it, although on the whole evidence the appellate court might have arrived at a different conclusion. See <em>Fixman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>14 Daly, 110. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
