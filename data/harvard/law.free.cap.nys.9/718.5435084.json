Loeber against Isaiah L. Roberts to recover damages for injury done to plaintiff\u2019s property by the negligence of defendant in setting fire to the same. Defendant, after setting up substantially a general denial, in his second defense alleges that the fire was caused by certain highly volatile, inflammable, or dangerous materials kept on the premises by plaintiff, and which, by their inflammable character, took fire, and that the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>gent keeping of such materials by plaintiff contributed to such loss. In his third defense, defendant realleged the same facts by way of a counter-claim. Plaintiff then moved for a bill of the particulars as to the second and third \u2022defenses. The motion was granted, and defendant required to furnish a bill \u25a0of the particulars of the second defense and counter-claim in his answer contained, specifying (1) what highly volatile, inflammable, or dangerous materials were used by plaintiff, and by their inflammable character took fire; (2) wherein said materials were negligently and carelessly used or exposed by plaintiff so as to cause said fire; and (8) what dangerous, volatile, inflammable, or highly combustible materials likely to ignite at a low temperature, or *o undergo chemical decomposition and to generate reaction, whereby combustion might ensue, were carelessly kept and exposed in plaintiff\u2019s room. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b743-5\">Argued before Sedgwick, <em>0.

It would promote the just investigation of the case not to \u2022call upon the defendant now and finally to specify \u201cwhat highly volatile, Inflammable, or dangerous materials were used by plaintiff, and by their inflammable character took fire, and what dangerous, volatile, inflammable, or highly combustible material likely to ignite at a low temperature, or to undergo chemical decomposition and to generate reaction, whereby combustion might ensue, were carelessly kept and exposed in plaintiff\u2019s room.\u201d The part of the order described should be modified so as to require the defendant to furnish a verified bill of particulars specifying the materials referred to, \u2022or, in case he states in the bill that he is not able to specify them, or any of them, to give a sufficient reason why he is not able to be more specific, and further to give the description of such material as fully as he is able to. The second requirement of the order should be omitted. It is: \u201cWherein said materials were negligently and carelessly used or exposed by said plaintiff so as to cause said fire.\u201d. This involves the defendant being confined in his evidence in a matter that is now as much within the knowledge of the plaintiff \u2022as of the defendant, and is not a case where it is necessary for the plaintiff to know what he will be called upon to meet. He was bound to take ordinary care as to the materials he had in his rooms. He knows what kind of care, in fact, should have been taken of them. The defendant, by his answer, proposes to prove that he did not take the proper care. The order, modified as has been indicated, should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
