J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO-\">Briggs Plumbing Products, Inc., doing business as Briggs Industries; Verson Allsteel Press, the predecessor of Allied Products Corporation (together Allied); and CR/PL, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> manufactured inexpensive bathroom sinks, hundreds of which the Fieldstone Company installed in residential developments throughout San Diego County in the 1980\u2019s. Field-stone, which brought this action to recoup costs of replacing sinks prematurely rusting and chipping, appeals from summary judgments in favor of the manufacturers. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The manufacturers produced low-cost enameled steel bathroom sinks; they carried written one-year warranties. Pursuant to Fieldstone\u2019s specification, plumbing subcontractors installed the sinks in numerous Fieldstone residential developments. Instead of lasting twenty-five or more years as expected, unsightly rusting and porcelain chipping, or \u201cpopping,\u201d occurred within one to five years, due to spot welding and inadequate coating around steel overflow outlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">In response to homeowner complaints, Fieldstone spent more than $250,000 replacing 1,900 of the enameled steel sinks with ones made of vitreous china. When the manufacturers refused to reimburse Fieldstone, it filed this suit for breach of express and implied warranties, strict liability, implied equitable indemnity and declaratory relief. The manufacturers brought motions for summary judgment, arguing the products liability claims were meritless because there was no requisite property damage. Rather, the sinks only damaged themselves, and thus damages were purely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>noncompensable economic ones. With regard to warranty issues, the manufacturers argued among other things that Fieldstone failed to give timely notice of breach of any express warranties created by their promotional materials, and lack of privity abrogated implied warranty claims. After oral argument, the trial court granted the motions. On appeal, Fieldstone contends the court erred as there are triable issues of material fact on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Summary judgment is proper only where there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The essential facts are undisputed;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the issue of whether Fieldstone suffered \u201cproperty damage\u201d or merely \u201ceconomic loss\u201d related to the sinks presents a question of law. <em>(Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumman Flxible, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 294; <em>Transwestern Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 502, 524 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Jurisdictions differ as to whether tort recovery is available where the sole physical injury is to the product itself. (2 Shapo, The Law of Products Liability (3d ed. 1994) \u00b627; Annot., Strict Products Liability: Recovery for Damage To Product Alone (1989) 72 A.L.R.4th 12.) A number of courts have allowed such recovery, finding the rationales behind the adoption of strict liability apply whether damages are to the same or other property; a large number of other courts have ruled otherwise, reasoning that warranty theories provide the exclusive remedy; and, yet \u201c[ojther courts have recognized that there may be particular exceptions to the rule of nonrecovery for mere economic damage to the product itself, based on an analysis of the nature of the defect and the risks involved. Accordingly, these courts have ruled that strict liability in tort could serve as a basis of recovery where the damage occurred in a sudden or calamitous manner, since this was akin to ordinary tort claims which ordinarily involve sudden injuries or damage, as opposed to mere deterioration over a length of time.\u201d (72 A.L.R.4th at p. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">California courts, with little or no analysis of the issue, have indicated that manufacturers may be strictly liable for physical injury to the product itself. In <em>Seely, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 9, the court held a manufacturer was liable in warranty, but not in tort, for plaintiff\u2019s lost profits incurred when a truck defect prevented its intended use. In dicta, however, the court indicated that, absent plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove causation, the manufacturer may have been strictly liable for physical injuries to the truck sustained in a rollover. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 19.) In <em>Gherna </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 639, 649-650 [55 Cal.Rptr. 94], the court impliedly held there may be a strict liability remedy where an automobile was damaged by fire as a result of a wiring defect, and in <em>International Knights of Wine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ball Corp. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 1001 [168 Cal.Rptr. 301], the court indicated that wine spoilage caused by defective metal caps was property damage for purposes of strict liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (110 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1003, 1005; <em>id. </em>at p. 1008 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Fleming, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Relying on the above cases, in <em>Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumman Flxible, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at page 293, the court broadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>stated that for purposes of strict liability, the \u201cdamaged property may consist of the product itself.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, it cautioned that tort recovery in such a situation is precluded absent \u201c. . . physical injury to the property apart from the manifestation of the defect itself. . . . The rule imposing strict liability in tort for damage to property presupposes (1) a defect and (2) <em>further </em>damage to plaintiff\u2019s property caused by the defect. When the defect and the damage are one and the same, the defect may not be considered to have caused physical injury. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumman Flxible, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 294, original italics, fn. omitted.) There, plaintiff was denied tort recovery where it, \u201c. . . pled that it purchased busses from defendant, that the busses are latently defective in that the fuel tank support members are prone to cracking; [and] that the fuel tank support members of certain of its busses are already cracked . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 294, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We conclude that here there was no injury to \u201cother property\u201d for purposes of imposing tort liability. The spot welding and inadequate coating were latent defects which made the sinks prone to rusting, chipping and premature deterioration. In other words, this case presents a routine situation in which a purchaser seeks replacement costs because a poorly designed and built product failed to meet its expectations. The doctrine of strict liability, however, is not a substitute for contract and warranty law where the purchaser\u2019s loss is the benefit of the bargain, and unless the parties specifically agree the product will perform in a certain way, the manufacturer is not responsible for its failure. (See <em>Seely, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 18-19.) Certainly, Fieldstone is a sophisticated consumer and could have specified a higher quality product; but, whether or not it is a \u201cmerchant\u201d as defined by the Uniform Commercial Code, there is no justification here for imposing tort liability on manufacturers that guaranteed their products for only one year.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reject Fieldstone\u2019s analysis, under which virtually every defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>product evidencing deterioration of any nature would constitute \u201cother property\u201d for purposes of tort recovery. Such is not the law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">C. <em>Equitable Indemnity Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">While Fieldstone\u2019s complaint did not contain negligence causes of action against the manufacturers, it alleged their \u201cbreaches\u201d created the sink defects, and therefore it was \u201centitled to complete or partial implied equitable indemnity and/or contribution\u201d from them, \u201cfor any damages sustained . . . , as well as for . . . costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred in connection with its obligations to replace the defective sinks and perform related repairs.\u201d The trial court determined the manufacturers could not be liable for indemnity, because they were not liable for Fieldstone\u2019s economic damages under either a strict liability or negligence theory as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Equitable indemnity is a restitutionary concept; it is \u201c \u2018 \u201ca right which enures to a person who, without active fault on his part, has been compelled by reason of some legal obligation, to pay damages occasioned by the initial negligence of another, and for which he himself is only secondarily liable.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Western Steamship Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 100, 108 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 263, 876 P.2d 1062].) \u201cIndemnity does not invariably follow fault; it is premised on a joint legal obligation to another for damages.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114.) Accordingly, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]here can be no indemnity without joint and several liability by the prospective indemnitor and indemnitee ....\u201d\u2019 [Citations.].\u201d <em>(GEM Developers </em>v. <em>Hallcraft Homes of San Diego, Inc. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 419, 430 [261 Cal.Rptr. 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">As discussed above, strict liability has no application here. It is also well settled that <em>Seely, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 9, ordinarily precludes recovery for economic losses under a negligence theory. <em>(San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1329.)  Fieldstone, however, alternatively argues its claim is viable under <em>J\u2019Aire Corp. </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 799, 806 [157 Cal.Rptr. 407, 598 P.2d 60] <em>(J\u2019Aire), </em>in which the court held economic damages are recoverable in a negligence action, despite the absence of physical or personal injury, if the parties have a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 804; see <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Alfa-Laval Agri, Inc. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 790]; <em>Huang </em>v. <em>Garner </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 404, 422 [203 Cal.Rptr. 800].) The determination whether a special relationship exists is a matter of policy and involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the balancing of various factors, including \u201c(1) the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff, (2) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (3) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, (4) the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, (5) the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct and (6) the policy of preventing future harm.\u201d <em>(J\u2019Aire, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 804; <em>Huang </em>v. <em>Garner, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 423.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In an attempt to meet the <em>J\u2019Aire </em>test, Fieldstone asserts it submitted evidence in opposition to the motions for summaiy judgment, establishing: (1) the manufacturers \u201cknew that their bathroom sinks would be installed in middle-class homes . . . , [t]he sinks were specifically made for that purpose\u201d; (2) the manufacturers \u201calso knew that defects causing rusting and chipping would render the lavatories unserviceable and the homeowners would be harmed\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]here is no doubt here that the homeowners were damaged because the sinks had to be replaced for both aesthetic and functional reasons\u201d; (4) \u201c[t]he defective design and workmanship of the lavatories directly caused the unsightly, debilitating damage\u201d; (5) \u201cBriggs and [Allied] both knew their lavatories leaked, rusted and chipped, but warned no one\u201d; and, (6) \u201c[h]olding [the manufacturers] responsible for damages caused by the defective lavatories will encourage them to produce more sound products in the future, and discourage them from placing unsuitable products into the stream of commerce which flows straight into the laps of very unhappy consumers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Fieldstone\u2019s analysis fails because the evidence does not suggest the transactions in question were intended to affect Fieldstone or the homeowners \u201cin any way particular to [them], as opposed to all potential purchasers of the equipment. The absence of this foundation precludes a finding of \u2018special relationship\u2019 as required by J\u2019Aire: to the extent the [product] was intended to affect [Fieldstone or the homeowners] in the same way as all retail buyers, this becomes a traditional products liability or negligence case in which economic damages are not available. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ott </em>v. <em>Alfa-Laval Agri, Inc., supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1455-1456, fn. omitted.) We need not consider the remaining parts of the <em>J\u2019Aire </em>test. \u201cEven if [they] weighed in favor of finding a duty of care, we would still conclude that no duty existed. If a duty of care to avoid economic injury existed in the circumstances of the present case, every manufacturer would become an insurer, potentially forever, against economic loss from negligent defects in a product used for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>its intended purpose. <em>J\u2019Aire </em>neither requires nor supports such a radical departure from traditional notions of liability.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">D. <em>Express Warranty Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"> jn opposition to the manufacturers\u2019 motions, Fieldstone argued they breached express warranties created by their promotional literature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court, however, found that as a matter of law Fieldstone failed to give reasonable notice as required by California Uniform Commercial Code section 2607, subdivision (3)(A). It provides, \u201c[t]he buyer must, within a reasonable time after he or she discovers or should have discovered any breach, notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> On appeal, Fieldstone contends the notice requirement is inapplicable because there was no privity of contract between it and the manufacturers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Fieldstone relies on <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57, 61 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d 1049], in which the court held the notice requirement \u201cis not an appropriate one for the court to adopt in actions by injured consumers against manufacturers with whom they have not dealt. [Citations.]\u201d The court further explained, however, that \u201c \u2018[a]s applied to personal injuries, and notice to a remote seller, it becomes a booby-trap for the unwary. The injured consumer is seldom \u201csteeped in the business practice which justifies the rule,\u201d [citation] and at least until he has had legal advice it will not occur to him to give notice to one with whom he has had no dealings.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">That is hardly the situation where, as here, plaintiff is a sophisticated development company which has built many thousands of homes over the last two decades. In fact, after <em>Greenman, </em>the court held the notice requirement applied to an implied warranty claim against a developer. It stated: \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>treating common law warranties, it has been recognized that statutory standards should be utilized where appropriate. [Citations.] The requirement of notice of breach is based on a sound commercial rule designed to allow the defendant opportunity for repairing the defective item, reducing damages, avoiding defective products in the future, and negotiating settlements. The notice requirement also protects against stale claims. [Citation.] These considerations are as applicable to builders and sellers of new construction as to manufacturers and dealers of chattels.\u201d <em>(Pollard </em>v. <em>Saxe &amp; Yolles Dev. Co. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 374, 380 [115 Cal.Rptr. 648, 525 P.2d 88].) <em>Presiding Bishop </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.2d 492, upon which Fieldstone also relies, was decided several years before <em>Pollard, </em>and is factually dissimilar, as there, a \u201cperson in the position of the [Bishop] ordinarily would not be aware of his rights as against the manufacturer until he had received legal advice predicated upon an adequate investigation of the facts as to the manufacturer\u2019s participation in the chain of events culminating in damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 515.) Again, such is not the situation here, and we accordingly conclude the notice provision applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Alternatively, Fieldstone contends it gave the manufacturers reasonable notice. It submitted evidence of the following: Fieldstone\u2019s sink replacements \u201cbegan in January 1988. The lavatory replacements were 66 for the year in 1988, with a slowly increasing frequency of replacement in 1989 (158 for the year) and 1990 (209 for the year). However, in 1991, replacements more than equalled what they had been in 1988, 1989 and 1990 combined\u2014replacements in 1991 were 460 for the year.\u201d Initially, Field-stone believed the sink problems were associated with homeowner abuse; however, by 1989 it \u201cbelieved the rusting and chipping to be a problem with the lavatories,\u201d but it was unaware \u201cof the origin or cause of the problem.\u201d Fieldstone only learned of the specific nature of the sink defects after it filed this action in September 1993. On March 14, 1991, Fieldstone\u2019s then customer service manager, Robert Chappell, sent Briggs a letter notifying it of the sink problems. It also sent a letter to a person at Delco Products whom Chappell \u201cvaguely recall[ed] . . . was a [CR/PL] representative.\u201d There is no evidence Fieldstone apprised Allied of any problem before it filed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The question of whether notice was reasonable must be determined from the particular circumstances and, where but one inference can be drawn from undisputed facts, the issue may be determined as a matter of law. <em>(Whitfield </em>v. <em>Jessup </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 826, 832 [193 P.2d 1]; <em>Ice Bowl, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spalding Sales Corp. </em>(1943) 56 Cal.App.2d 918, 922 [133 P.2d 846].) Here, we conclude from the undisputed facts that Fieldstone failed to give the manufacturers reasonable notice of breach of any express warranties. (See <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Herring H. M. Safe Co. </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d Supp. 874, 877 [280 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>P.2d 549] [delay of 15 months unreasonable as matter of law]; <em>Ice Bowl, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spalding Sales Corp., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.2d at pp. 921-922 [delay of four months unreasonable as matter of law].) Although perhaps not aware of the specific causes, Fieldstone knew the sinks were defective for three years before giving notice to Briggs and CR/PL; it gave Allied no indication of a problem for five years, until it filed this lawsuit. (See <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Saxe &amp; Yolles Dev. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 380 [ignorance of specific nature of defect does not excuse failure to give notice].)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">E. <em>Implied Warranty Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The trial court determined as a matter of law, Fieldstone\u2019s implied warranty claims were meritless because it had no privity with the manufacturers. We conclude there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u201cVertical privity is a prerequisite in California for recovery on a theory of breach of the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(U.S. Roofing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Credit Alliance Corp. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1431, 1441 [279 Cal.Rptr. 533].) \u201c[T]here is no privity between the original seller and a subsequent purchaser who is in no way a party to the original sale. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Burr </em>v. <em>Sherwin Williams Co., supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">While conceding it did not contract with the manufacturers, Fieldstone argues that because at least Briggs and CR/PL \u201cmake sales calls on developers such as Fieldstone,\u201d and \u201cFieldstone\u2019s plumbers special ordered shipments of lavatories for use in Fieldstone\u2019s specifically designated projects,\u201d \u201cFieldstone is a purchaser from respondent as much as it is from its plumbers . . . within the overall context of the relationships among the parties.\u201d We reject such a notion. Further, Fieldstone\u2019s reliance on <em>Presiding Bishop </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.2d 492, in arguing the \u201coverly technical\u201d privity requirement should not be applied, is misplaced as that case involved only an express warranty cause of action.

The rule serves the dual purposes of protecting the consumer\u2019s reasonable expectations, and preventing a manufacturer from suffering liability for damages of unknown and unlimited scope. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 17-19.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\">In support of its argument, Fieldstone relied on the declaration of a mechanical engineer, in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFG\">\u201cIt is my opinion that the pressed-steel lavatories suffer from a design defect involving the use of spot welds to seal the flange of the overflow channel to the bottom of the lavatory. The lavatories also suffer from a manufacturing defect insofar as there is a lack of or insufficient coating on the inside of the overflow channel to seal the crevice between the flange and the bowl. These defects allow water to come into contact with bare steel. The resulting damage is rusting in the overflow channel which conodes the lavatory; the oxidation also causes the porcelain coating on the user side of the lavatory to \u2018pop\u2019 or chip off, which in turn creates an environment conducive to further rusting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALr\">\u201cThe lavatories suffer from yet another manufacturing defect; there is insufficient coating of the edge of the overflow hole. Again, this allows water to come into contact with uncoated steel which then rusts; the rust undermines the integrity of the adjacent porcelain coating, causing it to chip off; when the porcelain is chipped off, more steel is exposed and more rusting ensues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AosW\">\u201cIn replacing the lavatories, it is also necessary to replace the pop-up and other items (such as the trap) which may become damaged or otherwise require replacement either because of the lavatory\u2019s damage or the repair/replacement process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASW\">Fieldstone also relied on the declaration of a professional metallurgical and corrosion engineer, who held the same opinions regarding the nature of defects and damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Fieldstone\u2019s reliance on <em>Raven\u2019s Cove Townhomes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Knuppe Development Co. </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 783 [171 Cal.Rptr. 334] and <em>Kriegler </em>v. <em>Eichler Homes, Inc. </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 224 [74 Cal.Rptr. 749] is misplaced as neither court discussed whether a manufacturer is liable in tort for damages solely to its product. \u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Cornejo </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 381,388 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 81,916 P.2d 476], fn. omitted.)

In <em>U.S. Roofing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Credit Alliance Corp., supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at page 1442, parties were in privity for purposes of implied warranty claims where there was considerable evidence they dealt directly with each other vis-\u00e1-vis .the purchase; in <em>Gilbert Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Steelform Contracting Co. </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 65, 69 [145 Cal.Rptr. 448], the issue of privity was not decided because plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>was a third party beneficiary to the parties\u2019 written contract; <em>Atlas Vegetable Exchange, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 868 [89 Cal.Rptr. 274], is not a warranty case and <em>Odell </em>v. <em>Frueh </em>(1956) 146 Cal.App.2d 504, 508 [304 P.2d 45, 76 A.L.R.2d 345] is another express warranty case based on plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the manufacturer\u2019s express representations, and thus privity was not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Additionally, we find no merit to Fieldstone\u2019s contention the trial court erred in granting Allied\u2019s joinder in the motions of Briggs and CR/PL, because it failed to submit its own evidence in support.
