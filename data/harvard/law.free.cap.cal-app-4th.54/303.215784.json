She contends the court erred in granting Mercury\u2019s motion for summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Kara Hitchcock and her fianc\u00e9 Jason Apodaca were registered owners of a 1983 Mercedes 190E. In August 1993, Hitchcock secured insurance from Mercury and the following month was involved in an automobile accident. Apodaca, a passenger at the time of accident, was injured. Mercury paid $3,617 for his medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Unsatisfied, Apodaca filed a personal injury action against Hitchcock. Mercury refused to defend or indemnify Hitchcock, based on policy provisions specifically excluding coverage for bodily injury claims brought by an \u201cinsured,\u201d defined as all persons \u201clegally responsible\" for the car. Hitchcock responded by filing the underlying complaint against Mercury for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The court granted Mercury\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding, \u201cApodaca was an insured under the Mercury policy at the time of the . . . accident by virtue of the undisputed fact that he was a registered owner of, and thereby a person legally responsible for the use of, the vehicle . . . Hitchcock was driving at the time of the accident. [Because] [t]he Mercury policy clearly excludes from coverage the bodily injury claims of an insured . . . there can be no indemnification or defense for . . . Hitchcock against the bodily injury claims of . . . Apodaca arising out of the automobile accident.\u201d Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The parties do not dispute Mercury\u2019s right to exclude \u201cinsureds\u201d from bodily injury coverage. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, subd. (c)(5).) Nor do they disagree Mercury was statutorily mandated to define \u201cpersons insured\u201d in its policy as, inter alia, \u201cany other person using, or <em>legally responsible </em>for the use of, [an owned or non-owned] motor vehicle, provided such use is by the named insured or with his or her permission, express or implied, and within the scope of such permission . . . .\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, former subd. (b)(4), italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue presented is the definition of persons \u201clegally responsible\u201d within the context of Insurance Code section 11580.1, former subdivision (b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The trial court agreed with Mercury\u2019s argument Vehicle Code section 17150 is controlling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section provides, <em>\u201cEvery owner </em>of a motor vehicle is liable and responsible for death or injury to person or property resulting from a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of the motor vehicle, ... by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of the owner.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, a vehicle owner who knowingly lends his or her car to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>person, is legally responsible for damages occurring during its use. It is undisputed Apodaca is a registered owner of the Mercedes, and Hitchcock was driving the car with his permission at the time of the accident. Apodaca is therefore deemed \u201clegally responsible\u201d and falls within the definition of an \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Hitchcock contends the Legislature enacted section 17150 to <em>protect </em>innocent injured third parties. She maintains a strict interpretation of the section to aid insurance companies \u201cis a perversion\u201d of legislative intent because \u201cby no stretch of the imagination could Mercury ... be considered the type of innocent party that was intended to be protected by section 17150.\u201d She fails, however, to suggest any alternative means of defining \u201clegally responsible,\u201d nor does she offer any authority, and we have found none, holding this is an improper interpretation of section 17150.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, insurance carriers are not precluded from relying on existing law in interpreting statutorily imposed definitions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 23, 27 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 340] [must assume Legislature has existing law in mind when enacting a new statute].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Mercury shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Sills, P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Insurance Code section 11580.1, former subdivision (b)(4) requires automobile liability policies to cover all persons responsible for the use of the vehicle. Thus, it mandates companies include in their policies a \u201c[provision affording insurance to the named insured . . . and . . . any other person using, or legally responsible for the use of [the insured] motor vehicle, provided such use is by the named insured or with his or her permission.\u201d Mercury incorporated this statutory language within its policy when defining \u201cpersons insured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">All further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">As respondent points out, the authorities upon which Hitchcock relies are patently inapt. In <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Russell </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 391 [322 P.2d 486] and <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Pippin </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 796 [113 Cal.Rptr. 698] the issue of whether section 17150 can be used to define \u201clegally responsible\u201d in the Insurance Code was not raised. <em>Ledgerwood </em>v. <em>Ledgerwood </em>(1931) 114 Cal.App. 538 [300 P. 144] does not even mention section 17150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Shortly after the accident, the Legislature amended Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4). It deleted the phrase \u201clegally responsible\u201d from the definition of \u201cpersons insured.\u201d Hitchcock argues this should be viewed as a statement of public policy which can be applied retroactively. But \u201c \u2018legislative enactments are generally presumed to operate <em>prospectively </em>and not retroactively unless the Legislature expresses a different intention.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1208 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585], italics added.) Nothing in the amended Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4) indicates the statue is to apply retroactively. To the contrary, for the past 25 years the Legislature has mandated insurance companies include the phrase \u201clegally responsible\u201d when defining those insured under an automobile liability insurance contract. There is no sound reason to now retroactively deem unenforceable as against public policy the millions of contracts with such provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
