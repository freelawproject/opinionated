The investigator contacted the police, apprising them of defendant\u2019s involvement and his request for an attorney, and defendant accompanied the investigator to the police department. Without obtaining an attorney for defendant, police advised defendant of his <em>Miran</em>da<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. Defendant indicated he understood, signed a waiver, and submitted to a videotaped interview regarding the shooting incident. The trial court suppressed defendant\u2019s statements to the police, finding they could be used only for impeachment purposes under <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 675 [108 S.Ct. 2093, 100 L.Ed.2d 704]. The court found defendant had requested counsel, counsel had not been provided, and further interrogation was initiated by police, not defendant. The People appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In a case involving charges of attempted murder in a shooting incident, the Yolo County Public Defender\u2019s Office represented the alleged perpetrator, Jose Villa. Robert Samaniego, an investigator for the public defender\u2019s office, identified defendant Alfred Calderon as a potential witness who might benefit Villa\u2019s defense. Samaniego kept Detective Armando Fernandez of the Woodland Police Department informed of his efforts, and Detective Fernandez told Samaniego \u201cas soon as you can locate [defendant], . . . you hand him over to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Samaniego eventually located defendant at a friend\u2019s apartment. Samaniego showed defendant his badge, stating he was \u201cfrom the Yolo County Public Defender\u2019s office and . . . was investigating the Jose Villa case.\u201d He then asked defendant to accompany him to his office to complete the interview. Defendant did so, identifying the public defender\u2019s office as the \u201csheriff\u2019s station.\u201d In the course of a 17-minute interview, defendant indicated his involvement in the shooting incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At this point, Samaniego asked if he could tape their interview, and defendant responded he wanted an attorney. Samaniego terminated the interview and contacted the Woodland Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Detective Fernandez and two other police officers met Samaniego outside the public defender\u2019s office and Samaniego related what had happened. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Samaniego then transported defendant to the Woodland Police Department. At the police station, Detective Fernandez told defendant they were investigating a shooting and believed he was involved. Fernandez advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; defendant signed a waiver and submitted to a videotaped interview. Fernandez placed defendant under arrest at the conclusion of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Defendant subsequently moved to quash his implicating statement to Samaniego and his later statements to police. The trial court found: \u201c[T]he motion to quash the statement made to Robert Samaniego, the Public Defender investigatory must be denied. From all of the evidence, I do not find and cannot find, frankly, that the defendant was in custody at the time he gave the statement to Mr. Samaniego. And if he\u2019s not in custody, then obviously it makes no difference whether Mr. Samaniego was cooperating with the police or there\u2019s a parallel investigation or how we want to characterize the relationship between Samaniego and Fernandez. . . . [&lt;U Samaniego asked [defendant] whether he would go down to the office. [Defendant] admitted on the stand that he voluntarily agreed to accompany Mr. Samaniego to the office. [Defendant] sat in the front seat of an unmarked, white Ford when he drove down to Mr. Samaniego\u2019s office. So there\u2019s nothing that would suggest that he was under arrest. [*][]... I recognize that [defendant] says he thought he was in the sheriff\u2019s department, but there is no reason a reasonable person would come to that conclusion. There\u2019s nobody in uniform in that particular area, there\u2019s nothing about the building to suggest that it\u2019s the police department. [Defendant] didn\u2019t know that the building had previously been the site of the Yolo County Sheriff\u2019s Department. So the site of the interview itself would not indicate that the defendant is in custody. . . . [^Q For all those reasons, then, the statement made to Mr. Samaniego would not be suppressed. ...[*]\u25a1 After reviewing the most recently filed points and authorities, I still find that the U.S. Supreme Court case of Arizona versus Roberson [citation] is the only case that addresses the issue before the Court. In that case, the Supreme Court held that once a defendant has asked for counsel, he cannot be interrogated further, if the police initiate the interrogation. According to the Supreme Court, this is true even if the second officer who conducts the subsequent interrogation does not know that the defendant has invoked his rights. [H That holding then dictates that the videotaped statement is inadmissible in the People\u2019s case in chief. That does not mean, however, the statement is inadmissible for any purpose. [*][] Based on the evidence in this case, I would find that the statement given to Officer Fernandez was not coerced, the defendant was fully Mirandized, the defendant indicated that he understood his rights, and he unhesitatingly said that he would waive his rights and talk to the police. [U Therefore, I find that the statement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>voluntarily made and that statement can be used for impeachment purposes, if the defendant chooses to testify in that particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">At a subsequent hearing, the prosecutor stated she was unable to proceed to trial \u201cdue to the Court\u2019s pretrial ruling.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the charges against defendant, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The trial court phrased the underlying issue as follows: \u201cIf a police officer learns from a private citizen that a suspect has said he wants to talk to an attorney, is the police officer precluded from interrogating the defendant, even if the police officer Mirandizes the defendant and the defendant says he\u2019s willing to talk\u201d? The limited case law on this issue indicates the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The trial court expressly found defendant was not in custody during his questioning by Samaniego, and it was during this questioning that defendant invoked his right to counsel. In discussing the right to counsel, the United States Supreme Court has noted: \u201cWe have in fact never held that a person can invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights anticipatorily, in a context other than \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 . . . . If the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel can be invoked at a preliminary hearing, it could be argued, there is no logical reason why it could not be invoked by a letter prior to arrest, or indeed even prior to identification as a suspect. Most rights must be asserted when the government seeks to take the action they protect against. The fact that we have allowed the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, once asserted, to be effective with respect to future custodial interrogation does not necessarily mean that we will allow it to be asserted initially outside the context of custodial interrogation, with similar future effect.\u201d <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 171, 182, fn. 3 [111 S.Ct. 2204, 2211, 115 L.Ed.2d 158, 171]; see also <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Hines </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 963 F.2d 255, 256 [\u201c[i]t is well established . . . that the Fifth Amendment right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>does not vest until a defendant is taken into custody.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Although this passage in <em>McNeil </em>is dicta, we consider it \u201cwith deference.\u201d <em>(See Alston </em>v. <em>Redman </em>(3d Cir. 1994) 34 F.3d 1237, 1246.) Moreover, \u201c[t]he antipathy expressed in <em>McNeil </em>towards the anticipatory invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>rights is consistent with <em>Miranda's </em>underlying principles. The <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel is a prophylactic rule that does not operate independent from the danger it seeks to protect against\u2014\u2018the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation\u2019\u2014and the effect that danger can have on a suspect\u2019s privilege to avoid compelled self-incrimination. [Citation.] To allow an individual to interpose <em>Miranda </em>in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>situation outside the custodial interrogation context would represent an unwarranted extension of Miranda's procedural safeguards, an extension best left to the discretion of the Supreme Court, which devised the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards in the first place and which has quite recently expressed disinterest in expanding them. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Accordingly, it was error to suppress defendant\u2019s statements to the police, and we remand this matter for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The trial court\u2019s order on the motion to suppress defendant\u2019s statements to the Woodland Police Department, and the order of dismissal resulting therefrom, are reversed. The matter is remanded with directions to the superior court to vacate the judgment of dismissal and enter a new and different order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Sims, Acting P.
