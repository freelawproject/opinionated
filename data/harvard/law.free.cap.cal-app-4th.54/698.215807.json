Camarena appeals from a superior court judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate in a case arising out of Camarena\u2019s disciplinary discharge from his employment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">Camarena was an employee of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (DFA). He was a maintenance mechanic in charge of the mechanic shop at the 32d District Agricultural Association (DAA) Orange County Fair. On February 18, 1992, he gave a new 121-volt battery owned by the fair to a coworker, Fernando Esquivel, for Esquivel\u2019s personal use. At the same time, Esquivel gave Camarena $10. The fair\u2019s management learned about the transaction from Albert Aguirre, Camarena\u2019s assistant, and asked the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">On June 6, Esquivel was notified of a five-day suspension for misuse of state property. A few days later, Camarena threatened Aguirre, waving a document in his face, calling him a \u201crat,\u201d and making a throat-slashing gesture. And on June 20, he pretended to point a gun at Aguirre as the two crossed paths in the parking lot. Believing Camarena wanted to kill him, Aguirre reported the threats to a coworker and to law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">On June 24, consistent with DFA procedures, Norman Bartosik, DAA\u2019s secretary-manager of the fair, signed a notice of adverse action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Camarena, advising him of his discharge based on dishonesty, misuse of state property and threats against Aguirre. Camarena immediately filed a notice of disciplinary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld Camarena\u2019s discharge, finding the three bases for the adverse action were established by a preponderance of evidence. He further found even though DAA was not Camarena\u2019s employer, its fair manager, Bartosik, had authority to act as DFA\u2019s agent, and DFA properly delegated the authority. Concurring with these findings, the State Personnel Board (the board) adopted the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Camarena petitioned for writ of mandate in the superior court, seeking reinstatement with backpay and restoration of all benefits. For reasons not relevant to the appeal, the court initially granted the petition, but then recalled the writ order. Upon reconsideration, it entered a judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Camarena advances two theories for reversal of the judgment: He contends his termination was invalid because Bartosik was unauthorized to sign the notice of adverse action, and there is insufficient evidence to support the finding he engaged in the conduct upon which his discharge was based. Neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">We apply the substantial evidence test in reviewing a decision of the board. <em>(Flowers </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 753, 758 [220 Cal.Rptr. 139].) We do not reweigh the evidence; we indulge all presumptions and resolve all conflicts in favor of the board\u2019s decision. Its findings come before us \u201cwith a strong presumption as to their correctness and regularity.\u201d <em>(Pereyda </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 47, 50 [92 Cal.Rptr. 746].) We do not substitute our own judgment if the board\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018 \u201cis one which could have been made by reasonable people. . . .\u201d [Citation.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Wilson v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 865, 870 [130 Cal.Rptr. 292].) Moreover, we give great deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes affecting issues within the its administrative sphere. <em>(Nipper </em>v. <em>California Auto. Assigned Risk Plan </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 35, 45 [136 Cal.Rptr. 854, 560 P.2d 743] [\u201cWe have generally accorded respect to administrative interpretations of a law and, unless clearly erroneous, have deemed them significant factors in ascertaining statutory meaning and purpose\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Camarena argues a notice of adverse action is ineffective unless signed by an authorized person. He claims the DAA could not fire him because it is not a state agency and is without statutory power to discipline a state employee; he further contends DFA could not delegate its disciplinary authority to the DAA. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In reviewing disciplinary actions, the board must necessarily interpret, enforce and administer the Civil Service Act, Government Code section 18500 et seq. (All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise stated.) In deciding whether the DAA had the power to terminate Camarena, the board interpreted section 19574, which states, in pertinent part, \u201cThe appointing power [here, DFA], or its authorized representative, may take adverse action against an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Camarena insists the word \u201cauthorized\u201d means \u201cstatutorily authorized.\u201d DFA contends Camarena\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the clear language of the statute. Moreover, it argues, the board\u2019s interpretation of section 19574 as authorizing DFA to delegate the authority for bringing an adverse action comports with the statute\u2019s plain language and harmonizes with the Civil Service Act as a whole. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In the first place, we cannot adopt Camarena\u2019s interpretation because we would have to rewrite the statute to read, \u201cThe appointing power, or <em>a </em>statutorily-authorized representative, may take adverse action against an employee.\u201d But in construing a statute, we \u201ccannot create exceptions, contravene plain meaning, insert what is omitted, omit what is inserted, or rewrite the statute.\u201d <em>(San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Classroom Teachers Assn. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 146, 149 [272 Cal.Rptr. 38].)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In the second place, statutes are to be construed in the context of the whole body of laws of which they are a part. <em>(San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Classroom Teachers Assn., supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 150.) Section 19574 must be read to harmonize with section 18572, which gives the DFA virtually unrestricted power to delegate its authority to take disciplinary action. Section 18572 provides, \u201cWhenever a power is granted or a duty imposed upon an appointing power, the power may be exercised or the duty performed by a deputy of the appointing power or by a person authorized pursuant to law by him [or her], unless it is expressly otherwise provided.\u201d Clearly, DFA, the appointing power, may delegate the duty of executing adverse actions to the fair manager because no law expressly prohibits such delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Indeed, DFA\u2019s formal guidelines and protocols specifically provide for delegation of authority to the fair manager to implement and execute formal adverse actions. DFA\u2019s \u201c1989 Supervisor\u2019s Guide to Employee Conduct and Discipline\u201d sets forth the fair manager\u2019s responsibility for reviewing all documentation regarding adverse action and signing the notice. Of course, pursuant to powers and duties defined in the Food and Agriculture Code, DFA reserves the right to review adverse actions to ensure their conformance to agency practices. And DFA retains the right to consent to the DAA\u2019s delegating implementation of management policies to the fair manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We need not discuss the plethora of cases cited by Camarena to prove his point. Without exception, they involve distinguishable factual situations or legal issues having no bearing on the validity of the authority delegated to and exercised by the fair manager here. Likewise, Camarena misconstrues the statutes upon which he relies. He has no legitimate basis for his claim his discharge was procedurally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Endorsing the conclusion of the board, the superior court found, \u201cThe signing of a Notice of Adverse Action by a Fair Manager does not invalidate the disciplinary action taken against a maintenance worker working at the 32nd District Agricultural Association.\u201d Not only was that finding correct, any other finding would have been clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Camarena\u2019s only other challenge to the judgment is insufficiency of evidence. He argues the testimony of witnesses against him was not credible and \u201cthe overwhelming weight of evidence\u201d established he simply loaned the battery to Esquivel who, coincidentally, loaned Camarena $10 to buy lunch that day. We remind Camarena we do not assess credibility or reweigh the evidence, so his arguments about the battery incident are of no avail. There were witnesses who testified not only to the transaction involving the exchange of the battery and the $10, but to a history of missing items from the mechanic shop under Camarena\u2019s watch. The evidence and inferences provide a legally sufficient basis for establishing Camarena\u2019s misuse of property owned by the fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Moreover, Camarena does not attack, and thus concedes, the proof of his harassing and intimidating conduct toward Aguirre which, as DFA notes, provides a sufficient basis for dismissal under section 19572, subdivision (t) \u2014\u201cOther failure of good behavior either during or outside of duty hours which is of such a nature that it causes discredit to the appointing authority or the persons\u2019 employment.\u201d The conduct was clearly related to Camarena\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>performance of his job duties and affected Aguirre\u2019s ability to perform his duties as Camarena\u2019s assistant: Aguirre feared for his life. (See, e.g., <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 729, 739 [164 Cal.Rptr. 557] [the test under subdivision (t) is \u201cwhether (1) there is a connection between the offensive conduct and the employee\u2019s duties, and (2) whether the uttered threats would risk impairment or disruption of public services\u201d].) As the ALJ noted in his decision, \u201c[T]hese implied death threats are management\u2019s primary reasons for [Camarena\u2019s] dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On this record, the superior court properly found, \u201cThere is substantial evidence to support Respondent State Personnel Board\u2019s finding that petitioner had engaged in the conduct with which he was charged in the underlying adverse action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The judgment is affirmed. DFA shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Wallin, Acting P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
