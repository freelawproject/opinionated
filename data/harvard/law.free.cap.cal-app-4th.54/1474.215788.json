(See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hotel Employees </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 491, 500-501 [104 S.Ct. 3179, 3184-3185, 82 L.Ed.2d 373, 382-383].) It provides order. Instead of having 50 or more standards with respect to a given human pursuit, there is one. When a preemptive federal standard is applied evenhandedly, it provides both the protection of the federal standard and some leeway to develop further state standards where the federal standard does not apply. With respect to medical devices that represent the highest risk to human life, the federal government imposes standards specific to each of those devices, and Congress has declared that the federal standard is preemptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Plaintiff Patricia Steele sued defendant Collagen Corporation, the maker of Zyderm Collagen Implants, because she developed an autoimmune disorder after receiving a test injection of Zyderm. The trial court concluded that all of her causes of action were preempted and granted Collagen Corporation\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse and remand because, even though there is an applicable federal regulatory standard of care for the design, manufacture, and marketing of Zyderm, it is unclear whether Steele asserts Collagen Corporation violated the federal regulatory standard of care or it violated a preempted state common law tort standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">Steele sued Collagen Corporation alleging causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation against Collagen Corporation. She later amended her complaint adding a cause of action alleging unfair trade practices. The basis of her complaint is that Zyderm caused her to suffer from an autoimmune disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">Collagen Corporation moved for summary judgment. It asserted Steele\u2019s causes of action are preempted by the Medical Device Amendments (MDA) to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because Zyderm was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360c, 360k.) In its separate statement of undisputed facts, Collagen Corporation claimed it had submitted Zyderm to the FDA for premarket approval and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>that the FDA had given its approval, certifying that Zyderm \u201chad been shown to be safe and effective for use as recommended in the submitted labeling.\u201d Collagen Corporation, however, did not claim as an undisputed fact that it had conformed to all of the requirements arising from the FDA approval. The trial court agreed that Steele\u2019s causes of action were preempted. It granted the motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of Collagen Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Steele appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">\n<em>The Medical Device Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">In 1976, Congress enacted the MDA, which provided for the classification and regulation of devices intended for human use. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c.) The most stringent controls apply to devices placed in class III under the MDA. \u201cBefore a new Class III device may be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must provide the FDA with a \u2018reasonable assurance\u2019 that the device is both safe and effective. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(d)(2). Despite its relatively innocuous phrasing, the process of establishing this \u2018reasonable assurance,\u2019 which is known as the \u2018premarket approval,\u2019 or \u2018PMA\u2019 process, is a rigorous one. Manufacturers must submit detailed information regarding the safety and efficacy of their devices, which the FDA then reviews, spending an average of 1,200 hours on each submission. . . .

Any subsequent changes in the product require submission of a PMA supplement application. (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.39 (1995).) Furthermore, to ensure continued validity of the PMA, the product sponsor is required to submit postapproval reports at one-year intervals, identifying any changes in the device or any reports from clinical investigation or scientific literature concerning the device. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360i; 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.84 (1995).)\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>CIBA Vision Corp. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 307, 315 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 902].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">\u201cNot all, nor even most, Class III devices on the market today have received premarket approval because of two important exceptions to the PMA requirement. First, Congress realized that existing medical devices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>could not be withdrawn from the market while the FDA completed its PMA analysis for those devices. The statute therefore includes a \u2018grandfathering\u2019 provision which allows pre-1976 devices to remain on the market without FDA approval until such time as the FDA initiates and completes the requisite PMA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(b)(1)(A); 21 CFR \u00a7 814.1(c)(1). Second, to prevent manufacturers of grandfathered devices from monopolizing the market while new devices clear the PMA hurdle, and to ensure that improvements to existing devices can be rapidly introduced into the market, the Act also permits devices that are \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019 to preexisting devices to avoid the PMA process.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at p. 2247, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 711], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Zyderm is a class III device that received FDA premarket approval in 1981. In 1991, at the behest of Congressman John D. Dingell, the FDA reconsidered its 1981 approval of Zyderm. Congressman Dingell expressed concern that Zyderm caused adverse reactions in the immune system. After reconsidering Collagen Corporation\u2019s application, the FDA determined the market approval for Zyderm was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">\n<em>Federal Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">Federal preemption is grounded in the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution and provides that a state law is preempted if Congress so intends. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 516 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407, 422].) Congress may make its intention explicit by including preemptive language in a law or it may imply preemption by the law\u2019s structure and purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 516-517 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2617-2618, 120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 422-423].) Any state law that conflicts with a federal law is preempted. And any state law that invades a legislative field thoroughly occupied by federal law is also preempted. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">Federal laws may preempt not only state legislation but also state common law. Common law damage awards can be a potent method of governing conduct and imposing requirements on manufacturers. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 521-522 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2620].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">There is a presumption against federal preemption. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 523-524 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2621].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-12\">\n<em>Preemption Under the MDA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-13\">The MDA contains an explicit preemption provision: \u201c[N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>respect to a device intended for human use any requirement [&lt;]\u25a1 (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and [U (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\u201d (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a) (hereafter \u00a7 360k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Construing section 360k, the FDA has promulgated the following regulation: \u201cState or local requirements are preempted only when the [FDA] has established <em>specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device </em>under the act, thereby making any existing divergent <em>State or local requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the specific </em>[FDA] <em>requirements. . . . </em>[^ (1) Section 521(a) [of the act] does not preempt State or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices (e.g., requirements such as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices. [&lt;][] (2) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements that are equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements imposed by or under the act.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1(d) (1996), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Most courts that have dealt with the issue of MDA preemption with respect to class III devices that have passed through the PMA process, including cases involving Zyderm, have concluded some or all state common law claims are preempted. (See, e.g., <em>Stamps </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1993) 984 F.2d 1416; <em>King </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp. </em>(1st Cir. 1993) 983 F.2d 1130; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>CIBA Vision Corp., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 318-319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently decided a preemption case under the MDA. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S._[116 S.Ct. 2240].) Consequently, we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the effect of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">Justice Stevens wrote the lead opinion, which is divided into seven sections. Four other justices, including Justice Breyer, joined him in five of the seven sections. Justice Breyer, however, did not join sections IV and VI of the lead opinion, leaving only three justices who joined Justice Stevens on those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">Section I summarized the law concerning class III devices and differentiated between class III devices subject to the PMA process and those subject only to the substantial equivalence test: \u201cThe \u00a7 510(k) notification process [substantial equivalence test] is by no means comparable to the PMA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>process; in contrast to the 1,200 hours necessary to complete a PMA review, the \u00a7 510(k) review is completed in an average of only 20 hours.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>at pp. _-_ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2245-2248, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 709-712].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">In section II, the lead opinion set forth the facts and procedural history of the case. It noted the defendant was permitted to market the class III device in question, a pacemaker lead, because it was substantially equivalent to other products already on the market. Consequently, the device was not subjected to the PMA process. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp__-_[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2248-2250, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 712-714].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">Section III summarized federal preemption law. It recognized that analysis must begin with the text of the preemption statute, but that there is a presumption against preemption supporting a narrow interpretation of the statute. The lead opinion concluded that \u201c \u2018 [t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.\u2019 ...\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2250,135 L.Ed.2d at p. 716], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">In section IV, rejected by Justice Breyer and thus representing the views of a minority of the court, Justice Stevens rebuffed the contention that all common law claims against manufacturers of class III devices are preempted. It stated: \u201cGiven the ambiguities in the statute and the scope of the preclusion that would occur otherwise, we cannot accept Medtronic\u2019s argument that by using the term \u2018requirement\u2019 [in \u00a7 360k(a)], Congress clearly signaled its intent to deprive States of any role in protecting consumers from the dangers inherent in many medical devices.\u201d Even though it stopped short of declaring that no common law claims are preempted under section 360k, the plurality indicated its opinion that most common law claims are not preempted. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2251-2253, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 716-719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">Section V, representing the majority of the court, dealt specifically with the common law claims asserted by the plaintiff and found none of them were preempted. For the purpose of analysis, the section broke the plaintiff\u2019s claims into three categories: (1) the design claim, (2) the identity of requirements claims, and (3) the manufacturing and labeling claims. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp__-_[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2253-2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 719-726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">The defendant argued the plaintiff\u2019s design claim was preempted because the FDA\u2019s substantial equivalence finding as a prelude to permitting the defendant to market the product amounts to a \u201crequirement\u201d under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>360k. The court rejected this argument because the device had not been formally reviewed for safety and effectiveness. \u201c[E]ven though the FDA may well examine \u00a7 510(k) [substantial equivalence] applications for Class III devices (as it examines the entire medical device industry) with a concern for the safety and effectiveness of the device, ... it did not \u2018require\u2019 Medtronics\u2019 pacemaker to take any particular form for any particular reason; the agency simply allowed the pacemaker, as a device substantially equivalent to one that existed before 1976, to be marketed without running the gauntlet of the PMA process.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2254, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 720-721].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">The court also held the plaintiff\u2019s common law claims were not preempted to the extent they rested on the violation of duties imposed by federal requirements: \u201cNothing in \u00a7 360k denies Florida the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of common-law duties when those duties parallel federal requirements. Even if it may be necessary as a matter of Florida law to prove that those violations were the result of negligent conduct, or that they created an unreasonable hazard for users of the product, such additional elements of the state-law cause of action would make the state requirements narrower, not broader, than the federal requirement. While such a narrower requirement might be \u2018different from\u2019 the federal rules in a literal sense, such a difference would surely provide a strange reason for finding pre-emption of a state rule insofar as it duplicates the federal rule. The presence of a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different \u2018requirement\u2019 that is necessary under the statute; rather, it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing \u2018requirements\u2019 under federal law.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at p. 2255, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 721-722].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">The court also found no preemption with respect to manufacturing and labeling claims based on a common law duty where there was no corresponding federal requirement specific to the device. The court of appeals had found those claims were preempted because the FDA has promulgated general labeling and manufacturing regulations applicable to all class III devices and further requirements imposed by the states would interfere with the consistent application of the federal regulations. The Supreme Court, however, rejected this reasoning. It held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not preempted because \u201cstate requirements are pre-empted \u2018only\u2019 when the FDA has established \u2018specific counterpart regulations or . . . other specific requirements applicable to a particular device.\u2019 (21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d) (1995).)\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2257, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 723].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">As to labeling and manufacturing claims, in general, the Supreme Court gave the following guidance: \u201cAlthough we do not believe that this statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>and regulatory language [section 360k and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations] necessarily precludes \u2018general\u2019 federal requirements from ever preempting state requirements, or \u2018general\u2019 state requirements from ever being pre-empted, ... it is impossible to ignore its overarching concern that pre-emption occur only where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest. State requirements must be \u2018with respect to\u2019 medical devices and \u2018different from, or in addition to\u2019 federal requirements. State requirements must also relate \u2018to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device,\u2019 and the regulations provide that state requirements of \u2018general applicability\u2019 are not pre-empted except where they have \u2018the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device.\u2019 Moreover, federal requirements must be \u2018applicable to the device\u2019 in question, and, according to the regulations, pre-empt state law only if they are . . . \u2018specific\u2019 to a \u2018particular device.\u2019 The statute and regulations, therefore, require a careful comparison between the allegedly pre-empting federal requirement and the allegedly pre-empted state requirement to determine whether they fall within the intended pre-emptive scope of the statute and regulations.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2257-2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 724-725].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Applying this seemingly interminable standard, the court found the requirements applicable to the class III device in question, which had not been through the PMA process, were entirely generic and the state common law duties the plaintiffs sought to enforce were not specific to the particular device. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at p. 2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 725].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">In section VI, also rejected by Justice Breyer and thus representing the views of a minority of the court, Justice Stevens concluded the FDA\u2019s reference to state requirements \u201cestablished by . . . court decision\u201d as being among those preempted referred only to court decisions construing state statutes and regulations. He opined: \u201cIt will be rare indeed for a court hearing a common-law cause of action to issue a decree that has \u2018the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device.\u2019 (21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d)(6)(ii) (1995).\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2258-2259, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">Section VII announced the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">Justice Breyer wrote a concurring opinion explaining his reasons for not joining sections IV and VI. He declared: \u201cI believe that ordinarily, insofar as the MDA pre-empts a state requirement embodied in a state statute, rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>regulation, or other administrative action, it would also pre-empt a similar requirement that takes the form of a standard of care or behavior imposed by a state-law tort action.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2260, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 727] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).) On the facts of the case, however, Justice Breyer concluded there was no preemption because he could find \u201cno actual conflict between any federal requirement and any of the liability-creating-premises of the plaintiffs\u2019 state law tort suit. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 730].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Justice Breyer explained it would be anomalous to prohibit a state from issuing regulations on a product but allow the state to regulate the product through common law tort standards of care and behavior: \u201cThe effects of the state agency regulation and the state tort suit are identical. To distinguish between them for pre-emption purposes would grant greater power (to set state standards \u2018different from, or in addition to\u2019 federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes.\u201d (518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2259, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 727].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by three other justices, concurred in part and dissented in part. Beginning with the premise that section 360k preempts any state common law action that would impose a requirement different from or in addition to federal requirements, she agreed with the majority that the plaintiffs\u2019 design claims were not preempted because the substantial equivalence test placed no requirements on the specific device. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp._-_ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2262-2264, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 730-733] (conc. and dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) She also agreed that violations of federal labeling and manufacturing requirements could form the basis of a state common law claim. She disagreed, however, that the state, through a common law duty, could impose labeling and manufacturing requirements different from or in addition to the federal requirements, even the generally applicable regulations. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 733].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">Even though a majority of the <em>Medtronic </em>court found no preemption, at least five of the justices concluded that state common law is preempted if it would impose a requirement different from or in addition to a federal requirement. (518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2260, 2262-2263, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 728, 730-731] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J. and cone, and dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) The obvious difference between the facts of <em>Medtronic </em>and facts of this case is that the medical device in <em>Medtronic </em>was subjected only to the substantial equivalence test but the device in this case was required to undergo the complete PMA process. Accordingly, considering the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that the substantial equivalence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>process did not place preemptive requirements on the device in question, a critical issue in this case is whether the PMA process creates preemptive federal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Steele contends we should adopt a Ninth Circuit opinion, decided before <em>Medtronic, </em>involving the same product at issue here and the same preemption statutes and regulations applicable to this case. <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 67 F.3d 1453 <em>(Kennedy).) Kennedy </em>held that state common law is never preempted under section 360k. This sweeping pronouncement was rejected by a majority of the <em>Medtronic </em>court. Justice Breyer held state requirements can include standards of care or behavior imposed through a state action of any kind, including tort. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2260, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 728] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).) Justice O\u2019Connor, representing four votes, agreed: \u201cI conclude that state common-law damages actions do impose \u2018requirements\u2019 and are therefore pre-empted where such requirements would differ from those imposed by the FDCA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2262, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 730] (conc. and dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) Even the plurality declined to adopt the position taken in <em>Kennedy, </em>instead, it refused to reach the issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2259, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 726] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.).) Recognizing <em>Kennedy's </em>conflict with the majority of justices in <em>Medtronic, </em>the Ninth Circuit has recently repudiated the <em>Kennedy </em>holding: \u201c[T]o the extent we concluded in <em>Kennedy </em>that the MDA cannot preempt <em>any </em>state common-law causes of action, the conclusion cannot survive in light of the concurring and dissenting opinions in <em>Medtronic.\u201d (Papike </em>v. <em>Tambrands Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 107 F.3d 737, 741, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">Asserting the Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated one MDA preemption case from the court of appeals while leaving another such opinion <em>(Kennedy) </em>intact by denying certiorari, Steele suggests we should attempt to discern from those actions the Supreme Court\u2019s intent concerning MDA preemption in cases involving a device that has undergone the full PMA process.  \u201cThe denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Carver </em>(1923) 260 U.S. 482, 490 [43 S.Ct. 181, 182, 67 L.Ed. 361, 364], quoted in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 70, 85 [115 S.Ct. 2038, 2047, 132 L.Ed.2d 63, 78].) Accordingly, we will not speculate concerning the intent of the Supreme Court based on its grant or denial of certiorari and will not take judicial notice, as requested by Steele, of those orders of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">The two prime considerations in determining whether a state claim is preempted are (1) whether a state damages award on the claim would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>establish a state requirement applicable to the device which is different from or in addition to a federal requirement and (2) whether the FDA has established a specific counterpart requirement for the device. (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1(d) (1996); <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2256, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 723].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">\n<em>Specific State Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">Little can be applied directly from <em>Medtronic </em>to cases such as this in which the class III device has gone through the PMA process. Nevertheless, it is clear preemption does not apply to a state claim based on a manufacturer\u2019s violation of FDA requirements. All of the justices in <em>Medtronic </em>agreed on that principle. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2255-2256, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 721-722] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.); <em>id. </em>at p._[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2262-2263, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 730-731] (conc. and dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) Thus, if the manufacturer does not abide by a federal requirement, preemption does not prevent a state award of damages on a tort claim based on the violation of that federal requirement, even if the device has undergone the PMA process, if the state requirement is equal to, or substantially identical to, the federal requirement. (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1(d)(2) (1996).) Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary for the purpose of MDA preemption analysis to determine whether the state claim imposes a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">The possibility of preemption, therefore, only arises when the state claim seeks to impose a requirement specific to the device that is not already imposed by the FDA. For guidance, we turn to <em>Medtronic, </em>albeit not to the plurality opinion. We reiterate Justice Breyer\u2019s practical expression concerning state requirements, which appears to reflect the views of at least five of the justices: \u201c[O]rdinarily, insofar as the MDA pre-empts a state requirement embodied in a state statute, rule, regulation, or other administrative action, it would also pre-empt a similar requirement that takes the form of a standard of care or behavior imposed by a state-law tort action.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2260, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 727] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.); see also <em>id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2262-2263, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 731] (conc. and dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-17\">Another district of the California Court of Appeal has held that a state common law tort cause of action does not seek to impose state requirements specific to the product. <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>Optical Radiation Corp. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 580, 595 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 763].) The court reasoned: \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>state law requirements imposed by the negligence claim (e.g., the duty of a manufacturer to avoid foreseeable dangers in making a product or to inform users of potentially dangerous products of the risks involved) \u2018were not specifically developed \u201cwith respect to\u201d medical devices.\u2019 <em>(Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[135 L.Ed.2d at p. 725, 116 S.Ct. at p. 2258].) Rather they are \u2018requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates ... to other products in addition to [medical] devices.\u2019 (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) (1996).) \u2018These state requirements therefore escape pre-emption . . . because their generality leaves them outside the category of requirements that \u00a7 360k envisioned to be \u201cwith respect to\" specific devices . . . .\u2019 <em>(Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._ [135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 725-726, 116 S.Ct. at p. 2258]; . . .)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 594-595.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">This reasoning ignores Justice Breyer\u2019s statement in <em>Medtronic, </em>that common law standards of care and behavior impose specific requirements, even though the general duty may not. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2259-2260, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 727-728] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).) The <em>Armstrong </em>court espoused, essentially, the view of <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>67 F.3d 1453, with respect to the specific state requirement element of preemption. That view, however, as reviewed above, was later repudiated by the Ninth Circuit in light of <em>Medtronic. (Papike </em>v. <em>Tambrands Inc., supra, </em>107 F.3d at p. 741.) Accordingly, we follow the view of the majority of justices in <em>Medtronic </em>and the court in <em>Papike. </em>Since common law standards of care and behavior impose state requirements that may be preempted, the only remaining issue is whether such state requirements are different from or in addition to specific federal requirements. (See \u00a7 360k.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">\n<em>Specific Federal Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">The <em>Medtronic </em>court found that state common law claims alleging liability for the manufacturing and labeling of a device but not based on the violation of a federal requirement were not preempted because the device at issue was only tested for substantial equivalence to devices already on the market. Accordingly, the state could impose its own requirements without offending the governing principles of MDA preemption. The FDA expressly warned the manufacturer of the device in <em>Medtronic </em>that this limited review did not denote official approval of the safety and effectiveness of the device; it therefore did not create a specific federal requirement. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2254-2255, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 720-721] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.).) The opposite is true of a device that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>undergone the PMA process. A PMA application is denied if there is an insufficient showing that the product is safe and effective \u201cunder the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof\u2019 or if the proposed labeling is misleading in any particular. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(d)(2)(A), (B), (D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">\u201cAll class III medical devices [not eligible for approval under the substantial equivalence test] are subject to the requirements of the MDA, including the extensive review and evaluation involved in the PMA process. Among other things, \u2018[t]he FDA retains rigid control over the entirety of the labeling and packaging of class III products . . . .\u2019 <em>(King </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp., supra, </em>983 F.2d at p. 1135.) The control extends to the size and location of a warning on a label, as well as its content. (See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(c)(1) and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 801.4, 801.5, 801.15, 814.20(b)(10), (e) (1995).) In fact the product\u2019s sponsor must submit a proposed label to the FDA for analysis and review prior to gaining PMA for the product. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(c)(1)(F).) A PMA application will be denied if there is an insufficient showing that the product is safe and effective \u2018under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,\u2019 or if the proposed labeling is misleading in any particular. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(d)(2)(A), (B), (D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">\u201cThe MDA also imposes extensive postapproval regulations to keep the FDA apprised of any new information or safety findings relating to class III devices. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360e(e), 360i; see also 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 803 (1995).) Furthermore, under the product problem reporting program, health professionals and consumers can notify the FDA when they have had an adverse experience involving an approved medical device. The FDA may withdraw approval of the device permanently or suspend its approval temporarily at any time if it determines that the device has become unsafe or its labeling inadequate. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(e).)\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>CIBA Vision Corp., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 317-318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">While the design or labeling of a device may be changed to enhance the safety without prior approval from the FDA, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a PMA supplement and obtain acknowledgment from the FDA of receipt of the supplement. (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.39 (1996).) The device is still subject to withdrawal from the market if the FDA determines any changes have rendered it unsafe or the labeling inadequate. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(e); see also <em>King </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp., supra, </em>983 F.2d at p. 1139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Considering the differences between the substantial equivalence test and the full PMA process, a state common law tort claim relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>safety and effectiveness of a device is preempted to the extent it seeks to impose requirements different from or in addition to the federal requirements resulting from the PMA process, even though the approval of a device for market under the substantial equivalence test does not provide for such preemption. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1(d) (1996).) The design, manufacture, and labeling of the device, as approved by the FDA as safe and effective after the device has undergone the PMA process, are the specific federal requirements giving rise to preemption. <em>(Stamps </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp., supra, </em>984 F.2d at p. 1423; <em>King </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp., supra, </em>983 F.2d at pp. 1138-1139; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Optical Radiation Corp. supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 593 [\u201c[I]n approving [the product] through the PMA process, the FDA imposed federal requirements specific to that product which govern virtually every aspect of its production and sale.\u201d].) They constitute a federal regulatory standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Concerning the substantial equivalence test, the FDA promulgated the following regulation: \u201c[A] . . . determination by the [FDA] that the device intended for introduction into commercial distribution is substantially equivalent to a device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, . . . does not in any way denote official approval of the device. Any representation that creates an impression of official approval of a device because of complying with the premarket notification regulations is misleading and constitutes misbranding.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 807.97 (1996).) \u201c[The] explicit statement [contained in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 807.97] that the FDA does not officially approve \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019 devices creates at least the presumption\u2014by way of the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u2014that the FDA does officially approve those products it scrutinizes through the regular Class III PMA process. Such official approval, of course, strongly would imply that federal preemption is present.\u201d <em>(Stamps </em>v. <em>Collagen Corp., supra, </em>984 F.2d at p. 1423, fn. 6, some italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Accordingly, state requirements in the form of standards of care or behavior are preempted and cannot form the basis of a state common law claim for damages if they are different from or in addition to the specific federal requirements arising from the PMA process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">\n<em>Application of MD A Preemption to This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">Even though preemption is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction that cannot be waived <em>(DeTomaso </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 517, 520, fn. 1 [235 Cal.Rptr. 292, 733 P.2d 614]), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>burden of proving preemption is on the defendant. (See <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1045, 1052 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 832 P.2d 573].) Accordingly, to establish preemption, it was incumbent on Collagen Corporation to prove, by way of its statement of undisputed facts, that Zyderm was designed, manufactured, and labeled according to the specifications approved by the FDA. Most likely because the summary judgment motion was made well before the Supreme Court decided <em>Medtronic, </em>Collagen Corporation made no attempt to establish its actions were in compliance with the federal requirements. Instead, Collagen Corporation only established that Zyderm had been through the PMA process and contended that preemption necessarily followed from that fact alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">In this situation, we cannot determine whether Collagen Corporation met the federal standard of care which emanated from the PMA process. Federal preemption is not an absolute shield. It does not dictate that there is no standard of care. Instead, it provides there is only one standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Since the facts presented by Collagen Corporation were insufficient to support summary judgment in its favor, we need not consider Steele\u2019s response to Collagen Corporation\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts. As submitted, the motion for summary judgment was deficient and, therefore, the order granting summary judgment must be reversed. (See <em>West </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1578, 1583 [278 Cal.Rptr. 570].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">The judgment is reversed and remanded.

However, I disagree with the majority opinion because it misreads or ignores the relevant text of <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. _ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700] <em>(Medtronic), </em>with which five justices agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">The majority opinion reverses the summary judgment granted Collagen on the ground it failed to show that \u201cZyderm was designed, manufactured, and labeled according to the specifications approved by the FDA.\u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>this page.) With this much I agree. However, this implies that the only ground upon which the product may be challenged is for lack of conformity with the FDA specifications. This amounts to a claim that the premarket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>approval of a device occupies the field relating to the device, precluding state regulations which differ from the specifications. Curiously, it reaches this conclusion by reading <em>Medtronic </em>from the point of view of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The proper test of preemption of state tort actions of general applicability, consistent with Justice Breyer\u2019s concurring views and part V of the plurality opinion, is that the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) preempts a state law tort action only where it \u201cactually conflicts\u201d with a federal requirement. (See, e.g., <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 729-730 conc. opn. of Breyer, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">This case arises on a summary judgment in favor of defendant Collagen Corporation (Collagen). The sole ground upon which the relief was sought was that \u201ceach and every one of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action is . . . expressly preempted under ... 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k as added by the [MDA], and regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d The principal, material, undisputed fact adduced by the defendant was that a product manufactured and distributed by Collagen, Zyderm, a class HI device, had been given premarket approval (PMA) by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and \u201chad been shown to be safe and effective for use as recommended in the submitted labeling.\u201d The only defense tendered is that premarket approval preempts any state cause of action. For this reason the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint stand unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">The allegations are exceedingly general. Little more is alleged than that Collagen designed, manufactured, tested, sold and labeled Zyderm, that the plaintiff was injected with the substance and as a result developed an autoimmune disease, and that Collagen is responsible for the injury under theories of unfair trade practices, strict liability, negligence, breach of express or implied warranty, fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Collagen did not seek to determine, by contention interrogatories or other means of discovery, in what way plaintiff contends Zyderm was designed, manufactured or labeled so as to give rise to liability. Accordingly, we are presented with an essentially abstract question of law, whether the MDA preempts the causes of action so pled. In this context it is not possible to tell whether the state claims \u201cactually conflict\u201d with any federal requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\"><em>Medtronic </em>concerns the construction and application of the MDA and the implementing FDA regulations. In pertinent part the MDA (hereafter section 360k) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-11\">\u201c\u00a7 360k. State and local requirements respecting devices</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-12\">\u201c(a) General rule</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b)[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] of this section, no State . . . may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014 [\u00b6] (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and [\u00b6] (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\" (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">In <em>Medtronic </em>the plaintiffs sought damages for injury caused by the negligent design and manufacture of a pacemaker and for failure to warn of its tendency to fail. A majority of the court, relying on FDA regulations which define the terms of section 360k, found the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not preempted by the FDA\u2019s general rules regulating manufacturing practices and labeling requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">This prompted a dissent which reasoned that section 360k is clear on its face, that no resort need be made to the FDA regulations implementing section 360k, that the term \u201crequirement\u201d encompasses common law causes of action, that such causes are preempted to the extent their recognition would impose a requirement different from or in addition to the FDA requirements applicable to the device and that the general regulations at issue impose \u201ccomprehensive\u201d requirements which preempt the plaintiffs\u2019 negligent manufacturing and failure-to-warn claims. (Medtronic, <em>supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2262-2264, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 730-734] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">The majority opinion in this case disagrees with the dissent in <em>Medtronic </em>only regarding the last claim. In particular, the majority opinion assumes that the phrase \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to,\u201d in section 360k, is clear and means that any variation from a federal requirement by a state requirement is preempted. This is the same as saying that the federal requirement, whatever it is, always preempts the field applicable to the device.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">By contrast, both the plurality opinion in <em>Medtronic </em>and the concurring opinion of Justice Breyer found the phrase \u201cdifferent from or in addition to\u201d ambiguous and deferred to the FDA regulations which define the key terms in the statute. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp__-_[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2255-2256 and 2260-2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 722 and 728-729 respectively].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>These are found in 21 Code of Federal Regulations, section 808.1(d) (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of significance, they require a divergence between a specific federal requirement with respect to a device and a specific state regulation of the device. This is another way of saying there must be an actual conflict between the federal and state requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">Applying this test, the majority in <em>Medtronic, </em>consisting of part V of the plurality opinion, together with Justice Breyer, who joined in the part, agreed with the plaintiffs that \u201cbecause only state requirements \u2018with respect to a device\u2019 may be pre-empted, and then only if the requirement \u2018relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device,\u2019 section 360k(a) mandates pre-emption only where there is a conflict between a <em>specific </em>state requirement and a federal requirement \u2018applicable to\u2019 the same device.\u201d (518 U.S. at p_[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2256-2257, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 723], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">The court said that the MDA did not preempt the plaintiffs\u2019 negligent manufacturing and labeling claims because they did not come within the regulations. The opinion sets forth the multiple criteria, addressing inter alia the meaning of the term \u201crequirement\u201d as applied to both the MDA and state law. \u201cState requirements must be \u2018with respect to\u2019 medical devices and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>\u2018different from, or in addition to\u2019 federal requirements. State requirements must also relate \u2018to the safety or effectiveness of the device . . . and the regulations provide that <em>state requirements of \u2018general applicability\u2019 are not pre-empted except where they have \u2018the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device.\u2019 </em>Moreover, federal requirements must be \u2018applicable to the device\u2019 in question, and, according to the regulations, pre-empt state law only if they are \u2018specific counterpart regulations\u2019 or \u2018specific\u2019 to a \u2018particular device.\u2019 The statute and regulations, therefore, require a careful comparison between the allegedly pre-empting federal requirement and the allegedly pre-empted state requirement to determine whether they fall within the intended pre-emptive scope of the statute and regulations.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2257-2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 724-725, italics added &amp; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">As emphasized, \u201c. . . the regulations provide that state requirements of \u2018general applicability\u2019 are not pre-empted <em>except where they have \u2018the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific </em>device.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2257-2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 724-725].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">The exception dovetails with the concurring views of Justice Breyer. He asked two questions. First, does the MDA ever preempt a state law tort action? Second, if so, does the MDA preempt the particular state-law tort claims at issue here?</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">He answered the first question by stating that \u201cthe MDA will sometimes pre-empt a state-law tort suit\u201d on the ground that \u201c[o]ne can reasonably read the word \u2018requirement\u2019 [in section 360k] as including the legal requirements that grow out of the application, in particular circumstances, of a State\u2019s tort law.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2259,135 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>at p. 727].) He did not elaborate on this point except to pose an example which appears to be a case of direct conflict between the application of a state tort rule and an MDA requirement. \u201cImagine that, in respect to a particular hearing aid component, a federal MDA regulation requires a 2-inch wire, but a state agency regulation requires a 1-inch wire. If the federal law, embodied in the \u20182-inch\u2019 MDA regulation, pre-empts the state \u20181-inch\u2019 agency regulation, why would it not similarly pre-empt a state law tort action that premises liability upon the defendant manufacturer\u2019s failure to use a 1-inch wire (say, an award by a jury persuaded by expert testimony that use of a more than 1-inch wire is negligent)?\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2259, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 727 (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">Justice Breyer also said that \u201cordinarily, insofar as the MDA pre-empts a state requirement embodied in a state statute, rule, regulation, or other administrative action, it would also pre-empt a similar requirement that takes the form of a standard of care or behavior imposed by a state-law tort action.\u201d (518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2260].) As Justice Breyer makes clear, what is at issue here is an actual conflict. That is shown in the following section which answers the second question, whether the MDA preempted the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">Of significance, the two-inch wire example was again introduced in connection with a discussion of implied preemption. There Breyer pointed out that \u201c. . . the MDA\u2019s pre-emption provision [i.e., \u00a7 360k] is highly ambiguous. That provision makes clear that federal requirements may preempt state requirements, but it says next to nothing about just when, where, or how, they may do so. The words \u2018any [state] requirement\u2019 and \u2018any [federal] requirement\u2019, for example, do not tell us <em>which </em>requirements are at issue, for <em>every </em>state requirement that is not identical to even <em>one </em>federal requirement is \u2018different from, or in addition to\u2019 that single federal requirement; yet, Congress could not have intended that the existence of one single federal rule, say about a 2-inch hearing aid wire, would pre-empt <em>every </em>state law hearing aid rule, even a set of rules related only to the packaging or shipping of hearing aids.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p_[116 S.Ct. at p. 2260, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 728] (conc. opn. of Breyer; J.); italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-13\">This bears out the view that Breyer is talking about an actual conflict. If a federal rule about the length of wire in a device does not rule out a state law rule regarding packaging of the device, the federal rule does not preempt the <em>field </em>of regulation of the device. The way is open for state regulation of those matters which do not actually conflict with, i.e., which supplement, the federal requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>The point is made in Justice Breyer\u2019s answer to his second question, \u201c[D]oes the MDA pre-empt the particular state-law tort claims at issue here[?]\u201d He said the answer turns on Congress\u2019s intent. That led him to a discussion of implied preemption. He said that section 360k is \u201chighly ambiguous\u201d and, deferring to the regulation, that the \u201cregulation does not fill all the statutory gaps, for its word \u2018divergent\u2019 does not explain, any more than did the statute, just when different device-related federal and state requirements are closely enough related to trigger preemption analysis. But the regulation\u2019s word \u2018specific\u2019 does narrow the universe of federal requirements that the agency intends to displace at least some state law.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p_[116 S.Ct. at pp. 2260-2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 728-729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">Applying this reasoning Breyer found that \u201c[i]nsofar as there are any applicable FDA requirements here, [they] are not \u2018specific\u2019 in any relevant sense. . . . Hence, ... the FDA\u2019s . . . pre-emption rule . . . does not intend these requirements to pre-empt the state requirements at issue here.\u201d (518 U.S. at p. _ [116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 729].) That being the case, Breyer resorted to the law of implied preemption. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 729-730].) He said that the court \u201cwould \u2018seldom infer, solely from the comprehensiveness of federal regulations, an intent to pre-empt in its entirety a field related to health and safety\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cordinary principles of \u2018conflict\u2019 and \u2018field\u2019 pre-emption point in the same direction. Those principles make clear that a federal requirement pre-empts a state requirement if (1) the state requirement actually conflicts with the federal requirement\u2014either because compliance with both is impossible ... or because the state requirement \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u2019 ... or (2) the scheme of federal regulation is \u2018so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 729]; citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-10\">Applying these principles to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, Justice Breyer said: \u201cI can find no actual conflict between any federal requirement and any of the liability-creating-premises of the plaintiffs\u2019 state law tort suit; nor . . . can I find any indication that either Congress or the FDA intended the relevant FDA regulations to occupy entirely any relevant field.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 730] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-13\">I would apply the test of \u201cactual conflict\u201d to this case. The first question is whether the premarket approval (PMA) process results in specific federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>requirements applicable to the device under section II of Justice Breyer\u2019s <em>Medtronic </em>concurrence. I would answer with a qualified yes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The second question is whether a state law tort action invariably presents an actual conflict with those specific federal requirements. I and the majority both say no. The majority correctly concludes that a state law tort action which premises liability upon the defendant manufacturer\u2019s failure to adhere to the specific federal requirements presents no actual conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">I do not agree with the view that this is the only circumstance in which a state law tort suit does not present an actual conflict. An actual conflict means that compliance with both the federal requirement and the state requirement is impossible or the state requirement obstructs the accomplishment of the federal statutory objective. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p._ [116 S.Ct. at p. 2261, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 729] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).) The latter occurs when, notwithstanding the possibility of dual compliance, the state law requirement is one that has been rejected in the premarket approval process: \u201ca case in which the Federal Government has weighed the competing interests relevant to the particular requirement in question, reached an unambiguous conclusion about how those competing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or set of cases, and implemented that conclusion via a specific mandate on manufacturers or producers.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at p. 725].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">For example, suppose the FDA promulgated a requirement in the PMA process or a regulation concerning the specific warning required for tampons about toxic shock syndrome. A plaintiff who sought to recover in a state law tort action premised on a different warning would likely be barred by preemption.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>Papike </em>v. <em>Tambrands Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 107 F.3d 737.) However, I would not predict the outcome without a fully developed factual record if the plaintiff tendered a claim that a warning was required as to some other different disease caused by the device. (Cf. <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2260,135 L.Ed.2d at p. 728] (conc. opn. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>Breyer, J.) \u201cCongress could not have intended that the existence of one single federal rule, say, about a 2-inch hearing aid wire, would pre-empt <em>every </em>state law hearing aid rule, even a set of rules related only to the packaging or shipping of hearing aids.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">In this case there is a dearth of evidence and developed claims of actual conflict between the plaintiff\u2019s state common law tort causes of action and particularized federal requirements engendered by the PMA process. I would not rule out the prospect that some claims may be viable even if plaintiff cannot show that the defendant disobeyed standards prescribed in the federal PMA process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">Subsection (b) provides <em>inter alia </em>that a state, upon application to the FDA, may establish regulations which are \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">The regulation provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alg\">\u201c(d) State or local requirements are preempted only when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act, thereby making any existing divergent State or local requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the specific Food and Drug Administration requirements.

The legal duty that is the predicate for the <em>Lohrs\u2019 negligent manufacturing claim </em>is the general duty of every manufacturer to use due care to avoid foreseeable dangers in its products.
