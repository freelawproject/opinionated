Carlson seeks review of an order denying her motion to vacate a stipulated judgment in a \u201cURESA\u201d action for child support arrearages. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4800 et seq.) Appellant contends the judgment was void because the district attorney settled her claim without her consent, contrary to Welfare and Institutions Code section 11478.2, subdivision (j). We agree that the settlement was unauthorized and reverse the postjudgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">This action began in September 1991, when appellant filed an action for paternity and child support against respondent Mike Eassa. Paternity was established in March 1995, when the court determined that respondent was the father of Brett Steven Tracy, bom July 13, 1977. Because appellant resided in Delaware, child support issues were governed by the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), Family Code section 4800 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">After protracted litigation, respondent was found to be the minor\u2019s father and ordered to pay temporary support. The issue of permanent child support was not heard until August 25, 1995. At that hearing, Stephen Hooper, the deputy district attorney representing appellant, informed the court that around the 10th of July he had received a call from Amy Silvestri, who represented a United States Senator from Delaware. According to Hooper, Silvestri had told him \u201cin very specific terms\u201d that appellant had contacted the senator\u2019s office because \u201cthis case had taken entirely too long, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>wanted it resolved or settled immediately.\u201d Silvestri was \u201cvery emphatic and very firm that it was to be resolved immediately.\u201d Hooper then contacted respondent\u2019s counsel and suggested they settle the case immediately. Respondent offered $6,000, which Hooper accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">A few days after the settlement, however, Hooper received a letter from appellant indicating there had been a misunderstanding. At the hearing he thought Silvestri was \u201cbacking away\u201d from her previous request that he should settle the case. Hooper claimed that he would not have settled without a firm statement from Silvestri, and he now felt bound to honor the $6,000 agreement with respondent, \u201ceven if it\u2019s a bad bargain.\u201d Respondent\u2019s attorney simply asked the court to confirm the district attorney\u2019s authority to settle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">After a conference in chambers, the court announced that it would continue the matter one week to approve the settlement on condition that respondent tender the money at that time. On September 1, 1995, Hooper advised the court that Delaware, the initiating jurisdiction, had requested he not sign the stipulation. Hooper stated he would not object to being <em>ordered </em>to sign it; or, he suggested, the court could accept the settlement without a signature. The trial court accepted tender of respondent\u2019s check for $6,000 and ordered the matter concluded. The stipulated judgment was filed September 5, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On November 29, 1995, appellant moved to vacate the September 5 order and requested support according to applicable guidelines retroactive to September 1991. Appellant asserted that she had not authorized settlement at \u201csuch a small amount.\u201d Appellant maintained that the September order was ineffective as to her, because she did not participate and the district attorney did not legally represent her. Citing Welfare and Institutions Code section 11478.2, subdivision (j), appellant argued that the district attorney was not permitted to enter into any stipulation for support without consent of all parties or their attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Appellant submitted a declaration from Amy Silvestri in support of the motion to vacate. Silvestri confirmed that appellant had enlisted her help because \u201cthe case had gone on for too long\u201d and appellant wanted to know if \u201cthere was a way to expedite it.\u201d Silvestri stated: \u201cI told Mr. Hooper that Ms. Carlson was very frustrated with the delays and that she wanted the case to proceed as quickly as possible. I explained that I was calling only to inquire on Ms. Carlson\u2019s behalf why the case was taking so long and whether anything could be done to move it along any more quickly. Mr. Hooper said that he understood and would do everything he could to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the case moving along.\u201d Silvestri added that she never told Hooper to take any specific action such as advancing the hearing or settling the case. When confronted after the settlement, she said, Hooper attempted to justify his action by saying he had \u201cthe impression\u201d that appellant wanted him to settle the case, even though he had not specifically been asked to do so. Because the settlement was unacceptable to appellant, however, he assured Silvestri that he would \u201cdo his best\u201d to remedy the situation by having the settlement withdrawn or reconsidered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Respondent opposed appellant\u2019s motion to vacate on several grounds. First, he argued, Hooper had ostensible authority to settle the matter, because Sylvestri\u2019s communication to him gave him reason to believe that appellant wished the matter settled. Any misunderstanding, respondent added, was appellant\u2019s own fault, because she used the United States Senator\u2019s office to exert pressure on the district attorney. Respondent also urged the court to apply estoppel principles against appellant, because she \u201cgave specific authorization to her agents\u201d to settle the issue of arrearages. By authorizing settlement, she had \u201cimplicitly authorized\u201d the district attorney to accept an amount lower than she had expected to receive. Finally, respondent argued Welfare and Institutions Code section 11478.2, subdivision (j), was inapplicable in a URESA case; consequently, appellant\u2019s authorization was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In a supplemental argument, respondent suggested the court lacked \u201cequitable jurisdiction\u201d to vacate the prior order, because appellant had failed to avail herself of her right to appeal from the September order. As to the merits, respondent argued that Hooper had had actual authority to sign the stipulation because the court had ordered him to do so: \u201cThat was the authorization.\u201d He further pointed out that appellant had given the Delaware Division of Child Support Enforcement a power of attorney, which \u201ctransferred\u201d authority to negotiate and settle her claim to the District Attorney of Monterey County.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The trial court characterized the issue as \u201csimply whether the District Attorney had a duty to seek and to secure Petitioner\u2019s agreement to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>stipulated settlement.\u201d Finding no such duty, the court denied the motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Before addressing the merits of the controversy, we must ascertain the appealability of the trial court\u2019s order. Upon request the parties submitted supplemental briefing on the question of whether this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Having reviewed their supplemental arguments and the relevant statutory authority, we conclude the appeal is proper because the underlying judgment is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1 describes the judicial acts from which a party may appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subdivision (a)(2) of the statute authorizes an appeal from an order made after an appealable judgment. The broad language of this provision appears to confer appealability upon any postjudgment order if the judgment was itself appealable. Such a conclusion would be erroneous, however.  \u201cTo be appealable, a postjudgment order must satisfy two additional requirements. . . . [f] The first requirement ... is that the issues raised by the appeal from the order must be different from those arising from an appeal from the judgment. (See <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Vermont Investment Corp. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 351 . . . .) \u2018The reason for this general rule is that to allow the appeal from [an order raising the same issues as those raised by the judgment] would have the effect of allowing two appeals from the same ruling and might in some cases permit circumvention of the time limitations for appealing from the judgment.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 358.). . . [H The second requirement ... is that \u2018the order must either affect the judgment or relate to it by enforcing it or staying its execution.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lakin </em>v. <em>Watkins Associated Industries </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 651-652 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 863 P.2d 179], fn. omitted; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Shers </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1831, 1838 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 57]; <em>Fundamental Investment etc. Realty Fund </em>v. <em>Gradow </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 966, 979 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 812].)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In light of these standards, an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment is generally not appealable; otherwise, an appellant would receive \u201ceither two appeals from the same decision, or, if no timely appeal has been made, an unwarranted extension of time in which to bring the appeal.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Brockman </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1035, 1040 [240 Cal.Rptr. 96].)  In this case, the postjudgment order did not decide new issues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>but merely \u201caffirmed\u201d the validity of the judgment. Thus, it initially appears that appeal from the postjudgment order is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">As appellant points out, however, an exception to this general rule applies when the underlying judgment is void. In such a case, the order denying the motion to vacate is itself void and appealable because it gives effect to a void judgment. (194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1040; <em>Adoption of Matthew B. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1239, 1267 [284 Cal.Rptr. 18]; <em>Residents for Adequate Water </em>v. <em>Redwood Valley County Water Dist. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1801, 1805 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 123]; see also <em>In re Marriage of Goodarzirad </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1020, 1031 [230 Cal.Rptr. 203] [stipulated judgment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">A judgment is void if the court rendering it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties. Subject matter jurisdiction \u201crelates to the inherent authority of the court involved to deal with the case or matter before it.\u201d <em>(Conservatorship of O\u2019Connor </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1087 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 386].) Lack of jurisdiction in this \u201cfundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.\u201d <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In a broader sense, lack of jurisdiction also exists when a court grants \u201crelief which [it] has no power to grant.\u201d <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 942, 950 [126 Cal.Rptr. 805, 544 P.2d 941]; <em>Becker </em>v. <em>S.P.V. Construction Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 493 [165 Cal.Rptr. 825, 612 P.2d 915].) Where, for instance, the court has no power to act \u201cexcept in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites,\u201d the court acts without jurisdiction in this broader sense. <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at p. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Collateral attack of such judgments is disfavored, even when the judgment is unauthorized by statute. (See, e.g., <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McConnell </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 715, 727 [285 P.2d 636] [judgment contrary to statute]; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 950-951 [mistaken application of law not reaching court\u2019s power to act]; <em>Conservatorship of O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1087-1088 [excess of jurisdiction]; <em>Law Offices of Stanley J. Bell </em>v. <em>Shine, Browne &amp; Diamond </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1021-1022 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 717] [excess of jurisdiction].) In some cases, however, if the trial court has made \u201ca grant of relief to one of the parties [which] the law declares shall not be granted,\u201d such judgment may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>considered void for lack of jurisdiction notwithstanding the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter. <em>(Michel </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 198, 200 [56 P.2d 546]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>World Life Research Institute </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 836, 847-848 [131 Cal.Rptr. 674]; <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 280, 283 [240 P.2d 319].) An unauthorized grant of relief \u201cis to be distinguished from a judgment in which the relief granted is simply in <em>excess of the amount </em>to which a party is otherwise entitled under the law applicable to his cause of action.\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>World Life Research Institute, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d at p. 848.) Thus, to the extent that appeal from an order denying a motion to vacate constitutes a collateral attack on an underlying judgment from which appeal was not taken, the appeal is not necessarily precluded merely because the court lacked the \u201cwrong\u201d kind of jurisdiction in entering the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In this case, appellant contends that the stipulated judgment was void because she was not asked to consent to or sign the stipulation, contrary to the mandate of Welfare and Institutions Code section 11478.2, subdivision (j).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent maintains that this statute is inapplicable to URESA actions. We must resolve this issue before determining whether the court erred, and if so, whether that error rendered the judgment void.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Section 11478.2, subdivision (j), provides as follows: \u201cA person who is receiving services under Section 11475.1 but who is not currently receiving public assistance on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a child shall be asked to execute, or consent to, any stipulation establishing or modifying a support order in any action in which that person is named as a party, before the stipulation is filed. The district attorney or Attorney General shall not submit to the court for approval a stipulation to establish or modify a support order in such an action without first obtaining the signatures of all parties to the action, their attorneys of record, or persons authorized to act on their behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Clearly, appellant was not asked to consent to the stipulation proffered by the district attorney to the court; on the contrary, Hooper submitted the document without appellant\u2019s signature and with full knowledge that she opposed the settlement he had reached with respondent. Thus, if section 11478.2 governed this action, the district attorney\u2019s acts were unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We agree with appellant that section 11478.2 applies to this action. This statute was enacted in 1991 for the express purpose of encouraging local district attorneys to make support enforcement efforts one of their highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>priorities, and to pursue such cases diligently \u201cto enable families to be self-supporting and to avoid welfare dependency.\u201d (Stats. 1991, ch. 495, \u00a7 1.) The same legislation made \u201crelated and conforming changes\u201d to existing URESA provisions for initiating proceedings, diligently prosecuting actions, and enforcing orders, thereby clarifying the district attorney\u2019s representation of the public interest. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 106, 1991 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">There is no reason expressed either in URESA or in California\u2019s support enforcement program to hold the district attorney to different standards and procedures merely because the child who ultimately benefits from his or her services resides in another state. On the contrary, URESA itself directs the prosecuting attorney to \u201cprosecute the case diligently.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4831, subd. (b).) \u201cProsecuting attorney\u201d is defined as \u201cthe public official in the appropriate place who has the duty to enforce criminal laws relating to the failure to provide for the support of any person.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4802, subd. (h).) In California, that function is served by the district attorney of each county.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 11475.1, subd. (a).) In order to comply with this mandate, the district attorney need only adhere to his or her duties under the procedural scheme set forth in section 11475.1 et seq. Resort to this scheme would be consistent with URESA\u2019s choice-of-law provision, Family Code section 4820, as well as the federal mandate that child support orders be made pursuant to the forum state\u2019s law. (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B(g); cf. <em>State of Ohio </em>v. <em>Barron </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 62, 67 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 342].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the district attorney in this case evidently assumed his duties were defined by sections 11475.1 et seq., because he expressly designated himself as attorney under sections 11475.1 and 11478.2 as well as under pertinent URESA provisions each time he drafted a superior court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Section 11475.1 establishes a unit within the district attorney\u2019s office of each county. That unit has the responsibility of \u201cpromptly and effectively establishing, modifying, and enforcing child support obligations . . . and determining paternity in the case of a child bom out of wedlock.\u201d (\u00a7 11475.1, subd. (a).) Subdivision (g) defines \u201c \u2018enforcing obligations\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cthe obtaining by the district attorney of an initial order for child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>support.\u201d Subdivisions (b) and (c) set forth the required contents of the complaint and answer form provided to the defendant, and subdivision (f) permits the district attorney to seek temporary child support. Subdivision (j) confirms the district attorney\u2019s authority to intervene \u201cZn <em>any action under the Family Code, </em>or other proceeding wherein child support is an issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">No exception is made for plaintiffs who reside outside of California. Indeed, such persons are specifically acknowledged in subdivision (m) of section 11475.1, where guidelines are provided for determining venue of the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is thus apparent that all children, even those living in other states, are the intended beneficiaries of the diligent prosecution of support obligations of parents in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Section 11478.2 reinforces this conclusion. Subdivision (a), which clarifies that the district attorney represents the public interest (not the recipient of services), applies to \u201call actions involving paternity or support, <em>including, </em>but not limited to, <em>proceedings under the Family Code.\u201d </em>Subdivision (g), which requires notice <em>to the </em>recipient of services when a support order is obtained, states that the notice in URESA cases should be made in conformity with URESA. Subdivision (Z) prescribes different ways of sending the notices required by the statute to recipients of section 11475.1 services depending on their residence: California residents are to receive all notices by personal delivery or by first-class mail, whereas in URESA actions the district attorney must mail the notices to the court of the initiating state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Respondent argues that these specific references to URESA in subdivisions (g) and (Z) of section 11478.2 imply that all other subdivisions do not apply to URESA actions. He suggests that if the Legislature had intended every subdivision of section 11478.2 to apply to URESA actions, it would have said so in each subdivision, and it would not have \u201cmade a point of distinguishing\u201d between URESA and non-URESA actions in subdivision (g). Respondent\u2019s reasoning is flawed. If the Legislature intended section 11478.2 <em>not </em>to apply to URESA obligees, then what was the point of making special provision for sending notice of proceedings and orders to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>parties? The only logical answer can be that the district attorney\u2019s duties under section 11478.2 apply to <em>all </em>recipients of services under section 11475.1, including URESA obligees, except where a different procedure is specifically denoted. Respondent does not contradict appellant\u2019s assertion that she was a \u201crecipient of services\u201d under section 11475.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We must conclude, therefore, that URESA actions were intended to be prosecuted according to the same procedures as any other child support enforcement effort. Although no court has made this recognition explicit, published decisions have assumed section 11475.1 is applicable to URESA proceedings in describing the procedural history of the case under review, in noting that they were conducted pursuant to section 11475.1. (See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Comer </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 504, 511 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 155, 927 P.2d 265]; <em>In re Marriage of Ward </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1455 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 32]; <em>In re Marriage of Angoco &amp; San Nicolas </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1532 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 305].) We see no reason to exclude section 11478.2, part of the same procedural scheme, from the duties of the prosecuting attorney in enforcement of child support obligations brought pursuant to URESA.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Respondent protests, however, that URESA actions should be exempt from the procedural mandates of section 11478.2 because obtaining the signature of every out-of-state plaintiff would cause undue delays and pose obstacles to compliance with federal time restrictions. We are unconvinced. Both Congress and this state\u2019s Legislature have placed the highest priority on the right of children to adequate support. The requirement that a custodial parent approve a settlement of support promotes that interest and advances the state\u2019s purpose of obviating reliance on public assistance to provide for children\u2019s needs. The risk of delay in obtaining the signature of the custodial parent is far outweighed by the necessity of resolving support issues in a balanced and thoughtful manner. Whether that parent lives in the same county, another county, or a more distant state should not be a basis for bypassing these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The Legislature has underscored the importance of involving parents in settlements of their support rights by restating the requirement in a separate provision. Family Code section 4065, like the statute at issue here, expressly prohibits the district attorney from stipulating to a child support order below the guideline formula amount without the consent of the recipient parent. In addition, under that provision the trial court may not approve such a stipulated agreement unless the parties declare, among other things, that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>agree to the order and that the needs of the child will be adequately met.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even in general civil contexts, the Legislature has deemed the <em>personal </em>approval of the litigants, either orally before the court or by written agreement, to be a prerequisite to entry of stipulated judgments. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 664.6; <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 583-586 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 896 P.2d 171].) Because settlement of a lawsuit ends the litigation, it is \u201csuch a serious step that it requires the client\u2019s knowledge and express consent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In the context of child support, the Legislature has made it plain that settlement with the obligor parent is an especially \u201cserious step.\u201d Accordingly, in a case not involving public assistance, settlement of a child support issue should not be undertaken without the consent of all parties to the action. If the district attorney has not obtained the signature of each party, the party\u2019s attorney of record, or authorized representative, the stipulation is not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">A judgment is void on its face if the defect is apparent upon examination of the record. <em>(Becker </em>v. <em>S.P.V. Construction Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 493; <em>National Diversified Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bernstein </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 415 [214 Cal.Rptr. 113]; <em>Estate of Lee </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 687, 691 [177 Cal.Rptr. 229].) Here, because the court was without authority to enter any judgment upon a purported stipulation to which both parties had not agreed, the judgment on its face is invalid. This is not merely a mistaken application of the law or a grant of excess relief, but a complete absence of power to accord relief, a judgment \u201ccompletely outside the scope of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant . . . .\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>World Life Research Institute, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d at p. 845; cf. <em>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>City etc. of S. F. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 37, 43-44 [152 P.2d 625] [grant of excess relief not void]; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 950-951 [mistaken application of law].) As one court has suggested, \u201cThe mere fact that the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action before it does not justify an exercise of a power not authorized by law, or a grant of relief to a party that the law declares shall not be granted.\u201d <em>(Selma Auto Mall II </em>v. <em>Appellate Department </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1672, 1683-1684 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 599].)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>A situation comparable to the one before us arose in <em>In re Marriage of Kreiss </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1033 [274 Cal.Rptr. 226]. There a former wife had not been served with notice of a motion to terminate spousal support, contrary to the mandate of former Civil Code section 4809. The respondent, her former husband, contended that the lack of service was merely a procedural irregularity, which did not make the judgment void and subject to collateral attack. Alternatively, he argued, the appellant waived the notice requirement of the statute; and she had actual notice of the proceeding in any event. This court rejected all of the respondent\u2019s contentions. Although the appellant did not bring her motion to set aside the order until after the time had expired under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, nevertheless the failure to comply with the statutory prerequisite of notice rendered the order void on its face and subject to collateral attack at any time. (224 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1039-1040.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The same result is compelled in this case. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 578 with respect to general civil settlements, a personal approval requirement \u201cprotects parties from impairment of their substantial rights without their knowledge and consent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 585.) Here it is not only the substantial rights of the parties, but the welfare of a child that is to be protected. Even acts in excess of jurisdiction may be deemed void, although fundamental jurisdiction exists, where a child\u2019s welfare is the subject of the litigation. (See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d 1020, 1027.) Because the record here does not reflect appellant\u2019s consent in accordance with section 11478.2, subdivision (j), the judgment approving the district attorney\u2019s settlement of appellant\u2019s child support claim was void, and the motion to vacate should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The order denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the September 5, 1995, judgment is reversed. Costs on appeal to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Premo, Acting P. J., and Wunderlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">At the ensuing hearing Hooper recounted his conversation with Syivestri with respect to appellant\u2019s desire that the case be \u201cresolved\u201d more quickly. According to Hooper, \u201c. . . I told her, \u2018Hey, if we could settle it for a decent amount, it would have happened.\u2019 The only way we could get the decent amount would [be to] go to hearing because we disagreed with [respondent\u2019s counsel] and Mr. Eassa on what the case was worth. But when we got the call from Amy Silvestri on behalf of Margaret Carlson, they said, \u2018This is taking too long. Margaret Carlson wants this case over, and over now.\u2019 \u201d Hooper said he was frustrated with this case because he had not been able to settle the matter favorably, and because appellant had \u201cstepped outside the channels of communication; went through a political office to try to exert pressure on the District Attorney to get it resolved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">This section provides, in relevant part: \u201c(a) An appeal may be taken from a superior court in the following cases: [\u00b6] (1) From a judgment . . .

In cases where the stipulation is for an amount below guidelines, the latter statute requires a declaration that, inter alia, the party is fully informed of his or her child support rights and has agreed to the stipulated order without coercion. The district attorney may not stipulate to such an order if the recipient parent has not consented. It does not specifically denote consent by a signature, but neither does it designate the party\u2019s attorney or other representative as authorized to sign a stipulation. Because the parties have not raised or discussed Family Code section 4065 in these proceedings, we make no comment on the relationship between that statute and section 11478.2, subdivision (j).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
