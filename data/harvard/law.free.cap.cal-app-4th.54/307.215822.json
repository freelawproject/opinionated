J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ako\">Intervener Manuel J. Andrade appeals a judgment after jury trial favoring defendant Dennis Edward Jennings (sued as Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London) on Andrade\u2019s complaint-in-intervention for declaratory relief and breach of contract. Attacking the jury\u2019s special verdicts sustaining Jennings\u2019s defense of collusion, Andrade contends such defense was barred as a matter of law and unsupported by substantial evidence. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Jennings issued an excess liability policy to tuna boat captain Andrade\u2019s employer. Suffering shipboard injury, Andrade made a claim against his employer and the vessel. Andrade filed state and federal lawsuits. Since Andrade\u2019s employer\u2019s primary insurer was insolvent, the employer and the vessel\u2019s lienholders sought to settle Andrade\u2019s claim without impairing their interests in the vessel. Eventually, without informing Jennings, the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>settled with Andrade for an amount invoking Jennings\u2019s excess policy. Andrade agreed not to execute against his employer\u2019s assets including the vessel, with the employer assigning to Andrade all its rights against excess insurer Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Under the settlement agreement, Andrade dismissed his state lawsuit against his employer. However, agreeing that Andrade could obtain judgment in his federal lawsuit against his employer in an amount invoking the excess policy issued by Jennings, Andrade and his employer scheduled a prove-up hearing in the federal court. Jennings was then notified of the settlement agreement and scheduled hearing. At the prove-up hearing Andrade presented evidence and his employer offered no defense. The federal court entered judgment favoring Andrade in the requested amount. Although notified of the prove-up hearing, Jennings declined to attend due to his belief such appearance would be pointless in light of Andrade\u2019s employer\u2019s effective admission of liability as part of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Andrade then intervened in his employer\u2019s state lawsuit against Jennings. As a third party beneficiary of the excess policy issued by Jennings and as his employer\u2019s assignee, Andrade sought recovery from Jennings. Defending against Andrade\u2019s claim, Jennings asserted the federal judgment was unenforceable as the result of Andrade\u2019s collusion with his employer. After the superior court granted summary adjudication/judgment favoring Andrade, we reversed and remanded on the limited ground the record contained evidence raising triable factual issues on Jennings\u2019s defense of collusion. Upon remand, the defense of collusion was tried to a jury. The jury returned special verdicts favoring Jennings. Andrade appeals, attacking the verdicts as lacking legal or evidentiary support since despite notice Jennings did not timely intervene in the federal lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We state the facts stipulated by the parties. We state other facts in the light most favorable to Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\n<em>Jennings Issues Excess Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">On behalf of his syndicate, Lloyd\u2019s of London underwriter Jennings issued to Jorge Fishing, Inc. (Jorge), owner of the tuna seiner <em>M/V </em>Maria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>C.J., a protection and indemnity insurance policy for the period February 16, 1983, to February 16, 1984, covering claims exceeding $1 million up to a limit of $5 million (the excess policy). American Maritime Services Corporation (American Maritime) was the vessel\u2019s primary insurer, providing liability coverage up to $1 million.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ultimately, American Maritime became insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>Andrade\u2019s Shipboard Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Andrade worked as a commercial fisherman. Andrade never worked in any other occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In July 1983 the M/V Maria C.J. was docked in Puerto Rico. During loading of aviation fuel onto the vessel, some of the fuel oil spilled onto the wet deck. The vessel\u2019s Chief Engineer Mamede walked through the spilled fuel and up a ladder to locate the vessel\u2019s 33-year-old Captain Andrade. While following Mamede back down the ladder, Andrade slipped and fell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Andrade was diagnosed with lumbar strain. Due to Andrade\u2019s continued pain, doctors thought he might have compression of a nerve root or a protruded disc. Back surgery (internal fixation) was recommended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>Andrade\u2019s State Court Lawsuit Against Jorge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In October 1983 Andrade through Attorney Dougherty sued Jorge in state court for damages for personal injuries allegedly incurred in his July 1983 accident aboard the M/V Maria C.J. (Andrade v. Maria C.J. (Super. Ct. San Diego County, 1983, No. 510275).) Andrade contended the vessel was unseaworthy due to the presence of aviation fuel on the wet deck. Andrade also contended the vessel was negligent in that its chief engineer Mamede allowed the spilling of aviation fuel. Wells Fargo Bank, the holder of a $10 million preferred ship mortgage on the M/V Maria C.J., retained the law firm of Gray, Cary, Ames &amp; Frye (Gray Cary) to defend Jorge against Andrade\u2019s lawsuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">On October 29, 1985, Gray Cary wrote Los Angeles attorney Bradley, counsel for Jennings in another matter. Gray Cary\u2019s letter stated Andrade alleged he was \u201ctotally disabled from tuna fishing\u201d and \u201cwe believe Mr. Andrade\u2019s claim may be in excess of $1,000,000.00, the amount of deductible after which your client\u2019s coverage begins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">On November 5, 1985, by letter to Gray Cary, Bradley stated his firm had not been retained in the Andrade matter and suggested Gray Cary have Jorge\u2019s insurance broker notify Jennings that Andrade\u2019s claim might exceed $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">On December 13,1985, Andrade submitted a settlement conference statement demanding $950,000 from Jorge.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>On December 20, 1985, Gray Cary wrote counsel for Jorge\u2019s broker. Advising that in light of American Maritime\u2019s insolvency Jorge had no primary insurance, Gray Cary requested help in notifying Jennings that Jorge demanded defense of Andrade\u2019s action. Gray Cary\u2019s letter also stated Andrade\u2019s wage loss alone could exceed $900,000 and that at least one doctor had concluded Andrade\u2019s back injuries required spinal fusion surgery. Gray Cary\u2019s letter further stated: \u201cWe have already attempted to negotiate with Mr. Andrade\u2019s attorney, William Dougherty, to assign to him all claims that the owners may have against their various insurers and against your client</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">On December 27, 1985, counsel for Jorge\u2019s broker advised Gray Cary to contact Jennings\u2019s London broker. Gray Cary sent Jennings\u2019s London broker a copy of its earlier letter to Jorge\u2019s broker\u2019s counsel. Gray Cary also advised Jennings\u2019s London broker that trial was \u201cfast approaching\u201d and asked for an immediate response.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">On January 3, 1986, Gray Cary was informed by Jennings\u2019s broker that Jennings had requested the San Francisco law firm of Hancock, Rothert &amp; Bunshoft (Hancock) to contact Gray Cary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In January 1986 Attorney Booth of the Hancock firm asked Attorney Hammer of Gray Cary to keep him updated on case developments including information bearing on liability, damages, medical complaints, and depositions. Hammer told Booth that Andrade\u2019s case had a $200,000 settlement value. Booth asked Hammer to provide him with any information indicating Andrade\u2019s claim might exceed $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">On January 10, 1986, at the settlement conference, Andrade\u2019s Attorney Dougherty made an opening settlement demand of $950,000 against Jorge. Andrade\u2019s settlement statement took into.account Andrade\u2019s claimed wage losses, his recommended back surgery, and his future medical costs. Dougherty generally expected a settlement recovery of between one-third and two-thirds of his initial demand. Gray Cary did not provide Jennings with a copy of Andrade\u2019s offer to settle for $950,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">On May 12, 1986, PCA asked Gray Cary to seek speedy resolution of Andrade\u2019s claim and present a new settlement proposal to Andrade. PCA also told Gray Cary to fashion the settlement agreement without allowing Andrade to record a lien against the vessel and not to accept or appear to accept service of process for Jorge in any in rem federal court lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">On May 13, 1986, noting the absence of primary insurance covering Andrade\u2019s claim in light of American Maritime\u2019s insolvency, Gray Cary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>asked Dougherty to present an \u201cimmediate demand\u201d and new settlement proposal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On June 19, 1986, knowing his client Andrade was recovering well from back surgery performed the previous month, Dougherty met with Gray Cary\u2019s Kammer for about two hours to craft a settlement. Immediately after the meeting, Dougherty drafted and filed with the superior court an offer to compromise for a $1.5 million stipulated judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 998.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\n<em>Andrade\u2019s Federal Court Lawsuit Against Jorge and Vessel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">On June 25, 1986, Andrade through Attorney Dougherty sued Jorge and the M/V Maria C.J. in federal court seeking personal injury damages for negligence under the Jones Act and unseaworthiness under general maritime law. Dougherty named the vessel as a defendant in rem to preserve Andrade\u2019s rights. Gray Cary was Jorge\u2019s defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">On June 25, 1986, Gray Cary wrote Booth, enclosing medical bills for Andrade\u2019s surgery but not mentioning the recent settlement discussions with Dougherty.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">On June 26,1986, Gray Cary received Andrade\u2019s offer to compromise for $1.5 million. Gray Cary did not immediately provide Jennings with a copy of Andrade\u2019s $1.5 million demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">On July 11, 1986, Andrade\u2019s Counsel Dougherty began discussing settlement with Attorney Driscoll of Gray Cary. Dougherty contemplated \u201cactivating\u201d the federal lawsuit to obtain a magistrate\u2019s approval of a \u201cstipulated judgment in the amount of 1.5 million dollars\u201d with Andrade agreeing to a covenant not to execute against Jorge or the vessel and with Jorge assigning to Andrade its rights against Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">On July 11, 1986, Gray Cary wrote to Booth about the Andrade case and payment of his medical bills without mentioning the settlement discussions or Andrade\u2019s new $1.5 million settlement demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">On July 11 and 14, 1986, Booth spoke to Gray Cary attorneys but was not told about Andrade\u2019s $1.5 million settlement demand. During July 1986 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Gray Cary\u2019s Kammer told Booth that Andrade\u2019s claim could be settled if Jennings paid Andrade about $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">On July 16, 1986, Gray Cary wrote Booth, providing surgical reports and requesting payment of medical bills but not mentioning the settlement discussions or the settlement proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In mid-July 1986, Gray Cary received Andrade\u2019s economist\u2019s report estimating Andrade\u2019s wage loss at $1,243,993. Gray Cary did not immediately provide Booth or Jennings with a copy of the economist\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">On July 24, 1986, Gray Cary wrote Booth without mentioning the settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">On October 3, 1986, Gray Cary wrote Booth about payment of medical bills for Andrade but did not mention the settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Meanwhile, from July until November 1986, Dougherty, Gray Cary and representatives of the vessel\u2019s mortgage holders engaged in three-way settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\n<em>Settlement of Andrade\u2019s Lawsuits Against Jorge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">In November 1986 Gray Cary\u2019s Driscoll negotiated the details of a settlement between Jorge and Andrade. Driscoll also prepared the settlement documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">On November 14, 1986, Gray Cary mailed the proposed settlement agreement to Andrade\u2019s Attorney Dougherty.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">On November 18, 1986, Gray Cary received the executed settlement agreement entitled \u201cAssignment of Rights and Claims and Covenant Not to Execute Upon the Assets of Defendant.\u201d The settlement agreement provided Andrade would dismiss his state court action against Jorge (Andrade v. Maria C.J., <em>supra, </em>No. 510275); Andrade could \u201cproceed forthwith to obtain a judgment\u201d against Jorge in his federal lawsuit; Andrade would ask the federal court to award $1,493,993 economic damages; Andrade would not execute against Jorge\u2019s assets; Andrade acknowledged that Jorge would give Jennings notice of Andrade\u2019s request for judgment but Jorge \u201cdoes not know and cannot control how [Jennings] will respond[]\"; and Jorge assigned to Andrade its rights against Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>On January 6 and 15, 1987, Gray Cary wrote Booth about Andrade\u2019s medical bills but did not mention the executed settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">During February 1987 Gray Cary and Booth corresponded several times about Andrade\u2019s claim and payment of his medical bills. In its February 17, 1987, letter to Booth, Gray Cary stated its opinion the value of Andrade\u2019s case \u201cprobably\u201d exceeded $1 million but did not mention the executed settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On February 20, 1987, Booth asked Gray Cary for information about the value of Andrade\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">On March 6, 1987, responding to Booth\u2019s letter, Gray Cary stated that Andrade\u2019s economist estimated Andrade\u2019s wage loss at $1,243,993. Gray Cary\u2019s letter enclosed medical reports about Andrade\u2019s injuries but did not mention the executed settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">On May 26, 1987, Jennings first received notice that Jorge and Andrade had entered into a settlement. On that date Gray Cary wrote Booth, advising that a settlement had been reached with Andrade and enclosing a copy of the agreement. Gray Cary also advised Booth that a hearing on the settlement was scheduled for June 26, 1987. Gray Cary suggested Booth contact Dougherty directly if Jennings needed more recent medical information about Andrade.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">On June 10,1987, Booth wrote Gray Cary, expressing he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Jorge was \u201ccontemplating entering into a consent judgment\u201d on Andrade\u2019s claim. Booth told Gray Cary: \u201cYou must know that this is a clear breach of the assured\u2019s express duty of cooperation with the excess Underwriters, and will void coverage under the Policy.\u201d Booth also told Gray Cary \u201cthis is clearly an attempt on your part and that of Andrade\u2019s lawyer to manufacture a claim in the excess layer where none exists.\u201d Booth stated \u201cthis claim has not yet reached [Jennings\u2019s] layer\u201d and that Jennings \u201cwill not be a part of, and will not be bound by, any attempt to fraudulently enter into a confessed judgment for a sum greatly in excess of what this case could reasonably be considered to be worth.\u201d Booth suggested that Gray Cary \u201creconsider your attempt to \u2018set up\u2019 the excess Underwriters, and accept their offer of a defense to this rather garden-variety claim.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">On June 25, 1987, Gray Cary wrote Booth, forwarding a letter from Andrade\u2019s counsel Dougherty that he intended to seek damages of no less than $1.5 million and no more than $2 million at the federal court hearing on the settlement agreement. Gray Cary\u2019s letter reviewed the Andrade case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>advised Booth the hearing date was continued to July 17, 1987, \u201cin order to give your clients another chance to defend the claim as they see fit. . . Gray Cary told Booth: \u201cYou have the opportunity to appear and to do whatever you feel is appropriate to negate the plaintiff\u2019s argument that his claim is worth more than one million dollars. If your view of the law is correct, and you prevail in your theory that your clients have no duty to pay any amount except that which exceeds one million dollars, you can easily defend this \u2018 garden-variety \u2019 claim so that a judgment in an amount less than one million dollars is entered, thus insulating your clients from any liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On July 16, 1987, Gray Cary was informed by Booth\u2019s secretary that Booth would not attend the settlement hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Federal Court Prove-up Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">On July 17, 1987, Booth did not appear at the federal prove-up hearing. Believing the settlement agreement between Jorge and Andrade had already prejudiced Jennings, Booth did not file a pleading for Jennings or \u201ccontemplate\u201d seeking a continuance. The hearing was not reported. After the parties reviewed the documents with the federal magistrate for about half an hour, the magistrate continued the matter to July 21, 1987, to permit Jennings to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">On July 17, 1987, Gray Cary wrote Booth, advising that the federal settlement hearing was continued to July 21, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">On July 21, 1987, the continued prove-up hearing was held before the federal magistrate. Attorney Dougherty appeared for Andrade. Attorneys Kammer and Olson appeared for Jorge. Neither Booth nor anyone else representing Jennings or other interested parties appeared. The magistrate stated he had not received a formal response or filings of any kind from any other interested party. Testifying on liability and damage issues, Andrade acknowledged jogging about four miles a day. Andrade introduced exhibits about his physical injuries, vocational rehabilitation, and economic loss. Andrade requested damages of $1,586,840.53. Jorge\u2019s attorneys waived opening and closing arguments, did not submit a defense brief and did not present any evidence. Jorge\u2019s attorneys did not object to the documentary or testimonial evidence presented by Andrade and did not cross-examine Andrade, the only witness who testified. Jorge\u2019s attorneys did not contest Jorge\u2019s liability or Andrade\u2019s damages. After the one-hour hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>magistrate referred to Andrade\u2019s \u201cmassive injuries,\u201d stated there was \u201capparently no question with respect to the causation\u201d and awarded the damages requested by Andrade.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Until Andrade\u2019s prove-up hearing, Dougherty\u2019s firm had not obtained a judgment or settlement exceeding $1 million on any maritime personal injury claim. Neither had there been a local judgment or settlement exceeding $1 million in a similar maritime case. The highest settlements in cases involving tuna boat captains undergoing back operations and claiming permanent disability had not exceeded $350,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">On July 28, 1987, the federal court entered a $1,586,840.53 judgment favoring Andrade against Jorge.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In late August 1987 Jennings moved to intervene in the federal lawsuit to file an answer to Andrade\u2019s claim and a counterclaim seeking declaratory relief. The federal court denied Jennings motion to intervene, in part as too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Jennings did not pay Andrade the portion of the federal court judgment within the excess policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>Andrade Intervenes in State Court Against Jennings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">In June 1988 Andrade intervened in this lawsuit initially filed by Jorge. (San Diego Super. Ct. case No. 545364.) Andrade\u2019s complaint-in-intervention alleged he had an interest in Jorge\u2019s success in the litigation as a foreseeable third party beneficiary of Jorge\u2019s insurance contracts and as assignee of all Jorge\u2019s causes of action under those contracts against Jennings, Jorge\u2019s primary insurer and Jorge\u2019s insurance brokers for injuries Andrade incurred while employed by Jorge as master of the M/V Maria C.J.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Andrade\u2019s complaint-in-intervention asserted causes of action against Jennings for declaratory relief and breach of contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Andrade\u2019s pleading sought damages and a declaration Jennings was obligated to pay Andrade as Jorge\u2019s assignee $586,840 in discharge of Jennings\u2019s obligation as the excess insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">In May 1990 the superior court summarily adjudicated five issues, to wit, that (1) res judicata prevented Jennings from relitigating issues conclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>decided in the federal action; (2) the policy issued by Jennings to Jorge was assignable by Jorge to Andrade; (3) Jennings was under the same duty to pay damages awarded to Andrade as Jorge\u2019s assignee whether the excess policy issued by Jennings indemnified Jorge against loss or against liability and/or whether Jorge had first paid the loss; (4) Jorge did not breach the excess policy\u2019s assistance and cooperation clause by entering into the consent agreement with Andrade; and (5) the federal judgment was not the product of collusion between Jorge and Andrade. The court also determined Andrade was entitled to $586,840 judgment as a matter of law on his causes of action for declaratory relief and breach of contract. In accord with the parties\u2019 stipulation, the superior court entered a $586,840.57 judgment against Jennings on Andrade\u2019s causes of action for declaratory relief and breach of contract. Under the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court entered judgment favoring Jennings on Andrade\u2019s other alleged causes of action. Jennings appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In May 1992 concluding as a matter of law that payment by Jorge to Andrade was not required before Jennings could become liable on the excess policy, we held the superior court properly summarily adjudicated the issue that the insurance coverage provided by Jennings indemnified Jorge against liability. However, because the record contained conflicting evidence raising triable factual issues on Jennings\u2019s defense of collusion, we reversed the summary adjudications on the issue of collusion and the subsumed issues whether Jorge breached the contractual assistance and cooperation clauses and whether for purposes of privity and res judicata Jorge adequately represented Jennings's interest in the federal lawsuit. In remanding the matter to the superior court, we stated the federal court judgment could have collateral estoppel effect against Jennings and the assignment by Jorge to Andrade would be upheld if upon remand Jennings\u2019s collusion-based defense were unsuccessful. <em>(Andrade </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(May 4, 1992) D014569 [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Andrade I).)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>H</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Trial of Jennings\u2019 s Collusion Defense Upon Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In December 1993 upon remand to the superior court, Jennings\u2019s defense of collusion was tried to a jury. The parties presented extensive testimonial and documentary evidence. Three witnesses testified the reasonable settlement value of Andrade\u2019s claim was between $150,000 and $250,000. Evidence was presented that Andrade\u2019s counsel Dougherty and Jorge\u2019s counsel Gray Cary discussed, negotiated and executed a settlement agreement containing a covenant not to execute on Jorge\u2019s assets and contemplating entry of a $1.5 million federal judgment after an unopposed prove-up hearing. Evidence was presented that Gray Cary kept Jorge\u2019s creditors informed of the settlement proceedings but delayed informing Jennings. Evidence was also presented that the settlement led to a federal judgment of $1.5 million, an amount sufficient to invoke coverage under the excess policy issued by Jennings. Testifying at trial, Attorneys Dougherty and Kammer did not recall their June 19, 1986, meeting until shown Gray Cary\u2019s billing records during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The jury returned special verdicts affirmatively finding: (1) Jorge\u2019s conduct in entering the November 18, 1986, settlement agreement amounted to fraud against excess carrier Jennings; (2) Jorge\u2019s conduct in obtaining the federal court judgment amounted to fraud against Jennings; (3) Jorge breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing owed to Jennings and such breach prejudiced Jennings; (4) Jorge breached the duty of assistance and cooperation contained in its excess insurance policy and such breach substantially prejudiced Jennings; (5) the November 18, 1986, settlement agreement was the product of collusion between Andrade and Jorge; and (6) the judgment awarded by the federal magistrate was the product of collusion between Andrade\u2019s counsel and Jorge\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In January 1994, based upon the jury\u2019s special verdicts, the court entered judgment that Andrade take nothing from Jennings. Andrade appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Andrade contends Jennings should be precluded as a matter of law from arguing the defense of collusion since the evidence indicated Jennings was on notice his coverage would be involved but did not intervene in the federal lawsuit or otherwise take steps to protect his own interest. Andrade also contends there was no substantial evidence he participated in any \u201csecret conspiracy for fraudulent purposes\u201d or that any such conspiracy damaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Jennings since Jennings assertedly knew everything necessary to protect his own rights in the federal lawsuit. Andrade further contends, even if the jury finding of collusion is upheld, his direct action against Jennings is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Jennings contends he proved that\u2014once Jorge\u2019s primary insurer went bankrupt leaving Jorge potentially exposed to uninsured liability for Andrade\u2019s alleged injuries\u2014Jorge, Andrade and their attorneys \u201cconspired\u201d to enter into a \u201csecret settlement\u201d and obtained a \u201cnon-adversarial\u201d federal court judgment \u201cfraudulently designed\u201d to inflate Andrade\u2019s actual damages to trigger Jennings\u2019s excess insurance. Jennings asserts Gray Cary took such actions on behalf of its \u201cnominal client\u201d Jorge to protect the interests of its \u201creal clients\u201d (institutional lenders) by preventing a sale of the vessel eradicating the lenders\u2019 large mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>State Court Consideration of Collusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Andrade contends as a matter of law the federal court judgment precluded state court \u201creconsideration\u201d of the collusion issue. Andrade asserts Jennings was barred in this collateral action from attacking the federal judgment as collusive since Jennings had notice of his potential liability but did nothing until after the federal court prove-up hearing. Citing <em>Pruyn </em>v. <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 500, 517 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 295]; <em>National Union Fire Ins.

Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 501, 541 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 726], Andrade contends recent case law recognizes that \u201ceven an uncontested prove-up hearing coupled with a covenant not to execute is sufficient to bind the insurer so long as there is \u2018a semblance of independent adjudication.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Asserting the prove-up hearing before the federal magistrate constituted an adequate independent adjudication of his claim, Andrade concludes Jennings could have moved timely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>intervene in the federal action to object to the amount of damages sought by Andrade but chose not to do so and thus must bear the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Contrary to Andrade\u2019s contention, the cases he cites do not establish a bright line rule barring Jennings from asserting the defense of collusion simply because Jennings despite notice failed to attend a prove-up hearing involving some independent adjudicatory action by a court. Instead, case law indicates that the circumstances where the defense of collusion may properly be asserted are varied. (E.g., <em>Pruyn </em>v. <em>Agricultural Ins. Co., supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 517, fn. 16, 518, 522, 526; <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lynette C., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 1434.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence, that Jennings knew of the upcoming prove-up hearing but declined to participate was simply one factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>for consideration by the trier of fact in adjudicating his collusion-based defense. Further, Andrade\u2019s reliance on <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>is misplaced as the issue of fraud or collusion was not before the court there since the insurer had not challenged an earlier unfavorable adjudication on that issue. (27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1444, fn. 7, 1456-1457, fn. 11.) Moreover, the other cases cited by Andrade involved insurers\u2019 wrongful denials of coverage or refusals to defend, significant circumstances not present here. <em>(Pruyn </em>v. <em>Agricultural Ins.

Asserting the evidence was essentially undisputed, Andrade contends the parties disagree only on the reasonable inferences permissibly drawn from such evidence. However, as we shall explain, substantial evidence and reasonable inferences supported the jury\u2019s findings (1) Jorge breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing owed to Jennings; (2) Jorge breached the duty of assistance and cooperation contained in the excess policy issued by Jennings; (3) the November 18, 1986, settlement agreement was the product of collusion between Andrade and Jorge; and (4) the judgment awarded by the federal magistrate was the product of collusion between Andrade\u2019s counsel and Jorge\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u201cWhat constitutes collusion will differ with each fact situation.\u201d <em>(Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat.

An insured may not manipulate claims to an excess carrier\u2019s detriment. <em>(Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>North Star Reinsurance Corp., supra, </em>at p. 792, fn. 9.) In <em>Andrade I, supra, </em>D014569, we observed that the \u201cissue of collusion subsumes the issue whether the insured Jorge breached the contractual assistance and cooperation clauses or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The jury\u2019s finding of collusion will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Reddy </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 118, 123 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 55].) \u201cSubstantial evidence in this regard is any evidence which is not \u2018unbelievable per se.\u2019 [Citation.] When two inferences can reasonably be drawn from the facts presented, this court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.

An appellate court may not judge the evidence\u2019s effect or value, reweigh the evidence, consider the credibility of witnesses, or resolve evidentiary conflicts. (Re<em>ddy </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>at p. 123.) \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdicts are entitled to a great deal of respect from this court, particularly when they have been approved by the trial judge by virtue of his denial of a motion for a new trial.\u201d<em>(Wayte </em>v. <em>Rollins International, Inc. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 1, 21 [215 Cal.Rptr. 59].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Andrade acknowledges the record contained evidence Gray Cary violated the assistance and cooperation clauses of the excess policy issued by Jennings and thus committed a fraud on Jennings by not providing Jennings with a copy of Andrade\u2019s initial offer to settle for $950,000, not providing Jennings with a copy of Andrade\u2019s proposal to settle by stipulated judgment for $1.5 million, not immediately providing Jennings with a copy of the economist\u2019s report indicating Andrade\u2019s wage loss exceeded $1.2 million, entering into the settlement agreement, and not presenting a defense at the federal prove-up hearing. However, Andrade contends such evidence of Gray Cary\u2019s wrongdoing was too weak to overcome the assertedly otherwise uncontradicted evidence that Dougherty simply represented Andrade\u2019s interests honestly and vigorously consistent with his obligations as an advocate. In essence, Andrade attacks as speculation and conjecture the finding he or his attorney participated in collusion. Review of the evidentiary record belies Andrade\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The jury reasonably concluded Andrade\u2019s settlement agreement with Jorge was collusive against Jennings as unreasonable and made in bad faith. (Cf. <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 791 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297].) Jorge had a duty not to manipulate Andrade\u2019s claim to Jennings\u2019s detriment. <em>(Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>North Star Reinsurance Corp., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at pp. 792-793.) However, substantial evidence and reasonable inferences established that Jorge and Andrade crafted the settlement with the specific aim to injure Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The reasonable settlement value of Andrade\u2019s claim was between $150,000 and $250,000. In January 1986 Gray Cary told Jennings\u2019s attorney, Booth, that Andrade\u2019s case had a $200,000 settlement value. Booth asked Gray Cary to provide any information indicating that Andrade\u2019s claim might exceed $1 million and to update him on matters bearing on liability, damages, medical complaints and depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Meanwhile, in December 1985 and January 1986, Andrade\u2019s counsel Dougherty demanded $950,000 from Jorge to settle the claim. Such demand took into account Andrade\u2019s future medical costs including the recommended back surgery and Andrade\u2019s claimed wage losses exceeding $1 million. Dougherty usually compromised seamen\u2019s claims for between one-third and two-thirds of his opening demand. However, in May 1986 Dougherty was formally notified by Gray Cary that in light of American Maritime\u2019s insolvency Jorge lacked primary insurance covering Andrade\u2019s claim. Dougherty was also asked by Gray Cary for an \u201cimmediate demand.\u201d In June 1986 Dougherty met with Gray Cary\u2019s Kammer for two hours. Immediately after the meeting Dougherty drafted and filed an offer to compromise under section 998 for the increased amount of $1.5 million, despite knowing Andrade was recovering well from his back surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">In July 1986 Dougherty began negotiating settlement with Gray Cary\u2019s Driscoll. Dougherty contemplated \u201cactivating\u201d Andrade\u2019s federal court lawsuit to seek a magistrate\u2019s approval of a \u201cstipulated judgment\u201d for $1.5 million, with Andrade agreeing not to execute the judgment against Jorge or the vessel in return for Jorge\u2019s assigning to Andrade its rights against Jennings. The effect of such settlement would be to trigger Jennings\u2019s excess coverage but leave Jorge Fishing and the vessel\u2019s mortgage holders without damage exposure. During the next four months, Gray Cary, Dougherty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the mortgage holders engaged in three-way settlement negotiations. On November 18, 1986, Andrade and Jorge executed a settlement agreement entitled \u201cAssignment of Rights and Claims and Covenant Not to Execute Upon the Assets of Defendant.\u201d However, as noted, Jorge was contractually prohibited from settling any claim to Jennings\u2019s detriment without Jennings\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">As Andrade concedes, the jury heard evidence that despite the policy language and its duty of good faith, Jorge did not provide Booth or Jennings with timely notice of Andrade\u2019s demands, settlement negotiations and other relevant information indicating Andrade\u2019s claim might exceed $1 million. <em>(California Casually Gen. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at p. 283; <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>North Star Reinsurance Corp., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at pp. 792-793.) Indeed, during July 1986, Gray Cary\u2019s Kammer again told Booth that Andrade\u2019s claim could be settled if Jennings paid Andrade about $200,000. Further, in July 1986, Gray Cary told Jorge\u2019s creditors about the settlement negotiations and Andrade\u2019s section 998 offer to compromise for $1.5 million, but did not provide Jennings or Booth with such information until almost a year later. Moreover, when volunteering information to Jennings by phone calls and letters during that interval, Jorge concealed relevant facts including Andrade\u2019s settlement proposals, the ongoing settlement discussions, and the economist\u2019s report estimating Andrade\u2019s wage loss at $1,243,993.  <em>(Lacher </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1046-1047 [281 Cal.Rptr. 640]; <em>Cicone </em>v. <em>URS Corp. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 194, 201 [227 Cal.Rptr. 887].<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>)  Gray Cary also delayed informing Jennings or Booth about existence of Jorge\u2019s $1.5 million settlement agreement with Andrade executed on November 18, 1986. Not until May 26, 1987, despite four letters from Gray Cary to Booth during the interval, was Jennings notified of the executed written settlement agreement. Based upon such evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude Jorge through Gray Cary breached its duties to Jennings of assistance, cooperation and good faith and, indeed, for many months concealed information from Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Other factors properly considered by the jury also indicated Andrade\u2019s settlement agreement with Jorge was unreasonable and made in bad faith.  In determining whether a settlement is reasonable and made in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>faith, jurors may take into account the amount of the overall settlement in light of the value of the case <em>(Abbott Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 858, 873-874 [239 Cal.Rptr. 626, 741 P.2d 124]; <em>Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward-Clyde &amp; Associates, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 499-500); a comparison with awards or verdicts in similar cases involving similar injuries <em>(Samson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 242; <em>Scala </em>v. <em>Moore McCormack Lines, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1993) 985 F.2d 680, 684; <em>Bohemia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 725 F.2d 506, 510-511); the facts known to the settling insured at the time of the settlement <em>(Abbott Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 874; <em>Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward-Clyde &amp; Associates, supra, </em>at p. 499; <em>Xebec Development Partners, Ltd. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 554-555); the presence of a covenant not to execute as part of the settlement (12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 537-538); and the failure of the settling insured to consider viable available defenses <em>(Andrade I, supra, </em>D014569; <em>Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat. Ins. Co., Inc., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 484-485).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">As noted, three witnesses testified the reasonable settlement value of Andrade\u2019s claim was between $150,000 and $250,000. Further, Gray Cary\u2019s Kammer twice told Booth the settlement value of Andrade\u2019s case was $200,000. However, Jorge and Andrade settled for $1.5 million. <em>(Abbott Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 873-874; <em>Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward-Clyde &amp; Associates, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 499-500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">As also noted, at the time of Andrade\u2019s settlement with Jorge there had been no local settlement or judgment exceeding $1 million in a similar maritime case. Further, the highest settlements in cases involving tuna boat captains undergoing back operations and claiming permanent disability had not exceeded $350,000. Additionally, the largest prior jury verdict obtained by Dougherty\u2019s firm in a maritime case was $900,000. <em>(Samson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 242; <em>Scala </em>v. <em>Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., supra, </em>985 F.2d at p. 684; <em>Bohemia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., supra, </em>725 F.2d at pp. 510-511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Finally, the jury could also reasonably conclude available defenses not asserted by Jorge at the prove-up hearing could have reduced Andrade\u2019s provable damages to under $1 million. <em>(Andrade I, supra, </em>D014569; <em>Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat. Ins. Co., Inc., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 484-485.) Evidence indicated a vigorous defense effort would have raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>weaknesses in Andrade\u2019s liability case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Andrade\u2019s contributory negligence,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the speculative nature of Andrade\u2019s claimed future wage losses, and Andrade\u2019s work history and personal factors. At a minimum, such factors should have been considered for settlement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Based on such evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude the settlement amount of $1.5 million was unreasonable and known to be so by Andrade and Jorge. The jury could also reasonably conclude Andrade and Jorge crafted the settlement specifically to injure Jennings. <em>(Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internal. Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 483-484; <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>North Star Reinsurance Corp., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at pp. 792-793.) In sum, subst\u00e1ntial evidence and reasonable inferences supported the jury\u2019s finding the settlement agreement was the product of collusion between Andrade and Jorge.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">(8a) Substantial evidence and reasonable inferences also established Andrade and Jorge obtained the federal judgment in a collusive manner. <em>(Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat.

Where a party wields a settlement \u201cas a sword to enforce its rights as an indemnitee, due process mandates at a minimum appropriate notice and an opportunity for the indemnitor to contest both liability and the amount of damages.\u201d  <em>(Western Steamship Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 100, 118, fn. 15 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 263, 876 P.2d 1062]; cf. <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 289, 293 [282 P.2d l].)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In June 1986, Andrade\u2019s counsel Dougherty and Jorge\u2019s counsel Gray Cary began discussing a $1.5 million stipulated federal judgment. In November 1986 Dougherty and Gray Cary executed the settlement agreement contemplating entry of the $1.5 million judgment at a federal prove-up hearing. Counsel intended that the prove-up hearing would be an unopposed proceeding. Despite numerous phone calls and letters to Jennings\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Booth, not until May 26, 1987, did Gray Cary notify Booth of the executed settlement agreement and the prove-up hearing scheduled for June 26, 1987. Eventually, the hearing was continued to July 21, 1987. However, although Jennings was ultimately given two months to prepare for the hearing, Gray Cary initially intended to give Jennings less than two weeks\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">At the prove-up hearing, Jorge did not contest damages.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Neither did Jorge present liability defenses.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although Andrade\u2019s covenant not to execute in return for Jorge\u2019s assignment of claims rendered Jorge and the vessel\u2019s mortgage holders immune from damages, the record contains nothing suggesting the magistrate was informed of such covenant. <em>(Xebec Development Partners, Ltd. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins.

In light of Jorge\u2019s having effectively admitted liability in the executed settlement agreement, Booth believed not unreasonably that Jennings\u2019s appearance at the hearing would be pointless. (Cf. <em>Western Steamship Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 118, fn. 15.) Moreover, expert testimony indicated Booth satisfied all duties of inquiry required of excess insurer Jennings.  <em>(Span, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat.

Gray Cary did not tell Booth its defense would cease in the future. During 1986 and 1987, Booth was in frequent communication with Gray Cary and had no reason to believe Gray Cary was withholding requested or necessary information about Andrade\u2019s claim. According to the expert\u2019s testimony, Booth was entitled to believe that Gray Cary\u2019s attorneys were truthful and were providing him with complete and accurate information about the status of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In sum, based upon such substantial evidence and reasonable inferences, the jury reasonably concluded the federal judgment resulting from the collusive settlement was the product of collusion between Andrade\u2019s counsel and Jorge\u2019s counsel. <em>(Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat. Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Andrade contends that even if there was collusion, Jennings was not damaged since Jennings assertedly knew everything necessary to protect his own rights in the federal lawsuit. In essence, Andrade attacks as lacking substantial evidentiary support the jury\u2019s findings Jennings was prejudiced by Jorge\u2019s breach of the excess policy\u2019s assistance and cooperation clauses and by Jorge\u2019s breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, on this record the jury reasonably concluded Jorge\u2019s misconduct caused Jennings to suffer substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The exposure of excess carrier Jennings arose when Jennings knew or should have known the limits of Jorge\u2019s primary insurance would likely become exhausted triggering the excess coverage provided by Jennings. <em>(Samson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at pp. 237-239; <em>Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 359, 367 [165 Cal.Rptr. 799, 612 P.2d 889, 19 A.L.R.4th 75]; <em>Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat. Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 483; <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>North Star Reinsurance Corp., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at pp. 791-792.) Determination of such issue was a factual question for the jury. (Cf. <em>Nevis </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 626, 632 [275 P.2d 761].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Jennings presented expert testimony that the economist\u2019s report concluding Andrade suffered $1.2 million economic loss constituted the first indication that Andrade\u2019s claim would likely enter the excess layer of insurance provided by Jennings. Jennings first learned of such report on March 6, 1987, when it was provided by Gray Cary. However, by that time, Jorge was already in breach of his express and implied contractual covenants by concealing Andrade\u2019s $1.5 million settlement demand from Jennings, not providing the economist\u2019s report earlier, engaging in settlement negotiations to invoke coverage under the excess policy issued by Jennings, and executing a settlement agreement containing a covenant not to execute and contemplating an uncontested $1.5 million judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Expert testimony also indicated the settlement agreement with its contemplated unopposed judgment placed Jennings in a position of \u201cultimate prejudice\u201d since the liability issue was a \u201cdone deal\u201d upon Jorge\u2019s agreement to \u201cgive away\u201d all defenses it might otherwise assert against Andrade. Hence, the jury could reasonably conclude that by such time Jennings lacked any meaningful opportunity to present a proper defense of the case, particularly with respect to issues of liability. <em>(Western Steamship Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 118, fn. 15; cf. <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 541, 555 [116 Cal.Rptr. 245, 526 P.2d 253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In sum, substantial evidence and reasonable inferences supported the jury\u2019s findings Jorge\u2019s misconduct prejudiced Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\n<em>Andrade\u2019s Direct Claim Against Jennings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Finally, Andrade contends that even if the jury finding of collusion is upheld, his direct action against Jennings is not barred. Andrade asserts any collusion voided only the settlement agreement and did not relieve Jennings of his contractual obligation to provide coverage for Andrade\u2019s injuries. Hence, Andrade concludes he should be able to return to the trial court with another opportunity to prove his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Jennings contends parties participating in crafting a collusive settlement are <em>\u201cin pari delicto\u201d </em>and may be barred from judicial aid. <em>(River Garden Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 986, 1000 [103 Cal.Rptr. 498].) Jennings contends that Andrade as Jorge\u2019s assignee possessed only those remedies Jorge had against Jennings and was subject to any defenses Jennings had against Jorge. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Co., supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1111; <em>Woolett </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 619, 625 [143 Cal.Rptr. 799].) Hence, asserting collusion is a defense to coverage <em>(Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internal. Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 483), Jennings concludes the jury\u2019s finding of collusion barred Andrade from any recovery against the excess policy issued by Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">However, we do not reach Andrade\u2019s contention about the consequences of the finding of collusion. As Andrade acknowledges, this issue was not briefed or decided in the superior court. Since the issue was not framed before the trial court, its resolution is for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Benke, J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 9, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Jorge\u2019s excess policy issued by Jennings provided: \u201cIn the event that any claim or claims appear reasonably likely to involve Underwriters [Jennings], the Assured shall give prompt written notice to the Underwriters hereon, shall forward every summons or process (or copies thereof) served upon the Assured, and shall thereafter keep Underwriters fully advised as Underwriters may request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5X\">\u25a0 Jorge's excess policy issued by Jennings stated Jennings reserved \u201cthe right and shall be given the opportunity to associate with the Assured or the Assured\u2019s underlying insurers, or both, in the defence and control of any claim suit or proceeding which in the opinion of Underwriters [Jennings] is likely to involve this insurance, in which event the Assured and Underwriters shall co-operate in such defence to the mutual advantage of both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZj\">Jorge\u2019s excess policy issued by Jennings also provided for terms and conditions in the same form as the underlying policy.

The transcript of the federal lawsuit suggests the prove-up hearing involving damages exceeding $1.5 million lacked attributes of an adversary proceeding. [Citation.] In the federal lawsuit Jorge waived opening and closing argument, did not submit a defense brief, did not present any evidence, did not object to documentary or testimonial evidence presented by Andrade, and did not cross-examine Andrade, the only witness who testified.

[Citation.] These circumstances necessarily involve significant independent adjudicatory action by the court, thus mitigating the risk of a fraudulent or collusive settlement between an insured and the claimant. Final judgments entered under either of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>circumstances are binding on the insurer which has wrongfully abandoned its insured and may be enforced directly under Insurance Code section 11580. [\u00b6] There is a sound reason why this should be so. The insurer not only had a right to participate in and to control the litigation, it had a duty to do so. An insurer which has wrongfully abandoned its insured should not be heard to complain or allowed to relitigate the trial court\u2019s judgment merely because the default or uncontested proceedings followed, and were related to, an agreement between the insured and the claimant. Whatever the terms of the settlement, the entry of judgment was based on an independent review and adjudication of the evidence by the trial court. An insurer which has breached its contract is properly bound by the result of such trial proceedings.... [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 516-517.)
