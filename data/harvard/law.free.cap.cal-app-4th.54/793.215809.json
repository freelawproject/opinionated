J.</author>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">John B. Kilroy, Jr., a respondent in a family law child support modification proceeding brought by Sharon S. Cagle Winter, the mother of the minor, has filed a prohibition petition seeking to restrain the respondent court from proceeding with a hearing on an order to show cause concerning potential modification of a Georgia child support decree. Mr. Kilroy argues that the respondent court does not have jurisdiction to modify a Georgia child support order because of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act. (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B.) We agree with Mr. Kilroy, issue our writ of prohibition, and direct the respondent court quash the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">II. Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">On May 10, 1990, Mr. Kilroy and Ms. Cagle entered into a written agreement which provided: Mr. Kilroy was the father of the minor; Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Kilroy agreed to pay to Ms. Cagle $50,000 to provide for the minor; Mr. Kilroy agreed to purchase an annuity contract which would pay $2,750 per month beginning June 1, 1990, as child support; the $2,750 per month child support payment was to continue until the minor turned 18 years; if the minor died before turning 18 years of age, Ms. Cagle would execute the necessary documents to assign the proceeds of the annuity to Mr. Kilroy; if Ms. Cagle died before the minor turned 18, Mr. Kilroy would not object if her parents were named as the guardian for the child; Ms. Cagle was awarded sole custody of the minor; Mr. Kilroy waived his right to visitation at present; however, he could secure reasonable visitation at a later date; and the agreement would be submitted to the \u201cSuperior Court of Forsyth County, Georgia\u201d as part of a \u201cpetition to legitimate the minor child and establish support payments for the minor child . . . .\u201d Ms. Cagle agreed not to contest the aforementioned petition and that the agreement be incorporated by reference as part of a \u201cconsent order and decree . . . .\u201d On June 18, 1990, an order was issued in the Forsyth County Superior Court which: declared the minor to be legitimate within the meaning of Code of Georgia Annotated section 19-7-22<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; identified Ms. Cagle and Mr. Kilroy as the parents of the minor; and described the custody and visitation rights of the parties. The June 18, 1990, order concluded: \u201cThe parties have heretofore entered into an agreement respecting the payment of child support for the benefit of the minor child dated as of May 10, which agreement has been reviewed by the Court, is hereby approved by the Court, and the terms thereof are hereby incorporated by reference as part of this Order and shall be binding and enforceable upon the parties as if set forth in this Order verbatim.\u201d The June 18, 1990, order was filed on July 5, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">On July 5, 1996, Ms. Cagle filed a \u201cStatement for Registration of Foreign Support Order and Clerk\u2019s Notice\u201d pursuant to Family Code section 4853.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statement and notice referred to the order of June 18, 1990, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>accompanied by the May 10, 1990, settlement agreement. On September 11, 1996, Ms. Cagle filed a document entitled \u201cComplaint for Support.\u201d It sought to increase the amount of child support payable to the minor. It adverted to: the May 10, 1990, settlement agreement; the judgment issued June 18, 1990; and the July 31, 1996, registration in California of the Georgia judgment. The complaint filed September 11, 1996, sought to increase the amount of child support and alleged as follows: \u201cThe minor child . . . has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and has required special medical treatment which has greatly increased the costs of his support. [1 . . . [Ms. Cagle] requests that the Court modify the child support order as registered according to California guidelines based on [Ms. Cagle\u2019s] and [Mr. Kilroy\u2019s] relative incomes and assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Also filed on September 11, 1996, by Ms. Cagle, was an order to show cause re child support and attorney fees. The order to show cause sought to increase the amount of monthly support from $2,750 to that provided for by the child support guidelines. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4050 et seq.) Further, the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>to show cause sought an award of reasonable attorney fees. In support of the order to show cause, Ms. Cagle submitted a declaration which stated the following: she and Mr. Kilroy had never been married; Mr. Kilroy did not visit with the minor; she believed Mr. Kilroy had the resources to pay more for child support; she was unemployed and now married with two sons in addition to the minor; in July 1993, the minor was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder; the cost of the testing and diagnosis was $2,000; because of the attention deficit disorder, the minor was required to take the drug \u201cRitalin\u201d three times a day at a cost of $1 per dose; because the minor had \u201cpoor eyesight,\u201d he needed to have an eye examination \u201cevery six months at a cost of $130 per exam\u201d; the cost of eyeglasses for the minor was $300 per year; the minor was required to attend a summer school and camp with a total cost of $2,000; the minor was required to see a psychologist \u201capproximately once a week\u201d at a cost of $100 per hour; the school the minor attended which specialized in attention deficit disorder cost $10,175 per year; and the minor also received the assistance of a tutor which cost an additional $150 per month. Finally, Ms. Cagle\u2019s declaration indicated she and the minor had been in an automobile accident and there had been costs incurred for medical treatment. Her income and expense declaration indicated her monthly expenses totaled $7,540 while her income was the $2,750 monthly child support paid by Mr. Kilroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">On October 3, 1996, Mr. Kilroy filed a motion to quash the order to show cause. The evidence indicated Ms. Cagle and the minor were residents of Georgia. By contrast, Mr. Kilroy was a California resident. Mr. Kilroy argued that California did not have subject matter jurisdiction because of the provisions of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act codified in 28 United States Code section 1738B. The respondent court denied the motion to quash. The respondent court concluded that California had jurisdiction over Mr. Kilroy and the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act was an unconstitutional violation of the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Mr. Kilroy then filed the present prohibition petition. We issued our alternative writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">A. <em>Summary of Holding and Standard of Statutory Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We now determine for the following reasons that California courts at present have no jurisdiction to modify the Forsyth County Georgia support order. We conclude: Under the terms of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, California courts have no jurisdiction at present to modify the Georgia support order; the Georgia order is one that is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act; the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act is not violative of the holding of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 549, 557-564 [115 S.Ct. 1624, 1629-1632, 131 L.Ed.2d 626, 636-641]; and the requirements imposed by the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act is not violative in the present case of the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In terms of the application of 28 United States Code section 1738B to the present case, we are presented with an issue of statutory interpretation. Because we are applying a federal statute, we follow rules of statutory construction enunciated by the United States Supreme Court.  In <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Bonjorno </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 827, 835 [110 S.Ct. 1570, 1575, 108 L.Ed.2d 842], quoting from <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 102, 108 [100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766], the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cThe starting point for interpretation of a statute \u2018is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u2019 \u201d The United States Supreme Court has noted that \u201c. . . the statutory language controls its construction\u201d <em>(Ford Motor Credit Co. </em>v. <em>Cenance </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 155, 158, fn. 3 [101 S.Ct. 2239, 2241, 68 L.Ed.2d 744]) and \u201c \u2018[t]here is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the [legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Oceanic Contractors, Inc. </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 564, 571 [102 S.Ct. 3245, 3250, 73 L.Ed.2d 973].) In interpreting a statute, the United States Supreme Court has noted: \u201c \u2018In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u2019 [Citations.] Our objective in a case such as this is to ascertain the congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will.\u201d <em>(Philbrook </em>v. <em>Glodgett </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 707, 713 [95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d 525].) On another occasion, the court stated, \u201cWe do not, however, construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Morton </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 822, 828 [104 S.Ct. 2769, 2773, 81 L.Ed.2d 680], fn. omitted.) Further, in interpreting a statute, the Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of avoiding: \u201cabsurd results\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Turkette </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 576, 580 [101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246]); \u201c\u2018an odd result\u2019\u201d <em>(Public Citizen </em>v. <em>Department of Justice </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 440, 454 [109 S.Ct. 2558, 2569, 105 L.Ed.2d 377]); or \u201cunreasonable results whenever possible.\u201d <em>(American Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 63, 71 [102 S.Ct. 1534, 1538, 71 L.Ed.2d 748].) Moreover, the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cJudicial perception that a particular result would be unreasonable may enter into the construction of ambiguous provisions, but cannot justify disregard of what Congress has plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>and intentionally provided.\" <em>(Commissioner </em>v. <em>Asphalt Products Co., Inc. </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 117, 121 [107 S.Ct. 2275, 2278, 96 L.Ed.2d 97].) In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Oceanic Contractors, Inc., supra, </em>458 U.S. at page 571 [102 S.Ct. at page 3250], the court stated: \u201cNevertheless, in rare cases the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters, and those intentions must be controlling. . . . [Citations.]\u201d When a statute is unambiguous, its language cannot \u201cbe expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the [legislative] process.\u201d <em>(West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 83, 98-99 [111 S.Ct. 1138, 1147, 113 L.Ed.2d 68].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">B. <em>The \u201cGeneral rule\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In 1994, the Congress adopted the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act which was codified at 28 United States Code section 1738B. (Pub.L. No. 103-383 (Oct. 22, 1994) \u00a7 3(a), 108 Stat. 4064.) It was amended as to matters not pertinent to this appeal in 1996. (Pub.L. No. 104-193 (Aug. 22, 1996) tit. III, \u00a7 322; 110 Stat. 2221.) As presently in force and relevant to this case, 28 United States Code section 1738B(a) states, \u201c(a) General rule.\u2014The appropriate authorities of each State\u2014 (1) shall enforce according to its terms a child support order made consistently with this section by a court of another State; and [&lt;]Q (2) shall not seek or make a modification of such an order except in accordance with subsections (e), (f), and (i).\" As we will note, the language of 28 United States Code section 1738B(a) sets forth the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d concerning enforcement of another state\u2019s support order. The foregoing plain language permits a state court to modify a child support order such as the Georgia decree in the present case when permitted by 28 United States Code section 17388(e), (f) and (i). In other words, California can modify the Georgia order only if the conditions set forth in 28 United States Code 17388(e), (f), and (i) are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">C. <em>There Are No Applicable Exceptions to the General Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHO\">1. <em>The exceptions to the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We now proceed to examine the application, if any of the exceptions to the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d set forth in 28 United States Code section 17388(e), (f), and (i). The first requirement that must be present in order to modify another state\u2019s support decree is set forth in 28 United States Code section 17388(e) and it states: \u201cAuthority to modify <em>orders.\u2014A </em>court of a State may modify a child support order issued by a court of another State if\u2014 [50 (1) the court has jurisdiction to make such a child support order pursuant to subsection (i); and [*]D (2)(A) the court of the other State no longer has continuing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>exclusive jurisdiction of the child support order because that State no longer is the child\u2019s State or the residence of any individual contestant; or [&lt;JQ (B) each individual contestant has filed written consent with the State of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction for a court of another State to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The second aspect of the exceptions to the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d is set forth as follows in 28 United States Code section 1738B(f) which states: \u201cRecognition of child support orders.\u2014If 1 or more child support orders have been issued with regard to an obligor and a child, a court shall apply the following rules in determining which order to recognize for purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and enforcement: [&lt;J[[ (1) If only 1 court has issued a child support order, the order of that court must be recognized, [f] (2) If 2 or more courts have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, and only 1 of the courts would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this section, the order of that court must be recognized. [&lt;]\u25a1 (3) If 2 or more courts have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, and more than 1 of the courts would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this section, an order issued by a court in the current home State of the child must be recognized, but if an order has not been issued in the current home State of the child, the order most recently issued must be recognized. [H (4) If 2 or more courts have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, and none of the courts would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this section, a court may issue a child support order, which must be recognized. [H (5) The court that has issued an order recognized under this subsection is the court having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The third description of the statutory preconditions to modification of another state\u2019s support decree is found in 28 United States Code section 1738B(i) which states as follows: \u201cRegistration for modification.\u2014If there is no individual contestant or child residing in the issuing State, the party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a child support order issued in another State shall register that order in a State with jurisdiction over the nonmovant for the purpose of modification.\u201d The plain language of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act prohibits California courts from modifying another state\u2019s decrees unless there is compliance with the provisions of 28 United States Code section 1738B(e), (f), and (i). In this case, unless there has been compliance with 28 United States Code section 1738(e), (f), and (i), the respondent court did not have jurisdiction to modify the Georgia support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">2. <em>Application of the exceptions to the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d in the present case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">First, there has not been compliance with 28 United States Code section 1738B(e). The initial requirement imposed by 28 United States Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>section 1738B(e)(1) is that this state has jurisdiction to \u201cmake such a child support order pursuant to subsection (i) . . . 28 United States Code section 1738B(i) provides that in order to modify a support decree if there is otherwise jurisdiction, the party seeking the modification must register the existing order in the state where the proceeding is contemplated or pending. Ms. Cagle has complied with this aspect of the statute; the Georgia support order was registered on July 5, 1996. Mr. Kilroy has taken no steps to set aside the registration as permitted by Family Code section 4853, subdivision (b) as described in footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>However, the plain language in 28 United States Code section 1738B(i) only allows the registration to be valid for purposes of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act \u201cif there is no individual contestant or child residing in the issuing State . . . .\u201d In the present case it is undisputed that Ms. Cagle and the minor reside in Georgia, the issuing state. Hence, there has not been a valid registration for purposes of modifying the Georgia order under the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act because both an individual contestant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the minor reside in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Further, the present modification proceeding does not meet the express statutory requirements of 28 United States Code section 1738B(e)(2) because Georgia has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction as defined by the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act and no written consent to jurisdiction has been secured from Mr. Kilroy. As noted previously, 28 United States Code section 1738B(e)(2) sets forth two possible preconditions to modification of another state\u2019s support order as follows: \u201c(2)(A) the court of the other State no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the child support order because that State no longer is the child\u2019s State or the residence of any individual contestant; or [f] (B) each individual contestant has filed written consent with the State of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction for a court of another State to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.\u201d There is no issue as to the second possible precondition\u2014Mr. Kilroy has not filed a written consent. Hence, the relevant issue is whether \u201cthe other State,\u201d Georgia, no longer has \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d under 28 United States Code section 1738B(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Two relevant provisions of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act define \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d The first definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>the state with \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d of the child support order is found in 28 United States Code section 1738B(f)(1) and (5). As related earlier in this opinion, 28 United States Code section 17388(f) defines the duties of a state when another jurisdiction has issued a support order as follows: \u201cIf 1 or more child support orders have been issued with regard to an obligor and a child, a court shall apply the following rules in determining which order to recognize for purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and enforcement: (1) If only 1 court has issued a child support order, the order of that court must be recognized. HD . . . [H (5) The court that has issued an order recognized under this subsection is the court having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d The plain language of 28 United States Code section 17388(f)(1) establishes that California \u201cmust\u201d recognize the prior Georgia order which is the only existing support decree. Therefore, once a court recognizes an out-of-state order, then pursuant to 28 United States Code section 17388(f)(5), the other state has \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act. Title 28 United States Code section 17388(f)(5) states with clarity, \u201cThe court that has issued an order recognized under this subsection is the court having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act also defines \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d in another provision as follows: \u201cContinuing jurisdiction.\u2014A court of a State that has made a child support order consistently with this section has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order if the State is the child\u2019s State or the residence of any individual contestant unless the court of another State, acting in accordance with subsections (e) and (f), has made a modification of the order.\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 17388(d).) Georgia remains the residence of both an individual contestant, Ms. Cagle, and the minor. Hence, under the 28 United States Code section 17388(f)(1) and (5), Georgia is the state with \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">When we construe the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act as a whole, as we are required to do <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 803, 809 [109 S.Ct. 1500, 1504-1505, 103 L.Ed.2d 891]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morton, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 828 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2773]), the statute clearly indicates that Georgia is the state with \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d given the plain language of 28 United States Code section 17388(d) and (f)(1) and (5). Therefore, in the absence of a written consent, Ms. Cagle has failed to establish any of the elements of 28 United States Code section 17388(e)(2). Georgia remains the state with \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d Hence, the respondent court has no power to modify the Forsyth County decree given the language of 28 United States Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>section 1738B(e) which sets forth the parameters of a second state\u2019s authority to modify existing support orders of another jurisdiction. California is prohibited by the provisions of the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d set forth in 28 United States Code section 1738B(a) from modifying the Georgia order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(State Dept. of Revenue </em>v. <em>Fleet </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1996) 679 So.2d 326, 328; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Otte </em>(1996) 123 N.C.App 585 [474 S.E.2d 131, 134]; <em>Schuyler </em>v. <em>Ashcraft </em>(1996) 293 N.J.Super. 261 [680 A.2d 765, 780-781]; <em>Paton </em>v. <em>Brill </em>(1995) 104 Ohio App.3d 826 [663 N.E.2d 421, 425]; <em>Isabel M. </em>v. <em>Thomas M. </em>(1995) 164 Misc.2d 420 [624 N.Y.S.2d 356, 361]; cf. <em>In re Marriage of Lurie </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 658, 673-676 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 835].) Respected California commentators are in accord with our analysis. (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law 1 (The Rutter Group 1996) 16:123.1, pp. 6-41-6-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">D. <em>Ms. Cagle\u2019s Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Ms. Cagle presents two additional arguments, one statutory and the other constitutional, as to why the \u201cGeneral rule\u201d set forth in 28 United States Code section 1738B(a) is inapplicable to the present case and the respondent court has subject matter jurisdiction to modify the Georgia order.

The United States Supreme Court then defined the types of permissible regulation of interstate commerce as follows: \u201cConsistent with this structure, we have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. [Citations.] First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.

The <em>Lopez </em>court concluded its analysis of this latter basis for congressional authority under the commerce clause by defining the permissible scope of regulation by the Congress in this manner: \u201cWe conclude, consistent with the great weight of our case law, that the proper test requires an analysis of whether the regulated activity \u2018substantially affects\u2019 interstate commerce.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 559 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1630; 131 L.Ed.2d at p. 637].)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Support payments between parents in different states substantially affects interstate commerce.  To begin with, such regular transfers of money between residents for purposes of supporting children in different states involves <em>interstate </em>commerce. Utilizing the test set forth by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, supra, </em>22 U.S. at pages 189-190 [6 L.Ed. at page 68] and relied upon in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>514 U.S. at page 553 [115 S.Ct. at page 1627, 131 L.Ed.2d at page 633], the monthly mailing of support checks over what could be an 18-year period before a minor reaches majority is not \u201c \u2018commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other States.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, those cases described the word \u201camong\u201d in the commerce clause as restricted to \u201c \u2018that commerce which concerns more States than one\u2019 \u201d and does not involve \u201c \u2018exclusively internal commerce of a State.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 553 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1627, 131 L.Ed.2d at p. 634]; <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, supra, </em>22 U.S. at pp. 189-190 [6 L.Ed. at p. 68].) The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act regulates interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Further, we conclude child support payments is economic activity which <em>substantially </em>affects interstate commerce. In evaluating whether economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, courts, although not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>absolutely bound by, may give appropriate deference to the evidence which was available to the Congress. Senate Bill No. 922, which ultimately became the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, had its genesis in an independent commission. The United States Commission on Interstate Child Support was established by act of Congress. (Pub.L. No. 100-485 (Oct. 13, 1988) \u00a7 126, 102 Stat. 2343, reprinted in 1994 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 3260.) The purpose of the commission was as follows: \u201cIn 1988, Congress created the U.S. Commission on Interstate Child Support to study the challenges presented by the enforcement and establishment of child support orders across state lines, and to recommend changes to address those challenges.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The report of the United States Commission on Interstate Child Support to Congress described the number of interstate child support cases and the enormous sums of moneys involved as follows: \u201c [Interstate child support cases represent approximately 30% of child support cases in this country. [(j[] . . . Almost identical percentages of mothers in intrastate and interstate child support child support cases report they have awards (61 percent and 59 percent). (The U.S. Com. on Interstate Child Support, Rep. to Congress, Supporting Our Children: A Blueprint for Reform (1993) pp. 3-4, fns. omitted (hereafter Commission Report); Price, <em>When One Party is 3,000 Miles Away </em>(1993) 32 Judges\u2019 J. 16, 16-17.) According to the commission, mothers of children where the father resided in a different state expected to receive in 1989 \u201can estimated $4.0 billion in child support ....\u2019\u2019 (Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 4.) Only 60 percent of the $4 billion was actually recovered. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, the states are obligated to seek reimbursement for welfare payments from nonpaying parents in other jurisdictions, generally fathers. In 1990, the commission reported, \u201cStates report that 477,637 requests for assistance were sent from one state to another state in fiscal 1990.\u201d (Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 4, fn. omitted.) In fiscal year 1990, states collected $457,254,889 in unpaid welfare reimbursements due in other jurisdictions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.) In addition to the sums of money collected in both private and public interstate collections, considerable time is involved. Former United States Senator Bill Bradley has noted that the typical interstate child support case takes a full year to resolve. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 20.) The complexity of interstate enforcement of child support obligations was described by the commission as follows: \u201cThe interstate case processing system is complex from the very beginning when agencies and parents attempt to secure information on the location of the other parent, choose the correct forum to bring a support action and select remedies that are appropriate to establish and enforce an order. The very nature of a process that involves two states and requires communication between two jurisdictions with different laws and procedures makes reform a challenge. . . . [Wjhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>interstate cases require more time to process, more communication with the parties and other states, and often involve more complex legal issues, the cases compete for limited staff resources in the child support agency and court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In enacting the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Act, the Congress found that the lack of uniformity caused the following impacts: noncustodial parents were thereby encouraged to move to another state; the movement of noncustodial parents increased interstate travel and communication that was necessary to secure enforcement of child support orders; the increased time and expenses involved in securing enforcement of support orders were disruptive of occupations and commercial activity; the movement of noncustodial parents to a new state has resulted in massive arrearages nationwide; there was an ongoing avoidance of child support obligations by noncustodial parents; there was the resulting excessive relitigation of child support orders; the excessive relitigation resulted in conflicting orders, confusion, a waste of judicial resources, and loss of public confidence in the courts; the deprivation of liberty and property without due process of law; and burdens on commerce among the states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Pub.L. 103-383 (Oct. 22, 1994) \u00a7 2, 108 Stat. 4064.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>Lopez </em>is obviously distinguishable from the present case. The <em>Lopez </em>majority concluded the criminal statute at issue, one prohibiting possession of a firearm in a school zone, did not involve a substantial impact on interstate commerce. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 559-562 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1630-1631, 131 L.Ed.2d at pp. 638-639].) In fact, the <em>Lopez </em>court noted, the law prohibiting firearm possession in a school zone had no effect on interstate commerce when it held: \u201c[The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990] is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with \u2018commerce\u2019 or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\u201d Further, the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 involved federal criminalization of already criminal conduct which by its nature effected a \u201c \u2018 \u201cchange in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 561, fn. 3 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1631, 131 L.Ed.2d at pp. 638-639].) Finally, unlike the present case, in <em>Lopez, </em>the Government admitted that there were no legislative committee or congressional findings \u201c \u2018regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 562 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1631, 131 L.Ed.2d at p. 640].) By contrast, in the present case, there were specific legislative committee and congressional findings which indicated: There were a large and growing number of interstate disputes concerning child support; the lack of uniformity in various state laws contributed to relatively low levels of support in interstate cases; the absence of a statute compelling the states to recognize each others\u2019 child support orders caused noncustodial parents to engage in interstate relocation to avoid jurisdiction; there was a corresponding increase in interstate travel and communication; the absence of federal law compelling recognition of state court support orders had led to massive arrearages nationwide; the then existing state of the law encouraged disregard of court orders; the failure of parents to pay child support had led to substantial hardship for parents; and there had been a resulting excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>litigation of support orders in various jurisdictions. Based on the foregoing, we conclude the present statute aimed at a growing problem involving enormous sums of money and multi-state governmental activities directed at recovering unpaid support solely in interstate cases substantially affects commerce between the various states. <em>Lopez </em>is therefore not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">b. <em>Improper command to state government</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Citing <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 144, 155-188 [112 S.Ct. 2408, 2417-2434, 120 L.Ed.2d 120], Ms. Cagle argues that the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act is violative of the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it forces the states to regulate a federal program. The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution states, \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d At the outset, we note that the United States Supreme Court has only invalidated federal laws because they are invasive of reserved state powers on the rarest of occasions. In <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pages 174-177 [112 S.Ct. at pages 2427-2429], the United States Supreme Court invalidated a federal regulation which compelled the states: to engage in regulation of low level nuclear waste; in the alternative to take title to the materials to the nuclear waste; and as a result of taking possession and title to the waste to become liable for all ensuing damages. Because the regulations required the states to \u201c \u2018enact and enforce a federal regulatory program,\u2019 \u201d they were outside the scope of congressional power and barred by the Tenth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 176 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2428].) In <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 452, 469-470 [111 S.Ct. 2395, 2405-2406, 115 L.Ed.2d 410], the court held that the supremacy clause did not under the circumstances override a state\u2019s Tenth Amendment rights to impose retirement rules which were otherwise violative of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The only other case to date in the last half-century where a Tenth Amendment claim was sustained by the United States Supreme Court was in <em>National League of Cities </em>v. <em>Usery </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 833, 844-852 [96 S.Ct. 2465, 2470-2474, 49 L.Ed.2d 245] where the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to public employees was invalidated as violative of the Tenth Amendment.

The court has sustained governmental entities\u2019 Tenth Amendment claims where the federal government requires a state to enact and enforce a congressionally mandated regulatory program. <em>(New York </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 176 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2428].) Also, the Supreme Court has invalidated a federal restriction contained in an ambiguous statute relating to the retention of state judges. <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pp. 469-470 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2406].) Other than these two narrow situations, all Tenth Amendment claims have ultimately been rejected by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">With the foregoing unmistakable development of the law in mind, we conclude that under the supremacy clause, as interpreted in <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pages 469-470 [111 S.Ct. at page 2406], insofar as the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act requires California to give deference to the Georgia order, there is no violation of the Tenth Amendment. This we conclude is particularly true given the fact that the authority to adopt general laws which enforce full faith and credit of state court judgments is a specified power of the Congress.  In developing its Tenth Amendment jurisprudence, the United States Supreme Court has held that the supremacy clause contained in article VI, clause 2 of the federal Constitution may be the basis for overriding a Tenth Amendment claim. Article VI, clause 2 of the United States Constitution states, \u201cThis Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has held that issues of state court organization and procedure can be the subject of Tenth Amendment protection. <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 460 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2400] [\u201ccase concerns a state constitutional provision through which the people of Missouri establish a qualification for those who sit as their judges . . . ; it is a decision of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign entity\u201d]; <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Dougall </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 634, 647 [93 S.Ct. 2842, 2850, 37 L.Ed.2d 853] [\u201cthis power and responsibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>State applies, not only to the qualifications of voters, but also to persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions\u201d]; <em>John </em>v. <em>Paullin </em>(1913) 231 U.S. 583, 585 [34 S.Ct. 178, 178, 58 L.Ed. 381] [\u201cWithout any doubt it rests with each State to prescribe the jurisdiction of its appellate courts, the mode and time of invoking that jurisdiction, and the rules of practice to be applied in its exercise . . . .\u201d]; <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull </em>(1798) 3 U.S. 386, 387 (3 Dall.) [1 L.Ed. 648] [\u201cThe establishing courts of justice, the appointment of judges, and the making regulations for the administration of justice, <em>within each state, </em>according to its laws, <em>on all subjects not entrusted to the federal government, </em>appears to me to be the <em>peculiar </em>and <em>exclusive </em>province, and duty of the <em>state legislatures.\u201d </em>(Original italics.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">However, the Supreme Court has made it clear under the supremacy clause that the reserved powers of the states can be overridden by specific federal statutes which direct state courts to abide by national laws. The controlling authority in this regard is <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pages 460-461 [111 S.Ct. at page 2401] where the Supreme Court ruled on the application of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to state judges. The Supreme Court noted that such regulation by the federal government which intruded on the sovereign power of the citizens of Missouri which would be constitutionally permissible under the supremacy clause only in the face of a specific congressional enactment. Speaking of the \u201cinterference\u201d of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in the retention of Missouri judges, the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cCongressional interference with this decision of the people of Missouri, defining their constitutional officers, would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers. For this reason, \u2018it is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress\u2019 intent before finding that federal law overrides\u2019 this balance. <em>Atascadero [State Hospital </em>v. <em>Scanlon </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 234,] 243 [105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146, 87 L.Ed.2d 171], We explained recently: ['JD \u2018[I]f Congress intends to alter the \u201cusual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,\u201d it must make its intention to do so \u201cunmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\" <em>Atascadero State Hospital </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 242 [105 S.Ct. 3142, 3147, 87 L.Ed.2d 171] (1985); see also <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 99 [104 S.Ct. 900, 907, 79 L.Ed.2d 67] (1984). <em>Atascadero </em>was an Eleventh Amendment case, but a similar approach is applied in other contexts.

(501 U.S. at pp. 456-464 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2398-2403].)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">By contrast, the pertinent language in the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act unambiguously reflects a specific congressional intent to preempt state court authority to modify another jurisdiction\u2019s orders which insure payments to children unless the enumerated circumstances are present. 28 United States Code section 1738B(a) states with crystal clear explicitness, \u201cThe appropriate authorities of each State ...[*][] (1) shall enforce according to its terms . . . and [f] . . . shall not seek or make a modification of such an order except in accordance with subsections (e) (f) and (i).\u201d Unless the circumstances set forth in 28 United States Code section 17388(e), (f), and (i) are present, a state court must enforce and may not modify another jurisdiction\u2019s child support order. There is no ambiguity. Unless the case falls within the ambit of 28 United States Code section 1738B(e), (f), and (i), the duty of every state court judge is clear\u2014there must be enforcement and no modification of another jurisdiction\u2019s child support order. None of the ambiguity cited in <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pages 461-463 [111 S.Ct. at pages 2401-2402] is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Because the limitation on state court jurisdiction is clear, the supremacy clause permitted the Congress to adopt the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act. This is so even though 28 United States Code section 1738B preempts state court jurisdiction to modify interstate child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>orders.  In <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra, </em>501 U.S. at page 460 [111 S.Ct. at page 2400], the court described the effect of the Supremacy Clause as follows: \u201cThe Federal Government holds a decided advantage in this delicate balance: the Supremacy Clause. U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. As long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the States. Congress may legislate in areas traditionally regulated by the States. This is an extraordinary power in a federalist system. It is a power that we must assume Congress does not exercise lightly.\u201d The federal Supreme Court has repeatedly relied on the supremacy clause to preempt state laws on a variety of subjects related to judicial proceedings. <em>(Block </em>v. <em>North Dakota, supra, </em>461 U.S. at pp. 288-289 [103 S.Ct. at p. 1820] [congressionally adopted statute of limitations binding on states pursuant to supremacy clause, the Tenth Amendment notwithstanding]; <em>Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 150-159 [102 S.Ct. 3014, 3020-3025, 73 L.Ed.2d 664] [California courts must enforce due on sale clause because of regulation promulgated by Federal Home Loan Bank]; <em>FERC </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>456 U.S. 760-761 [102 S.Ct. at p. 2138] [supremacy clause permits federal regulation of state public utility despite Tenth Amendment]; <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Katt </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 386, 389-393 [67 S.Ct. 810, 812-814, 91 L.Ed. 967, 172 A.L.R. 225] [under supremacy clause, Rhode Island courts must enforce federally mandated price controls]; <em>Hauenstein </em>v. <em>Lynham </em>(1879) 100 U.S. 483, 488-491 [25 L.Ed. 628] [Virginia courts required by supremacy clause to enforce terms of Swiss-American treaty in probate case].) Because the statute at issue is unambiguous, the supremacy clause permitted Congress to regulate and preempt state court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The foregoing supremacy clause considerations are more compelling given the fact that the full faith and credit clause has an enforcement provision. Article IV, section 1 of the United States Constitution states: \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\u201d Congress has been expressly delegated the power to enact laws which set forth the effect of \u201c \u2018judicial [proceedings of every other [s]tate.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Migra </em>v. <em>Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed. </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 75, 80, fn. 4 [104 S.Ct. 892, 896, 79 L.Ed.2d 56]; <em>Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Santa Fe Ry. </em>v. <em>Sowers </em>(1909) 213 U.S. 55, 64 [29 S.Ct. 397, 399, 53 L.Ed. 695]; <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Watertown </em>(1894) 153 U.S. 671, 676 [14 S.Ct. 947, 949, 38 L.Ed. 861]; <em>Matter of Cook </em>(7th Cir. 1995) 49 F.3d 263, 266.) An example of the exercise of this power is the adoption of 28 United States Code sections 1738 and 1738A. Hence, Ms. Cagle\u2019s Tenth Amendment argument has no merit. Congress adopted the Full Faith and Credit for Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Support Orders Act pursuant to its express power set forth in article IV, section 1 of the United States Constitution to enact legislation describing the effect of a state court judgment. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act must therefore be enforced in California courts by reason of the supremacy and full faith and credit clauses. Since Georgia has sole and exclusive jurisdiction under the provisions of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, California at present has no jurisdiction to modify the June 18, 1990, support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">IV.

A report prepared for the Senate Judiciary Committee analyzed the foregoing findings as follows: \u201cSection 2 provides that the Congress finds that a large and growing number of child support cases involve disputes across state lines, and the laws by which courts determine their authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>establish and modify child support orders are not uniform. This lack of uniformity in interpreting child support orders, combined with the inability of States to take certain actions outside of its own boundaries, has led to a number of deficiencies in child support collection. [\u00b6] Lack of uniformity among the States encourages noncustodial parents to relocate outside the States where their children and custodial parents reside, in order to avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of such States. The result is an expensive, time consuming, and disruptive burden on the child and the custodial parent. In addition, the lack of uniformity contributes to relatively low levels of child support payments in interstate cases, allows noncustodial parents to avoid payment of child support for extended periods of time, and contributes to a number of other problems within the court system, including an increase in litigation and the establishment of conflicting orders in various jurisdictions. [\u00b6] Among the results of conditions described in this section are the deprivation of rights of liberties and property without due process of law, burdens on commerce among the States, and harm to the welfare of children and their parents or other custodians.\u201d (1994 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.
