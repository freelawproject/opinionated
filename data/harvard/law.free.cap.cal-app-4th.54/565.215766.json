The initiative conditioned the development of the facility on approval from various state and federal agencies. The initiative placed the responsibility for obtaining the state and federal permits on the \u201cApplicant,\u201d defined as \u201cServcon-San Marcos, Inc. or its assignee or authorized representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Pala Band of Mission Indians<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Pala), which owns property near the Gregory Canyon site, petitioned for a writ of mandate, requesting the court to declare the initiative invalid because several of its provisions violated the California Constitution and state law. Pala named the County of San Diego and the San Diego County Board of Supervisors (collectively County) as respondents/defendants, and named Servcon-San Marcos, Inc. (Servcon) as the real party in interest. The County and Servcon filed answers urging the court to deny Pala\u2019s petition and to enter judgment in respondents\u2019 favor. After considering the parties\u2019 written submissions and their counsels\u2019 oral argument, the court denied Pala\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pala appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">We conclude section 8, subdivision A (Section 8A) of the initiative violates the California Constitution\u2019s prohibition on an initiative naming a private entity to \u201cperform any function or to have any power or duty . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 12.) We determine, however, Section 8A is severable. We reject Pala\u2019s additional challenges to Proposition C. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment, except with respect to Section 8A.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Proposition C, a copy of which is attached to this opinion, contains eight pages of text and two maps. The proposition text is divided into 12 separate sections. We summarize these sections below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Section 1 states the intent of the initiative measure is to (1) \u201cprovide for the siting of a new recycling collection center and . . . solid waste landfill . . (2) \u201censure that the [collection center and landfill] . . . fully comply with all environmental laws and regulations . . (3) \u201camend the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and other ordinances and policies of the County of San Diego to allow the construction and operation of a [recycling center and landfill] . . . on . . . [the] Gregory Canyon site . . and (4) \u201cprovide that at least 1313 acres of the . . . site will be dedicated as permanent open space to create a substantial preservation area . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Section 2, entitled \u201cFindings and Purpose,\u201d sets forth the reasons a new solid waste facility is needed in North San Diego County and the reasons Gregory Canyon is a preferred location for the facility. This section describes a \u201csolid waste crisis\u201d in San Diego County, resulting from \u201c[l]ocal opposition to landfill sites and disagreement between north county cities and the County . . . over the handling of the solid waste system . . . .\u201d The section further states that the Gregory Canyon site was selected as one of the preferred landfill sites based on a 1987 study evaluating 168 alternate sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Section 3, entitled \u201cDescription of the Project,\u201d identifies the location of the Gregory Canyon site, by referring to an attached map, and describes the main features of the project, including a lined landfill, access road and bridge, scale area, recycling collection center, and activities and operation center. Section 3 then states \u201c[t]he Applicant shall be entitled to adjust the size and location of solid waste operations and to alter the proposed facilities based on a detailed site plan to be submitted to the [California] Integrated Waste Management Board for its review and approval as part of the solid waste facilities permit.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Section 4, entitled \u201cPermits,\u201d states the applicant \u201cshall secure\u201d or \u201cshall obtain\u201d numerous identified environmental and other regulatory permits and \u201cshall conduct\u201d consultations with specified government agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">Section 5, entitled \u201cMitigation Measures,\u201d provides \u201cvoter approval of the Project\u201d is conditioned on various \u201cmitigation measures\u201d to ensure \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Project is constructed and operated in a manner which minimizes its environmental impacts . . . .\u201d Section 5 then lists 18 mitigation measures that the applicant must comply with in operating the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Section 6, entitled \u201cTipping Fee and Financial Guarantees,\u201d states the tipping fee charged \u201cby the Project\u201d cannot exceed the fee currently charged at county-owned landfills, but that the fee schedule \u201cshall be subject to changes or adjustments based upon tipping fees negotiated between the Applicant and various public agencies agreeing to provide solid waste to the Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Section 7, entitled \u201cImplementation\u201d contains four subparts. Sections 7, subdivision A (Section 7A) and 7, subdivision B (Section 7B) amend the County General Plan, subregional plans, community plans, and the County Zoning Ordinance to designate the Gregory Canyon site for use as a solid waste facility. Sections 7, subdivision C (Section 7C) and 7, subdivision D (Section 7D) direct the County to make all necessary amendments to ordinances, rules and regulations, the general plan, subregional and community plans, and the Zoning Ordinance. Section 7D provides the County \u201cshall cooperate with the Applicant wherever possible in issuing permits and approvals so that the Project can proceed in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Section 8 is the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section. Section 8A defines \u201cApplicant\u201d as \u201cServcon-San Marcos, Inc. or its assignee or authorized representatives.\u201d Section 8, subdivision D (Section 8D) defines \u201cProject\u201d as \u201cthe recycling collection center and landfill and associated structure and improvements as described in Section 3 of this initiative measure <em>as subsequently modified by a detailed site plan submitted by Applicant </em>to the [California] Integrated Waste Management Board as part of the solid waste facilities permit.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 8B identifies the location of the Gregory Canyon site.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Section 9 recognizes the private ownership of the proposed solid waste site. The section states, \u201c[t]he Gregory Canyon site shall remain private land until purchased by a public agency or Joint Powers Authority for its fair market value. Nothing contained herein shall restrict the right of any public agency to exercise its eminent domain power as authorized by law to acquire the Gregory Canyon site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Section 10 provides \u201c[t]his measure may be amended or repealed only by a majority of the voters voting in an election thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Section 11 contains a severability clause, stating that if one portion of the initiative is declared invalid, \u201csuch decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Section 12 sets forth rules governing the initiative\u2019s relationship with other ballot measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">I. <em>General Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The main purpose of Proposition C is to amend the General Plan<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Zoning Ordinance to permit a solid waste facility\u2014constructed and operated in compliance with all relevant environmental laws and regulations\u2014to be located at the Gregory Canyon site,  Our Supreme Court has long held zoning ordinances are subject to amendment by initiative (see <em>Arnel Development Co. </em>v. <em>City of Costa Mesa </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 511, 516 [169 Cal.Rptr. 904, 620 P.2d 565]) and recently confirmed that a general plan may also be amended by initiative. <em>(DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 775.) The court has further \u201cspecifically recognized that the Legislature conceives land-use planning as legislative action\u2014part of the political process\u2014and not as \u2018something distinct from the local legislative function, to be performed by an apolitical planning commission.\u2019 <em>(DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 773, fn. 3.)\u201d <em>(Memorial Hospitals Assn. </em>v. <em>Randol </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1313-1314 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 547].)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">We are additionally mindful of the substantial public concern with proper solid waste management and appropriate landfill siting in this state. In 1989, the Legislature declared \u201c[t]he amount of solid waste generated in the state coupled with diminishing landfill space and potential adverse environmental impacts from landfilling constitutes an urgent need for state and local agencies to enact and implement an aggressive new integrated waste management program.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 40000, subd. (d).) Thus, \u201c. . . the responsibility for solid waste management is a shared responsibility between the state and local governments\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 40001, subd. (a)) and \u201c. . . it is in the public interest for the state ... to authorize and require local agencies ... to make adequate provision for solid waste handling . . . .\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 40002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Our review of this appeal is also strictly circumscribed by the long-established rule of according extraordinarily broad deference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>electorate\u2019s power to enact laws by initiative. The state constitutional right of initiative or referendum is \u201cone of the most precious rights of our democratic process.\u201d <em>(Mervynne </em>v. <em>Acker </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 558, 563 [11 Cal.Rptr. 340].) These powers are reserved to the people, not granted to them. Thus, it is our duty to \u201c \u2018 \u201cjealously guard\u201d \u2019 \u201d these powers and construe the relevant constitutional provisions liberally in favor of the people\u2019s right to exercise the powers of initiative and referendum. <em>(Rossi </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 688, 695 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363, 889 P.2d 557].) An initiative measure \u201c \u2018must be upheld unless [its] unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 711.)  An initiative measure amending a general plan or zoning ordinance is valid \u201cso long as reasonable minds might differ as to the necessity or propriety of the enactment . . . .\u201d <em>(Garat </em>v. <em>City of Riverside </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 292 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 504], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 743, fn. 11 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Pala does not challenge these general principles. Pala instead asserts numerous specific arguments in an attempt to persuade us that Proposition C violates constitutional and statutory provisions. Pala argues Proposition C is invalid because it (1) proposes only indirect amendments to the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance; (2) is inconsistent with other portions of the General Plan; (3) violates Public Resources Code section 50000.5; (4) reflects administrative acts; (5) eliminates \u201cessential\u201d County functions; (6) fails to adequately inform the voters of the initiative provisions; (7) contains an invalid \u201ctipping fee\u201d provision; and (8) violates California Constitution, article II, section 12 by defining the applicant as \u201cServcon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In the published portion of this opinion, we explain why we reject the first (\u201cindirect amendment\u201d) argument and explain the basis of our conclusion that Section 8A violates the California Constitution but that Section 8A is severable and does not affect the validity of the remainder of the initiative. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we reject Pala\u2019s additional contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">We emphasize that in addressing these issues, our role is limited to determining whether Proposition C, approved by San Diego County voters, violates any constitutional or statutory provisions. It is not our role, and we make no attempt, to judge the merits of the initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>II. <em>Proposition C Is Not Invalid as \u201cIndirect\u201d Legislation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Pala first argues Proposition C is constitutionally infirm because the initiative\u2019s \u201cImplementation\u201d section (section 7)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> proposes only \u201cindirect\u201d amendments to the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. Pala relies on <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>City of San Clemente </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1504 [277 Cal.Rptr. 550] (Marblehead).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\"><em>Marblehead </em>invalidated a local initiative measure that directed the San Clemente City Council to enact general plan amendments to reflect specified \u201cconcepts.\u201d <em>(Marblehead, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1510.) The San Clemente initiative provided that before any other general plan amendment could be approved, certain defined levels of transportation services and other city services must \u201c \u2018be achieved and maintained.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1507.) The initiative stated \u201c \u2018[u]pon the effective date of this initiative, the general plan of the City shall be deemed to be amended to contain these concepts and enforced as such by the City. , . . The City shall within six (6) months revise the text of the general plan and other ordinances to specifically reflect the provisions of this amendment and ordinance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\"><em>Marblehead </em>concluded this initiative was beyond the scope of the electorate\u2019s initiative power. Noting that the California Constitution limits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>initiative power to the enactment of \u201cstatutes\u201d <em>(Marblehead, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1508-1509; Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 8; see <em>American Federation of Labor </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 687, 707-716 [206 Cal.Rptr. 89, 686 P.2d 609]), the <em>Marblehead </em>court reasoned the initiative measure was invalid because it did \u201cnot directly amend San Clemente\u2019s general plan\u201d and therefore it was not a \u201cstatute.\u201d <em>(Marblehead, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1510.) The court explained the initiative \u201cconstitutes a resolution by the voters declaring that the city\u2019s general plan should be revised to reflect the <em>'con-cepts\u2019 </em>expressed in the measure. The actual amendment of the general plan is left to the city council. Which elements of the general plan are affected and how the substantive terms of Measure E are to be incorporated into these elements is unexplained.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Marblehead </em>stressed that the city council \u201ccould not simply append [the initiative] to the existing [general plan]\u201d since a general plan must be a \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cintegrated\u201d document. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Relying on <em>Marblehead, </em>Pala argues each of the subsections of section 7 \u201care indirect legislation\u201d and therefore they are \u201cunconstitutional and must be stricken.\u201d We disagree. Proposition C\u2019s implementation section is not comparable to that found inadequate in <em>Marblehead.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Unlike the conceptual directives underlying the <em>Marblehead </em>initiative, Section 7A amends the General Plan; it does not rely on future legislative action. This is accomplished by language directing that the land use element of the General Plan be changed to permit a previously impermissible land use (waste disposal) in a particular area (Gregory Canyon). Section 7A provides the land use element and all relevant community plans and maps \u201cshall be amended to designate the Gregory Canyon site Public/Semi-public lands with a Solid Waste Facility Designator.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is a proper amendment as it makes a specific change to a specific portion of the General Plan. Because the General Plan\u2019s land use element sets forth the county\u2019s intentions concerning the distribution, location and use of real property (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302), this was the appropriate element to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We reject Pala\u2019s argument that additional text was necessary to designate Gregory Canyon as a site for a solid waste facility. Respondents have presented portions of the General Plan reflecting that the Section 7A text is the appropriate method for amending the General Plan to allow a landfill to be developed and operated on the site. Under the General Plan, a \u201cPublic/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Semi-public Lands with a Solid Waste Facility Designator\u201d is a term of art and the label is all that is necessary to designate a waste disposal use on that land. Pala has not presented any authority to support its assertion that more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Likewise, Section 7B specifically amends the Zoning Ordinance to create a new zoning classification applicable to the Gregory Canyon site. This is a proper amendment since it makes a specific change to the Zoning Ordinance. The fact that the initiative did not cite to the particular ordinance number where the amendment will be located does not invalidate the initiative. We are unaware of any authority requiring that an initiative specify the particular numerical section that will contain the proposed amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">While Sections 7C and 7D do not propose \u201cdirect\u201d amendments to the laws or to the General Plan, <em>Marblehead </em>does not provide a basis for invalidating these sections. The proposed general plan amendments in <em>Marblehead </em>did not state how <em>any </em>specific element of the general plan would be changed. Rather, the San Clemente initiative required the city council to make amendments as necessary to promote land use \u201cconcepts\u201d identified in the initiative. <em>Marblehead </em>stated the voters could not propose such unspecified amendments to the San Clemente general plan because such vague mandate is inconsistent with the purpose of a general plan, to serve as an \u201c \u2018integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies . . . (Marblehead, <em>supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1510; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 65300.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Here, the voters said precisely how the General Plan is to be amended\u2014 Section 7A changes the land use element to designate the Gregory Canyon site for use as a solid waste facility. Sections 7C and 7D merely tell the County to enact any necessary amendments to ensure the General Plan amendment will take place. Such enabling legislation promotes, rather than violates, the requirement that a general plan reflect an integrated and consistent document. Further, on this record there is no basis to believe any amendment to the General Plan would be necessary since there is no evidence Proposition C creates an inconsistency in the plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">We additionally decline to read <em>American Federation of Labor </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 687 as establishing a blanket rule that initiatives proposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cindirect\u201d legislation such as those identified in Sections 7C and 7D are necessarily beyond the scope of the electorate\u2019s power. <em>American Federation of Labor </em>concerned a proposed initiative mandating the California Legislature to apply to the United States Congress for a constitutional convention to adopt a balanced budget amendment. (36 Cal.3d at p. 707.) The California Supreme Court determined the balanced budget initiative \u201cmerely express [ed] the wishes of the enacting body\u201d and therefore it was not a \u201cstatute\u201d within the meaning of California Constitution article II, section 8. (36 Cal.3d at p. 708.) In so concluding, <em>American Federation of Labor </em>recognized the \u201cdistinction between an initiative which enacts a statute and one which commands the Legislature to do so . . . may be constitutionally significant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 714.) The court, however, did not base its holding on that distinction. The court\u2019s holding was instead premised on its view that the initiative measure sought <em>only </em>to express the policy views of the voters: \u201c. . . the crucial provisions of the balanced budget initiative do not adopt a <em>statute </em>or enact a law. They adopt, and mandate the Legislature to adopt, <em>a resolution </em>which does not change California law . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 694, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Section 7C does not ask the board of supervisors to adopt a resolution\u2014it tells the legislative body to enact any necessary <em>laws </em>to permit the \u201cProject\u201d to take effect. Section 7D likewise tells the legislative body to enact any needed General Plan or Zoning Ordinances to ensure consistency with the Sections 7A and 7B amendments. Neither <em>Marblehead </em>nor <em>American Federation of Labor </em>can fairly be read as prohibiting the voters from exercising such powers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We reject Pala\u2019s argument Proposition C was beyond the electorate\u2019s power because it failed to propose a \u201cstatute.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>III.-VIII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">IX. \u201cServcon\u201d <em>as the </em>\u201cApplicant\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">California Constitution, article II, section 12 provides: \u201cNo amendment to the Constitution, and no statute proposed to the electors by the Legislature or by initiative, that names any individual to hold any office, or names or identifies any private corporation to perform any function or to have any power or duty, may be submitted to the electors or have any effect.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Pala contends Proposition C violates this constitutional provision because Section 8A defines Servcon as the \u201cApplicant\u201d and the initiative provides the applicant with \u201cpowers,\u201d \u201cduties,\u201d and \u201cfunctions\u201d relating to the application process and to the operation of the solid waste facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Respondents counter that (1) article II, section 12 restricts only statewide initiatives and is inapplicable to a county initiative; (2) Proposition C does not violate article II, section 12 because the initiative does not identify Servcon to \u201cperform any function\u201d or \u201cto have any power or duty\u201d; and (3) even assuming Proposition C violates article II, section 12, the provision identifying Servcon is severable and this court should enforce the remaining provisions or rewrite the definition of \u201cApplicant\u201d to eliminate the reference to Servcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">As explained below, we conclude article II, section 12 applies to Proposition C and that Section 8A violates the constitutional provision. We determine, however, that Section 8A is severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">A. <em>Article II, section 12 applies to Proposition C</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Article II, section 12 applies to an \u201camendment to the Constitution\u201d and a <em>\u201cstatute </em>proposed to the electors by the Legislature or by initiative.\u201d (Italics added.)  Respondents argue that because a statute generally means a state law and an ordinance generally means a local law, article II, section 12\u2019s reference to a \u201cstatute\u201d must mean a state law and therefore the constitutional provision applies only to statewide initiatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">In determining the meaning of a constitutional provision, we apply established principles of statutory construction. <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 402, 407 [267 Cal.Rptr. 589, 787 P.2d 996].) Our primary objective is to ascertain the legislative intent. In so doing, we first examine the particular words used, keeping in mind that words should be interpreted in the context of the relevant constitutional provisions as a whole. <em>(Quintano </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049, 1055 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 906 P.2d 1057]; <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Retirement Board </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1204, 1210 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 297].) If there is no ambiguity, the constitutional provision should be interpreted according to its plain meaning. <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 407.) Where an ambiguity exists, we may resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the Legislature or of the voters. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Applying these principles, we conclude the term \u201cstatute\u201d as used in article II, section 12 does not reflect a legislative intent that the constitutional provision apply only to statewide initiatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">First, the term \u201cstatute\u201d does not unambiguously refer only to a state law. As reflected in the dictionary definitions, the commonly understood meaning of a \u201cstatute\u201d broadly extends to \u201claw[s] enacted by the legislative branch of a government,\u201d without limiting the definition to the laws of a particular legislative body. (See Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dict. (9th ed. 1987) p. 1152.) While in legal terminology a statute generally means a state or federal law and an ordinance is used to specifically refer to a municipal or county law, a court must apply the \u201cusual and ordinary\u201d meaning of words, rather than a technical construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Second, the origin of article II, section 12 reveals the term \u201cstatute\u201d was not selected for the purpose of limiting the scope of the constitutional provision to state initiatives. Article II, section 12 derived from two voter initiatives contained in former article IV, section Id, a 1950 initiative and a 1964 initiative, both of which sought to prevent voters from \u201cconfer[ing] special privilege or advantage on specific persons or organizations.\u201d <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 832 [258 Cal.Rptr. 161, 771 P.2d 1247].) Under the wording of the 1950 initiative, the prohibition against identifying individuals applied not to \u201cstatutes\u201d but more broadly to a <em>\u201claw . . . proposed by the initiative </em>or by the Legislature.\u201d (Former art. IV, \u00a7 1d, subd. (a).) The 1964 initiative concerned only proposed constitutional amendments. (Former art. IV, \u00a7 1d, subd. (b).) In combining the two provisions to create the present version of article II, section 12, the 1966 Constitution Revision Commission changed the word \u201claws\u201d to \u201cstatutes,\u201d but stated it was not intending to change the meaning of the provision. (Cal. Const. Revision Com., Proposed Revision (Feb. 1966), at p. 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Thus, respondents\u2019 insistence that the word \u201cstatute\u201d was intended to impart a special meaning different than the word \u201claw\u201d or \u201cordinance\u201d is not supported. We are further unpersuaded by respondents\u2019 focus on the fact that the 1950 and 1964 initiatives were triggered by perceived problems with particular <em>state </em>initiatives. We have examined the legislative history materials and have found nothing in-- those materials indicating that the voters believed these same problems would not exist with local initiatives or that the voters intended to exclude local initiatives from the reach of the restrictions. Further, respondents have failed to articulate, and we have been unable to identify, any policy basis for the voters to have intended a distinction between state and local initiatives with respect to the rule that initiatives may not identify individuals or entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Third, viewing article II, section 12 in combination with the other relevant constitutional provisions shows that the voters in 1950 and 1964 and the Constitution Revision Commission in 1966 would have understood that the article II, section 12 restriction would extend to local initiatives. When voters enact an initiative, they are \u201cdeemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 844 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Article II, sections 8 and 9 create the statewide initiative and referendum powers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Article II, section 11 extends these powers to voters in local elections.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\n                   The courts have long recognized that the rights of initiative and referendum reserved to local voters under article II, section 11 (and its predecessor provision) are co-extensive with the rights reserved to the people of the state as set forth in the state Constitution, unless a local charter gives the voters broader powers. (See <em>Hopping </em>v. <em>Council of City of Richmond </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 605, 609 [150 P. 977]; <em>Midway Orchards </em>v. <em>County of Butte </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 765, <em>777 </em>[269 Cal.Rptr. 796]; <em>Dye </em>v. <em>Council of the City of Compton </em>(1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 486, 489 [182 P.2d 623]; see also <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 694-699; <em>Geiger </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 832, 836-837 [313 P.2d 545].) Thus, unless a charter extends the local initiative or referendum power, constitutional limitations on the statewide initiative and referendum powers generally apply to also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>restrict the power of local voters to vote on countywide initiatives. (See <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 698; <em>Geiger </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at pp. 836-837; see also <em>Voters for Responsible Retirement </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 765, 778 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 814, 884 P.2d 645].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">While the cases recognizing that the statewide limitations on the initiative and referendum power apply in local elections have arisen mostly in the context of limitations on the referendum power, the reasoning of these cases apply equally to the initiative power. (See <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 866, 870 fn. 3 [166 Cal.Rptr. 100].) At least one court has assumed that the single subject rule applicable to statewide initiatives applies equally to county initiatives. (See <em>San Mateo County Coastal Landowners\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 523, 553 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 117].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Likewise, respondents here concede the applicability of article II, section 8, subdivision (a)\u2019s requirement that initiatives must enact \u201cstatutes,\u201d even though article II, section 8 pertains to the statewide initiative power. (See <em>American Federation of Labor </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 687; <em>Marblehead, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 1504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We thus presume the voters understood that when they approved the 1950 and 1964 propositions prohibiting naming of entities in initiatives, the proposed rules would apply equally to statewide <em>and </em>local initiatives, unless a local charter provided otherwise. Had these voters or the Constitution Revision Commission wanted a different rule, they could have said so. They did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The San Diego County Charter (County Charter) does not expand the local initiative power. Instead, the charter confirms that the county voter\u2019s initiative and referendum powers in county elections are equivalent to that of the state voter\u2019s powers. The charter provides \u201c[t]he people of the County may exercise the initiative, referendum, and recall provisions of general law.\u201d (County Charter, art. II, \u00a7 200.) The charter defines \u201c[g]eneral [l]aw\u201d as \u201cthe <em>Constitution, </em>Statutes, and Codes of the State of California.\u201d (County Charter, art. I, \u00a7 100, italics added.) Thus, under the County Charter, county voters are bound by the same restrictions in enacting laws by initiatives as are applicable to state voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>We reject Servcon\u2019s argument in its supplemental brief that County Charter, article II, section 200 is unconstitutional because it \u201cenact[s] initiative provisions different from those contained in the general statutes of the State applicable to county initiatives and referenda.\u201d The charter merely makes the local initiative power equivalent to that of the statewide initiative power. Such rule is consistent with the state Constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Respondents additionally argue their interpretation of article II, section 12 as applying only to state statutes is supported by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent reference to article II, section 12 as a \u201climitation [] on the . . . statewide initiative power.\u201d <em>(Rossi </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 695.) Reading the quoted language in context, the Supreme Court did not state or suggest that article II, section 12 was inapplicable to the local initiative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Servcon further argues that if we were to hold that article II, section 12 applied to Proposition C, this would \u201cseverely curtail[]\u201d the \u201clong . . . recognized\u201d power of the people to use <em>initiatives </em>to designate private parties as public franchises. Servcon cites to two cases holding that the granting of a franchise is subject to the <em>referendum </em>process. (See <em>Pacific Rock etc. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Upland </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 666, 668 [63 Cal.Rptr. 572, 433 P.2d 476]; <em>Orange County Cable Communications Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Clemente </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 165, 171 [130 Cal.Rptr. 429].) Article II, section 12 applies to initiatives, and not referendums. Respondents do not cite, nor are unaware of, authority in this state upholding a local electorate\u2019s right to use the initiative power to designate a private individual or corporation to act as a franchise. Thus, our conclusion does not place any new limits on an existing right.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We additionally reject Servcon\u2019s argument that holding article II, section 12 applicable to Proposition C would violate the general rule that the power of the voters by initiative and referendum is co-extensive with the legislative power of the governing body. (See <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 775.) As our Supreme Court has recognized, article II, section 12 creates an exception to that general rule. <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 835, fn. 29.) In striking a portion of Proposition 103 that would have established a private corporation to represent consumers, the court noted \u201cArticle II, section 12, limits only the power of the voters, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the Legislature. The Legislature remains free to adopt measures to provide for consumer representation . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 835, fn. 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">B. <em>Does Proposition C violate article II, section 12?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Respondents argue that even assuming article II, section 12 applies to Proposition C, Section 8A does not violate that constitutional provision because the initiative does not name or identify Servcon \u201c \u2018to perform any function\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018to have any power or duty.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Most fundamentally, the express intent and purpose of the initiative is to authorize a \u201cProject\u201d to be constructed on the Gregory Canyon site after the necessary permits are obtained. Section 7C requires the County to amend all ordinances, rules and regulations \u201cto accommodate the Project.\" Section 4, subdivision K \u201cdirects\u201d the County \u201cto include the Project in its Integrated Waste Management Plan . . . and to make any findings required for issuance of any necessary permits.\u201d The proposition defines the \u201cProject\u201d as a \u201crecycling collection center and landfill and associated structures and improvements as described in Section 3 of this initiative measure <em>as subsequently modified by a detailed site plan submitted by Applicant </em>to the Integrated Waste Management Board as part of the solid waste facilities permit.\u201d (\u00a7 8, subd. D, italics added; see also \u00a7 3, subd. A.) Thus, the proposition provides the applicant (defined as Servcon) with the sole responsibility of preparing and submitting the site plan that will ultimately define the precise nature of the project created by the proposition. This imposes functions, powers, and duties on Servcon within the meaning of article II, section 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Further, the initiative repeatedly states that the applicant \u201cshall consult\u201d with federal and state agencies and \u201cshall secure\" numerous specified permits and approvals required by state or federal law. (\u00a7 4.) The proposition also recognizes the applicant will be the operator of the solid waste facility and imposes on the applicant numerous duties and powers related to the operation of the facility. (\u00a7 5.) For example, the initiative states the applicant (1) <em>\u201cshall </em>widen and realign State Route 76\" (\u00a7 5, subd. I, italics added); (2) \u201cshall. . . implement] \u201d a landscaping plan prepared by a licensed architect (\u00a7 5, subd. O, italics added); (3) <em>\u201cshall </em>submit a mitigation and monitoring program meeting state and federal law to the Integrated Waste Management Board\u201d (\u00a7 5, subd. R, italics added); (4) <em>\u201cshall </em>maintain trained, full-time personnel engaged exclusively and continuously in the inspection of incoming refuse loads for hazardous waste\u201d (\u00a7 5, subd. D, italics added); and (5) <em>\u201cshall </em>retain a qualified archaeologist to investigate and recommend appropriate mitigation measures\u201d and <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>implement these mitigation measures (\u00a7 5, subd. P, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Respondents argue that Proposition C does not vest Servcon with a function, power, or duty, but rather it merely identifies a land use designation and permits Servcon to \u201capply\u201d to perform a function. As set forth above, Proposition C does much more than that. The initiative specifies functions and duties that Servcon must perform in operating the facility and gives Servcon the exclusive authority to prepare a site plan, apply to operate, and operate the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Respondents alternatively argue we should interpret article II, section 12 to mean that an initiative may not identify an entity to perform any \u201cnew\u201d functions, powers, or duties. Respondents point out that as the \u201cowner\u201d of the property, Servcon already had the ability to apply for the necessary permits and to operate the facility. In response to the petition below, Servcon submitted the declaration of a Servcon project manager, stating that \u201c[o]n July 23, 1993, North San Diego Development Company, . . . entered into a written agreement with Servcon granting Servcon the exclusive right to develop a landfill on . . . the \u2018Gregory Canyon site\u2019. . . . Pursuant to this agreement, Servcon has sole ownership rights to develop a landfill and acquire the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Even assuming the word \u201cnew\u201d should be read into article II, section 12, Proposition C gave Servcon functions and powers it did not have before the voters approved the initiative. Before Proposition C, Servcon apparently had the exclusive <em>contractual </em>right to develop and operate the solid waste facility at Gregory Canyon. Proposition C elevates that contractual right to a right under a county ordinance. In practical terms, it means that the current owner of the property is now bound by local law to follow through with that contract and, should a third party attempt to claim a superior right, Servcon would have the ability to rely on the terms of Proposition C to establish its exclusive right.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Servcon\u2019s contractual rights are not identical to the powers, duties, and functions accorded it in the initiative. Thus, Servcon\u2019s contractual rights do not exempt it from the reach of article II, section 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">C. <em>Are the provisions severable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">When an initiative provision is invalid, the void provision must be stricken but the remaining provisions should be given effect if the invalid provision is severable. <em>(Gerken </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(1993) 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Cal.4th 707, 721 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 449, 863 P.2d 694]; <em>California Gillnetters Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Fish &amp; Game </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1158 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 338].) Where, as here, the initiative contains a severability clause, the invalid provision is severable if it can be separated grammatically, functionally, and volitionally. <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 821, 836.) This rule applies to an initiative provision held invalid under article II, section 12. (48 Cal.3d at p. 836.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The volitional requirement concerns whether the voters would have adopted the initiative without the invalid provisions. <em>(Gerken </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 714-715; <em>California Gillnetters Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Fish &amp; Game, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th at p. 1159.) \u201c \u2018The test is whether it can be said with confidence that the electorate\u2019s attention was sufficiently focused upon the parts to be severed so that it would have separately considered and adopted them in the absence of the invalid portions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gerken </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 714-715, italics deleted.) In applying this test, \u201c[w]e may examine the proposition itself, as well as the ballot materials . . . .\u201d <em>(California Gillnetters Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Fish &amp; Game, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th at p. 1159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Other than naming \u201cServcon,\u201d the initiative text did not describe any facts about Servcon, such as identifying the nature of Servcon\u2019s business or that Servcon had development rights to the proposed landfill, nor were the voters given such information in the ballot materials. Likewise, neither the county counsel\u2019s impartial analysis nor the ballot arguments discussed or even mentioned Servcon. Further, there is no showing that the identification of Servcon as the operator of the proposed facility was part of the public debate about the merits of the initiative. On this record, the voters\u2019 decision to site a solid waste facility at Gregory Canyon could not have been motivated by the fact that Servcon was identified as the proposed operator of the facility. The volitional test is thus satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The next question is whether Section 8A is functionally and grammatically severable. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Section 8A is contained in a discrete separate section and therefore it is grammatically severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Section 8A is also functionally severable because the proposition specifically imposes functions, powers, and duties on the \u201cApplicant,\u201d not Servcon. Although striking Section 8A will leave the identity of the applicant and the term \u201cApplicant\u201d undefined, a textual definition of applicant is unnecessary to support the validity of the remainder of the initiative. Without an express definition, \u201cApplicant\u201d as set forth in Proposition C necessarily means the \u201cproposed operator of the facility\u201d or the \u201coperator of the facility,\u201d depending on the particular section of the initiative. By definition, only the proposed operator of the private facility is entitled to apply to operate the facility and only the owner or operator of the facility would be required to engage in the mitigation measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Section 3, subdivision A (Section 3A), for example, states \u201c[t]he Applicant shall be entitled ... to alter the proposed facilities based on a detailed site plan to be submitted to the Integrated Waste Management Board ... as part of the solid waste facilities permit.\u201d The California Code of Regulations states that the entity entitled to apply for such solid waste facilities permit is an \u201cApplicant\u201d defined as \u201cthe proposed operator of a facility.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 18011, subd. (a)(3).) Thus, the applicant referred to in Section 3A means \u201cthe proposed operator of the facility.\u201d It is unnecessary to set forth that definition in the text of the initiative for the initiative to make sense. The deletion of Servcon as the \u201cApplicant\u201d will not alter the implementation of the initiative.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Because Section 8A is grammatically, functionally, and volitionally severable from the remainder of Proposition C, the balance of the initiative remains valid.

The recycling collection cerner and landfill will occupy approximately 270 acres of the Gregory Canyon site. The landfill footpnm containing refuse will cover approximately 150 acres of the site. The main features of the Project in dude a lined landfiH, construction of a new access road and bridge providing access to the site from Highway 76, a scale area, a recycling collection center, a facilities and operation area, a borrow and stockpile area, a leachate collection system, and storm-water retention facilities. The facilities and operation area wfll include a visitors' center, an office buSding, a maintenance office, a snop and yard, a fueling stalion/storage area, a water tank truck wash and wash-water treatment area, a water supply well, groundwater monitoring wells, a landfiH gas collection and recovery system, and a leacnale collection tank. The Applicant shall be entitled to adjust the size and location of solid waste operations and to alter the proposed facilities based on a detailed sita plan to be submitted to the Integrated Waste Management Board for its review and approval as part of the solid waste facilities permit B. Dedicated Open Space. The remaining 1413 acras of Gregory Canyon site shall be dedicated as permanent open space to the County of San Diego, the Pala Band of Misar\u00e1n Indians, another public agency, or a Resource Conservation Group for long-term preeervation of sensitive habitat and species. The actual amount of acreage dedicated may be adjusted as necessary to accommodate construction and operation of the Project The open space area shall net be lesa than 1313 aeree as a result of any adjustment C. Access Road. The Project includes construction of a new access route and bridge from Highway 76 to the Gregory Canyon site. D. Relocation of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Power Lines. The project \u00abdudes relocation of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric transmission lines that are located within the area for the proposed landfiH and recyding collection center.
