We hold it may not. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying the judgment debtor\u2019s motion to vacate the order renewing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Prior to 1980 plaintiff and respondent, Timberline, Inc., was a woodworking business. In 1980 it sold all its assets to defendant and appellant, Gul Jaisinghani. Thereafter, the corporation ceased doing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">Defendant apparently did not pay the agreed sales price. On August 21, 1986, the corporation received a judgment against him for $65,463.71. At the time of trial and judgment the corporation was in good standing with the Secretary of State and the Franchise Tax Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">However, on June 1, 1989, the corporation was suspended by the Secretary of State of California pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code section 23302 for failure to pay franchise taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Defendant has not paid any part of the judgment and it remains unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">On December 19, 1995, the corporation filed an application to renew the judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 683.110.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The clerk of the court renewed the judgment on that date in the principal amount, plus accrued interest of $62,209.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">When defendant received notice the judgment had been renewed he filed a motion in the trial court to vacate the renewal of judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The basis for his motion was that the corporation was suspended, and as such is not entitled to enjoy the benefits of the state court\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The trial court denied the motion to vacate. Defendant filed a timely appeal from the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">I. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">\u201c \u2018Interpretation and applicability of a statute [such as Revenue and Taxation Code section [23301]] ... is ... a question of law.\u2019 (9 Witkin, Cal.

This section provides; \u201cExcept for the purposes of filing an application for exempt status or amending the articles of incorporation as necessary either to perfect that application or to set forth a new name, the corporate powers, rights and privileges of a domestic taxpayer may be suspended, and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights and privileges of a foreign taxpayer in this state may be forfeited, if . . . .\u201d (1) the corporation fails to pay franchise taxes on time; (2) fails to file a required annual information statement; or (3) fails to file a franchise tax return, even when no tax is due. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 23301.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">When a corporation fails to pay its taxes the Franchise Tax Board informs the Secretary of State of the delinquency, who in turn notifies the corporation of its suspended status. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 23302.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Thus, except for filing an application for tax-exempt status or amending the articles of incorporation to change the corporate name, a suspended corporation is disqualified from exercising any right, power or privilege. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 23301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">This means a suspended corporation may not prosecute or defend an action in a California court. <em>(Ransome-Crummey Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>(1922) 188 Cal. 393, 396-397 [205 P. 446]; <em>Alhambra-Shumway Mines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 46, 50-51 [317 P.2d 649].) Nor may a suspended corporation appeal from an adverse judgment <em>(Boyle </em>v. <em>Lakeview Creamery Co. </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 16, 20-21 [68 P.2d 968]; <em>Gar-Lo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Prudential Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 242, 245 [116 Cal.Rptr. 389]), or seek a writ of mandate <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 519, 635 [51 Cal.Rptr. 633]). However, if the corporation\u2019s status only comes to light during litigation, the normal practice is for the trial court to permit a short continuance to enable the suspended corporation to effect reinstatement (by paying back taxes, interest and penalties) to defend itself in court. (See, e.g., <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Magyar House, Inc. </em>(1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 182, 190 [335 P.2d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">\u201cIn a number of situations the revival of corporate powers by the payment of delinquent taxes has been held to validate otherwise invalid prior action. <em>(Traub Co. </em>v. <em>Coffee Break Service, Inc. </em>[(1967)] 66 Cal.2d 368, 370 [57 Cal.Rptr. 846, 425 P.2d 790]; <em>Diverco Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilstein </em>[(1970)] 4 Cal.App.3d 6, 12 [85 Cal.Rptr. 851]; A. <em>E. Cook Co. </em>v. <em>K S Racing Enterprises, Inc. </em>[(1969)] 274 Cal.App.2d 499, 500 [79 Cal.Rptr. 123]; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Sunset Agricultural Minerals </em>[(1969)] 273 Cal.App.2d 489, 493 [78 Cal.Rptr. 339].) In all of the above cited cases it was held that the purpose of section 23301 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is to put pressure on the delinquent corporation to pay its taxes, and that purpose is satisfied by a rule which views a corporation\u2019s tax delinquencies, after correction, as mere irregularities. This reasoning is in accord with our language in <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Lakeview Creamery Co., 9 </em>Cal.2d 16, declaring the legislative policy of Revenue and Taxation Code provisions imposing sanctions for failure to pay taxes to be \u2018clearly to prohibit the delinquent corporation from enjoying the ordinary privileges of a going concern, in order that some pressure will be brought to bear to force the payment of taxes.\u2019 (At p. 19.) There is little purpose in imposing additional penalties <em>after the taxes have been paid.\" (Peacock Hill Assn. </em>v. <em>Peacock Lagoon Constr. Co. </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 369, 371 [105 Cal.Rptr. 29, 503 P.2d 285], italics added [corporation which was suspended after judgment for nonpayment of franchise taxes was entitled to pursue its appeal after it paid the delinquent tax, interest and penalties and received its certificate of revivor].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The plain language of Revenue and Taxation Code section 23301 \u201cexpressly deprives the corporation of all \u2018corporate powers, rights and privileges\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Boyle </em>v. <em>Lakeview Creamery Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.2d 16, 20.) Thus, it appears from the statutory language and the decisional authority interpreting those provisions, the corporation\u2019s action in requesting the court to renew the judgment was an unauthorized act by a suspended corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>which was attempting to exercise the rights, powers and privileges of a going concern. (See 9 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Corporations, \u00a7 225 et seq., p. 716 et seq.; Friedman, Cal. Practice Guide: Corporations 2 (The Rutter Group 1997) \u00b66:562 et seq., p. 6-111 et seq.) Consequently, it was error for the trial court to deny defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the renewal of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">The corporation seeks to avoid this result. It argues renewing a judgment does not really invoke the powers of a California court. It points out renewal of a judgment is made virtually automatic by statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The corporation argues renewal of a judgment does not require any action by a state court because the court clerk processes the application, making it nothing more than a \u201cministerial act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">This argument misses the mark. Renewal of a judgment requires judicial intervention for its validity, regardless how minimal the activity. For example, renewal of a judgment involves at least as much judicial intervention in the average case as does the filing of a lien to secure a judgment. The decision in A. <em>E. Cook Co. </em>v. <em>K S Racing Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 499 [79 Cal.Rptr. 123] is instructive. That case involved the validity of the corporate plaintiff\u2019s attachment of the defendant\u2019s bank account to secure a judgment. The defendant moved to discharge the attachment, claiming the corporation was suspended for nonpayment of taxes at the time it filed its lien. However, prior to the defendant\u2019s motion to discharge the lien, the corporate plaintiff revived its corporate powers by paying all delinquent taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dissolve the attachment and the appellate court affirmed. It noted the earlier Supreme Court decisions holding that the effect of a corporation\u2019s reviving itself by payment of delinquent taxes is to retroactively legitimize the corporation\u2019s prior acts. The court then reasoned if revivor can validate prior actions taken to prosecute or defend an action then revivor should also operate to validate \u201cprovisional remedies ancillary to such actions. If a corporation may shore up its entire cause of action by reviving its corporate powers and thereby validate its complaint, it seems appropriate to permit it to do the same thing on behalf of a provisional remedy wholly dependent on the main cause of action, provided, of course, that in the meantime substantive defenses have not accrued nor third party rights intervened. [Citation.]\u201d (274 Cal.App.2d at pp. 500-501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>By parity of reasoning, the ancillary remedy of renewing an unsatisfied judgment is an invalid act if attempted by a suspended corporation which has not taken the necessary action to revive itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We agree with the corporation the original judgment was valid. We also agree the corporation was not pursuing a new action or seeking a new judgment, but was instead attempting to extend the life of the earlier valid judgment. Nevertheless, to do so required invocation of the benefits of California laws and the assistance of the California judicial system. These rights and privileges are reserved to those corporations which pay their franchise taxes in a timely fashion and remain in good standing with the California Secretary of State and taxing authorities. As a suspended corporation, it is deprived of these benefits and was therefore not entitled to renew its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\"> This may seem to be a harsh penalty for a corporation which has not conducted business since selling its assets to the defendant, and which has not realized any amount from the sale of those assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, this penalty could have easily been avoided. If the corporation was not in fact conducting any business after the sale of its assets in 1980, then someone should have taken steps to formally dissolve the corporation. After the Franchise Tax Board approves a corporation\u2019s final tax return the corporation is no longer liable for any taxes (provided it does not continue in business after notifying the Secretary of State of its intent to dissolve). (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1905; see also Friedman, Cal. Practice Guide: Corporations, <em>supra, </em>\u00b68:585.1, p. 8-105.) On the other hand, a dissolved corporation maintains considerable corporate powers to conduct whatever business is required to wind up its affairs\u2014including prosecuting actions and enforcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>judgments. (See, e.g., Corp. Code, \u00a7 2010<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; <em>Pensaquitos, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1180, 1185 [dissolved corporation continues to exist for an indefinite period as a legal entity for the purpose of winding up its affairs].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">Thus, in this case the corporation could have avoided all liability for franchise taxes and in addition could have renewed or enforced its judgment had it taken the necessary steps to formally dissolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Alternatively, the corporation could have avoided this result by reviving itself prior to filing its application to renew the judgment, or at any time before its 10-year life expired. The corporation was obviously aware the 10-year limitations period was about to elapse and it would soon have to file an application to renew the judgment. It thus had more than sufficient time to take the necessary curative action yet did nothing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under these circumstances it was not entitled to enjoy the privilege of renewing its judgment while suspended for nonpayment of California franchise taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The order is reversed. The trial court is directed to vacate its order denying the motion to vacate and enter a new order granting defendant\u2019s motion to vacate renewal of the judgment. Defendant is awarded his costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Lillie, P.
