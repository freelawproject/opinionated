Punderferd; a guaranty of the payment of the sum named in the bond made by defendant\u2019s testator in1 writing under seal, and\u2019 a subsequent assignment of the bond to plaintiffs\u2019 testator. Recovery is sought upon the guaranty.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-11\">Argued at February Term, 1897, before Mag-ie, Chief Justice, and Justices Depue,-Van Syckel and Lippincott.

Woodruff </em>and <em>James Buchanan.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AxG\">For the defendant,' <em>Aar\u00f3n V.

If plaintiffs\u2019 testator acquired any right of action thereon, it must have been by the assignment to him of the bond the payment of w'hich was guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The researches of counsel and my own have failed to discover that the precise question thus presented has been authoritatively dealt with in the courts of this State. In <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Weldon, </em>14 <em>Vroom </em>128, a question arose regarding the effect of an irregular endorsement upon a promissory note, made after the note had come into existence, and the liability of such an endorser to a holder to whom the note had been transferred. It was held that such an endorsement gave no authority to the holder to write over it a contract of guaranty. Mr. Justice Knapp, in his opinion in that case, proceeded to discuss the question whether, if the contract of the irregular endorser could be considered as a guaranty, it would be governed by the law relating to commercial paper, and the guarantor would be debarred from questioning its consideration. In that discussion the learned judge expressed some opinion as to the transmissibility of collateral guaranties by a transfer of the original debt, which 'were unnecessary to the decision and were, moreover, largely founded upon cases in the courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>New York which have since been overruled. In our judgment that case does not determine the question now presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Elsewhere the decisions upon the question before us- are conflicting, as will be seen by the cases collected in <em>Brandt S. &amp; </em>G., \u00a7\u00a7 33, 35. See, also, 2 <em>Dan. Neg. Inst., </em>\u00a7 1774 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">An examination of the cases has led us to the conclusion -that the better view is that an assignment of the principal \u25a0debt, if not limited in its scope, carries with it the promises .and undertakings connected therewith and tending to secure its payment. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Parkis, </em>40 <em>N. Y. </em>181; <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Ostrom, </em>54 <em>Id. </em>581; <em>Stillman </em>v. <em>Northrup, </em>109 <em>Id. </em>473; <em>Lemmon </em>v. <em>Strong (Conn.), </em>22 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>293.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">For this reason we think the declaration discloses a cause of action in plaintiffs and the demurrer must be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
