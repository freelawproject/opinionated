Darby, the local agent of the defendant at the city of Camden. The rules to show cause herein were allowed upon the <em>ex parte </em>affidavits tending to'show that he was not the proper party upon whom service could be legally made. Upon the argument at the November Term, 1897, of this court it appeared that no testimony had been taken under the rules, and, as the facts were not agreed upon between counsel, the court held that the <em>ex parte </em>affidavits could not be used, and ordered depositions to be taken upon the rules upon notice, within thirty days, and submitted to the court, in order that the court might properly determine whether the actions had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>properly, brought in this state in the name of the Adams Express Company, and whether legal service of process had been made in such actions. The depositions as ordered'have-not been taken and submitted to the court. Instead thereof another <em>ex parte </em>affidavit, taken without notice, has been served upon the attorney of the plaintiffs and submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The <em>ex parte </em>affidavits used to obtain the rules to show cause cannot be used upon argument without the agreement of parties and the leave of the court. The <em>ex parte </em>affidavit taken afterwards is in the same position.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Upon rules to show cause of this character, depositions upon which the argument before and the determination- by the court are to be had, must be taken upon notice under the statute, unless the facts be-agreed upon by the parties and are of such a sufficient character and certainty that the judicial determination of the court can be had upon the questions arising. The rule is absolute that <em>ex parte </em>affidavits cannot be used on the final hearing of the rule. When insisted upon, depositions in the usual manner, upon notice, must be taken. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2569, \u00a7\u00a7 219, 220, 221; <em>Sup. Ct. Rules </em>62, 63 ; <em>Dare </em>v. <em>Ogden, Coxe 91; Layton </em>v. <em>Cooper, Pen. </em>65; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Galbraith, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>219 <em>; Baldwin </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>14 <em>Vroom </em>495 ; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Price, </em>17 <em>Id. </em>53.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The rules to show cause not being properly prosecuted must be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
