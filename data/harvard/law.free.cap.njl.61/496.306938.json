No person or persons licensed to keep a restaurant and beer saloon, or either, as aforesaid, within the limits of the city of Bayonne, shall <em>Iceep open </em>restaurant or saloon on the Christian Sabbath, or the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, under the penalty of twenty dollars for each offence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">This ordinance was passed under the police powers contained in the city charter, and the general authority thereby given to \u201cregulate\u201d saloons. The first reason assigned is \u201c that this ordinance is unreasonable and uncertain, and does not specify in what respect it was illegal for the defendant to&gt; keep open his restaurant and beer saloon on Sunday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">To \u201c keep open,\u201d as applied to places of business and to&gt; public houses, is a familiar expression, constantly in use. Its meaning in the present case is clear, viz., that the proprietors of public houses shall temporarily cease to entertain the public. It does not refer to the closing of shutters or to the barring of doors. These may be done in order that the place-may \u201c keep open.\u201d It is not met by the mere refusal to sell) intoxicating liquors. It means more. As \u201cto keep open\u201d is a standing invitation that gives to the public a right of access- and of entertainment, so \u201c not to keep open \u201d means that this invitation is withdrawn and that all public entertainment has ceased. No better illustration of just -what constitutes a saloon that is being kept open on Sunday can be found than that given by the witness upon whose testimony this conviction rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">John Gorman, a police officer of the city of Bayonne, being \u25a0called and sworn as a witness, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u201c I was doing my duty on West Twenty-first street on the morning of the 28th day. of June, A. D. 1896, it then being the Christian Sabbath, or the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; heard loud noise inside of Richards\u2019place j my attention was first attracted by the loud talk of a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and woman outside; I went through an alleyway on the east side of the saloon and went to the back door; opened same and went into the saloon; walked up to the bar; saw four or five men at the bar; dice and box were on the bar; also four glasses half full of some liquor of a light red fluid; the defendant was behind the bar with an apron on; I told him he was doing business illegally; he said he would <em>\u2018 </em>not do so again; let it go this time; <em>\u2019 </em>there was no other door to enter the saloon, except the one in front of the house, which was locked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">This aptly describes a saloon whose proprietor had closed the doors in order to \u201c keep open \u201d the saloon.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The cases cited in the brief of counsel for the defendant are in point so far as identity of legislative language permits. <em>Harrison\u2019s Case, </em>11 <em>Gray </em>308; <em>Kurtz </em>v. <em>People, </em>33 <em>Mich. </em>280; <em>People </em>v. <em>Waldvogel, </em>49 <em>Id. </em>337; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummerford, </em>58 <em>Id. </em>328 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ambs, </em>20 <em>Mo. </em>214; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 <em>Ga. </em>18; <em>Hussey\u2019s Case, </em>69 <em>Id. </em>54; <em>Ring. L. Sun. </em>182; 11 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Encycl. L. </em>547, and cases and notes there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The case of <em>Houtsch </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>5 <em>Dutcher </em>316, is not in point; the ordinance in that case specified \u201c exposure for sale \u201d of intoxicating liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The second reason is that the ordinance is \u201c oppressive and interferes with personal rights in that it may impose a penalty upon an act which is not in violation of law.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">To this the rejoinder is that all police regulations are in the nature of interferences with unrestricted personal freedom, which thereby ceases to be a right and becomes a violation of law. The remaining reason is that the ordinance is not a \u201cregulation\u201d of restaurants and saloons within the meaning of the city charter, the words of which are \u201c to license and regulate and prohibit inns or taverns, restaurants and saloons.\u201d The definition of such a regulation is that it is a partial restriction which does not wholly prohibit. The case of <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Gloucester County, </em>21 <em>Vroom </em>585, 590, is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Finding no error or insufficiency in the record sent to this court, the judgment contained in it is affirmed.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
