LEWIS H. BROOME.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b149-9\">An architect employed by commissioners for the construction of a public building, to supervise the erection of the building, does not thereby become the incumbent of <em>an office.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">On motion to quash indictment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b149-11\">Argued at June Term, 1897, before Justices Dixon, Ludlow and Collins.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-12\">For the state, <em>Oharles M. Winfield, </em>prosecutor of the pleas.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Asz\">For the defendant, <em>James B. Vredenburgh.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b150-5\">Dixon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A28\">The defendant' was indicted in the Hudson County Oyer and Terminer for misdemeanor in office, and, the indictment having been removed into this court, he now moves to quash it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u201cThe state claims,\u201d to quote from the brief of;the learned prosecutor of the pleas, \u201c that the defendant was at the time the holder of an office, and that he was guilty of misconduct in that office. If the facts do not constitute this offence, then no offence was committed by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The office which the indictment avers he held was that of \u201carchitect to supervise the erection of a new city hall in Jersey City,\u201d and the misdemeanor charged is the giving of a false certificate as to the materials used in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The only ground for the state\u2019s contention that this constituted a misdemeanor in office is, that by the act of April 15th, 1887 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>168), the commissioners for the construction of a city hall were expressly empowered \u201c to have plans and specifications prepared \u201d for the erection of the building, that they accordingly chose the defendant as the architect to supervise the erection, and that as such it was his official duty to give true certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The defendant\u2019s motion to quash is based upon the claim that he did not hold an office.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">We think the defendant\u2019s position lacked the essentials of an office, and was merely that of a contractor. In order to ascertain the nature of his duties, their duration, and his compensation, recourse must be had, not to any law, nor to any regulation adopted by authority of law, but only to his contract with the commissioners. In such circumstances an office does not exist. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Germaine, </em>99 <em>U. S. </em>508; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>22 <em>Vroom </em>240; <em>Town of Salem </em>v. <em>McClintock, </em>46 <em>N. E. Rep.

Rep. </em>(1896-1897) 682; <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Water Commissioners of New Brunswick, </em>28 <em>Vroom </em>478.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The indictment should be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
