Stat., p. </em>1494, \u00a7 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">On February 8th, 1897, upon a pending application, the trustees refused, after consideration, to extend further relief to the relator. He requested relief because he was an exempt, fireman and because he came within the rules of the association which entitled him to such relief. The minutes and evidence show that this application was fully considered by the trustees, and it was decided against him. There is no contention at all in the case but that such consideration was had, nor of the character of the conclusion reached by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>If- <em>mandamus, </em>therefore, was the appropriate remedy it could not go, because the very duty'which he insists should be compelled has been performed and therefore the right to this remedy does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The relator further seeks the direction, by <em>mandamus, </em>that he be restored to the roll of memb\u00e9rship of the Firemen\u2019s Eelief Association. The decision of the trustees, as appears by the evidence, against extending relief to -him, was that he was not eligible to relief from the Firemen\u2019s Eelief Association, and that he was. not a legally-exempt fireman. I have examined the evidence, and find that it is seriously controverted whether any roll of members exists. The records of the association presumably show who are the members, and the fact exists that a legally-exempt fireman of any fire company within the jurisdiction of the association is entitled to relief, and, presumably, the records of such fire company show who the members are, whether legally exempt from duty or not, and it is by these that the relator\u2019s title to relief, if he is entitled to any, must be established. I am not clear at all under the evidence whether any formal roll of members of the Firemen\u2019s Eelief Association was ever in existence. There have been lists of members at one time and another exhibited, and the records are in existence. But whether any formal roll of members exists or not is, as it seems to me, entirely immaterial. The evidence does not show that the relator\u2019s name has ever been stricken or erased from it, if it ever existed, or that the records of the association have ever been changed .to his detriment by any act of the association. If the roll exists and his name was ever on it, the evidence does not show that it has been changed so that his name, is erased or dropped from it. If his name ever appeared in the records of the association as a legally-exempt fireman, the evidence does not show that the record has been changed to his exclusion. The roll and the record remain as they always have existed, and therefore.no facts are presented which can give\u00a1 rise to a <em>mandamus </em>to the trustees- to do- the specific act of \u2022 restoring his name to the list or roll of membership. , \u25a0 ;</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The fact is that the whole basis for the remedy sought by <em>mandamus </em>is that his case has been considered by the trustees and further relief to him upon such consideration refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It matters little upon what reason this refusal was based; there appears to be no occasion, for relief by <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The whole matter appears to be the subject of an action at law against the association, but the court in nowise determines what relief, if any, could be so obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\"><em>Mandamus </em>is refused, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
