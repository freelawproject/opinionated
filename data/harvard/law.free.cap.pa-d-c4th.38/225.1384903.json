(N.T. 6/23/98, p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>The Parties to the Negotiations and Their Representatives</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">(3) GMH Associates is a multi-faceted real estate investment company that serves as an umbrella for affiliated companies that invest in, develop, and manage real estate. (Geiser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 90-91; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">(4) Gary Holloway is the chief executive officer of GMH (N.T. 6/15/98, p. 38), and Bruce Robinson is an executive vice president and chief financial officer for GMH. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 72.) Mr. Holloway and Mr. Robinson were GMH\u2019s representatives in negotiations with Prudential, AHERF, Goldman Sachs, and GE Capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">(5) Prudential Realty Group is an unincorporated division of The Prudential Insurance Company of America. (Triece N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 48-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">(6) During the fall of 1995, Prudential entered into a sales agency agreement with CB, a commercial brokerage company, to market the property. (P-40, sales agreement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">(7) Devon Glenn, a vice president of Prudential Realty, was \u201cplaced in charge of the disposition of the Bala properties.\u201d (Exhibit P-234, Glenn deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>(2/24/97), pp. 6-7, 19);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 55.) He reported to John Triece, managing director, and with respect to the Bala deal, to the investment committee, which included Dave Twardock, head of the realty group, and Mr. Triece. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 144.195; see also, Triece N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 51-52.) Mr. Twardock and Mr. Triece were the primary decision-makers for Prudential regarding the Bala deal. (Triece N.T. (6/23/98), p. 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">(8) Douglas Joseph, a vice president of CB, was the CB representative responsible for marketing the property. (Exhibit P-236, Joseph deposition, pp. 9,17);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Joseph reported to Glenn Whitmore, vice president and managing director for investment properties at CB. (See exhibit P-1, Holloway; N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 58-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">(9) As part of its 1995 marketing efforts, CB sent offering materials to 26 prospective buyers. Approximately 15 of these responded. Although the asking price was $136,000,000, all of the responding prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>buyers made tentative offers in a range between $80,000,000 and $108,000,000. (Exhibit P-236, Joseph dep. (3/3/97), pp. 41-48; P-1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">(10) Devon Glenn was Prudential\u2019s \u201cteam leader\u201d for the project. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 30; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 55.) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that he was informed by Doug Joseph that Devon Glenn was \u201crunning the deal for Prudential\u201d and that he had no discussions with anyone on the Prudential side other than Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 56-57, 85-86.) A team leader is a person who has \u201cthe primary role for organizing that transaction, being an interface with the bankers and sometimes being an interface with the outside world, for instance outside brokers, outside potential buyers.\u201d (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">(11) Goldman Sachs, one of the largest investment banking firms in the United States (or the world), through its Whitehall Fund, which served as a vehicle for Goldman\u2019s real estate transactions, was to provide equity financing for the Bala deal in partnership with GMH. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 8, 11-12, 38; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 69-70.) Goldman was to provide 90 percent of the equity and GMH 10 percent. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 159-60; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">(12) General Electric Capital Corporation, a large lending and investment institution, was to provide debt financing for the Bala deal. (See Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 73; Kurz deposition (5/1/98), p. 10.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the time of the Bala deal, GMH was one of GE Capital\u2019s \u201ctier one\u201d customers, and GMH was already in partnership with GE Capital relating to other GMH real estate holdings. (Kurz dep. (5/1/98), p. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>GMH\u2019s Plan for the Bala Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">(13) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that GMH planned that, simultaneous with the closing with Prudential, GMH would sell Three Bala East to Allegheny Health Education Research Foundation (\u201cAHERF\u201d); that the sale was structured so that the ground under the building was to be sold to Allegheny for $6.2 million and then the rest of the value of the transaction was to be paid in the form of a lease over a 20-year period; that GMH and its partner, Goldman Sachs, planned to package the AHERF transaction as a bondable lease, which would have been sold to investors at market rates netting GMH and Goldman approximately $31,000,000; that AHERF was also going to take an option on Three Bala West; and that remaining properties would then be managed by GMH, which would generate various management and construction fees for GMH. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 156,165,168; McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 154-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">(14) The court further finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that GMH planned to roll the Bala acquisition into its eastern office portfolio, which already contained approximately $90,000,000 worth of commercial office buildings. GMH would then have combined that portfolio with some other office prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>erties so that they could establish an REIT that specialized in office properties in the suburban Philadelphia area. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 157-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>The Role of Goldman Sachs and Michael Fascitelli</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">(15) Goldman Sach\u2019s role in the Bala transaction, through its Whitehall Fund, was to back GMH in the purchase of the Bala property. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">(16) Michael Fascitelli, then a partner at Goldman, and the head of the firm\u2019s real estate investment banking, had developed a relationship with Mr. Holloway a year or two before the transaction involving the Bala property, starting in approximately 1994. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">(17) In the spring of 1996, Mr. Holloway brought the Bala property to Michael Fascitelli\u2019s attention, and GMH supplied him with information regarding the proposed transaction and with a plan of acquisition. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 39, 46; exhibit P-128.) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that \u201c[wjhen the transaction came, because it was Prudential who we enjoyed a good relationship with and because of Gary and because we thought it would fit into a plan, we proceeded and said, if it works out economically, we\u2019d be \u2014 Whitehall would be prepared to do a deal with you.\u201d Whitehall\u2019s commitment was made orally. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 39-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">(18) The court further finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he stated that most of the work regarding the Bala transaction, including the negotiations, was done by Gary Holloway and his people at GMH, Devon Glenn and Prudential; that Goldman Sachs was a money source, and did not have a day-to-day involvement in the transaction; that Mr. Fascitelli was involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Whitehall\u2019s decisions regarding its participation; in \u201cshaping the business deal with Gary that we were prepared to make\u201d; and because of his experience with Prudential, in giving advice concerning how to deal with Prudential. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 41-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">(19) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he stated that he had experience over a 10-year period in dealing with Mr. Twardock and Mr. Triece; that he spoke with Mr. Triece and occasionally to Mr. Twardock regarding the Bala transaction; and that he never got the impression from either Mr. Triece or Mr. Twardock that Mr. Glenn was acting without authority in the negotiations that were going on with GMH. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 43-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>GMH Receives Offering Materials Related to the Bala Deal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">(20) The court finds that GMH entered into an agreement on or about February 2, 1996 (\u201cdisclaimer agreement\u201d) as a condition of receiving the offering materials that had been prepared for prospective purchasers. (Exhibit D-137, P-3.) The court further finds that Prudential would not have entertained GMH\u2019s interest unless GMH had agreed to the disclaimer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">(21) GMH received copies of the offering materials by March 14, 1996, and by March 21, 1996, GMH tendered its first offer for the property. (Exhibit P-236, Joseph dep. (3/3/97), pp. 100, 126-27; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">(22) On April 24, 1996, Gary Holloway and Bruce Robinson for GMH met with Devon Glenn for Prudential and Douglas Joseph and Glenn Whitmore for CB to discuss GMH\u2019s interest in the property. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 29-30.) Gary Holloway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>told Prudential that GMH was looking to AHERF as a tenant for one of the buildings. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 58-60, 62-63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">(23) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that he knew that Mr. Holloway was in a \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation \u2014 he needed Prudential\u2019s agreement to take the property off the market so he could attempt to secure the tenant, and he could not pay the agreed price without securing the tenant. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 42-44; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 240; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 63-64.) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that Mr. Glenn made clear to him that he was representing Prudential and was Prudential's \u201cmouthpiece\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 61) and that Mr. Glenn told him they could reach an agreement on this if the investment committee approved the price which was more or less a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), p. 44; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 152-53; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 61-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">(24) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that he discussed with Mr. Glenn that the AHERF transaction was a way to give Prudential a premium price for the property, above what the market was willing to pay. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 62-63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">(25) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that he understood that Mr. Holloway needed assurances that as long as Prudential was negotiating with him, Prudential would not be negotiating with anybody else. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">(26) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on April 26, 1996, Mr. Glenn and Mr. Holloway agreed on a price of $109,250,000; that Mr. Glenn said he discussed the transaction with \u201chis people\u201d; that when Mr. Holloway asked whether the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>erty was off the market, Mr. Glenn responded that \u201cit is 100 percent off the market, the deal is your deal, he said proceed [with due diligence]\u201d; that Mr. Holloway said he would be spending a lot of money on due diligence and needed to know he had a deal, and that Mr. Glenn said, \u201cYou have a deal, proceed, and you will be getting the written documents from our lawyers.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 65-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">(27) The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on May 13, 1996, Mr. Glenn met Meg McGoldrick, then president and CEO of Allegheny University Hospital\u2019s Delaware Valley Division, to determine AHERF\u2019s interest in the property, in order to \u201cunderstand the viability of the stepped-up price of $109,250,000 (see Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 97-98) and that he concluded AHERF\u2019s involvement was sufficient to justify Prudential\u2019s entering into a letter of interest with GMH. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 68, 79-80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>GMH and Prudential Sign Letter of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">(28) On May 13, 1996, Prudential and GMH entered into a \u201cletter of interest\u201d (LOI), which was drafted by Prudential. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 92-94; exhibit P-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">(29) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that entering into a letter of interest would then technically allow Mr. Holloway the opportunity to secure or attempt to secure his tenant . . . \u201cwithout competing negotiations with other possible suitors for this property.\u201d (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), p. 33; see also, Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">(30) The LOI included the following information: a detailed description of the premises to be purchased; a purchase price of $109,250,000 and the methodology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>for paying it; a closing date; a provision for the timing of due diligence and the party to bear the cost of the same; responsibility for brokers\u2019 commissions; a time period within which the buyer\u2019s due diligence would be completed; and a statement that the property would be sold \u201cas is.\u201d (Exhibit P-14, (5/13/96).) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that the purpose of the LOI was \u201c[t]o set forth the kind of process between May 13 and the closing date, the process being time, what the expectations were, who was going to pay for what regarding closing, just to kind of put a framework together.\u201d (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 93-94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">(31) The court finds Mr. Triece credible when he testified that he was Mr. Glenn\u2019s supervisor, and a managing director at Prudential Realty Group; that the LOI was not intended to be a final purchase and sale agreement, and it included a provision that either side could \u201cterminate\u201d negotiations at any time; and that notice was necessary. (Exhibit P-235, Triece dep. (3/18/97), pp. 57-59;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see also, Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">(32) The court further finds Mr. Triece credible when he testified that Prudential and CB agreed that the property would stay \u201coff the market\u201d after Prudential signed the LOI as long as GMH. was \u201cseriously pursuing the acquisition of the property and [was] meeting the deadlines that they had proposed to [Prudential].\u201d (Exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>P-235, Triece dep. (3/18/97), p. 67.) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that he understood that \u201cas long as [Prudential was] . . . negotiating with Gary Holloway, he [Mr. Holloway] needed to understand that. . . [Prudential] was not negotiating with anybody else . . . .\u201d (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">(33) On May 14, 1996, Mr. Glenn wrote a memo to the Prudential Realty Investment Committee advising that Prudential was entering an LOI with GMH and that GMH would be proceeding with due diligence, contract negotiations and lease documentation with the tenant. (Exhibit P-15, (5/14/96).) In this memo from Devon Glenn to Prudential Realty Investment Committee, re: Bala Plaza letter of interest, he stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cWhile all contingencies have not been removed, I feel we are proceeding forward in a prudent manner. We have gotten GMH to begin spending money on due diligence within a 45-day window. And, the offer remains at $109,250,000.\u201d (Exhibit P-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">(34) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that Prudential typically did not market a property to other people when it had a letter of interest. (See Glenn N.T. (6/17/98), p. 153.) Consistent with its policy, Prudential did take the property off the market after obtaining the LOI, because GMH was \u201cworking with their tenant and they were doing their due diligence.\u201d (Exhibit P-235, Triece dep. (3/18/97), pp. 64-65; see also, exhibit P-236, Joseph dep. (3/3/87), pp. 177-78.) The court further finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that regardless of any theoretical definitions of \u201coff the market,\u201d Prudential recognized that \u201cas long as [it was] . . . negotiating with Gary Holloway, he needed to understand that . . . [Prudential] was not negotiating with anyone else . . . .\u201d (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>(35) In late May or early June 1996, GMH learned that, for a 90-day period, AHERF would not be able to actively negotiate on the proposed lease transaction because AHERF was in the midst of a bond issue and had not disclosed the Bala Plaza lease transaction as part of that issue. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 87-88; see also, McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 139-40; exhibit 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">(36) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that he called Mr. Glenn when the issue with AHERF arose, told him about it, and said he thought it could be resolved without affecting the closing date. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 87-92; Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 123-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">(37) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that he agreed that the issue could be resolved and assured Mr. Holloway several times that Prudential would work with GMH and that the deal was still GMH\u2019s deal. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 89, 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">(38) The court further finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that on July 1, the parties agreed to extend the LOI in order to give Prudential and GMH an opportunity to reach a final accord upon the purchase price, adjustments related to capital improvements and the questions of whether Prudential would be willing to accept an \u201cearn-out,\u201d a partial payment, to be paid upon completion of the lease-purchase agreement between GMH and its planned tenant, AHERF. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 130-34; exhibit P-236, Joseph dep. (3/3/97), pp. 170-74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">(39) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that he asked Mr. Glenn if the LOI extension should be put in writing; that Mr. Glenn assured him that it was not necessary and that Prudential would go forward with GMH on a verbal basis; and that LOI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>was extended to July 31. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 99-100; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 240-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">(40) Although Mr. Glenn testified he did not recall discussing whether the property would stay off the market, Prudential did, in fact, keep it off the market in July 1996. (See exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 216-17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">(41) The court finds Mr. Triece credible when he testified that Prudential considered the property to be \u201coff the market\u201d at least from May 13,1996 until August 12, 1996. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 216-17; exhibit P-235, Triece dep. (3/18/97), pp. 64-65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>GMH/Prudential Negotiations Between May and August</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">(42) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that between May and August 1996, GMH and Prudential engaged in extensive negotiations to finalize their agreement for the sale of the property. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 97-18, 187); that during this period, GMH engaged in its due diligence efforts and arranged for financing (see Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 80, 92-94; exhibit P-116); that by August 30, GMH had essentially completed its due diligence and had completed its arrangement for financing; and that Prudential was aware that GMH was continuing to spend time and money to complete the transaction. (Glenn N.T. (6/17/98), p. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">(43) Between May and August, the parties discussed generally the impact of the AHERF bond issue and ways around it, an \u201cearn-out\u201d concept relating to the AHERF transaction, and the amount of the capital adjustment. There were delays in working through these issues in late July and early August because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>vacations of the various Prudential representatives and other business that Prudential was conducting unrelated to the Bala deal. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 243-44; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 102-104; exhibit P-8.) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on August 12, Prudential rejected GMH\u2019s pricing proposal, which included an earn-out concept regarding AHERF and an implicit capital adjustment of $2.5 million. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 116; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 249-50.) In 1996, the management of AHERF wanted to find a site in the City Line Avenue area to consolidate various facets of its services, including a women\u2019s health center it referred to as its Center of Excellence. (McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 133-34; see also, Melvin N.T. (6/17/98), p. 8.) Although several sites were considered, Bala Plaza became the site of choice, in large part because of its location and the fact that it was an already existing property instead of new construction. (McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 135-36, 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">(44) The court finds Ms. McGoldrick credible when she testified that the plans for AHERF\u2019s lease transaction with GMH were proceeding smoothly until the bond issue arose in late May or early June; that she had planned on June 28, 1996 to present for board approval the parameters of the Bala proposal; that this essentially would be general approval for the outline of the project, which would then allow AHERF\u2019s management to pursue and refine the specifics of the Bala transaction. The court further finds Ms. McGoldrick credible when she testified that when the bond issue arose, on advice of counsel, the plan to go to the board for approval was suspended during the 90-day window; and that by September 11, the 90-day hold period had passed, and AHERF was ready to proceed. (McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 16, 133, 137-38, 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>(45) As discussed above, AHERF\u2019s management planned to purchase Bala Three East, including the land, and lease back the building. (McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), p. 154; Melvin N.T. (6/17/98), p. 14.) AHERF also wanted an option on Bala Three West. (McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 154-55.) The original purchase price for the land was $6,200,000. After the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation surfaced with the signing of the GSIC letter of intent dated September 12, 1996 and became involved, it appeared it would take more money to finalize the deal, and AHERF was willing to pay $7,200,000 for the land. (McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 155-56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">(46) On October 17,1996, Ms. McGoldrick presented the Bala proposal to the board, and it was approved. (McGoldrick, N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 151,153,156; exhibit P-172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>The Earn-out</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">(47)The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that various alternatives were considered by the parties to give Prudential assurances that AHERF would enter a lease once the 90-day window had passed. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 88-90, 95-96) and that one such alternative involved Prudential agreeing to take part of the purchase price as an \u201cearn-out\u201d to be paid when AHERF signed its lease. \u201cThe idea [was that GMH] . . . would close the deal with Prudential at an all-cash number minus the capital adjustment . . . and that at some point in the future when in fact the tenant (AHERF) could come back . . ., [Prudential] would be paid the extra differential at that point in time.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 93.) The all-cash number originally contemplated was $103,000,000, with a $3,000,000 capital adjustment, and $3,250,000 as the earn-out. From early July until early August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>GMH waited for Prudential\u2019s response to the concept of the earn-out proposal, although there was some discussion regarding the cash portion of the earn-out proposal. In mid-July, GMH increased the cash offer to $103.5 million (with a downward adjustment to $2.5 million on the capital improvements number). On July 30, at Prudential\u2019s request GMH put the earn-out proposal in writing. Prudential then made a counterproposal requesting that \u201cteeth\u201d be put in the earn-out. By \u201cteeth,\u201d Prudential wanted to be able to \u201cget an additional bite at the apple of [GMH\u2019s]... profit\u201d if and when AHERF came on board. That counterproposal was sent by Devon Glenn to GMH on the morning of August 12. GMH declined Prudential\u2019s counterproposal. Devon Glenn then took the earn-out concept as proposed by GMH to Prudential\u2019s investment committee, which, on August 12, rejected GMH\u2019s pricing proposal with the earn-out feature. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 94-114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Capital Adjustment Negotiations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">(48) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that from the beginning of negotiations, the parties agreed that a capital adjustment was appropriate. (Exhibit P-8; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 83-85; exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/98), p. 131; exhibit P-11); that the capital adjustment discussions began with Prudential at $600,000 and GMH at $3,000,000; and that before the parties began to focus on an all-cash deal, Prudential was at $1,000,000 and GMH was at $2,500,000. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 83-85, 97, 108; exhibit P-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>Prudential Begins Considering GSIC As a Potential Bidder for Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">(49) Without the knowledge of GMH, in June of 1996, while the property was \u201coff the market\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Prudential and GMH were negotiating toward finalizing the sale of the property, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (\u201cGSIC\u201d) expressed an interest in the acquisition of the property. (Exhibit P-238, Whit-more dep. (4/25/98), pp. 86-87.) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Grubb N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 12-13.) Further, on or around July 11, 1996, just a few days after Prudential extended the LOI with GMH, CB and Prudential began to discuss among themselves the possibility of selling the property to GSIC. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 134-35; see also, exhibit P-8 (handwritten note by Devon Glenn).) Prudential also considered entering into a direct transaction with AHERF. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/25/97), pp. 178-79.) These internal considerations were memorialized by Devon Glenn in a memo sent to members of the investment committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\">\n<em>Conference Call Regarding the Limit of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Participation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">(50) Sometime in mid-July, the parties had a conference call where the limit of Goldman Sachs\u2019 participation in the Bala deal was discussed. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 105-106; Triece N.T. (6/23/98), p. 62; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 184.) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that he told Mr. Glenn what Goldman was willing to contribute to the deal and that Prudential could terminate the deal if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>it wished to do so; that he told Prudential that he was not speaking to the overall price GMH would pay for the transaction, but to the amount Goldman Sachs would contribute; that he stated that Mr. Holloway could bridge the gap if he wanted to do so; and that he told Prudential, \u201clet\u2019s all think about it [and] ... let us know what you want to do.\u201d After Mr. Fascitelli got off the conference call, Mr. Holloway told Mr. Glenn that Mr. Fascitelli was not driving the deal, that GMH still wanted to do the deal, that GMH had already put up additional funds and any more funds would have to come from GMH or the tenant. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 105-106; Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 49-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">(51) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that Prudential did <em>not </em>terminate the deal, and never informed Mr. Fascitelli of other options it was pursuing. Prudential never notified Mr. Fascitelli that it was negotiating with anyone else, and Mr. Fascitelli learned about Prudential\u2019s negotiations with GSIC at around the time GSIC\u2019s letter of intent was signed (September 12,1996). (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>Prudential and CB Actively Reach Out to GSIC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">(52) On July 22, 1996, CB and Prudential contacted GSIC to explore GSIC\u2019s interest in the property. (Exhibit P-231, defendant\u2019s answers to plaintiff\u2019s first set of interrogatories to all defendants, answer to question no. 1; exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/25/97), p. 134.) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that Prudential did not tell GMH it was considering GSIC as a buyer or that it had approached GSIC. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/25/97), pp. 137, 168-69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">(53) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that in late July, Mr. Holloway expressed concern to Mr. Glenn about Prudential\u2019s delay in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>sponding to GMH\u2019s earn-out proposal, which had then been on the table for several weeks. (See Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 102-104.) The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he stated that because he was concerned about the delay, Mr. Holloway asked Mr. Glenn:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u201cAre there any other players in this deal, is this deal still ours, to which he emphatically denied I was not negotiating with anybody, you\u2019re the only players, this deal is off the market, it\u2019s your deal.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he stated that Mr. Glenn told him that the delay in Prudential\u2019s response to the earn-out concept was due to \u201cred tape\u201d and peoples\u2019 vacations, and assured him again that Prudential was not dealing with anyone else, (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 102-104), and at the time, Mr. Holloway believed Mr. Glenn was negotiating in good faith during the earn-out negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">(54) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that toward the end of the time period when the earn-out concept was being negotiated, in or around early August, Mr. Glenn suggested an all-cash number; that he recalled his response as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u201cAnd I said Devon I have no problem with that [i]f the earn-out doesn\u2019t work[.] [L]et\u2019s go through the earn-out, we\u2019ve been at this for five weeks now, let\u2019s get an answer on the earn-out. But if it doesn\u2019t work out, we can discuss an all-cash number, you know, what are we looking at? And clearly at this point in time, the number that was bandied about[,] and Devon made this statement^] which was [\u2018]I feel at $106,750,000 that I could get this transaction done.[\u2019]\u201d Prudential\u2019s Continuing Negotiations with GMH from August 12 Forward</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(55) On August 12, 1996, the court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that Mr. Glenn told him Prudential\u2019s investment committee had rejected the earn-out concept and the deal would have to be on an all-cash basis (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 114; Joseph N.T. (6/23/98), p. 78); that at the close of the call, Mr. Holloway said he needed some time to talk to his partners and put together an all-cash offer, and Mr. Glenn agreed. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 115-17.) The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that Mr. Glenn assured him the deal was still GMH\u2019s, \u201cas long as we are still communicating and negotiating.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 117.) The court finds Mr. Joseph credible when he testified that he was told by Mr. Glenn about that August 12 call, and he understood that Devon Glenn had told Mr. Holloway that the earn-out concept was rejected and that if GMH was to continue negotiating, GMH would have to come back with an all-cash price. (Joseph N.T. (6/24/98), p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">(56) On or about August 12, 1996, however, Prudential and CB decided to give GSIC an \u201cexclusive\u201d opportunity to purchase the property. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 275-76; Joseph N.T. (6/24/98), p. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">(57) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that he did not think he needed to tell GMH about GSIC since, \u201cin [his] mind,\u201d negotiations with GMH were terminated on August 12,1996 (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 261); he admitted, however, that he never told GMH negotiations were terminated on that date, and Prudential continued to accept pricing proposals from GMH and to discuss those proposals with GMH. (Glenn N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 62-65,91-94,262-63; Triece N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 108-109; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(58) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he stated that no one from Prudential notified him that negotiations had ended. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">(59) The court finds that Prudential sent a letter from Mr. Glenn to GSIC dated August 15, in which Mr. Glenn wrote, among other things:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cI understand from Glenn Whitmore [an employee of CB] that your firm will explore the potential acquisition of Bala Plaza. As I\u2019m sure Glenn discussed with you, the property is currently off the market and Prudential is giving GSIC a limited exclusive look at this prominent four building complex.\u201d (Exhibit P-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">(60) The court finds that Prudential actively concealed from GMH that it was offering the property to GSIC (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/25/97), p. 137) and that, even more, it was giving GSIC an \u201cexclusive look.\u201d (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 276.) Nor did it tell GMH when, on August 21,1996, GSIC representatives visited the property. (Joseph N.T. (6/24/98), pp. 86-87.) The court finds both Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph credible when they testified that they told Ms. Giuliani, an employee of Prudential\u2019s property management subsidiary, not to advise GMH about the GSIC visit. (Exhibit P-234, Glenn dep. (2/25/97), p. 186; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 230; Joseph N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 227-29; Joseph N.T. (6/24/98), pp. 83-84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">(61) The court finds that Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph\u2019s instructions to Ms. Giuliani were made specifically knowing that there were two separate potential bidders for the property, neither of whom knew of the other. (Joseph N.T. (6/24/98), p. 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">(62) The court finds Ms. Giuliani credible when she testified that she felt uncomfortable about these twin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>directives from Douglas Joseph and Devon Glenn not to tell Bruce Robinson about the foreign investor\u2019s visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">(63) The court further finds Ms. Giuliani credible when she testified that \u201cit seemed to me that [GMH and Prudential] were negotiating and they were preparing to consummate an agreement of sale. And what seemed odd is that you would have another investor come to the property, take a look at the property without at least saying to GMH at some point\u2014 ... understand our letter of intent has expired. We\u2019re closing \u2014 you know, we\u2019re going to close our negotiations with you, and by the way we\u2019re reopening the offering of the property to other prospective buyers.\u201d (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">(64) The court finds Ms. Giuliani credible when she testified that she was further instructed by Devon Glenn to give Joseph Grubb of Tower Realty whatever information he needed about the property and that she followed this directive. (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 236-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">(65) The court further finds Ms. Giuliani credible when she testified that from May 1996, when Devon Glenn informed her that Prudential and GMH had entered into a letter of interest (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), p. 226), Ms. Giuliani was instructed not to do any leasing with respect to any of the properties unless she ran the leases by Devon Glenn and Bruce Robinson and that she complied with this directive from the time GMH signed its letter of intent in May 1996 until the day the letter of intent was signed with GSIC in September 1996; she continued through that time to run leasing matters on all properties past Mr. Robinson. (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 226-27; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 28-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>(66) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that his instruction to Ms. Giuliani to work closely with Bruce Robinson on the new leaseholds at Bala Plaza continued through June and July . . . didn\u2019t stop in August, did not stop on August 12, did not stop on August 15 when [Glenn] gave GSIC an exclusive look, didn\u2019t stop on August 30 when [Glenn] rejected the $105.5 and didn\u2019t stop when GMH was looking for a number at which they could purchase the property in the time frame of early September right after Labor Day. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\">(67) The court finds Ms. Giuliani credible when she testified that she has a specific recollection that some time in late August, she reviewed with Bruce Robinson a leasing transaction involving Prime Star, a current large tenant, at the same time she was providing some information to Joseph Grubb, and that when she told Devon Glenn she was uncomfortable with this situation, he reiterated that she was still <em>not </em>at liberty to tell Bruce Robinson that Prudential was negotiating with GSIC. (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 237-38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">(68) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that he called Doug Joseph on August 23 to ask about the status of GMH\u2019s August 16 proposal; that Mr. Joseph told him the delay was due to people being away on vacation; and that Mr. Holloway asked if they were \u201cshopping\u201d GMH\u2019s deal and Mr. Joseph replied, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d (Giuliani N.T. 6/16/98, pp. 11-12, 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(69) The court finds that in late August, CB and Prudential were waiting for GSIC\u2019s bid so it could be compared to GMH\u2019s August 16 proposal. On August 27, 1996, Mr. Joseph and Mr. Whitmore sent a memo to Mr. Glenn, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u201cWe will have GSIC\u2019s offer by the end of the week (hopefully sooner) however, given the time delay we should be prepared to consider both proposals from GMH and GSIC and respond accordingly by Friday.\u201d (Exhibit P-29, (8/27/96).)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(70) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that at about the same time that Mr. Holloway was seeking assurances from Doug Joseph, Mr. Fascitelli shared with Mr. Holloway that he had heard rumors in August that Prudential was talking to other people. Since the telephone conversation in which Mr. Fascitelli had asked Prudential to \u201clet us know\u201d if it had another offer, GMH, Whitehall and Prudential had been continuing to negotiate and structure a solution to the AHERF situation. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 54-55, 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">(71) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that he asked Mr. Triece in August 1996 whether anyone else was looking at the property, and Mr. Triece was evasive. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 54-55.) The court finds Mr. Triece credible when he testified that despite taking the position that the parties were not negotiating in late August, he understood by these messages that Mr. Fascitelli was \u201ctrying to figure out if we were going to counter at a higher price, if we were going to reject him outright, if we were going to consider other alternatives\u201d; that although that was Mr. Triece\u2019s understanding, he never said to Mr. Fascitelli, \u201cMike, why are you talking to me about a transaction that\u2019s over,\u201d because Mr. Fascitelli did not \u201cspecifically\u201d ask a \u201cquestion like that.\u201d (Triece N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 99, 102.) The court further finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that in response to his concerns, Mr. Holloway told him that he had spoken to Mr. Glenn and that Mr. Glenn had assured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>him that there were no competing bidders to the property. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 54-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">(72) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on August 30, he called Devon Glenn to check on the status of GMH\u2019s August 16,1998 all-cash proposal; that at that time, Devon Glenn told him that Prudential was rejecting GMH\u2019s proposal; that he was bewildered and questioned Devon Glenn as to how that could have happened after Devon Glenn had previously told him that $106,750,000 was a number at which he thought he could get the deal done. GMH\u2019s net number was actually greater than $108,000,000 when the TIBCs were added in. (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 13-14; Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 284-85, 294-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">(73) The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on August 30, 1998, he then asked Devon Glenn where GMH stood and asked for a counteroffer from Prudential; that Mr. Glenn responded that Prudential did not give counteroffers; that he then told Mr. Glenn he wanted a number at which Prudential would agree to sell the property; that Devon Glenn said he thought he could probably get a number by Tuesday, to which Mr. Holloway responded that he might not even want a number, because he was so disgusted; and that the conversation ended when Mr. Holloway told Devon Glenn that he would get back to him to let him know whether he wanted a number. (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 14-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">(74) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that during the August 30 conversation, he asked Devon Glenn if Prudential was talking to anyone else; that Devon Glenn responded that the property was off the market, it was GMH\u2019s deal, Prudential had not talked to anyone else, had not shown the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ings to anyone, had not discussed the deal with anyone, and was not negotiating with anyone else. (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 15-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">(75) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that after his call with Devon Glenn, he immediately called Mr. Joseph of CB Commercial; that he reiterated to Mr. Joseph the conversation he had just had with Devon Glenn, and asked Mr. Joseph, \u201c[Hjave you guys been shopping us? ... It doesn\u2019t smell right to me\u201d; that Mr. Joseph responded that they were not \u201cshopping\u201d GMH and that nobody is \u201cinvolved in this transaction but you\u201d; that he then told Mr. Joseph that he would call back on Tuesday, September 3, 1997 (since Monday was the Labor Day holiday) to let him know whether GMH wanted a number. (Holloway N.T.

Devon\u2019s very apologetic. As you know, people are away. We\u2019re having a problem getting a price for you, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that Mr. Joseph told him and Mr. Robinson that Devon Glenn expected to talk to Mr. Triece and Mr. Twardock the next day and was hopeful that he would be able to get back to them with a number the next day.

Doug Joseph again stated that Devon Glenn was very apologetic, but that Dave Twardock was away. Mr. Joseph also told Mr. Holloway and Mr. Robinson that Mr. Twardock and Mr. Triece were expected in that day, and that he would definitely have a number on Monday at which Prudential would agree to sell GMH the property. Mr. Joseph set up a conference call for Monday. In response, Mr. Holloway stated that he wanted to get this done, that everything, including the due diligence, was done, and that GMH was \u201cready to go.\u201d (Holloway N.T.

(6/18/98), pp. 117-18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">(79) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that neither on September 3 nor September 5 did Devon Glenn or Doug Joseph tell Mr. Holloway that the Government of Singapore had tendered an offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>for the purchase of the Bala properties on August 30. (N.T. (6/16/98), p. 19.) The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that at no time during the conversation of September 6 did Mr. Joseph tell Mr. Holloway or Mr. Robinson about the two written offers that had come in from the Government of Singapore on August 30 or September 6.

(Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), p. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">(81) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that before leaving for Utah, he told Mr. Robinson that, based on his conversation with Doug Joseph and Devon Glenn, he believed the price would be \u201cshaking out\u201d at $106,750,000; that he told Mr. Robinson that he thought Doug Joseph and Devon Glenn had said that they were going north of 107, but that Mr. Robinson had \u201cpermission that at $106,750,000 he could accept the deal right then.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 23-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">(82) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that previously, on August 12, Mr. Holloway and he had spoken with Devon Glenn about the possibility of an all-cash offer, and Devon Glenn had told them that, \u201c$106,750,000 would be an all-cash offer that he felt 95 percent sure he could get approved.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(Robinson N.T.

If you were to offer us a price of say $106 million, then we would think it was too low and we would decline and so we have a difference and what should we do with that?\u201d; that he responded that he believed they could overcome the difference, and asked, \u201cwhat about the $106,750,000 that we had previously discussed that you were 95 percent sure that you could get approved? If that was the number on the table, would we have a deal?\u201d; that Devon Glenn responded that he felt that the market had moved since that time and that that was no longer an acceptable number; that when he then asked what number would be acceptable, Devon Glenn said $107,250,000 was the number he could close at. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 118-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">(84) The court further finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified, during the September 9, 1996 conference call, that he then stated that he was not saying that GMH could not offer a lower number and that Prudential would not accept the lower number, but that if he wanted to make sure that GMH got the property, he must offer the $107,250,000 because that was the number Devon Glenn knew he could get the deal approved at; that he further asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u201c[H]ow do I know that this isn\u2019t a moving target? How do I know that we\u2019re not going to offer $107,250,000 and you\u2019re going to come back a week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>later and tell us the number is now $108 million?\u201d (Robinson N.T.

(6/18/98), p. 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">(85) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that he ended the call on September 9 feeling that although the number was higher than GMH had wanted to pay, they finally had a number that they could buy the property for if they wanted it; that he spoke with Mr. Holloway in Utah on the night of September 9, 1998 to update him on the day\u2019s events, and they decided that they would talk about a response to Prudential\u2019s price the next day. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">(86) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that during his conversation with Doug Joseph on either September 9 or 10, Doug Joseph told him that GMH\u2019s next offer had to be in writing. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">(87) The court further finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that on September 10,1996, Mr. Joseph called him and asked where GMH was, why hadn\u2019t he and Mr. Holloway talked, and if he was going to talk to Mr. Holloway soon; that Mr. Joseph seemed \u201cantsy.\u201d (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">(88) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that approximately 15 minutes after the telephone call on September 10,1996, Mr. Joseph called back and told him that there were three people interested in the property and he was concerned they were going to put in bids on the property; that he asked Doug Joseph how anyone else could be bidding on the property when GMH was told there was nobody else negotiating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and Mr. Joseph did not respond; that he asked if one of the parties was Cali Realty, and Mr. Joseph responded that Cali was not the one that concerned him; that when he asked who concerned him, Mr. Joseph responded that he had taken a large international buyer through the property at the end of August and he believed they were going to bid for the property; that Mr. Joseph then told him that it was really important that GMH put its best offer on the table if it wanted to get the property; and that Mr. Joseph did not disclose to Mr. Robinson that the foreign investor had already bid twice on the property. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 123-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">(89) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that on September 10,1996, after this second call from Mr. Joseph, he called Janet Giuliani to ask about the large international buyer; that Ms. Giuliani was upset and said she had wanted to tell him about the visit, but Devon Glenn had told <em>her </em>not to; and that Ms. Giuliani told him that:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u201cDevon Glenn told me I\u2019m not allowed to tell you. He told me that you guys knew that there was competition for the property. I didn\u2019t think there was, but I feared for my job, you know, I felt that I had an obligation to my employer\u201d; and that when Mr. Robinson asked again, Ms. Giuliani finally revealed that the Government of Singapore had toured the building.

(Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), p. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">(91) The court further finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that before the morning meeting with AHERF, he and Mr. Robinson agreed between themselves that they would meet Prudential\u2019s \u201cwill sell\u201d price; that is, \u201cgive them the price that they say which is $107,250,000.\u201d (Holloway N.T.

(Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 128; Melvin N.T. (6/17/98), p. 18.) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that he and Mr. Holloway started the meeting by telling AHERF that GMH had a deal with Prudential, that GMH and Prudential had agreed to a price, and GMH was moving toward closing; that although at the time of the AHERF meeting they had not actually transmitted the requested written response to Prudential as of the time of the meeting, but GMH had decided to commit to the $107,250,000 price. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 127, 129; Melvin N.T. (6/17/98), p. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">(93) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that at the meeting with AHERF, \u201cAllegheny basically told us that they have a deal with us in principle, however there\u2019s some issues that they\u2019d like to discuss with us\u201d; that none of the issues that Allegheny wanted to discuss \u201cwere viewed by either side as material in completing the transaction\u201d; that these issues involved clarification from GMH on when GMH would be able to put tenants into the Bala buildings and whether GMH was able to give Allegheny an additional $10 allowance for tenant improvement. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>129-30; see also, McGoldrick N.T. (6/17/98), p. 151; Melvin N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 24-25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">(94) The court finds Mr. Melvin credible when he testified that when he walked away from the September 11 meetings, he believed that AHERF and GMH had a deal; and that there were \u201cno significant open issues at the culmination of the September 11 meeting.\u201d (Melvin N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 25-27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>GMH Meets Prudential\u2019s \u201cWill Sell\u201d Price</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">(95) The court finds the testimony of Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that on September 11, 1996, after the AHERF meeting, he called Doug Joseph to tell him that the full price of $107,250,000 was acceptable, and that he would put it in writing to him later that day; that Doug Joseph suggested the writing should be just \u201clike a letter of intent format.\u201d The court further finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that GMH\u2019s September 11 letter was \u201c[GMH\u2019s] acceptance of the $107,250,000 price\u201d; that GMH used the LOI format because Mr. Joseph requested it, because there had been numerous references to the May 13 LOI and because the May 13 LOI addressed details including who was responsible for the brokers\u2019 commissions and tenant improvements. GMH, therefore, tried to \u201cpiggy-back ... off that document.\u201d (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 130-31; exhibit P-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">(96) The court finds the testimony of Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that he sent a draft of the acceptance letter to Doug Joseph first for his review and that Joseph told them it looked great and could be sent to Prudential. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">(97) The court finds Mr. Robinson credible when he testified that with this September 11 letter, there were no material outstanding issues between the parties; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that while the letter referred to an environmental question, GMH had removed that as a pricing issue; and that the purpose of identifying the question was that he wanted to make sure Prudential realized GMH had to have some closure with it and GMH would have Prudential\u2019s cooperation in getting it resolved. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 131-32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">(98) The court finds that throughout the parties\u2019 negotiations, the price agreed upon in the May 13 LOI\u2014 $109,250,000 \u2014 did not change. What was being negotiated was whether part of the price would be paid by means of an \u201cearn-out\u201d and, in addition, the extent of capital adjustments to the agreed upon price. (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/98), pp. 102-103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">(99) The court finds that the ultimate \u201cwill sell\u201d price of $107,250,000 which was provided by Prudential and CB, was an all-cash price which took into account the previous negotiations concerning capital adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">(100) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that had he known that there was another bidder, he would have sat down immediately with Mr. Glenn and closed the deal; he would have \u201cimmediately brought Devon Glenn in and sat him down and said, tell us exactly what has to be done in this deal. There\u2019s no way in hell we would allow ourselves to be stalking horse at that point. We had been in this deal for five or six months. Everything was done. The financing was in place. The equity was in place. Our tenant was in place. I mean there\u2019s no way in hell \u2014 we would have closed that deal, and we would have brought him right down to the point of where he had to be on a price structure and closed it.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 56; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), p. 221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">(101) The court finds that from late July until September 12, while the above negotiations with GMH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>were proceeding, Prudential and CB were pursuing a parallel track with GSIC. Prudential and CB actively concealed these parallel tracks from both GSIC and GMH in order to use these suitors for the property as pawns against one another in a scheme to drive up the purchase price of the property, all for the gain of CB and Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>GSIC\u2019s Negotiation and Acquisition of Bala</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">(102) Tower Realty Management Corporation is an asset management company that is a wholly owned affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">(103) The court finds Mr. Whitmore credible when he testified that late in July, he was instructed by Devon Glenn to call Tower Realty\u2019s Joseph Grubb, the regional asset manager for GSIC\u2019s northeast region (Boston through Virginia), to determine if GSIC would be interested in Bala Plaza. (Exhibit P-238; Whitmore dep. (4/25/98), pp. 86-89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">(104) The court finds Mr. Whitmore credible when he testified that Mr. Grubb told him that GSIC was \u201cvery, very interested\u201d in the property, but that he understood that the property was under an agreement with GMH, and therefore, off the market; he told Mr. Grubb that negotiations with GMH were not going smoothly. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 16-18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">(105) The court further finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified after speaking with Glenn Whitmore, he had a conference call with Paul Gamelin, his superior at Tower; that during the conference call, Mr. Grubb stated that GSIC had a high level of interest; that it was very important for them to have an \u201cexclusive look\u201d; that they would go forward and put their time into reviewing the asset if they got exclusivity; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>that it was important to GSIC to have an \u201cexclusive look,\u201d to know that they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a competitor,\u201d so they would not be used as a \u201cstalking horse.\u201d (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 20-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">(106) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that during the phone conference on or about August 15, 1996, and in a subsequent August 15 letter from Devon Glenn, Prudential assured him that GSIC would have an exclusive opportunity regarding Bala. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 24-26; exhibit P-128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">(107) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that on August 21, he toured the property for GSIC. (Grubb N.T. (6/16/98), p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">(108) The court further finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that from GSIC\u2019s receipt of the August 15 letter up through and including GSIC\u2019s visit to the Bala property on August 21, no one from Prudential or CB Commercial told any representative of GSIC that GMH had made an all-cash offer on August 16. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">(109) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that he relied on Prudential\u2019s promise of exclusivity, and that it was inconsistent for Prudential to entertain an offer from GMH during this time period. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">(110) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that when GSIC submitted its August 30 offer of $108,500,000, it used its standard letter of intent, which included a provision that the tenant improvements and the brokers\u2019 commissions would be paid by the seller, and a provision that the LOI would not be construed as a final agreement.

(Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">(112) The court further finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that Devon Glenn asked that certain revisions be made to the language of GSIC\u2019s August 30, 1996 letter of intent; that GSIC submitted a revised letter of intent on Friday, September 6, 1996, which incorporated Devon Glenn\u2019s changes; and that this September 6, 1996 LOI still contained a $108,500,000 offer, a provision that the seller would be responsible for tenant improvements and brokers\u2019 commissions, and a provision that the LOI could not be construed as a final sale agreement; and that GSIC expected, and had discussed with Prudential, that Prudential was to sign the LOI on Monday, September 9, 1996. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 33-37; exhibit P-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">(113) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that when he still had not received a signed letter of intent by September 11, he began to get nervous and contacted Devon Glenn and Glenn Whitmore to see why there was a delay; Mr. Whitmore told him that Prudential was reviewing the offer and that it was \u201cgoing through channels\u201d; he was not made aware that on September 9, Devon Glenn had given GMH a \u201cwill sell\u201d price or that on September 10, Mr. Joseph had contacted GMH twice to make sure that GMH made its best offer in keeping with the \u201cwill sell\u201d price or that Prudential was waiting for GMH\u2019s response to the September 9 call. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 38-40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">(114) The court further finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that early on the morning of September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>12, he and Mr. Glenn spoke by telephone; that Mr. Glenn told him during that conversation that \u201cGMH had made an \u2018unsolicited offer\u2019 and that it was \u2018a higher net number\u2019 than GSIC\u2019s offer.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 41-42, 67; exhibit P-139.) The court finds that GMH\u2019s September 11 pricing proposal was not an \u201cunsolicited\u201d offer in that both Mr. Joseph and Mr. Glenn were waiting for GMH to respond to the September 9 conference call; in fact, Mr. Glenn conceded that the reason Prudential was not signing GSIC\u2019s proposed LOI on September 9, 10 or 11 was that Mr. Glenn was waiting for GMH\u2019s response to the September 9 conference call and Prudential\u2019s $107,250,000 number. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 293-94.) Mr. Glenn told Mr. Grubb, however, that Prudential would \u201cstill honor [GSIC\u2019s] . . . exclusive\u201d; that Mr. Glenn further told him that if GSIC agreed to pay for tenant improvements and brokerage commissions (\u201cTIBCs\u201d) in the amount of $806,158, then Prudential would sign an LOI with GSIC, and GSIC agreed, which made its offer approximately $500,000 more than GMH\u2019s number, including TIBCs.

(6/23/98), pp. 284-85, 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">(115) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that the final GSIC LOI executed by Prudential dated September 12, 1996, provided that GSIC would pay for the tenant improvements and brokers\u2019 commissions, and it also contained similar language to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>May 13, 1996 GMH LOI with the need regarding final approvals.

(Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 54; exhibit P-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">(117) The court finds Mr. Grubb credible when he testified that GSIC\u2019s 60-day due diligence period expired on or about November 11 or 12, but there were no written extensions of the letter of intent; that Devon Glenn provided verbal extensions of the LOI until GSIC\u2019s closing in late December could occur; and that the purchase and sale agreement between GSIC and Prudential was not executed until the day of closing, December 26, 1996. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 55-56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">(118) The court finds Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on September 12, he and Mr. Robinson were informed by Devon Glenn and Doug Joseph that Prudential had rejected GMH\u2019s $107,250,000 number and was awarding the deal to GSIC. (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 43-45; see also, Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 133-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">(119) Mr. Holloway expressed disbelief about Prudential\u2019s earlier representation that Prudential and CB were negotiating only with GMH and queried how an agreement with GSIC could be consummated so quickly. (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 43-45; Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 133-34.) Mr. Glenn responded that the negotiations with GSIC had only just evolved \u201cwithin the last 24 hours.\u201d (Exhibit P-244; Glenn dep. (2/24/98), p. 302; see also, Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 43-45; Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 133-34.) The court finds that Mr. Glenn and, in fact, Prudential had been having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>discussions with GSIC for nearly a month. (Glenn N.T. (6/23/98), p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">(120) The court finds that the LOI with GSIC contained language to the effect that the LOI was not a final agreement, but, nonetheless, Prudential believed the GSIC LOI committed Prudential to consummating the transaction with GSIC. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 53; exhibit P-35; Triece N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 203-204.) No purchase and sale agreement was ever executed until the GSIC-Prudential transaction closed in late December 1996. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">(121) The court finds Mr. Triece credible when he testified that when GMH threatened litigation based on its belief that it had consummated an agreement to purchase the property, Prudential agreed to approach GSIC about \u201cunwinding\u201d the GSIC-Prudential LOI. (Triece N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 203-204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">(122) The court finds that there was no evidence Prudential\u2019s board met before Mr. Glenn signed GSIC\u2019s LOI, and GSIC and Prudential did not execute a purchase agreement or any other legal document other than the LOI until their transaction closed in late December 1996; after September 12, Prudential insisted, nevertheless, that its deal with GSIC could not be unwound unless GSIC were paid a \u201cbreakup\u201d fee and agreed to step aside. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), p. 56; Triece N.T. (6/17/98), pp. 203-204; Glenn N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 112-13.) The court finds Mr. Glenn credible when he testified that Prudential was \u201cunder agreement with GSIC,\u201d but agreed \u201cas a courtesy\u201d to ask GSIC to accept a breakup fee so that GMH \u201ccould then step back in.\u201d (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/98), p. 298.) The court finds Mr. Triece credible when he testified that GSIC would expect a breakup fee, \u201cbecause of our relationship with them and the fact that Devon [Glenn] had told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that he was going to recommend their deal to Prudential and that Devon had told them that Prudential was going to work with them to try and see if we couldn\u2019t close the transaction.\u201d (Exhibit P-235; Triece dep. (3/18/97), p. 187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">(123)The court finds that the bases Prudential has cited for considering itself bound to GSIC thus consist of oral assurances made by Mr. Glenn and an LOI signed by Mr. Glenn, without the formalities it now insists were a prerequisite to a binding agreement with GMH.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Findings Regarding Expert Testimony: Michael Fascitelli</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">(124) The court qualified Michael Fascitelli as an expert in the field of real estate transactions, real estate trusts and the type of custom and practice in the business entailed in a transaction such as that under consideration at this time. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 26.) From 1985 to 1996, he was with Goldman Sachs, one of the largest investment banking firms in the United States (or the world). He was a general partner from 1992-1996, became co-head of the real estate department in 1990, and became sole head of real estate investment banking in 1992. He was also a founding member and a member of the investment committee for the Whitehall Fund, a vehicle for Goldman Sachs\u2019 real estate transactions, including its transaction with GMH. He is also associated with other major real estate associations. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 8, 10-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">(125) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that he has been involved in many real estate transactions in which Goldman Sachs represented Prudential Realty as an agent, broker and advisor; sometimes he was a team leader in such transactions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sometimes he supervised other people. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 26-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">(126) The court further finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that he has also been involved in transactions in which he was on the opposite side of the table from Prudential, <em>i.e., </em>buying a property from Prudential. The relationship with Prudential was an important one for Goldman Sachs, and the value of the transactions was in billions of dollars. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 26-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">(127) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that he is familiar with the language used in paragraph 8(b) of the LOI between GMH and Prudential, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Not binding. </em>Notwithstanding That Either Or Both Parties May Expend Substantial Efforts And Sums In Anticipation Of Entering A Contract, The Parties Acknowledge That In No Event Will This Letter Be Construed As An Enforceable Contract To Sell Or Purchase The Property And Each Party Accepts The Risk That No Such Contract Will Be Executed;\u201d (Exhibit P-14; paragraph 8(b)); this language is commonly used in real estate transactions, both by Prudential and by the industry, generally. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), p. 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">(128) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that notwithstanding the inclusion of such a provision in an LOI, it is standard practice in the industry to consummate a transaction based on an oral agreement and a handshake; most of the transactions in which Mr. Fascitelli was involved with Prudential were consummated by oral communications \u2014 \u201cthe rule is when you agree to a transaction, you finished it. I mean most of the cases, the [v]ast majority.\u201d (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 65-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(129) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that before agreeing to take on GMH as a partner, Whitehall and Goldman Sachs performed a substantial amount of work to check out Mr. Holloway and understand his aspirations, his qualifications and his organizational capabilities. (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 66-67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">(130) The court further finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that Mr. Holloway explained to him that he had been operating in the local Philadelphia market and had become involved in certain transactions with General Electric, a big national player; that he was seeking to develop a large portfolio of suburban properties and use it either to go public or form a private REIT; that his goal was to become a participant in the national real estate market; that in order to do so, it was necessary for him to interest national players, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Prudential, in offering him properties; that to get on such entities\u2019 lists of prospective buyers, one needs a track record, \u201ca status or reputation of doing large transactions and doing them with quality sellers and quality buyers.\u201d (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 67-69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">(131) The court finds Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that failure to close a $100 million-plus transaction has a negative impact on the ability to move from a regional market participant to a national market participant; that the real estate business is based on reputation and track record; that failure to close a deal affects the ability to get offering materials and, even more, makes people reluctant to award a deal; and that \u201c[0]ffered another choice, you would probably not seek to do business with that buyer.\u201d (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 70-71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\n<em>Evidence Supporting GMH\u2019s Expert, Wayne Geisser\u2019s, Analysis of Lost Profit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">(132)Mr. Geisser relied on certain facts and assumptions derived from the trial record. The court finds Mr. Geisser\u2019s reliance reasonable, and the following trial evidence that he relied upon to be credible and well-supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>General Market Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">(133) Mr. Geisser relied, in part, on the testimony of Mr. Robinson, who is a CPA, and is responsible at GMH for the acquisition and disposition of properties, capital transactions and financing relating to these activities. Additionally, as part of his job, it is important for Mr. Robinson to follow the real estate market including its trends, acquisitions and dispositions. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 141-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">(134) For the acquisition or disposition of property, it is necessary to have specific information about the market in order to understand pricing. In general, currently, the suburban office market is extremely strong nationally, and more specifically, the Philadelphia suburban office market is extremely strong. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 142-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">(135) In Mr. Robinson\u2019s experience, there has been a lot of activity with Real Estate Investment Trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) in the Philadelphia marketplace within the last 12 months, both central business district properties and suburban office properties, and as a result, pricing in this marketplace has increased dramatically. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 144-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">(136) There are a number of ways to value property. Of these, two are pertinent to the analysis here. They are capitalization (\u201ccap\u201d) rate analysis and a market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>value approach. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 147-48, 154.) The court in this matter has chosen to use the \u201ccap\u201d rate analysis since it is supported by competent evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">(137) A cap rate is a multiple on a property\u2019s earnings. In valuing a property, one would take the net operating income of a property and apply the cap rate. Cap rate is inverse to market value, <em>i.e., </em>the lower the cap rate, the higher the market value. Recently, cap rates and market value rates have begun to decouple. In certain situations, where a property would not have been sold previously because the income stream was too low and the owner of the property might not be willing to sell for that price, a buyer such as a REIT is willing to look past the cap rate value. The REIT is willing to accept a much, much lower cap rate because they are viewing the replacement costs of the property. The impact of this is that it allows more transactions to occur because buyers are now willing to pay more for properties. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 148, 150, 153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">(138) With respect to using the market value approach to establish a property\u2019s value, the value of the property is taken and divided by the amount of rentable square footage in that building to arrive at a price per square foot. Price per square foot valuation is used to cost the construction of new buildings and to compare the replacement cost of an existing building. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>The Bala Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">(139) With respect to the Bala properties, financing was to be supplied by Goldman Sachs and GE Capital. Goldman was to be GMH\u2019s equity partner and GMH was to put up no less than 10 percent of the equity. GMH projected that a 10 percent equity contribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and the initial capital contribution would have amounted to $2.89 million. On the day of closing, upon the sale of Bala Three East to AHERF and the receipt of GMH\u2019s brokerage fee for the deal, GMH would have received back $2.3 million at closing. GMH\u2019s net cash investment, therefore, at the end of the day of closing would have been $500,000. Following the closings with Prudential and sale of the bondable lease, the GMH/Whitehall partnership would have realized approximately $20 million to be distributed pursuant to the partnership agreement. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 155-56, 158, 161-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">(140) With a purchase price of $107,250,000, the Bala Three East transaction with AHERF would yield the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">(a) the total proceeds from the sale of the Bala Three transaction would have been $37 million;</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">(b) the sale of the land represented $6.2 million;</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">(c) approximately $31 million would be realized by the sale of the bondable lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">After paying off the debt, a net of approximately $20 million would be available for distribution to the partnership. With respect to the GE Capital financing, Goldman Sachs and GMH would pay off any debt at 100 percent of the agreed upon allocated value. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 165, 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">(141) Closing costs were to be capitalized. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">(142) GMH planned to accelerate its cash distributions from the Bala transaction by selling buildings at the earliest possible stage, increasing rents, and deferring expenses and capital expenditures. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 155-56, 159-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(143) Pursuant to the agreement between GMH and Goldman, the partners would have received cash distributions from the partnership along lines consistent with prior agreements between GMH and Whitehall relating to other deals as follows: all distributions were to be made in a 90/10 (Goldman/GMH) split until the partners received a return of all their invested capital. Thereafter, distributions continued to be governed by the 90/10 split until each partner received a 20 percent return on its investment. Finally, after the two foregoing conditions were met, GMH would receive a promoted distribution to a level of 28 percent, thereafter, with Goldman receiving the balance at 72 percent. Because of this arrangement, GMH had great incentive to accelerate cash flow. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 159-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">(144) In terms of dollars per square foot, the total value of the Bala Three East transaction came to $202 per square foot ($185 a square foot for the base building plus $17 a square foot per tenant improvements). (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">(145) Because of favorable market conditions in June 1998, GMH could have sold the property to either AHERF or another party at a comparable rate; AHERF\u2019s option was for $185 per square foot on Bala Three West. In fact, taking advantage of the favorable market, GMH sold nearly half of its portfolio in January 1998 for $350,000,000. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 164; see Golboro N.T. (6/23/98), pp. 52-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">(146) As part of its agreement with Goldman Sachs, GMH was entitled to receive various fees from the Bala transaction as follows: (1) a net property management fee equal to 3 percent of the gross collected revenues from the properties; (2) an 8 percent construction management fee; and (3) leasing commissions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>which would have created additional income to GMH. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 167, 188-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">(147) Mr. Robinson testified that he and others at GMH worked with Mr. Geisser in developing assumptions relating to the cash flows from the property that were then used by Mr. Geisser in his damages analysis. With this method, GMH took the original assumptions the company used in initially valuing the property before negotiations and updating those assumptions to reflect current market conditions, which are more favorable than those that existed in early 1996. The court finds that the methods used are credible and sound. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 192-93; exhibit P-219; exhibit P-220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">(148) Currently, the Bala properties are outperforming what GMH had projected; rents are higher, vacancy rates are lower, and bad debt experience is lower. In addition, the residual values of the properties substantially exceed the values projected by GMH at the time of negotiations with Prudential. (Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">(149) The typical lease period for the Bala Plaza properties is five years. The current rental rate for One Bala Plaza starts at $24 a square foot and escalates by $1 a square foot each year throughout the lease term. At Two Bala Plaza, rents start at $27 a square foot, escalating by $1 a square foot per year for the lease term. Three Bala East and West both start at $28 a square foot and escalate by $1 a square foot each year during the lease term. (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 246-47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">(150) The court finds that the vacancy rates are low for the Bala properties and have steadily decreased since the early 1990s. One Bala Plaza is currently 99 percent leased, Two Bala is 98 percent leased, and Three Bala <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>is also 98 percent leased. In fact, Ms. Giuliani testified that the current market at Bala Plaza is the best she has seen. (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 248-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">(151) The court finds that current losses due to bad risk tenants are minimal because the Bala property is only taking credit-worthy tenants. If there is a new company or start-up company, the Bala properties secure a line of credit. (Giuliani N.T. (6/16/98), p. 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">(152) The court finds that GMH planned to spread the capital improvements over the projection period. This was consistent with GMH\u2019s plan to defer improvements to accelerate cash flows. (Robinson N.T. (6/*/98), p. *.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\"><em>Wayne Geisser </em>\u2014 Lost <em>Profits to GMH</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">(153) Mr. Geisser is a certified public accountant, having received his CPA certificate in 1977. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), p. 81; exhibit P-221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">(154) The court finds that Mr. Geisser is a qualified expert accountant in the areas of lost profits and the analysis of business losses. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 86, 88; court statement (6/19/98), p. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">(155) In preparing his calculations, Mr. Geisser, along with the assistance of GMH personnel, prepared detailed cash flow projections pertaining to each of the properties. Mr. Geisser started with the basic projection that GMH had compiled at the time of due diligence on the Bala transaction (based on the financial data provided to GMH by Prudential), including a measure for evaluating performance. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), p. 119; exhibit P-219; exhibit P-220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">(156) In arriving at his projections, to confirm their accuracy, Mr. Geisser reviewed data from the Project database and software package designed specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>for real estate projections, and was specifically used in this transaction; consulted with GMH; and reviewed the manuals pertaining to the Project database. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), p. 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">(157) Mr. Geisser\u2019s projections reflect net operating income. Net operating income is significant because it is the primary way that property is evaluated in terms of its income productivity, and it is used directly in connection with establishing the value of a property when a capitalization rate is applied. Net operating income is the primary measure for evaluating how a property is doing. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 123-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">(158) Cash flow differs from net operating income in the following manner: to calculate cash flow from net operating income, one must typically deduct tenant improvements and brokers\u2019 commissions <em>(i.e., </em>cash flow equals net operating income minus tenant improvements and brokers\u2019 commissions (\u201cTIBCs\u201d). Cash flow was used in Mr. Geisser\u2019s analysis to determine how much is available to be paid to the partners in the partnership. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), p. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">(159) In preparing his expert opinion, Mr. Geisser made a series of assumptions and prepared a series of calculations pertaining to various facets of the Bala Plaza transaction based upon admitted exhibits and testimony. The facets of the transaction he focused upon were: GMH\u2019s plans for the acquisition, operation and disposition of the properties. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), P- 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">(160) The court finds that the most appropriate method and the method most within Mr. Geisser\u2019s area of expertise is the cap rate analysis. Based on a cap rate analysis, Mr. Geisser concluded that the total lost profits to GMH in this matter was $20,340,623. This $20,340,623 figure represents lost profits to GMH at the time of trial based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>on a calculation of lost profits through the year 2003, then discounted back to June 30, 1998 and compounded forward from January 1, 1997 (the approximate date of closing) to June 30, 1998 (the time of trial). (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 94, 99-100, 164.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">(161) The capitalization rate is a methodology that is used to calculate the market value of a property based on the income stream it is producing. The lower the cap rate, the higher the market value. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 94-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">(162) Mr. Geisser performed his analysis of lost profits over the period of 1997 through 2003. Mr. Geisser\u2019s analysis took into account actual changes and trends in the marketplace that occurred from January 1, 1997 up to the time of trial. (Geisser N.T.

The model accounted for the cash flows that would have existed over approximately a six-year period of time, from the beginning of 1997 through 2003. (Geisser N.T.

If that number was calculated over 240 periods, it has a present value of $31,533,148;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">(d) the bonded lease interest rate was 8-1/4 percent (using Mr. Robinson\u2019s contemporaneous notes from his meeting with AHERF on September 11, 1996) (exhibit P-39);</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">(e) the GMH/Goldman Sachs partnership needed to make tenant improvements in the amount of $ 15 a square foot pursuant to their agreement with AHERF;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">(f) at closing, $1 million was to be paid to Dr. Federman in connection with bringing the deal to fruition (to be paid in the form of cash or in the form of buildouts or other enhancements to the property);</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">(g) at closing, a $500,000 fee was to be paid to GMH;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">(h) at closing, a $35,000 fee was to be paid to Mr. Melvin;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">(i) the tenant improvements and brokerage commission in an amount of $1,612,182 were included as part of the acquisition cost;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">(j) 2 percent of the total amount realized on the sale of Bala Three to AHERF would be closing costs;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">(k) $10 additional per square foot was allocated for fit-out (in keeping with Allegheny\u2019s request of Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tember 11, 1996). (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 103-104, 109-110, 128, 143, 146; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">(166) The total amount realized by the GMH/Goldman partnership on the AHERF transaction would have been $37,733,148. (Geisser N.T.

Ill; exhibit P-224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">(168) With respect to the financing of the Bala Plaza transaction, Mr. Geisser made the following assumptions, which the court finds credible and valid:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">(a) 75 percent of the financing would have been provided by GE Capital (a total amount of $85,077,169);</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">(b) the balance ($28 million) was being provided by the equity contribution of GMH and Goldman Sachs;</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">(c) the balance ($28 million) was then broken down 90/10, with the Goldman Sachs portion of 90 percent being $25,523,151; and the GMH offer of 10 percent being $2,835,906 at 114 for a total required equity contribution of $28,359,056. (Geisser N.T.

(Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), p. 127; exhibit P-102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">(170) The total debt relating to the Bala properties was $85,077,169, allocated pursuant to the parameters contained in exhibit P-128, as follows: $17,510,377 to Bala Three East; $21,195,129 to Bala Three West; and the balance of $46,371,663 to Bala One and Two.

(6/19/98), p. 115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(171) If the Bala properties were not sold in 2003, but instead all three of the properties were sold in June 1998 to take advantage of the favorable market conditions, GMH would have received a proportionally larger distribution of the cash that would have been made upon the sale as calculated by Mr. Geisser. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), p. 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">(172) In determining which cap rate to apply when calculating the selling price of the buildings, Mr. Geisser considered the downward trend in cap rates from the time Prudential priced the properties in its offering memorandum to the present, and used information available from statistical sources, including the RERC report (exhibit P-227), and market data supplied by GMH personnel relating to market conditions. The 8.5 percent cap rate used by Mr. Geisser reflects current market conditions and trends. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 132-33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">(173) Mr. Geisser also reduced the amount of damages by factoring in an alternative use of the $500,000 that would have been GMH\u2019s capital contribution (having contributed approximately $2.8 million but receiving back $2.3 million at time of closing). He applied an 8 percent rate of return on these monies. (Geisser N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 157-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">(174) Mr. Geisser used a discount rate of 5.6 percent because it is the current rate on six-year treasury notes, and Mr. Geisser deemed it to be a riskless rate of return. Higher discount rates include a risk factor of holding and operating the property. In this instance, using a higher discount rate with a risk factor would be inappropriate because the result of the negotiations are known; <em>i.e., </em>the transaction did not occur, and the property was not sold to GMH.

As a result, the cap rate used (10 percent) by Mr. Golboro was inappropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, other assumptions he made, such as vacancy rates and rental rates, were flawed for the same reason. As a result of not taking into account actual trends from the date of breach to the time of trial, as well as for other reasons outlined below, Mr. Golboro reached an artificially low damage estimate.\u201d (Golboro N.T. (6/25/98), p. 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u201c \u2014 Mr. Golboro used the high discount rate of 12 percent and attempted to justify its use because it is a rate he believed would be appropriate when evaluating a real estate venture. However, the use of this 12 percent rate is inappropriate in this instance because the question to be answered is how can we make plaintiffs whole or restore them to the position they would have been in had the Bala deal been consummated? It is not a question of analyzing the risks of a real estate investment.\u201d (Golboro N.T. (6/25/98), pp. 97, 99, 101-102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c\u2022 \u2014 Mr. Golboro did not use a proper method to discount to present value, because he did not compound forward to the date of trial.\u201d (Golboro N.T. (6/25/98), pp. 97, 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u201c \u2014 Mr. Golboro ignored testimony or evidence in his analysis which the court has found to be credible, including the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u201c \u2014 that the GMH/Goldman Sachs partnership would pay down 100 percent of the allocated debt (and <em>not </em>120 percent).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201c \u2014 that the GMH/Goldman Sachs partnership would succeed in accelerating cash flows from the transaction, leading to the partnership parties\u2019 earlier recovery of a 20 percent return on their investment and the earlier return of their investment, thereby allowing GMH to receive the 28 percent promote rate at the earliest possible time.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u201c \u2014 the recent trends in the Philadelphia suburban market are quite favorable, allowing for high rates of return on real estate investments, both from disposition and through operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u201c \u2014 Mr. Golboro ignored that GMH would have received back at the time of closing with Prudential all but $500,000 of its capital investment.\u201d (Golboro N.T. (6/25/98), p. 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">(178) The court finds that the testimony of Wayne Geisser, GMH\u2019s damages expert, was credible, well-supported, and persuasive with respect to the lost profits due to GMH as a result of Prudential\u2019s actions. The court bases this finding of fact that Mr. Geisser has expertise in evaluating lost profits in a litigation setting. Further, Mr. Geisser\u2019s projections were conservative and were supported both by the record of events between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the parties as well as an analysis of current trends in the real estate marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">(179) The court finds that on or about September 3, 1996, GMH asked Prudential for a number at which Prudential would sell GMH the Bala property.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">(180) The court finds that on September 9, 1996, Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph told GMH Prudential would sell it the property for a cash price of $107,250,000 and assured GMH that the number was not a \u201cmoving target.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">(181) The court finds that Mr. Joseph, pursuant to Mr. Glenn\u2019s instructions, told GMH that its response to Prudential\u2019s price proposal had to be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">(182) The court finds that on September 11, 1996, GMH agreed to pay Prudential\u2019s price of $107,250,000 and that, as Prudential required, GMH put its acceptance in writing. The court finds that Mr. Joseph told Mr. Robinson to put GMH\u2019s letter in the form of a letter of intent and that Mr. Joseph approved the form of the September 11 letter before GMH sent it to Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">(183) The court finds that as of September 11, 1996, the parties had reached agreement on all of the essential terms of the transaction and that they had manifested an intention to be bound by their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">(184) The court finds Mr. Glenn had authority, or apparent authority, to act for Prudential in its negotiations with GMH, and that Mr. Glenn\u2019s statements, representations and assurances made to GMH in connection with the sale of the Bala property were within the scope of his authority as vice president of Prudential Realty and as team leader for disposition of the Bala property.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">(185) The court finds that it was reasonable for GMH to believe that Mr. Glenn had authority to act on Pru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>dential\u2019s behalf in connection with the Bala property. In particular, it was reasonable for GMH to believe that when Mr. Glenn communicated Prudential\u2019s \u201cwill sell\u201d price on September 9, he had the authority to do so. The court bases this finding, in part, on the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u201c \u2014 Mr. Glenn was a vice president of Prudential Realty and was \u2018placed in charge of the disposition of the Bala properties.\u2019\u201d (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep.

Mr. Glenn was authorized to sign letters of intent and even final purchase and sale agreements after obtaining the necessary approvals.\u201d (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep.

Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph told GMH the delay in getting Prudential\u2019s \u2018number\u2019 was caused by Mr. Twardock and Mr. Triece not being available and that they would get back to GMH after they talked to those gentlemen. Prudential\u2019s investment committee had already approved the terms set forth in the LOI, including the total price.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 116; Holloway N.T.

Mr. Holloway testified that Mr. Glenn said he was getting approval from Mr. Triece and Mr. Twardock for the price Mr. Glenn ultimately proposed on September 9. \u2018So when he came with the number, there\u2019s no reason for us to ever believe, for one reason or another, that that wasn\u2019t the number that was approved by you guys [Prudential]. That number was put on the table by Prudential, not by us.\u2019 \u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), p. 51; see also, Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 240-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u201c \u2014 Prudential has not claimed Mr. Glenn was not authorized to make any of the representations he made; it simply takes a different view of what those representations meant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>(186) Based on the foregoing, the court finds that, at the very least, Mr. Glenn had apparent authority to commit Prudential to a \u201cwill sell\u201d price on September 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">(187) The court concludes that Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph repeatedly misrepresented to GMH that Prudential and CB Commercial were not negotiating with other parties regarding the Bala property and that the deal was GMH\u2019s deal, while Prudential was, in fact, negotiating with and laying the groundwork to sell the property to GSIC. These misrepresentations were made at the very least from August 15,1996, when Prudential, without telling GMH, promised GSIC an \u201cexclusive look\u201d at the property, until September 12, 1996, when Prudential announced that it intended to sell the property to GSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">(188) While the evidence establishes that on September 10, 1996, GMH was told that GSIC was interested in and had been taken through the property, the court finds that GMH was not told GSIC had made offers, that GSIC had been given an \u201cexclusive look,\u201d or that Prudential was working toward a sale of the property to GSIC. (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 182-83; Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">(189) The court finds that Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph knew they were dealing with GSIC at the time they were assuring GMH they were not dealing with others, and that they intended to deceive GMH. This finding is reinforced by those witnesses\u2019 evasive testimony regarding their negotiations with GSIC and GMH, and by the false statements Mr. Glenn made to both GMH and to GSIC regarding the other party\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">(190) The court finds that GMH relied on the representations of Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>GMH\u2019s reliance was justifiable. In particular, this court finds that:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">\u201c \u2014 GMH relied on Prudential\u2019s original promises of exclusivity when GMH spent time and money on due diligence and worked to secure AHERF as a tenant. GMH would not have proceeded with the transaction had it not received Prudential\u2019s commitment that it would not negotiate with others.\u201d (Holloway N.T (6/15/98), pp. 63-67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u201c \u2014 As the negotiations proceeded, GMH believed, based on Prudential\u2019s representations, that it had time to consider its position and to attempt to work out details which would not have been important if it had known the entire deal might be at risk.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 6-7; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 102-103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u201c \u2014 On August 12,1996, Mr. Glenn specifically agreed to give GMH time to put together an all-cash proposal.\u201d (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 115-17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u201c \u2014 The existence of a competing bidder made a difference to GMH, and if GMH had been told of the negotiations with GSIC, it would have handled the situation differently. The court finds reasonable and credible the testimony of Mr. Holloway that GMH would have insisted on Prudential\u2019s final position regarding price structure and would have closed the deal.\u201d (Holloway N.T.

N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 61-63, 65-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">(192) The court finds that GMH and Prudential would have consummated their transaction had not the negotiations with GSIC intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u201c \u2014 Though Mr. Glenn testified that he believed negotiations with GMH were terminated August 12, Prudential continued to accept and respond to proposals from GMH.\u201d (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 95-98, 186-88; exhibit P-235; Triece dep. (3/18/97), pp. 147, 151; exhibit P-29 (8/27/96).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u201c \u2014 Asked why, Mr. Glenn responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">\u201cCall it emotion. I had been working with these guys and I \u2014 that\u2019s\u2014it was emotion. We had spent a lot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>time. They had done their due diligence. They had moved down the road. They had gone toward the end so I was still willing to listen to them.\u201d (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), p. 277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201c \u2014 Even after its agreement with GSIC, Prudential agreed to try to \u2018unwind\u2019 the transaction and sell the property to GMH, though it believed GSIC would expect a fee. Prudential believed it would benefit from selling the property to GMH if it could get the same price it was getting from GSIC, because GMH had completed its due diligence, and the transaction could have closed sooner. According to Mr. Glenn, GMH ... \u201chad clearly done all of their due diligence. They are definitely a step ahead of GSIC, and they expressed their interest. If GSIC would have accepted the breakup fee, they were already done with their due diligence, and things would \u2014 Prudential would still end up with the same\u2014 Prudential was not trying to profit from it. We would have ended up with the same price.\u201d (Exhibit P-235; Triece dep. (3/18/97), pp. 167-70, 181; exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), p. 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u201c \u2014 GSIC, however, did not agree to unwind the transaction, and the property was ultimately sold to GSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u201c \u2014 The benefits to Prudential of selling to GMH rather than to GSIC were equally present before September 12, 1996; and the difference was that, before September 12, there would not have been the same question regarding a commitment to GSIC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">(193) The court finds that defendants used the bids from GSIC and GMH to negotiate a higher price for the property. For example, on September 9, 1996, when Mr. Glenn gave GMH Prudential\u2019s cash price number of $107,250,000, Mr. Glenn knew an offer of that amount would be a higher net offer than Prudential\u2019s pending offer from GSIC (though he did not tell GMH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that). (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 258-59.) After GMH agreed to Mr. Glenn\u2019s price, Prudential told GSIC on September 12, 1996 that GMH had made an \u201cunsolicited offer\u201d that was a higher net number than GSIC\u2019s, and that if GSIC agreed to pay certain fees totalling more than $800,000, Prudential would sign GSIC\u2019s LOI. (Grubb N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 42, 67.) GSIC did agree to pay the additional fees, and Prudential signed its LOI. (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 280, 286-87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">(194) The court finds that when defendants told GMH it had to put its acceptance of Prudential\u2019s price term in writing, defendants intended to and did use GMH\u2019s acceptance letter to induce GSIC to raise the price it was willing to pay for the property. The court also finds that defendants knew GMH would be damaged as a result of their representations and Prudential\u2019s sale of the property to GSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">(195) The court finds that the parties agreed the Bala property would be kept \u201coff the market\u201d as long as GMH was \u201cseriously pursuing the acquisition of the property and [was] meeting the deadlines that they had proposed to [Prudential].\u201d (Triece N.T. (6/17/98), p. 199; Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 63-67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">(196) The court finds Mr. Holloway and Mr. Robinson credible when they testified that Prudential representatives repeatedly assured them quite specifically that the deal was \u201cGMH\u2019s deal\u201d and that they were not negotiating and would not negotiate with anyone else. (See <em>e.g., </em>Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), pp. 89,99-100, 109; Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), p. 12; Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), p. 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">(197) The court finds that Prudential knew GMH would not proceed to spend money on due diligence and attempt to secure AHERF as a tenant, thereby giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Prudential the possibility of a premium above what the market was willing to pay, without Prudential\u2019s commitment that it could do so without competing negotiations, and that GMH did move forward with the transaction in reliance on Prudential\u2019s assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">(198) The court finds that GMH manifested its intention to be bound to an agreement to negotiate in good faith by performing due diligence, at substantial expense, by negotiating with AHERP regarding a lease for the property, and by engaging in intensive negotiations with Prudential to finalize the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">(199) The court finds that Prudential manifested its intention to be bound to an agreement to negotiate in good faith by taking steps toward the finalization of the agreement, by assuring GMH the property was \u201coff the market\u201d during the negotiations and by extending the period of the LOI while negotiations were continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">(200) The court finds that Prudential\u2019s course of conduct justified GMH in believing that GMH, CB Commercial and Prudential were dealing exclusively with one another throughout their negotiations and were working toward a closing on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">(201)The court finds that the LOI clearly allowed either GMH or Prudential to terminate negotiations. The LOI is not clear, however, as to how negotiations would be terminated or whether notice was required before termination of negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">(202)The court finds that the parties expected that notice would be provided if negotiations were terminated and that this expectation was reasonable. The court relies on the fact that the LOI did not say notice was <em>not </em>required; on the testimony of the witnesses, including Prudential\u2019s witness, Mr. Triece; and on the evidence that GMH repeatedly asked defendants if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>were dealing with others and was repeatedly told they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">(203) The court finds that Mr. Holloway and Mr. Robinson did not insist that the agreement to keep the property off the market be included in the May 13, 1996 LOI because Prudential insisted that GMH sign its form of the LOI in order to move forward, and because GMH relied on the verbal assurances Mr. Glenn made. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 95; Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 82, 84, 210-11.) The court further finds that GMH acted reasonably and that Prudential\u2019s assurances that the property would be kept off the market were the underlying premise of the parties\u2019 negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">(204) The court finds that Prudential never did terminate negotiations with GMH until it closed the sale with GSIC in December 1996. Even after entering into a letter of intent with GSIC, Prudential continued to negotiate with GMH regarding the possibility of unwinding its agreement with GSIC and selling the property to GMH instead. (Holloway N.T. (6/15/98), p. 117; Robinson N.T. (6/18/98), pp. 105-106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">(205) Prudential representatives acknowledged that Prudential continued to consider and respond to proposals from GMH throughout the month of August 1996 and into September. (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/98), pp. 96-98, 185-90, 221-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">(206) The court\u2019s finding that Prudential did not terminate negotiations with GMH is supported by the fact that until September 12,1996, Prudential\u2019s leasing agent continued to submit leases for the property to GMH for GMH\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">(207) The court finds that when Prudential promised GMH on September 9,1996 that it would sell the property to GMH if GMH would agree in writing to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>$107,250,000 in cash, Prudential should reasonably have expected GMH to rely on its promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">(208) The court finds that Prudential\u2019s promise induced GMH to accept Prudential\u2019s terms in writing and to finalize its lease agreement with AHERF.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">(209) The court finds that on September 11, 1996, GMH and AHERF had reached agreement on all essential terms of their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\n<em>Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Count I\u2014Liability\u2014GMH v. Defendant Prudential Realty: Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">(1) GMH\u2019s claim for breach of contract is based on its position that it and Prudential entered into an enforceable oral contract of sale for the Bala property on September 11, 1996, and that Prudential breached this contract by selling the property to GSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">(2) \u201cIt is established law in this Commonwealth that parties may bind themselves contractually prior to the execution of a written document through mutual manifestations of assent, even where a later formal document is contemplated.\u201d <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Great Lakes Holdings Inc., </em>387 Pa.

The court stated, however, that \u201c[t]he intent of the parties is a question of fact to be determined by the fact[-]finder.\u201d <em>Krause, </em>387 Pa. Super. at 64, 563 A.2d at 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">(6) As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated in <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>McShain, </em>432 Pa. 61, 247 A.2d 455 (1968), \u201coral testimony is usually required to determine whether the parties did or did not intend the formal document to be the only binding agreement.\u201d <em>Goldman, </em>432 Pa. at 69, 247 A.2d at 459 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a726 and comment b).

If the fact-finder finds that was an oral agreement to modify the written agreement, it can find waiver of the \u201cno oral modifications\u201d provision. <em>Empire Properties Inc. </em>v. <em>Equireal Inc., </em>449 Pa.

Lexis 603 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 22, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">(11) The court concludes that GMH and Prudential entered into an oral contract of sale for the Bala property on September 11, 1996, that Prudential waived any requirements set forth in the LOI regarding the final contract, and that Prudential breached the contract by selling the property to GSIC. Specifically, the court concludes that after the parties had negotiated for months, GMH on September 3, 1996, asked for Prudential\u2019s final position on how much of the agreed purchase price of $109,250,000 should be paid in cash; that Mr. Glenn responded on September 9 that Prudential\u2019s number for a cash price was $107,250,000; that GMH agreed to this price orally and then, as Prudential demanded, in writing; and that GMH\u2019s September 11, 1996 letter incorporated the May 13, 1996 LOI which contained other terms and conditions to which the parties had already agreed (and which Prudential\u2019s investment committee had already approved), including a description of the property, a provision for a down payment, and details regarding closing costs and brokers\u2019 commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">(12) The court concludes that GMH has proven the existence of an oral contract by evidence that is clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">(13) Evidence of the custom or practice of the industry is admissible on the issue of whether an enforceable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>oral contract can be formed when the parties\u2019 written LOI contains requirements regarding the approval and execution of a contract of sale. See <em>e.g., Jeannette Paper Company </em>v. <em>Longview Fibre Company, </em>378 Pa. Super. 148, 158, 548 A.2d 319, 324 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">(14) The court concludes that Prudential is bound by the statements, representations and assurances made to GMH by Mr. Glenn in connection with the sale of the Bala property, including the statements which are the basis for GMH\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">(15) Under Pennsylvania law, a principal is responsible for the acts of its agent, even if it did not know of those acts and even if it forbade such acts, so long as they were within the agent\u2019s scope of employment. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Ed Saxe Real Estate Inc., </em>508 Pa. 553, 562, 499 A.2d 282, 287 (1985); <em>Cohen v. Blank, </em>359 Pa. Super. 93, 518 A.2d 582 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">(16) The court concludes that Mr. Glenn\u2019s statements, representations and assurances made to GMH in connection with the sale of the Bala property were within the scope of his authority as vice president of Prudential Realty and as team leader for disposition of the Bala property.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">(17) The court concludes that the fact that Prudential considered itself obligated to GSIC based on an LOI signed by Mr. Glenn and Mr. Glenn\u2019s oral assurances that Prudential would work with GSIC supports a conclusion that Mr. Glenn had actual authority to bind Prudential in connection with the sale of the Bala property.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">(18) The court concludes that regardless of whether Mr. Glenn had actual authority, he had apparent authority, and it was reasonable for GMH to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Mr. Glenn had authority to act on Prudential\u2019s behalf in connection with the Bala property. The court further concludes that it was reasonable for GMH to believe that when Mr. Glenn communicated Prudential\u2019s \u201cwill sell\u201d price on September 9, he had the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">(19) The court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Glenn, as the \u201cteam leader\u201d for Prudential, had actual or apparent authority to bind Prudential is further supported by the factual testimony of Mr. Fascitelli, based on his personal experience working as a broker on behalf of Prudential, concerning the role of the \u201cteam leader\u201d at Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">(20) \u201cThe test for determining whether an agent possesses apparent authority is whether \u2018a man of ordinary prudence, diligence and discretion would have a right to believe and would actually believe that the agent possessed the authority he purported to exercise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Universal Computer Systems Inc. </em>v. <em>Medical Services Association, </em>628 F.2d 820, 823 (3d Cir. 1980) (quoting <em>Apex Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>245 Pa.

April 15, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">(21) The court concludes that in view of the parties\u2019 conduct throughout the transaction, GMH\u2019s belief that Mr. Glenn was giving it Prudential\u2019s final price on September 9, 1996 and had the authority to conclude a binding agreement was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">(22) The court concludes, based on the testimony and the report of Michael D.

All Defendants: Fraudulent Misrepresentations</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">(23) Count II of the second amended complaint, for fraudulent misrepresentations, is based on GMH\u2019s position that defendants falsely and fraudulently assured GMH that Prudential was not negotiating with any other party for sale of the Bala property, when Prudential was in fact negotiating with and laying the groundwork to sell the property to GSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">(24) Under Pennsylvania law:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u201cFraud consists of anything calculated to deceive, whether by single act or combination, or by suppression of truth, or suggestion of what is false, whether it be by direct falsehood or by innuendo, by speech or silence, word of mouth, or look or gesture.\u201d <em>Delahanty </em>v. <em>First Pennsylvania Bank N.A., </em>318 Pa.

This evidence satisfies the element of misrepresentation. See <em>Den-Tal-Ez Inc. v. Siemens Capital Corp., </em>389 Pa. Super. 219, 252-53, 566 A.2d 1214, 1230-31 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">(30) Clear and convincing evidence also establishes that the misrepresentations were made with fraudulent intent. \u201cIt is well settled that fraud is proved when it is shown that the false representation was made knowingly, or in conscious [disregard] of the truth, or recklessly without caring whether it be true or false.\u201d <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 108, 464 A.2d at 1252. The court concludes that there is no question that defendants knew they were dealing with GSIC at the time they were assuring GMH they were not dealing with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">(31) The court concludes that the evidence establishes by clear and convincing evidence that GMH justifiably relied on defendants\u2019 assurances. The court concludes that, in particular, GMH relied on Prudential\u2019s original promises of exclusivity when GMH spent time and money on due diligence and worked to secure AHERF as a tenant, and as the negotiations proceeded, GMH believed, based on Prudential\u2019s representations, that it had time to consider its position and to attempt to work out details which would not have been important if it had known the entire deal be at risk.

The court has previously found Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that after Prudential told him it was committed to sell the property to GSIC, he told Mr. Triece the loss of the property was a significant loss to him and he was \u201cwilling to increase his price significantly.\u201d (Exhibit P-235; Triece dep. (3/18/97), pp. 166-68; Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 65-66.) The court has further previously found Mr. Holloway credible when he testified that on November 13, 1996, the day after GMH believed GSIC\u2019s due diligence period expired, GMH handed Prudential a \u201csigned agreement of sale without any contingencies,\u201d stating a price of $109,250,000 plus TBICs, together with a check for a million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">(33) The court concludes that Prudential\u2019s delays in responding made GMH concerned that another bidder might be involved and that GMH did the only thing it reasonably could do: it repeatedly asked Prudential for assurances that Prudential was not dealing with anyone else. Prudential gave those assurances directly and plainly. (Seee.g., Holloway N.T. (6/16/98), pp. 161-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">(34) The court concludes that the fact that the parties\u2019 exclusivity agreement was not included in their written LOI does not undermine GMH\u2019s claim for fraud or its proof on the elements of justifiable reliance. The court concludes that GMH would not have proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>with the transaction had Prudential not committed to keep the property \u201coff the market,\u201d especially without protection for its due diligence expenses. The court also concludes that the parties expected that notice would be provided if negotiations were terminated and that this expectation was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">(35) The court concludes that clear and convincing evidence also establishes that GMH was damaged as a result of its reliance on defendants\u2019 misrepresentations, and that GMH and Prudential would have consummated their transaction had not the negotiations with GSIC intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">(36) The court concludes that GMH\u2019s damages include the amounts it spent in reliance on Prudential\u2019s false representations and the profits it lost due to its loss of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">(37) The court further concludes that based on the above stated facts, reliance damages are not speculative. In <em>Universal Computer, </em>the Third Circuit rejected an argument that damages based on plaintiff\u2019s loss of a contract were speculative because there was no guarantee plaintiff would have been awarded the contract. 628 F.2d at 826. The court found the jury reasonably concluded that if defendant\u2019s employee had picked up plaintiff\u2019s bid as he had promised, plaintiff would have been awarded the contract, since plaintiff\u2019s bid would have been the low bid, and there was no evidence regarding other factors which would have prevented acceptance of the bid. <em>Universal, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">(38) The court concludes that information regarding Prudential\u2019s negotiations with GSIC was material. When a bidder has been assured there is no competition, the existence of serious competition (another bidder who has been offered an \u201cexclusive look\u201d) is part of the \u201ctransaction at hand\u201d and is unquestionably material. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>See <em>Den-Tal-Ez, supra </em>at 253-54, 566 A.2d at 1230-31; <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 112-13, 464 A.2d at 1254; see also, <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>Bell Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>367 Pa.

The facts which support this conclusion are set forth herein. In particular, the evidence establishes that defendants, acting in concert and with a common purpose, assured GMH that Prudential was not negotiating with others, while knowing Prudential was negotiating with GSIC; represented to GMH that Prudential would sell GMH the property if GMH agreed to pay $107,250,000 in cash; that defendants knew, but did not disclose to GMH, that Prudential was in the final stages of agreeing to sell the property to GSIC; that defendants told GMH that it had to put its acceptance of the price term in writing; that GMH agreed in writing to Prudential\u2019s terms in reliance on the representations that Prudential would sell GMH the property on those terms; that Prudential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>in fact used GMH\u2019s acceptance to induce GSIC to raise the price it was willing to pay for the property and assured GSIC that notwithstanding GMH\u2019s \u201cunsolicited bid,\u201d it would honor GSIC\u2019s exclusivity; that Prudential then, when GSIC did raise the price, agreed to sell the property to GSIC; and that defendants knew GMH would be damaged as a result of their representations and Prudential\u2019s sale of the property to GSIC. The court also concludes that defendants acted with malice. See <em>Shared Communications, </em>692 A.2d 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Count VI\u2014GMH v. Prudential Realty: Promissory Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">(47) GMH has two grounds for its promissory estoppel claim. The first ground is that Prudential promised to keep the Bala property \u201coff the market\u201d while it was negotiating with GMH; that these promises induced GMH to spend its time and money pursuing a tenant, performing due diligence and engaging in negotiations over the specific terms of the parties\u2019 agreement; and that injustice can be avoided only if Prudential\u2019s promises are enforced. The second ground is that Prudential promised it would sell the property to GMH for $107,250,000; that Prudential\u2019s promise induced GMH to accept Prudential\u2019s terms and enter into a lease agreement with AHERF, under which AHERF would completely occupy one of the buildings on the property; and that injustice can be avoided if Prudential\u2019s promise is enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">(48) \u201cPennsylvania has long recognized promissory estoppel as a vehicle by which a promise may be enforced in order to remedy an injustice.\u201d <em>Travers </em>v. <em>Cameron County School District, </em>117 Pa. Commw. 606, 612, 544 A.2d 547, 550 (1988). (citations omitted) In that case, Pennsylvania adopted the statement of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>doctrine as it appears in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a790 (1979), which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201c(1) [a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.

Super. 65, 74, 384 A.2d 1228, 1233 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">(49) The court has previously found that Prudential promised GMH it would keep the Bala property \u201coff the market\u201d while it was negotiating with GMH for the sale of the property; that Prudential knew GMH would not proceed to spend money on due diligence and attempt to secure a tenant without such assurances; and that GMH did move forward with the transaction in reliance on Prudential\u2019s assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">(50) The court concludes that injustice can only be avoided by enforcing Prudential\u2019s promise to keep the property \u201coff the market\u201d and placing GMH in the position that it would have occupied had Prudential performed. See <em>Universal Computer, </em>628 F.2d 820 (3d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">(51) The court has previously found that Prudential promised GMH on September 9, 1996 that it would sell the property to GMH if GMH would agree in writing to pay $107,250,000 in cash, and that, in light of the history of negotiations between the parties, Prudential should reasonably have expected GMH to rely on its promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>(52) The court concludes that Prudential\u2019s promise induced GMH to accept Prudential\u2019s terms in writing and to finalize its lease agreement with AHERE</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">(53) The court concludes that injustice can only be avoided by enforcing Prudential\u2019s promise to sell GMH the property for $107,250,000 and placing GMH in the position that it would have occupied had Prudential performed.

Prudential Realty: Breach of Duty to Negotiate in Good Faith</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">(54) Count VII of GMH\u2019s second amended complaint is based on GMH\u2019s position that Prudential agreed to negotiate in good faith and to keep the Bala property \u201coff the market\u201d while it was negotiating with GMH, and that Prudential breached that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">(55) The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has predicted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would recognize a cause of action for breach of a duty to negotiate in good faith. See <em>e.g., Flight Systems Inc. </em>v. <em>Electronic Data Systems Corp., </em>112 F.3d 124, 130 (3d Cir. 1997); <em>Channel Home Centers </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>795 F.2d 291, 299 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">(56) According to the Third Circuit, \u201c[a]n agreement to negotiate in good faith is a contract.\u201d <em>Flight Systems Inc. supra, </em>112 F.3d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">(57) The elements of a cause of action for breach of this duty are:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u201c(1) both parties manifested an intention to be bound by an agreement to negotiate in good faith; (2) the terms of the agreement were sufficiently definite to be enforced; (3) consideration was conferred . . . and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>(4) the agreement was breached by bad faith conduct.\u201d <em>Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>112 F.3d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">(58) Based on the record, the elements of a cause of action for breach of a duty to negotiate in good faith are satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">(59) With respect to the first element, the parties agreed to negotiate for a specific property according to the specific terms of the LOI and agreed the property would be kept \u201coff the market\u201d as long as GMH was \u201cseriously pursuing the acquisition of the property and [was] meeting the deadlines that they had proposed to [Prudential].\u201d (Exhibit P-235; Triece dep. (3/18/97), p. 67.) GMH manifested its intention to be bound by performing due diligence, at substantial expense, by negotiating with AHERF regarding a lease for the property, and by engaging in intensive negotiations with Prudential to finalize the agreement. Prudential also manifested its intention to be bound by taking steps toward the finalization of the agreement, by assuring GMH the property was \u201coff the market\u201d during the negotiations and by extending the period of the LOI while negotiations were continuing. See <em>e.g., Channel Home Centers, supra, </em>795 F.2d at 299-300; <em>Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>112 F.3d at 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">(60) The terms of the parties\u2019 agreement in this case were also sufficiently definite. As set forth above, the LOI contained detailed and specific terms, including a price, and the parties agreed that the property was to be kept \u201coff the market\u201d while serious negotiations were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">(61) The element of consideration is also satisfied. Consideration \u201cconfers a benefit upon the promisor or causes a detriment to the promisee and must be an act, forbearance or return promise bargained for and given in exchange for the original promise.\u201d <em>Curry </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Estate of Thompson, </em>332 Pa. Super. 364, 371, 481 A.2d 658, 661 (1984). The LOI did not require either party to proceed with the negotiations. (See exhibit P-14.) GMH proceeded to do its due diligence and secure its tenant based on Prudential\u2019s promise that it could do so \u201cwithout competing negotiations with other possible suitors for this property.\u201d (Exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 32-33.) GMH acted to its own detriment by spending its time and money pursuing a tenant, performing due diligence and engaging in negotiations over the specific terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. Prudential also received a benefit by agreeing to take the property \u201coff the market\u201d; it obtained a committed buyer and the possibility of a higher price than the market was currently offering, which it realized it could not have done without granting the buyer exclusivity during negotiations. The parties\u2019 mutual promises and GMH\u2019s conduct in proceeding with the transaction constitute consideration. See <em>Jeannette Paper Company v. Long-view Fibre Company, </em>378 Pa. Super. 148, 160, 548 A.2d 319, 325 (1988); <em>Dahar </em>v. <em>Grzandziel, </em>410 Pa. Super. 85, 90, 599 A.2d 217, 219-20 (1991); <em>Kelly by Kelly v. Ickes,, </em>427 Pa. Super. 542, 552-53, 629 A.2d 1002, 1007; see also, <em>Empire, </em>449 Pa. Super. at 487, 674 A.2d at 302 (quoting <em>KoEune </em>v. <em>State Bank of Schuylkill Haven, </em>134 Pa. Super. 108, 112, 4 A.2d 234, 237 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">(62) Finally, Prudential\u2019s bad faith is apparent from the record. After keeping GMH negotiating and spending money for months, Prudential started negotiations with GSIC \u2014 and even promised GSIC an \u201cexclusive look\u201d at the property \u2014 while continuing to negotiate with GMH and without giving GMH any notice that it was terminating negotiations or offering the property to someone else. Prudential then proceeded to entertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>offers from both parties, while still allowing each to think it was the only bidder. After GMH agreed to pay the price Prudential demanded, Prudential told GMH it had accepted an offer from GSIC, and said falsely that negotiations with GSIC had only developed over the last 24 hours. Then, when GMH protested, Prudential took the position that it could not sell the property to GMH unless it formally \u201cunwound\u201d the transaction with GSIC, even though it had not more than a letter of interest with GSIC, and GSIC had not even started the due diligence process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">(63) The court concludes that the parties had an agreement to negotiate in good faith and keep the Bala property \u201coff the market,\u201d and that their agreement is enforceable under Pennsylvania law. The Third Circuit decisions recognizing a duty to negotiate in good faith are based on established principles of Pennsylvania contract law and fully consistent with Pennsylvania precedent. As the court made clear in both <em>Channel Home Centers, supra </em>and <em>Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>a contract to negotiate in good faith is subject to the same requirements as any other contract: the parties must have manifested an intention to be bound, the terms must be sufficiently definite to be specifically enforced, and there must be consideration. <em>Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>112 F.3d at 130; <em>Channel Home Centers, supra, </em>795 F.2d at 298-99. See also, <em>Dahar, </em>410 Pa. Super. at 91-92, 599 A.2d at 220-21; <em>Jeannette Paper Co., supra </em>at 159, 548 A.2d at 324-25. The parties\u2019 agreement to negotiate under specific terms and the assurances that Prudential would keep the property \u201coff the market\u201d meet these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">(64) The Third Circuit\u2019s holdings do not create a new cause of action. The court simply recognized that the fact that parties may not have reached an enforceable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>agreement of sale on a particular date does not preclude a finding that they reached an enforceable agreement as to other aspects of their transaction. This is fully consistent with Pennsylvania law. See <em>e.g., Den-Tal-Ez Inc. v. Siemens Capital Corp., </em>389 Pa. Super. 219, 241-42, 566 A.2d 1214, 1225 (1989). See also, <em>Project Development Group Inc. v. O.H. Materials Corp., </em>766 F. Supp. 1248, 1352-53 (W.D. Pa. 1991), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>993 F.3d 225 (3d Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">(65) Enforcement of such agreements is also consistent with the principle of Pennsylvania contract law that parties can be bound by an agreement that covers essential terms, even if certain details remain to be finalized. See <em>Field </em>v. <em>Golden Triangle Broadcasting Inc., </em>451 Pa. 410, 419, 305 A.2d 689, 693-94 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1158 (1974); <em>Jeannette Paper Company, supra </em>at 159, 548 A.2d at 324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">(66) The claim GMH asserts has also been recognized in other jurisdictions. As one court put it, \u201c[t]he modern view, and the view endorsed by most scholars, is that agreement to negotiate in good faith, unlike mere \u2018agreements to agree,\u2019 are not unenforceable as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Howtek Inc. v. Relisys, </em>958 F. Supp. 46, 48, 49 (D.N.H. 1997); see also, <em>Shann </em>v. <em>Dunk, </em>85 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">(67) As the Third Circuit has held, an agreement to negotiate in good faith and to keep property \u201coff the market\u201d is a contract separate and distinct from any agreement of sale. It is, therefore, enforceable in its own right, regardless of whether the parties have an enforceable agreement of sale. See <em>e.g., Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>112 F.3d at 131; <em>Channel Home Centers, supra, </em>795 F.2d at 298 &amp; n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">(68) In determining whether an agreement to negotiate in good faith exists, the court can and should look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>to the circumstances surrounding the LOI as well as the LOI itself. See <em>e.g., Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>112 F.3d at 130; <em>Channel Home Centers, supra, </em>795 F.2d at 299-300; <em>Project Development Group, supra, </em>766 F. Supp. at 1352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\">(69) In <em>Flight Systems Inc., </em>for example, the defendant made similar arguments to the ones defendants make here: that a duty of good faith could not be imposed when a letter agreement between the parties stated that it was contingent on internal approval and an executed lease document. The court rejected this argument, stating that \u201c[t]his evidence merely raises an issue of material fact; it does not preclude the claim since [plaintiff] relies not only on this letter but on [defendant\u2019s] course of conduct to argue that [defendant] agreed to negotiate in good faith.\u201d <em>Flight Systems Inc., supra, </em>112 F.3d at 131. The same is true in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">(70) GMH\u2019s evidence regarding the parties\u2019 course of conduct, including the oral agreement not to market the property to others, also distinguishes this case from the cases defendants cited at pages 25-26 of their summary judgment brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u2014In <em>Philmar Mid-Atlantic Inc. </em>v. <em>York Street Associates II, </em>389 Pa. Super. 297, 566 A.2d 1253 (1989), plaintiff relied on a letter in which a real estate agent set forth the terms he would be \u201cwilling to recommend\u201d to the owner. The court held that the letter, by its terms, did not manifest any intention to be bound by a duty to negotiate: \u201cThere is no cause of action to enforce a contract absent a mutual manifestation of assent to be bound.\u201d <em>Philmar, supra </em>at 302, 566 A.2d at 1254. In this case, however, GMH has established that there <em>was </em>a \u201cmutual manifestation of assent to be bound,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and, therefore, under normal contract law principles, there <em>is </em>an enforceable contract. The evidence here goes far beyond the terms of the letter in <em>Philmar, </em>including an LOI which set forth the essential terms of the transaction, an oral agreement to keep the property \u201coff the market,\u201d and a course of conduct which demonstrated both parties\u2019 intention to be bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u2014In <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>County of Schuylkill, </em>441 Pa. Super. 642, 645, 658 A.2d 380, 383 (1995), the letter on which the plaintiff sought to rely was a general notice that plaintiff was the prime bidder. The parties herein had not agreed to any specific terms, either in the letter or outside of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">(71) The parol evidence rule does not preclude GMH from offering evidence beyond the language of the LOI. The Pennsylvania Superior Court has specifically held that a letter of intent which does not include a merger clause and does not purport to be the parties\u2019 final agreement does not preclude the submission of evidence that the parties orally agreed not to negotiate with others. <em>Den-Tal-Ez. Inc. v. Siemens Capital Corp., </em>389 Pa. Super. 219, 242, 566 A.2d 1214, 1225 (1989). In that case, although the letter of intent did not expressly prohibit negotiations with others, \u201cthe parties were clearly free to prove the existence of other agreements relating to that subject matter, including their oral agreement that [defendant] would not negotiate with [another party] while negotiating with [plaintiff].\u201d The Superior Court further held that, given defendant\u2019s repeated assurances that it was not interested in acquiring plaintiff\u2019s competitor, plaintiff reasonably saw no need to insist on a clause in the letter of intent prohibiting dual negotiations; defendant\u2019s assurances were the \u201cunderlying premise\u201d of its negotiations with plaintiff. <em>Den-Tal-Ez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Inc. supra; </em>see also, <em>Project Development, </em>766 F. Supp. at 1352.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">(72) The court has previously found that the LOI was <em>not </em>the parties\u2019 final agreement, and it did not even purport to preclude oral modification or supplementation of its terms. The right to terminate negotiations went both ways \u2014 under the LOI, GMH also did not have an obligation to proceed, or even an obligation to perform due diligence. (See exhibit P-14.) As set forth above, Prudential recognized GMH would <em>not </em>proceed unless it could do so \u201cwithout competing negotiations with other possible suitors for this property\u201d (exhibit P-234; Glenn dep. (2/24/97), pp. 32-33), and Prudential admits it did consider the property \u201coff the market,\u201d though it now disputes what that meant. Mr. Robinson, who signed the LOI on GMH\u2019s behalf, testified that GMH did not request that an exclusivity provision be included in the LOI because Prudential insisted it wanted to use its standard LOI form. GMH relied instead on Prudential\u2019s oral assurances that the property would remain \u201coff the market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">(73) The court concludes that the agreement to keep the property \u201coff the market\u201d is not inconsistent with the provision allowing the parties to terminate negotiations at any time. The agreement is not clear about how negotiations should be terminated and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>any notice is required. Apparently, in defendants\u2019 view, negotiations were terminated if Mr. Glenn thought \u201cin my mind,\u201d they were terminated, even if Prudential continued to accept and discuss proposals and did not tell GMH it considered negotiations to be terminated. However, the testimony of both Prudential and GMH representatives supports my conclusion that notice of termination was required. The LOI does not say notice is <em>not </em>required, and certainly does not say a person can decide in his mind that negotiations are terminated while with his mouth, he continues to negotiate. An alleged intention to abandon negotiations which is neither communicated nor consistent with subsequent conduct is no abandonment at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">(74) There is no dispute that both parties considered the property \u201coff the market,\u201d and the court has found credible GMH\u2019s evidence of the very specific assurances defendants and their representatives made to GMH that they were not negotiating with anyone else. This evidence does not vary the terms of the LOI, but this evidence supplements the LOI and clarifies the terms and conditions under which negotiations would be conducted and, if necessary, terminated. Under Pennsylvania law, \u201c[w]here, as here, an ambiguity exists in the contract, parol evidence is admissible to explain, clarify or resolve the ambiguity, irrespective of whether the ambiguity is created by the language of the agreement or by extrinsic or collateral circumstances.\u201d <em>Sun Company Inc. v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, </em>708 A.2d 875, 878 (Pa. Super. 1998). This is particularly true when a party admits it made assurances which were not included in the agreement, and when the party\u2019s litigation position is inconsistent with its course of conduct after entering the agreement. <em>Sun Company Inc., supra </em>at 879. As the Pennsylvania courts have held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201cthe course of conduct of a party is always relevant in interpreting a contract and may be the strongest indication of the intention of the parties to the contract.\u201d <em>Sun Company Inc., supra </em>at 880; <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v.

The court has concluded that GMH has established each of these elements by clear and convincing evidence. The evidence which led the court to conclude that defendants were liable for fraudulent misrepresentation and nondisclosure under Counts II and III also establishes that the oral agreement of September 11, 1996 was obtained by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">(84) In particular, GMH has established by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Glenn represented to GMH that Prudential would sell GMH the property if GMH agreed to pay $107,250,000 in cash; that Mr. Glenn knew, but did not disclose to GMH, that Prudential was in the final stages of agreeing to sell the property to GSIC; that Mr. Glenn and Mr. Joseph told GMH that it has to put its acceptance of the price term in writing; that GMH agreed to Prudential\u2019s terms in reliance on the representations that Prudential would sell GMH the property on those terms; that Prudential in fact used GMH\u2019s acceptance to induce GSIC to raise the price it was willing to pay for the property and assured GSIC that notwithstanding GMH\u2019s \u201cunsolicited bid,\u201d it would honor GSIC\u2019s exclusivity; that Prudential then, when GSIC did raise the price, agreed to sell the property to GSIC; and that GMH was damaged as a result of Prudential\u2019s representations and its sale of the property to GSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">(85) \u201cThe essence of fraud is in the misrepresentation that occurs when a defendant make a bargain with no intention of living up to it.\u201d <em>American Trade Partners </em>v. <em>A-1 International Importing Enterprises, </em>755 F. Supp. 1292, 1301 (E.D. Pa. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">(86) Because Prudential obtained the oral agreement of September 11, 1996 by fraud, GMH is entitled to recover the profits it lost due to Prudential\u2019s breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of the oral agreement. The court concludes that GMH has proven with reasonable certainty that it incurred lost profits in the amount of at least $20,340,623.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">(87) GMH also seeks damages for injury to its business reputation due to Prudential\u2019s refusal to sell it the property. While GMH has not quantified these damages, the court concludes that GMH has provided a reasonable quantity of information from which this court may fairly estimate the amount of the damages. This satisfies GMH\u2019s burden of proving damages under Pennsylvania law. <em>Delahanty, supra; </em>see also, <em>AM/PM Franchise Association v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>526 Pa. 110, 584 A.2d 915(1990); <em>Miller Oral Surgery Inc. v. Dinello, </em>416 Pa. Super. 310, 320-21, 611 A.2d 232, 237-38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">(88) As set forth above, the court concludes that the evidence establishes that GMH was a successful real estate development company which had acquired over one billion dollars worth of real estate in 14 years in business, and which was poised to become a national player. Gary Holloway, GMH\u2019s owner, had a specific business plan that contemplated combining an existing GMH portfolio with the Bala property in order to be able to move to the national real estate market and, ultimately, to form an REIT. The court has found Michael Fascitelli credible when he testified that he currently heads an REIT and has years of experience in the national real estate market, and that a company which plans to move from being a regional to a national real estate player must develop a track record of closing large deals with national \u201cplayers\u201d such as Prudential. The court has also previously found Mr. Fascitelli credible when he testified that the failure to close a large deal like the Bala transaction has serious ramifications\u2014 it makes it harder for a company to receive offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>memoranda from the national \u201cplayers\u201d and to be given real consideration for large deals, because of the perception that the company could not close a deal. Although Mr. Fascitelli could not quantify the damage due to loss of reputation suffered by GMF1 as a result of failing to close the Bala deal, he testified that it was in the millions of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">(89) The court has found Mr. Fascitelli qualified as \u201can expert in the field of real estate transactions, real estate trusts and the type of custom and practice in the business entailed in a transaction such as that under consideration at this time.\u201d (Fascitelli N.T. (6/19/98), pp. 25-26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">(90) Mr. Fascitelli is qualified as an expert to testify about the impact of the failure to close the Bala transaction on GMH\u2019s plans to become a participant in the national real estate market.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">(91) The court concludes that GMH has proven that its reputation was damaged by defendants\u2019 conduct, and defendants\u2019 conduct injured GMH\u2019s ability to enter into other transactions of a type and size similar to the Bala transaction. Only the dollar amount of damages is uncertain. However, GMH has proven that the loss of just one transaction, the Bala transaction, caused it damages of more than $20 million. This gives the court a benchmark for calculating the impact on GMH of losing other similar transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">(92) The evidence allows the court to conclude that GMH lost at least one additional transaction of a type and size similar to the Bala transaction as a result of defendants\u2019 conduct. GMH may continue to lose similar transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">(93) The court concludes that the fact that GMH and its witnesses have stated that they cannot put a specific dollar figure on damages due to loss of repu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tation does not, as defendants urge, mean that these damages are unduly speculative. \u201cWhile the trier of fact may not use sheer conjecture as a basis for arriving at a verdict, it may use a measure of speculation in aiming at a verdict or an award of damages, and <em>an even greater degree of flexibility is granted in regard to testimony concerning prospective or future damages, which are at best, not always easy or certain of ascertainment and are to a large extent based on probabilities and uncertainties.\u201d Delahanty, supra </em>at 118, 464 A.2d at 1257. (emphasis added) \u201cSo then, mere uncertainty as to the amount of damages will not bar recovery where it is clear that the damages were the certain result of defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 118-19, 464 A.2d at 1257; see also, <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>520 Pa. 484, 505, 555 A.2d 58, 68 (1989), citing <em>Pashak </em>v. <em>Barish, </em>303 Pa.

Lost profits are among the damages recoverable for fraud. See <em>e.g., Scaife Co. v. Rockwell-Standard Corp., </em>446 Pa. 280, 291-92, 285 A.2d 451, 457 (1971); <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 128, 464 A.2d at 1262; <em>Lokay v. Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farmers Inc., </em>342 Pa.

Co. Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>952 F.2d 715 (3d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">(100) The court concludes that the cases defendants have cited for the proposition that a defrauded plaintiff cannot recover the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d do not preclude GMH\u2019s lost profits claim. As the Superior Court explained in <em>Lokay, </em>the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d rale precludes a plaintiff who is deceived into believing that something is worth more than it actually is from recovering damages based on its lost expectation. The rule did not preclude plaintiff in <em>Lokay </em>from recovering the salary and benefits he lost when he was fraudulently induced to leave his job; the salary and benefits were the \u201cactual loss\u201d plaintiff incurred. In the Superior Court\u2019s words:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cAt first, recovery of these losses appears to be recovery of a lost expectation, in violation of the rale that a fraud plaintiff is limited to damages for \u2018actual loss.\u2019 However, in an employment context lost future income is in fact what the plaintiff loses when he is induced to leave an otherwise ongoing position; this is not the archetypal fraud fact-pattern in which a plaintiff was tricked into buying something for more than it was worth, or selling for less than that.\u201d <em>Lokay, </em>342 Pa. Super. at 100, 492 A.2d at 410. Likewise, in this case, GMH\u2019s lost profits are part of the actual loss it incurred when Prudential sold the property to GSIC after fraudulently representing to GMH that it was not dealing with other bidders.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">(101) The court concludes that an award of damages for injury to its business reputation due to Prudential\u2019s refusal to sell it the property is too speculative in nature, but the court will consider said injury to business reputation as a factor in determining punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Count V\u2014Damages\u2014GMH v.

But the same factors which bear on whether any relief should be granted also bear on the character and extent of the remedy. In particular, relief may sometimes be limited to restitution or to damages or specific relief measured by the extent of the promisee\u2019s reliance rather than by the terms of the promise. . . . Unless there is unjust enrichment of the promisor, damages should not put the promisee in a better position than performance of the promise would have put him.\u201d <em>Travers, </em>117 Pa.

See <em>Kirkbride </em>v. <em>Lisbon Contractors Inc., </em>521 Pa. 97, 102, 555 A.2d 800, 803 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(118) Under Pennsylvania law, punitive damages need not be proportional to the compensatory damages awarded. <em>Kirkbride, supra </em>at 103, 555 A.2d at 803-804. As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained, a proportionality requirement between punitive and compensatory damages would defeat the purpose of punitive damages, which is \u201cto punish a tort-feasor for outrageous conduct and to deter him or others from similar conduct\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u201cIt is for this reason that the wealth of the tort-feasor is relevant. In making its determination, the jury has the function of weighing the conduct of the tort-feasor against the amount of damages which would deter such future conduct. In performing this duty, the jury must weigh the intended harm against the tort-feasor\u2019s wealth. If we were to adopt the appellee\u2019s theory [requiring proportionality], outrageous conduct, which only by luck results in nominal damages, would not be deterred and the sole purpose of a punitive damage award would be frustrated. If the resulting punishment is relatively small when compared to the potential reward of his actions, it might then be feasible for a tort-feasor to attempt the same outrageous conduct a second time.\u201d <em>Kirkbride, supra </em>at 103, 555 A.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">(119) Defendants\u2019 conduct was outrageous. As set forth in detail in the findings of fact herein while cultivating a relationship of trust with GMH over many months of negotiation, and while specifically assuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>GMH that they were not dealing with other prospective buyers, defendants took steps to sell the property to GSIC. Defendants\u2019 conduct was willful, and punitive damages are appropriate to punish defendants for their behavior and to deter such conduct in the future. Prudential and CB intentionally and with deceit schemed to drive up the purchase price of the Bala properties by using GMH as a pawn in their plan to play GSIC and GMH off of one another without either\u2019s knowledge. To further their scheme, defendants actively deceived GMH with their repeated assurances that it was GMH\u2019s deal. Further, defendants represented to GMH that Prudential would sell the property for a cash payment of $107,250,000 and then, when GMH agreed to that price, used GMH\u2019s agreement to obtain a higher price from GSIC. The court concludes that defendants acted with a bad motive or, at the very least, with reckless indifference to GMH\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">(120) Defendants\u2019 acts caused serious harm to GMH, including substantial lost profits on the Bala transaction itself and injury to GMH\u2019s reputation and business plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">(121) Prudential and CB Commercial are very wealthy national companies. The evidence established that Prudential\u2019s net worth, calculated according to general accepted accounting principles, is $19,718 billion. CB\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity is $157,771,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">(122) All of these factors support an award of punitive damages in this case. See <em>e.g., SHV Coal, supra. </em>In <em>SHV, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that punitive damages were recoverable based on facts comparable to those in this case. A coal broker employed by SHV accepted a job offer from one of its competitors and diverted to the competitor a contract he had solicited on behalf of SHV, in part by misrepresenting that SHV intended to close an office. The trial court awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>compensatory and punitive damages against both the coal broker and the company to which he had diverted the contract. <em>SHV, supra </em>at 491, 587 A.2d at 703. Reversing the Superior Court, which had held that there was no outrageous conduct to support an award of punitive damages, the Supreme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the award of punitive damages. <em>SHV, supra </em>at 493, 587 A.2d at 705. This included evidence that a customer was \u201cready, willing and able to give a purchase order for coal to SHV,\u201d and that the broker approached the customer when he had already accepted a job offer from SHV\u2019s competitor, but did not disclose that information to SHV. \u201cFrom this circumstantial evidence and reviewing the credibility of all the witnesses, the chancellor could conclude that but for the actions of both [the broker] and ContiCoal, the SHV-Eastman Kodak contract would have been solidified.\u201d <em>SHV, supra </em>at 496, 587 A.2d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">(123) Similarly, in <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 132, 464 A.2d at 1264, the Superior Court affirmed an award of punitive damages in an amount that was a multiple of the amount of compensatory damages. In <em>Delahanty, </em>the evidence established that the officers of the defendant bank used information provided by plaintiff in confidence to support defendant\u2019s own competing business and to injure plaintiff\u2019s business. The Superior Court agreed that this evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s conduct was outrageous and involved a bad motive. <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 132, 464 A.2d at 1264-65. The court concluded that the trial court properly considered \u201cnot only the bank\u2019s wealth but also, the outrageous conduct of the bank\u2019s officials, their motive, the relationship between the parties and the nature and extent of the harm to [plaintiffs\u2019] businesses.\u201d <em>Delahanty, supra </em>at 136, 464 A.2d at 1266; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>see also, <em>Jeannette Paper, supra </em>at 165, 548 A.2d at 327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">(124) The court concludes that Prudential is vicariously liable for punitive damages based on the actions of Mr. Glenn. As set forth above, his actions were during the course of his employment, within the scope of his duties, and done with the intent to further Prudential\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">(125) For the same reason, CB Commercial is vicariously liable for punitive damages based on the actions of Mr. Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Total Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">(126) The court concludes that the total damages recoverable by GMH in this action consist of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">(1) The sum of $20,340,623 in profits GMH would have earned had it purchased the Bala property.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">(2) The sum of $10,000,000 in punitive damages from Prudential and from CB Commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The court hereby finds in favor of plaintiff GMH Associates Incorporated in the amount of $20,340,623, plus an amount of $10,000,000 in punitive damages and against defendants The Prudential Realty Group, CB Commercial Real Estate, and Douglas Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">AMENDED VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">The court hereby finds in favor of plaintiff GMH Associates Incorporated in the amount of $20,340,623 and against defendants The Prudential Realty Group, CB Commercial Real Estate and Douglas Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The court further finds in favor of plaintiff GMH Associates Incorporated in an amount of $10,000,000 in punitive damages and against defendant The Prudential Realty Group in the amount of $7,000,000 and against defendant CB Commercial Real Estate in the amount of $3,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">And now, December 3, 1998, it is hereby ordered that judgment shall be entered on the amended verdict dated December 2, 1998 in favor of plaintiff GMH Associates Incorporated in the amount of $20,340,623 and against defendants The Prudential Realty Group, CB Commercial Real Estate and Douglas Joseph and in favor of plaintiff GMH Associates Incorporated in an amount of $10,000,000 in punitive damages and against defendant The Prudential Realty Group in the amount of $7,000,000 and against defendant CB Commercial Real Estate in the amount of $3,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">CLOUSE, <em>J., </em>February 8, 1999 \u2014 Plaintiff GMH Associates Inc. filed a complaint against The Prudential Realty Group, CB Commercial Real Estate Group and Douglas Joseph for damages arising out of the failure of a commercial real estate transaction. A trial was held before this court, sitting without a jury, on June 15 through 19, 1998, June 23 through 25, 1998 and July 22,1998. The court, in a verdict and opinion dated September 16, 1998, found in favor of plaintiff GMH Associates Inc.; said verdict was amended on December 3,1998.

The reason GMH\u2019s $107.25 million number was a higher net number than GSIC\u2019s $108.5 million number was because, in its LOI, GMH agreed to pay tenant improvements and brokers\u2019 commissions, which were $1.6 million. GSIC had no such provision in its offer. Therefore, comparing \u201capples to apples,\u201d GMH\u2019s number was $107.25 plus $1.6 million, or $108,850,000, and GSIC\u2019s was $350,000 less. (See N.T. 6/23/98 (Glenn), pp. 294-95.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\">. Alternatively, using a market comparison analysis, Mr. Geisser concluded that the total lost profits for GMH in this matter was $23,337,801. (N.T. 6/19/98, p. 164.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b317-13\">. A six-year time period was used to value the property because it was a middle time frame between how GMH usually evaluates these types of assets. (N.T. 6/19/98, p. 99.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\">. This number is composed of the purchase price, the closing costs, the acquisition fees, and the tenant improvements. Mr. Geisser then allocated these costs over the five buildings; namely Bala Three East, Bala Three West, Bala One and Bala Two (the Saks Fifth Avenue is included within the Bala Two). The allocation process was based on exhibit P-128, the document from GMH to Goldman Sachs, which set forth an analysis of the appropriate allocation. Since this document, exhibit P-128, used a total purchase price of approximately $108 million, Mr. Geisser took the relative proportion between the $108 million and the $107,250,000 and used this same proportion to allocate among the five buildings. The allocation, in terms of Bala Two, is relatively low in terms of a square footage basis because the Saks store, which makes up a large portion of Bala Two, has a very long-term lease at a low rate, and as a result, it has less inherent value. (N.T. 6/19/98, pp. 105-107.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">. Moreover, the court notes that Mr. Golboro used a lower cap rate (9.2 percent) which would have led to a higher damage valuation, while acting as a consultant in a real estate transaction that occurred in the last quarter of 1997. (N.T. 6/25/98 (Golboro), pp. 84-85.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\">. Even a written contract which specifically forbids oral modifications \u2014 which the LOI did not do \u2014 can be modified or supplemented orally if the parties clearly intended to do so.
