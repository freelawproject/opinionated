If the instrument is not void, and an action can be sustained thereon, can a suit in the name of Samuel Potts be sustained ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">1. When an attorney executes a deed or other writing in his own name, though stated to be for and in behalf of his principal, it is void, and no action can be sustained thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\">1 Swift Dig. 31; 2 Ld. Raym. 1481; 9 Coke, 77; 1 Strange, 705; 6 Johns. 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\">2.

Of this contract the defendant has ha,d the benefit. He entered and enjoyed the leased premises, and there is no justice in permitting him now to say that the contract was.void. The recitation in the covenant that the plaintiff acted in the character of an agent, does not of necessity control the other parts of the agreement. The fact is inconsistent with the personal covenants between the parties, which assume for Potts a different character; and it were safer to consider the words in reference to the agency as surplusage than to give them the effect of rendering void the contract. By adopting this construction, effect is *given to everything respecting which the parties contracted, and injury is done to no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The demurrer is overruled, judgment entered for the plaintiff, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
