Gilmore <em>v. </em>The Miami Bank and others.</parties>\n\n<summary id=\"b478-6\">This cause came before the court, by adjournment from the county of Hamilton. It was a bill in chancery, under section 59 of the law \u201cdirecting the mode of proceeding in chancery.\u201d The Miami Bank was the principal debtor, and the object of the bill was to subject certain debtors of the bank to the payment of the money due the complainants. Their whole claim, when the bill was filed, amounted to about thirteen thousand dollars. The aggregate of debts due to-the-bank from the debtors summoned amounted to about forty-five thousand dollars. W. H. Harrison made no objection to his liability. J. Burnet answered that, when served with process in 1824, he was indebted to the Miami Bank in the character of indorser; that the evidence of this debt had been long before pledged with the Bank of the United States as -collateral security, for the payment-of a debt due from the Miami Bank to that institution, and that in the month of March, 1825, he had paid the amount to the Bank of the United States.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b478-7\">Hunt, Riddle, Piatt &amp; Co. alleged that the debt due from them to the bank was paid in after bill filed by Martin Baum, a partner, not made defendant in the bill, and that consequently such, payment was available for them against the complainants. As the decree is only against the defendants here named, it is deemed unnecessary to notice the defenses of the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b478-8\">It was fully proved that the alleged payment from Martin Baum of the debt of Hunt, Riddle, Piatt &amp; Co., was by a discount in the Miami Bank of his individual note, indorsed by other members of the company.</summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b478-10\">The court ruled that when a creditor summoned the debtors of his debtor, to an excessive amount, the debtor should apply to the court to compel the complainant to select whom he would hold, and, in default of his making such selection, the court would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>assign who should be holden, and discharge the residue. That if no such application be made, all the defendants remain bound. That, if pending the suit, the summoned debtors make payment to the principal debtor, they must held liable to the complainant <em>sub </em>modo\u2014he who last paid to be first liable. It was also held that Martin Baum, not being made a party to the suit, could not affect the rights of the complainants, unless the matter had been regularly pleaded in abatement of the suit. The decree entered was in the following form, which is inserted as a document which may be \u2022useful to the profession, as a precedent, in future cases.</summary>\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b478-5\">Practice under section 59 of the act directing the mode of proceeding in chancery.</p><p id=\"AREq\">*The cause was argued by Hammond and Storer, for complainant, and by Y. Worthington, for Burnet. No argument was submitted for the other defendants.</p><p id=\"b479-5\">\u201cThis cause came on to be heard upon the bill, answer and exhibits, and arguments of counsel, which being seen and heard, the court are of opinion that the complainants are the legal owners of the judgment in the bill mentioned, rendered in favor of Samuel \u2022Sullivan, treasurer of the State of Ohio, against the president and directors of the Miami Exporting Company, and are entitled to recover of the defendants last named the sum now due thereon, amounting to twelve thousand five hundred and eighty-six dollars \u2022and twenty-three cents, being the principal and interest due on said judgment up to the 18th day of December, instant.
