The first set forth an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>indenture, made October 7,1822, between the defendant of the one part, and the plaintiff of the other part, by which the defendant conveyed to the plaintiff, for the consideration of five thousand dollars, a certain in-lot in the town of Columbus; after reciting the indenture the plaintiff further stated, \u201cthat in and by the said indenture it was further witnessed, that the said William did covenant and promise, to and with the said James, his heirs and assigns, that the said promises thereby conveyed were free and clear of all incumbrances, and that he, the said William, would warrant and truly defend the same unto the said James, and unto his heirs and assigns forever, against all claims whatsoever, which said last-mentioned covenant of the said William, contained in the said indenture, by virtue of the statute of the State of Ohio, entitled an act declaring the law in certain cases of actions upon covenants real, and for other purposes, passed January 2,1815, has the force, effect, and operation of a covenant, that he, the said William, was at the time of the making said indenture seized of a good and indefeasible estate in fee simple, in the aforegranted premises. And the said James in fact saith, that the said William was not at the time of the making said indenture, nor hath he been at any time since, seized of a good and indefeasible estate in fee simple, in the aforegranted premises, but on the contrary thereof, certain other persons, at the time of the making the said indenture, 'and continually from thence until the present time, had and still have, lawful right and title to the said premises, contrary to the form and effect of the said indenture, and of the said last-mentioned covenant therein contained, operating as aforesaid by virtue of the statute aforesaid.\u201d ^The second count was the common count upon a covenant of seizin. The defendant craved oyer of the indenture, and made it part of the record. The indenture contained, in fact, no covenant of seizin, nor other covenant except those specified in the first count, to wit: the covenant against incumbrances, and the common covenant of general warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-5\">The defendant pleaded: 1. <em>Non est factum; </em>2. That the premises were free and clear of all incumbrances, and that defendant had well and truly warranted and defended, etc.;. 3. That defendant was seized of an indefeasible estate in fee, etc.; 4. That the plaintiff, on October 7,1822 (the same day on which the deed in the declaration mentioned was executed), in consideration of five thousand dollars, sold and conveyed to the defendant the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>in-lot, by deed, with full covenants of seizin, general warranty, etc.; 5.

Because the statute referred to in the declaration, is wholly void for its uncertainty; 2. If the statute means anything it is a declaratory act, reviving the old remedy of <em>warrantia charted </em>\u2014 which could only be sustained, before eviction, by the tenant of the freehold, which tenancy ought to be set forth in the declaration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-7\">Ewing, for the plaintiff, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-8\">*By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The doctrine settled at this term, in the case of Adm\u2019rs of Bacchus <em>v. </em>McCoy, decides this case.
