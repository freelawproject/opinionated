The objection to the account allowing the receiver the amount paid to the agent for collecting the rents in question, namely, forty dollars and fifty-two cents, should, therefore, have been sustained. The order appealed from is, therefore, modified by sustaining the exception so far as this sum of forty dollars and fifty-two cents is* concerned, and charging the receiver with that amount, and as so modified affirmed, without costs.
