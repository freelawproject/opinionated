That defendant is not resident of this State, and has no property therein. That one Nicholas A. Den, of Santa Barbara, and now in this city, is indebted to said defendant in an amount exceeding $1500, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-9\">On the 15th January, the court ordered said Den to appear before Galbreath (the referee) to answer concerning the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-10\">On the 16th, Den appeared as directed before the referee, who being sworn, said, that in January, 1850, he purchased of said John Davis apiece of land in Stockton, California, for $8000, or $9000, cash in hand, and an annuity to him and his wife of \u00bf\u00a3300 sterling a year, payable semi-annually, in July and January, at Liverpool, England, during their natural lives ; that he had paid the first half-year\u2019s annuity. As near as he could then know, there was due by him, on the 2d January, 1852, the sum of $1500; that he had off-sets against said Davis for the whole of the first year\u2019s annuity. The referee ordered that the said $1500 be applied to the satisfaction of the said judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>against the said John Davis, in favor of the said Parsons, administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\">On the 12th January, on motion of Mr. Emmett, the court allowed defendant to appear and answer to the merits, and that all proceedings under the judgment be stayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">The defendant answering denied, that on the 13th April, 1850, the said 0. Swanson recovered the sum of $5815 against him, and denies that there is any judgment in the Court of First Instance, as alleged in the said complaint; or that, if a judgment, as alleged, is against him, he had no previous notice thereof, or of any suit, &amp;c., to recover the same. And denies that he is indebted to the said plaintiff in any sum whatever; and denies that Parsons is the administrator, &amp;c., or entitled to sue or recover the said alleged judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\">On the 3d August, 1852, the court, sitting as a jury, found that Parsons was the administrator, &amp;c., of Swanson, and that judgment was entered in favor of Swanson against Davis, in the Court of First Instance, on the 13th April, 1850, for $5815; and ordered, that the judgment heretofore entered in this case, on the 13th January, 1852, for $6852, be confirmed, and stand as the judgment in this cause in all particulars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\">The record of the Court of First Instance, accompanying the record of the District Court, shows that on the 13th April, 1850, Charles Swanson filed his complaint, in which he states, that about the 25th September last, Robert Swanson, as his agent, entered into a contract with one John Davis, that if he would build upon lots of Davis\u2019s, in Stockton, three houses, that the land and houses should be owned in common between them. That in consideration thereof, he built the houses to the said Davis\u2019s satisfaction. That Davis, not regarding the contract, sold the lots and houses for $5000 cash down, and an annuity of a large amount, to be paid to him and his wife. That Davis had not accounted to him for his interest in said lots, but sold the same with intent to cheat and defraud the complainant of his property, to his damage $10,000. That Davis has gone out of the jurisdiction of this court; and prays that process may issue, and that publication be had of this proceeding, commanding said Davis to appear and answer this complaint, and that judgment, to the amount of the damages, be rendered against him, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Robert Swanson, being sworn, testified that the facts set forth in the complaint were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\">On the 27th February, 1850, the court ordered that publication of the proceedings be made in a newspaper published in San Francisco, commanding said Davis to appear and answer, &amp;c., and that a rule be entered to take the depositions of going witnesses before T. Smith, Esq., one of the commissioners of this court, to be read on the trial of this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">The notice as directed was published in the \u201c Pacific News,\u201d of which proof appears upon the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">On the 13th April, 1850, judgment was entered for the plaintiff, for $5815.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-7\"><em>Parsons, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-8\">The judgment is in accordance with the statute, sects. 179 to 181 inclusive, Prac. Act. The judgment of the Court of First Instance is good. The court had authority under the laws of Mexico to render such judgment. Zamiego Practicis Forencio, vol. i. p. 211; for translation, see note B, 1 Hill, 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-9\">From this judgment the appellant had two years to appeal, and not having appealed, he is bound by it. Stat. 1850, Act to supersede certain courts, p. 77, sec. 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-10\">An appeal brings up no more than a writ of error at common law. 3 Sandford, 593.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-11\">Note B, above referred to, is thus given :\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-12\">\u201c When the person cannot be found, the place where he is gone to is not known, or if those to be cited are numerous and uncertain, the citation shall be made by advertisement (or notices) affixed in public (conspicuous) places of the jurisdiction (tribunal), and its neighborhood, and inserting them in the official bulletins, in the Gazette, or other periodicals.\u201d Elements Practica Forense, vol. i. 211.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-13\">No brief for the appellant on file.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b416-14\">Heydenfeldt, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Aze\">delivered the opinion of the court. Murray, Chief Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">This was an action upon a judgment of the Court of First Instance, the records of which belong to the District Court. The judgment which was the basis of this suit, was rendered without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>any personal service on the defendant, and indeed without any service which by the laws then in force could be deemed an equivalent for personal service., There is, therefore, no dispute that the judgment of the Court of First Instance is invalid, and insufficient to sustain the present judgment, provided that the record of the first-mentioned judgment is properly brought before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">This has been done by a certiorari from this court, and it is insisted by the respondent that it should have been made part of the record of this cause by a statement of it as evidence, or a bill of exceptions. The sole object of a bill of exceptions is to make a record of the special action of the court of what is not record by the general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">By such action it attains the sanction and verity which enables the revising court to consider it. But that which is a record already, cannot receive any higher degree of sanction by being made record a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Where, therefore, it appears from the declaration that the court below must render judgment simply by an inspection of its own records, it is obviously the most proper mode upon an appeal, to bring up the latter by a certiorari, in order that it may receive the construction of the appellate court, which is the only object of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">[The above opinion was filed December 5, 1853. December 12, an elaborate petition was filed for a rehearing of the case, and on the same day the court ordered all proceedings to be stayed until the petition could be heard.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
