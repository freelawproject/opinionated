When, however, the plaintiff named the amount of grapes which he would take under the offer of the defendant, the contract was complete, and both parties were bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The court below, therefore, erred in deciding for the defendant, and the judgment is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
