' The first ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>for the motion is not well taken. The bond seems to me substantially to conform to the requisitions of the act, and no variation has been pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The succeeding grounds are based upon the action of the court in the case in which the bond was given. The errors of that case, if any, cannot be reviewed in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with ten per cent, damages and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
