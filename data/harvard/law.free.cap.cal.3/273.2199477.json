Plaintiffs, therefore pray that defendant may be compelled to pay the amount of rent due, $280; and damages for holding over; and for a writ of restitution for the said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">The defendant\u2019s answer admits possession of the premises; the lease of 21st February, from Peralta to Payot and Dessassier; the transfers to him by the latter on the 20th October, and by the former on the 21st October, 1851; that on the 23d October, said Peralta transferred to the plaintiffs the said lease; and that defendant has had, and still holds the possession, and claims the sole right to the said premises under said lease; and says that he went into possession under the lease from Peralta, and the transfers thereof; and denies that he holds over the premises contrary to the conditions and covenants thereof.

And denies that there was due to the plaintiffs the rent ($420) claimed by them; that $140, part of said sum of $420, was not due till the 21st instant, several days after the commencement of this suit; and said defendant now tenders and brings into court, the said receipts and acquittances, and the sums of money heretofore tendered to the plaintiffs as aforesaid; and also tenders and brings into court the sum of $280, in full satisfaction of the rent due the plaintiffs; and prays judgment against the plaintiffs, and denies all allegations of the complaint not admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\">The Justice found the defendant not guilty of unlawful detainer, and that plaintiffs pay the costs.

The defendant admitted the cutting of the trees, &amp;c., but justified under the lease assigned to him as set forth in his answer; and avers that the lease was made in view to the use of the timber for making charcoal, and that the premises were so used by his assignors, with the knowledge of Peralta, the original lessor, under whom plaintiffs claim. Proof of the above facts was objected to, on the ground that it would contradict the lease from Peralta to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Dessassier and Payot, but was admitted by the referee; and plaintiffs counsel excepted.

If such rents as were claimed by defendant, were due to him, the acquittances were no tender; coin only, and not paper, debts, notes, &amp;c., is good as a tender.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-15\">But no such note was due; the lease to plaintiffs, from the assignees of the defendant, of January 23d, 1851, guaranteed a certain piece of ground in said Encinal, \u201c <em>free from all incumbrances.\u201d </em>In this covenant, the lessors and their assignee, the defendant, failed, as there were prior incumbrances, two leases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>from Peralta, which were retained till transferred by Peralta to plaintiffs in October, 1851.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">Can the defendant assume an indebtedness, which is totally denied, and apply it, not as a set-off, but as a legal tender, and this upon a debt due the plaintiffs and not denied?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">Our purchase of the fee, October 1851, from our landlord, merged the lesser title, ended the lease, and stopped the rent. But if the rent was apportioned, and the plaintiffs charged in accordance with the respective interests under the lease of January 23d, 1851, it could not be used as a tender.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">The payment of $280 with costs was withdrawn ; if good as a tender it was not <em>kept good.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">Under the statute, it is an unlawful holding, <em>\u201c </em>where any holder shall hold over after the- rent shall be due, and remain unpaid for the space of three days;\u201d and the justice, after judgment, is directed to give a writ of restitution, as in other cases. See sect. 13, p. 420, statutes of 1850. And if restitution is not to follow the breach of defendant\u2019s covenants, and if a tenant may commit waste, and pay no rent, and continue to enjoy, &amp;c., the summary remedy sought to be provided by the statute is of little avail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">The provisions of the statute are entirely independent of the common law, and the directions in the proceeding are plain, without any reference thereto; no \u00a1provision requires a clause of re-entry, nor demand before sunset on the day the rent falls due, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">If the proceedings are substantially correct, no objections to form will be regarded; 2 Bibb, 431; Barrett <em>v. </em>Chitwood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-10\">A tenant holding over, even on a parol lease, is not <em>entitled </em>to notice to quit before the emanation of the warrant; 4 Bibb, 524; 11 Wend. 616; 6 Hill, 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-11\">By the same reasoning, a tenant holding over contrary to any other provision of the law, is entitled to notice, before a warrant can emanate, and writ of restitution issue, and our statute fixes, the notice to be three days.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-12\">A covenant to pay rent is the very basis of the tenure in almost every lease.

In August, 1850, Dessassier and Basquit went into possession of the Encinal, under a verbal lease from Peralta for five years, for the purpose of cutting wood and making charcoal. A lease was drawn, but was never executed. In November, 1850, Basquit quit the concern, and retired, when Maitre took his place, who, with Dessassier, continued the business. On the 23d, Dessassier and Maitre leased to Chipman and Aughenbaugh a certain part of the Encinal for four years and a half, from the 1st February, 1851. Maitre retired, and Payot came into his place, and on the 21st February, 1851, the lease on the record from Peralta to Dessassier and Payot were executed. The cutting of wood and making of charcoal were continued by them and their successors until they were enjoined by the plaintiffs, about the 1st November, 1851. \u2022 The respondent soon after this acquired an interest in the lease, and subsequently the whole was transferred to him, with the consent of Peralta.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">On the 2'6th March, 1851, the appellants procured from Dessassier, Emeric, and Payot, their confirmation of the sub-lease from Dessassier and Maitre to them, made 1st February, 1851, by endorsement, viz., \u201cThe written lease'is hereby confirmed by us this day, we having become the lessors of the within-described ground from Don Antonio Peralta.

The lease contains no clause of re-entry for this cause; the payment of rent is not made a condition of the tenure, it is a mere covenant, and no rule of law, statutory or common, works a forfeiture for this more than any other debt owing to his landlord. Such termination of a tenancy can only arise under an express agreement of the parties.

At common law, waste was punishable when committed by guardian in chivalry, tenant in dower, or tenant by the curtesy, because their estates were created by act of law; but where the tenant came in by demise, and could have provided against it, and did not, it was his own default. The remedy was extended to tenants for life and for years by the Stat. of Marlbridge, 52 Henry III. c. 23, and of Gloucester, 6 Edw. 1, c. 5. By the latter, the forfeiture did not extend to the whole premises, but to the place where the waste was committed. 2 Bla. Com. 282, 283, 286.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">The Stat. of Gloucester is not in force here.

Murray, Chief Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The appellants say that the estate of the defendant (a term for years) is forfeited, for two reasons: first, for the non-payment of rent; 2d, for the commission of waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">At common law, there was no forfeiture upon either of these grounds. It was only by the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Ed. 1, that the remedy of forfeiture was given for waste, and it was then expressly confined to the place wherein the waste was committed. 2 Black. 283. Our statute confines the remedy to the recovery of treble damages. Laws, 566, 52, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In reference to the first point, I can come to no other conclusion, than that, by the 13th section of the act concerning forcible entries and unlawful detainers, it was the intention of the legislature to make the non-payment of rent work a forfeiture of the estate of the tenant. In order to effect this, however, it must be held necessary to pursue tjhe same strictness as is required at common law to work a forfeiture, where there are stipulations in the contract of lease to that effect. The rent must be demanded on the day it becomes due, and at a late hour of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">See the case of Jackson <em>v. </em>Harrison, 17 J. R. 66, and the cases there cited. Adams on Ejectment, 160. Gaskill <em>v. </em>Trainer* decided at the present term of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The record in this case discloses no demand whatever of the rent, and it follows there can be no forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
