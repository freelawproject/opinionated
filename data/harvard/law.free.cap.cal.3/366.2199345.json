See statutes 1851, pp. 165-167.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">The complaint avers that the defendant kept a gaming-house in Sacramento City, with more than three gaming-tables, in which banking games, and games having a percentage, were played during a period of three months, and had thereby become liable to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $500, under the statute, which he had refused to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-9\">The defendant demurred, on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-10\">The demand was sustained, and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-11\"><em>Carlton, </em>District Attorney, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-12\">The common law of England was adopted in this State, 13th April, 1850, and the keeping of a common gaming-house is indictable at common law: 1 Russel on Crimes, 323. The civil action is not merged in the misdemeanor created by the statute, though it is in a felony: 10 Wheat. 473; 1 Chitty\u2019s Genl. Prac. 10, 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-13\">We say that whenever a legal liability to pay money is created, whether by statute or at common law, a civil action to recover it will lie, in the name of \u2018the person to whom it is due. The statute requires any person keeping gaming-tables, to pay a certain sum for the privilege. It is in the nature of a license tax. See Addison\u2019s Rep. 312; 2 Greenl. 404; 6 N. H. 499 ; 1 N. H. 20; U. S. Dig. p. 271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-14\">Taxes may be recovered, though no action is given by statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>and this, though distress may lie: 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 383 ; 2 Roch. 61. The same principle is held, 3 Mason, 324; 1 Mason, 482; 5 Mass. 326; 2 Conn. 215; 1 U. S. Dig. 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-3\">Where a statute provides for the payment of money, and gives no means to enforce it, an action at law will lie: Cowper, 474; and see 1 Doug. 10, n. 2; 19 Yt. (4 Wash.) 621; 2 Cranch, 236 ; 4 Washington C. 0. 106.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-4\">No brief for respondent is found with the record.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b359-5\">Heydenfeldt, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Afi\">delivered the opinion of the court. Murray, Chief Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The defendant was the keeper of a common gaming-house, and this action was for the amount required by law for a license, which the defendant had neglected to obtain. It was decided by this court, in the case of \u201c The People <em>v. </em>Craycroft,\u201d that such an action could not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The statute re-enacts the common law, in making this evil occupation a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment, and the license is proposed as a sort of compromise for the offence, doubtless with the hope of regulating and thereby diminishing the bad influence of a vice which it is impossible to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The failure to obtain the license, leaves the party as he would have been at common law, a public wrong-doer, and subject to indictment and punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
