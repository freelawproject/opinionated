The witness (agent of Chapman) testified that the delivery to Chapman of the flour was separate. He considered the transaction joint only so far as the purchase was concerned. The delivery to M\u2019Gilvery was separate, and the payment separate. At each delivery Chapman paid the purchase-money, to the satisfaction of the parties. The written contract was cancelled, so far as Chapman was concerned, by the witness as agent of Chapman. <em>u </em>I suppose as far as he is concerned, the matter is entirely closed. Chapman claims nothing from defendants.\u201d The contract was cancelled at the suggestion of Brown (a clerk of defendants). The understanding between M\u2019Gilvery and Chapman was made before the written contract was signed; could not say that Moorhead knew of it, nor that this understanding was part of the agreement with Moorhead. (It was in evidence that the contract was made with Moorhead, one of the defendants.) There was no contract with defendants as regards this understanding. Subsequent to the execution of the written contract, witness told the defendants of this private understanding, and told them that Chapman, instead of paying $10 for the flour, should only pay $8 75 per sack; they insisted on payment of the $10, but Waddington said that he had money of M\u2019Gilvery\u2019s in his hands, and in the final settlement would protect Chapman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">On his cross-examination the witness said the words \u201c can-celled on my part,\u201d written on the original agreement, were written by me (Chapman\u2019s agent), at the suggestion of Brown (defendants\u2019 clerk).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The foregoing is the substance of the evidence adduced by the plaintiff bearing on the question considered in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">After the plaintiff had closed, the defendants moved for a non-suit, on the ground that Chapman was a necessary party to the suit, and that the evidence of plaintiff did not sustain his action; which the court overruled, and left it to the jury to say whether Chapman had any remaining interest in the action, and charged, if they found that Chapman had any interest, to find for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">The jury found for plaintiff $ for which judgment was entered, and defendants moved for a new trial, which the court ordered, and from this order plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-6\"><em>Hastings </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">It was understood between the parties, that each party purchaser to the contract was to have a certain portion of the flour, and that Chapman had received his portion and accounted for it with plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8\">The written contract was cancelled, so far as Chapman was concerned, and he had no interest in it.
