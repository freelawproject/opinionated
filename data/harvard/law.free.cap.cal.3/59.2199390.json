Admitting this deed is not void for uncertainty, it can only convey an undivided half of said lot. The exact portion conveyed is not set forth by any metes or bounds, by means of which it can be separated or distinguished from the remainder. It therefore follows that Ramirez took as tenant in common with Bujan, and Bujan having afterwards sold his remaining interest to O\u2019Donnell, Lick, the present plaintiff, xvho claims under Ramirez from Bujan, and O\u2019Donnell, hold as tenants in common, being seised for themselves, and for each other; consequently, this action cannot be maintained against O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Before the plaintiff can obtain any relief, he must resort to a court of equity, for a partition of the land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Judgment reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
