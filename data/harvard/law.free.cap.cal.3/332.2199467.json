That the fourth part of the crop so raised, for which rent is due, will amount to about 3000 bushels, and the present value of potatoes in the market is <em>$2 </em>50 per bushel, which plaintiff is about to lose\" by defendant\u2019s refusal to deliver the same, and by his fraudulent removal of them without payment of rent to plaintiff, and prays for an injunction to restrain the defendant from \u2022 removing and disposing of the potatoes, and for a receiver to take charge of, and sell them, and account, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The court granted the injunction, and appointed a receiver until further order thereon, and afterwards, upon the demurrer of defendant and divers causes filed by him, the injunction was dissolved, and plaintiff appealed from the order directing the dissolution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-4\"><em>J. Wilson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">There is no answer filed by defendant, and of course the intention to defraud the plaintiff is admitted. If there were good causes of demurrer, an answer should have been put in denying the fraud. See Daniel\u2019s Ch. Prac. 375, 653; 9 Yes. 87; Mitford E. PI. 216, note (f); 3 Paige, 277 and 273; Story Eq. Plead. 464-5, and sect. 605. Charges of fraud shut out a demurrer: 1 Dan. Ch. 375; lb. 653. If the demurrer is not to the whole bill, it ought to specify which part, and if it does not, it is not good, and must be overruled. 2 Paige, 574; lb. 414; 6 lb. 57; 1 Johns. Ch. 57. Demurrer bad in part is bad in the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">The injunction was properly granted on the allegation of the petition, that the rents were due, demanded, and refused, with a view to defraud plaintiff, and where this stands admitted by the pleadings, it is good cause for granting an injunction. Amotion to dissolve without answer, admits every allegation with their legal conclusions. The motion to dissolve was improperly sustained. 2 Sto. Eq. PI. 168, sects. 845, 710, 711, 717, 718, 721, and 722.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-7\"><em>Sloan, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">When the bill was filed, defendant was in the act of gathering his crop. It does not show how much had been gathered, how much in the ground, or that defendant was irresponsible. There was no existing cause of action, as is apparent from the terms of the lease, when the suit was brought; the demand for rent was premature; no <em>petitiam affectionis, </em>as to the potatoes, is shown to exist; no insolvency on the part of the defendant, or other probable cause of loss, or irreparable injury to the appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-9\">Heydenfeldt, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">delivered the opinion of the court. Wells, Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>To obtain the injunction in this case, it was necessary for the bill of complaint to aver either the insolvency of the defendant, or that he is without any tangible property which could be made the subject of attachment or execution. Without either of these averments, the bill is too defective to sustain the order for an injunction and receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The order of dissolution is affirmed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
