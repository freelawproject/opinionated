A. Campbell, the rule to show cause why the judgment by default, entered 14th December, should not be set aside, rule having been argued by Clarke for defendant, and Halliday for plaintiff, it is ordered that the said rule be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">September 24,1852, defendant appealed to the District Court, from the judgment of said County Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">And in the District Court, the judgment of the County Court was affirmed the 2d October, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">And defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-9\">Clarke, Taylor, and <em>Sickle, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">The summons emanated from the District Court, and cited defendant to appear there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-11\">The <em>place </em>of the service does not appear, and therefore it is impossible to say whether the default should be taken at the end of 10, 20, or 40 days. Prac. Act., sect. 25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-12\">The sheriff\u2019s return is not in conformity to the statute, for it does not state the place of service: \u00a7 34 Prac. Act; nor in its indication of the time of answering : sect. 33. If the time for answering had expired, then the mode of obtaining judgment was irregular: ib. sect. 150. The clerk in this case should have entered the default, and the court, upon application, should have heard the proofs,\u2014this action calling for special relief,\u2014but the court ordered judgment for the amount claimed: ib.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-13\">The amount of costs was left at large, and not specified in the judgment, and is therefore void. If a judgment is uncertain as to the amount, and as to the time of rendition, it is invalid: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Miner, 5; Jones <em>v. </em>Acre ; 4 Munf. 262; 2 Penn. 1004; 5 Halst. 288; 2 A.

A. Campbell, Judge of the County Court, and defendant was required to appear there: M\u2019Cormaclt <em>v. </em>Meason, 1 Ser. &amp; Raw.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-6\">As to the omission of the <em>place </em>of service, see sect. 33 of the Prac. Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-7\">The case comes under the 1st sect, of the Prac. Act, being <em>\u201cfor the recovery of money </em>therefore the default was regularly entered; see sect. 150.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">The judgment was for $124 75, and as there was no bill of costs filed, defendant has nothing to complain of; he could have paid that amount and the clerk\u2019s fees, and plaintiff could claim no more, not having filed his bill of costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">The seal of the County Court was to the writ, and it proves itself. Defendant could not have been misled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-10\">The endorsement of service by the counsel waived all irregularities. 5 Hon. Pr. Rep. 233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-11\">No motion was made to open or set aside the judgment by defendant, from 24th December, 1851, until September, 1852.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-12\">If the objections were good as between plaintiff and defendant, they will not at this day be suffered to disturb a judgment upon which the title of another depends. See 6 Watts &amp; Sergt. 506.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-13\">\u25a0 The record shows the judgment satisfied, it cannot therefore be disturbed. 14 Johns. 468.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-14\">Wells, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AjR\">delivered the opinion of the court. Heydenfeldt, Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">Suit was brought in the County Court of San Francisco County, to enforce a <em>mechanic\u2019s lien. </em>The summons was served by the sheriff, upon Clarke, Taylor, and Bickle, who undertook, as attorneys for Brannan, to accept service. The attorneys sign the acceptance of service, but attach no date; the sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>return, however, shows service to have been made on the 13th December, 1851. No answer was filed, and a default was taken on the 24th December, and a judgment entered for the plaintiff. From the judgment of the County Court, defendant appealed to the District Court, where judgment was affirmed; the case is now brought to this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The memorandum of \u201cDistrict Court,\u201d at the top of the summons, was no part of the writ. It was issued out of the County Court, and tested by the Hon. A. Campbell, Judge of the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The place where the writ was served is not stated, but the Court should,have assumed, as it was directed to the Sheriff of San Francisco, and as it was returned by him served, that it was served within his jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The form of this summons is at least substantially good, and sufficiently indicates the time when the defendant was required to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It appears that default was entered, and that thereupon the court rendered judgment for $124 75. Whether or not the court received and heard any testimony, does not appear. But it is a settled rule that every presumption is in favor of the conclusion, that a public officer, and particularly a judicial officer, has acted regularly. Nothing appearing to the contrary, we presume the Judge of the County Court informed himself as to the matter of complaint, in a proper and regular manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The judgment finds the amount of the claim, and we do not think its validity impaired by not finding the amount of costs, which, at the time of the rendition of judgment, are not generally taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
