D.1853, in open court, of said Court of Sessions, to answer to said indictment in said undertaking named,\u201d \u201cand then and there the hereunto annexed undertaking was declared operative.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">Defendants appeared and demurred to the complaint, for divers causes set forth, among others : That the complaint does not show that any valid indictment was found by any legally constituted tribunal; by what authority the accused had been admitted to bail, nor where, or upon whom, she committed an assault, &amp;c. The undertaking does not stipulate a time or place or tribunal before which the accused should appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">The court after hearing the case overruled the demurrer, and gave judgment in favor of plaintiffs, for $3000 and interest, from which defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-7\">Sanders, <em>Edwards, </em>and <em>English, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">The averment that an indictment was found, &amp;c., does not establish that it was found by a grand jury, or that it was in writing, preferred upon oath. 4 Black. Com. 299; Statute of 1851,234 and 206. The law declares before whom bail shall be taken. See statutes, sects. 265, 268, p. 269 ; and how forfeiture shall be declared, sect. 3, 535, lb.; and the mode of proceeding thereon, sect. 537 ; with which provisions the averments of the complaint do not correspond.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b264-9\">Heydenfeldt, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AMI\">delivered the opinion of the court. Murray, Chief Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The declaration in this case is too defective to support the judgment. The bond given was to appear and answer an indictment ; there is no averment that any indictment was found or pending. Une of the conditions is for her appearance in whatever court the indictment, \u201c may be prosecuted;\u201d there is no averment in what court it was prosecuted, but only a loose statement that she was called in \u201cthe said Court of Sessions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Without referring to any other defects, these pointed out are sufficient to show, that the demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Judgment reversed, and case remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
