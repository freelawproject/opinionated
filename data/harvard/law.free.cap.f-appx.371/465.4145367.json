Moreno argues that the district court erred in determining that he was unable to challenge his federal conviction under \u00a7 2241 and dismissing his petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-21\">\u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). There is no merit to Moreno\u2019s assertions that his claims of jurisdictional defect or actual innocence are independently cognizable under \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a); <em>Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. Moreno has also not shown that his claim of actual innocence provides an exception to the requirement that a petitioner first satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) in order to challenge his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">Accordingly, Moreno must meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) to raise his claims under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Moreno bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cthe remedy by motion [under \u00a7 2255] is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Moreno must demonstrate that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense by virtue of a recently-decided, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Cf. Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904-06 (5th Cir.2001). As he has not done so, the district court did not err in concluding that Moreno could not bring his claims under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The district court also did not err in dismissing Moreno\u2019s petition for want of jurisdiction. Although Moreno\u2019s claims could have been raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see id. </em>at 451, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider his claims under \u00a7 2255 as it was not the court that sentenced him. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Moreno nonetheless argues that the district court should have transferred his petition to a district in which jurisdiction would have been proper. Moreno has not suggested why the interest of justice would be served by transfer instead of dismissal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Moreno also argues that the district court failed to give him advance notice that it intended to construe his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Even if the district court construed his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion without providing advance notice, there is no reversible error because Moreno\u2019s pleading will not be considered a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of the second or successive restrictions of \u00a7 2255(h). <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
