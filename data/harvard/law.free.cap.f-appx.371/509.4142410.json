He argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether the defendant was aware of, or should have been aware of, the threat to his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">Morris commenced this action against Mattie Collins, a captain at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility. He asserted that while he was in line for dinner a large inmate named Danny Irby got in front of him and attempted to take his food tray. Morris stopped him but then Irby pushed him and threatened him, saying he was going to beat him up and bite him once they returned to the zone. Morris contended that Collins saw and heard this incident but did nothing to stop it even though he looked directly at her when he left the dining hall. Irby attacked Morris after they had returned to their housing unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">Via affidavit, Collins asserted that while she was standing outside the dining hall she observed Morris and Irby arguing. She did not hear any threats and did not observe any physical contact between the two men. She approached them and told them to stop it and sit down. They complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence shows that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)(2). To establish an Eighth Amendment claim for failure to protect, an inmate must show that a prison official\u2019s act or omission resulted in his being incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm and that the prison official was deliberately indifferent to his safety. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">Morris asserted in his verified complaint that Collins saw and heard everything that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>happened in the dining hall. The eonclusional assertion that Collins heard the alleged threat from Irby is not within Morris\u2019s personal knowledge and, therefore, does not constitute competent summary judgment evidence. <em>See Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 240 n. 6 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, Morris has not shown that a material issue of fact exists regarding Collins\u2019s assertion that she did not hear any threats made. Because the evidence does not show that Collins knew of and deliberately disregarded an excessive risk to Morris\u2019s safety, the district court did not err in denying Morris\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Newton v. Black, </em>133 F.3d 301, 308 (5th Cir.1998); Neals. <em>v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Morris\u2019s motions for leave to supplement the record on appeal and to file a supplemental brief are DENIED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 28.4; <em>Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
