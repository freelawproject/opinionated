While Hills does not dispute that his original sentence was based on the application of a statutory mandatory-minimum term, he argues that his mandatory-minimum sentence is invalid because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), rejected any mandatory regime, including mandatory-minimum sentences. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hills\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). A district court may modify a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced ... <em>based on </em>a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). In such a case, the court,may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction is not consistent with applicable policy statements and is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the \u201ceffect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Amendment 706, which applies retroactively, amends the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). However, a defendant who was originally sentenced based on a statutory minimum is not eligible for relief under Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Furthermore, this Court has held that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>are not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">We have also recognized that proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Therefore, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>As such, we cannot review Hills\u2019s arguments concerning the constitutionality of mandatory-minimum sentencing, or the court\u2019s imposition of a ten-year mandatory-minimum sentence rather than a five-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Because Hills was originally sentenced based on a statutory mandatory minimum that was not affected by Amendment 706, the district court lacked authority to grant his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
