Morales challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-27\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWe review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness,\u201d <em>id., </em>and we use a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>step process. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we must \u201c 'ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Gall <em>v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we find the sentence to be procedurally sound, the second step is to review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">The district court sentenced Morales to 24-months imprisonment, the statutory maximum. She contends that the district court committed a procedural error by failing to explain why a shorter sentence was not sufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Morales has failed to show that her sentence was procedurally unreasonable. The district court was required to adequately explain the sentence it actually imposed \u2014 not explain why every other sentence it could have imposed was inadequate. <em>See United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that a procedural error occurs when a district court fails to \u201cadequately explain the <em>chosen </em>sentence\u201d) (emphasis added). The district court explained that it was sentencing Morales to the statutory maximum because it had given her break after break, and she had failed to take advantage of any of them. Instead, Morales repeatedly violated the terms of her supervised release. That explanation was sufficient. We conclude that no procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Morales' also challenges the substantive reasonableness of her sentence. She contends that her 24-month sentence was substantively unreasonable because of her personal history and characteristics. Moreover, she argues that her sentence was unreasonable because she violated the terms of her supervised release by committing Grade C violations. Because the sentencing guidelines do not require revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release for Gi*ade C violations, she asserts that sentencing her to the statutory maximum was unreasonable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2) (stating that \u201c[u]pon a finding of a Grade C violation, the court <em>may </em>(A) revoke probation or supervised release; or (B) extend the term of probation or supervised release and/or modify the conditions of supervision\u201d) (emphasis added). We cannot say that sentencing Morales to 24-months imprisonment was unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Morales engaged in a pattern of non-compliant behavior while on supervised release and while awaiting sentencing. The district court gave due consideration to Morales\u2019 personal history and characteristics by recommending that she receive mental health and substance abuse treatment while in prison. Morales has failed to show that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
