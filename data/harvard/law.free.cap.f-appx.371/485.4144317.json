California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Rodriguez-Duberney has filed a response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Rodriguez-Duberney\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal. This court has previously issued decisions holding that Rodriguez-Duberney\u2019s prior conviction under the Travel Act constituted a drug trafficking offense for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines. Rodriguez-Duberney has not shown that these decisions should be revisited despite the law of the case doctrine because \u201cthe earlier decision[s are] clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320 and n. 3 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
