Brandt and Orestes Lopez sued Defendants Magnificent Quality Florals Corporation and Mois\u00e9s Sanchez to recover overtime wages that Defendants allegedly owed them under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-216. Plaintiffs, who were employed by Defendants, each claimed that Defendants did not pay them for the time they worked which exceeded forty hours per week, as required by the Act. The case was tried to a jury before a magistrate judge. A jury awarded damages of $604.26 to Plaintiff Brandt (which was doubled to $1,208.52 with liquidated damages), but awarded no damages to Plaintiff Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Thereafter, Defendants filed two motions for sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees against the Plaintiffs and their counsel. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs committed perjury, that the case was a fraud perpetrated upon the court, and that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not investigate their clients\u2019 claims. Moreover, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that Defendants\u2019 counsel presented an improper closing argument by engaging in personal attacks on Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, referring to evidence that the magistrate judge had excluded from trial, and making outrageous statements. The magistrate judge denied both motions. (R. 4-132, 135.) Plaintiffs appeal, challenging the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial, and Defendants cross-appeal, challenging the denial of their motions for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">We review the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Millennium Partners, L.P. v. Colmar Storage, LLC, </em>494 F.3d 1293, 1301 (11th Cir.2007). Likewise, we review the magistrate judge\u2019s decision denying sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>SCADIF, </em>S.A. <em>v. First Union Nat\u2019l, </em>344 F.3d 1123, 1130 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Mut. Serv. Ins. Co. v. Frit Indus., Inc., </em>358 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">Although the magistrate judge noted that the arguments made by Defendants\u2019 counsel were improper, she found that counsel\u2019s \u201ccomments, viewed in the context of the totality of the case, did not affect substantial justice, and do not rise to the level at which a new trial is appropriate.\u201d (R. 4-135 at 4-5.) With respect to Defendants\u2019 motions for sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees, the magistrate judge found that although the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were weak, \u201cthey were not frivolous.\u201d (R. 4-132 at 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">After review, we find that the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial or in denying Defendants\u2019 motions for sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">The closing argument of Defendants\u2019 counsel was improper in several respects, but no objections to the argument were voiced at the time. While the magistrate judge should have intervened and curtailed this improper argument, we find no abuse of discretion in the decision to deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial because we find the magistrate judge\u2019s reasons for denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion persuasive. And, while we find the Plaintiffs\u2019 case weak at best, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions. Defendants did not keep rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>ords of hours worked by employees as required by the Act. Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not have access to time records and had to rely largely on Plaintiffs\u2019 memories regarding time worked. Given all the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in giving Plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
