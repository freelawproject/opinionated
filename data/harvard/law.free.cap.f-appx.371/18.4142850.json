Magana-Sagrero also was convicted of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), being an alien in unlawful possession of a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(5), 924(a)(2), and conspiracy to launder money, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1956, but he does not challenge these convictions. Magana-Sagrero argues for the first time on appeal that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">When a defendant fails to move for a judgment of acquittal, \u201c \u2018we may reverse the conviction only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Tagg, </em>572 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002)). To satisfy this standard, we must \u201cfind that the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bender). </em>Magana-Sagrero cannot satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">To establish that Magana-Sagrero was guilty, the government was required to \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: 1) an illegal agreement existed to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine; 2) [Magana-Sagrero] knew of this agreement; and 3) [Magana-Sagrero] knowingly and voluntarily joined the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Charles, </em>313 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). Magana-Sagrero argues that the government proved he was \u201cinvolved with the [drug] proceeds\u201d but failed to establish that he possessed cocaine with intent to distribute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">The government introduced ample evidence from which a jury could have found that Magana-Sagrero conspired to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. The evidence established that Magana-Sagrero knew of the conspiracy and made deliveries of cash and drugs on behalf of the drug organization. In 1991 and 1997, Magana-Sagrero was convicted of the \u201cpossession or purchase for sale of narcotics.\u201d Later, agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency discovered that Magana-Sagrero worked for Jose Tapia-Corneso, also known as \u201cTigre,\u201d who was a mid-level distributor in a large-scale drug organization. On at least five occasions, Magana-Sagrero delivered for Tigre suitcases that contained between $150,000 and $500,000. In October 2007, an agent observed an unidentified Hispanic man, who was driving a gold Nissan Sentra, arrive at a residence in Fairburn, Georgia, ostensibly to deliver cocaine to a confidential informant. The Hispanic man walked into and left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>residence in a manner that suggested he was carrying a package. On November 20, 2007, another agent observed the same gold Nissan Sentra arrive at a residence on Harbin\u2019s Ridge Way in Lawrenceville, Georgia, ostensibly to collect 20 kilograms of cocaine from another member of the conspiracy who drove a red Ford Sport Truck. After the truck left the residence, agents followed the Nissan Sentra to a ear wash, where an agent was able to identify the driver as Magana-Sagrero. Agents recorded telephone conversations between Angel Haro Perez, a leader of the drug conspiracy, and Tigre about the timing of the delivery and receipt of cocaine at the Harbin\u2019s Ridge residence, and agents later seized a ledger stating that Tigre received 20 kilograms of cocaine on November 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Physical evidence also tied Magana-Sagrero to the conspiracy. In December 2007, agents searched the Harbin\u2019s Ridge residence and discovered a table and knife with white residue and drug-processing equipment, including devices used to press and package cocaine. Agents installed a global positioning device on the gold Nissan Sentra and tracked the vehicle to a home on Luther Way in Lawrenceville, Georgia, where Magana-Sagrero answered the door and consented to a search of the residence. Agents discovered on the property two firearms, two ledgers, a lease in Magana-Sagrero\u2019s name for a residence on Clinton Place in Lawrenceville, two receipts for rent for the residence on Clinton Place, a garage door opener for that residence, and four cellular telephones. One of the cellular telephones listed the name \u201cTigre\u201d in its contacts list and ascribed to that name a number that Tigre had used in his conversations with Perez. Agents later obtained a warrant to search the residence on Clinton Place and discovered devices used to package cocaine, cellophane wrap, a digital scale, latex gloves, and colored sheathes to affix to keys to identify locations by color instead of by address.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Magana-Sagrero has not established that upholding his conviction would result in a miscarriage of justice. Reasonable jurors have found that Magana-Sagrero joined the conspiracy. We affirm Maga-na-Sagrero\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 5 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Magana-Sagrero\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
