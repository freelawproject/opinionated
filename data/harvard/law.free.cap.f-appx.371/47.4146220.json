Moore\u2019s second direct appeal of his sentence. In this appeal, Moore challenges his life sentence imposed on remand for his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and five grams or more but less than fifty grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), (b)(l)(B)(iii), and (b)(1)(C) (Count Two). After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of Moore\u2019s advisory guidelines range on Count Two as being life imprisonment. However, we must again vacate Moore\u2019s life sentence on Count Two because the district court erred in treating life imprisonment as a mandatory sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">A jury convicted Moore of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base (Count One) and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base (Count Two). The district court imposed two concurrent life sentences. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Moore\u2019s convictions and his life sentence with respect to Count One, but remanded for resentencing on Count Two because the district court \u201cerroneously believed that Moore\u2019s conviction on Count II carried a mandatory life sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>303 Fed.Appx. 767, 769 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(\u201cMoore I\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On remand, the district court entered an order reimposing a concurrent life sentence on Count Two, stating that this sentence was \u201cmandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">I. Calculation of Guidelines Range</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">We first explain why Moore\u2019s advisory guidelines range is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Moore does not dispute that his offenses were properly grouped together for purposes of determining his combined offense level under Part D of Chapter Three of the Sentencing Guidelines. As Moore\u2019s Pre-sentence Investigation Report noted, his \u201cunrestricted\u201d guidelines range was 292 to 362 months based on his offense level of 38 and his criminal history category of III. However, because the statutory mandatory minimum of life on Count One was greater than the high end of that guidelines range of 362 months, Moore\u2019s advisory guidelines sentence became life imprisonment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, while life was the statutory mandatory minimum on Count One, life was the advisory guidelines sentence, not the <em>statutory </em>minimum, on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">Further, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b), when there are multiple counts of conviction, the sentence imposed on each count is the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d as calculated under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the relevant portions of the guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commentary to \u00a7 5G1.2 defines \u201ctotal punishment\u201d as the \u201ccombined length of the sentences.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b) cmt. n. 1. Because Moore faced a mandatory life sentence on Count One, his \u201ccombined length of sentences,\u201d or total punishment, was life. Moore\u2019s argument that \u00a7 5G 1.1(b) applies only when there are single counts of conviction is unavailing. Section 5G1.2(b) explicitly refers to \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) in explaining how to determine the total punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The commentary also states that the sentences should run concurrently \u201cto the extent allowed by the statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment for each count of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where at least one count has a \u201cstatutory maximum adequate to permit imposition of the total punishment as the sentence on that count,\u201d then the sentences on the other counts are \u201cset at the <em>lesser </em>of the total punishment and the applicable statutory maximum\u201d and are run concurrently with the longest sentence. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Here, Moore\u2019s \u201ctotal punishment\u201d was life imprisonment, and his applicable statutory maximum on Count Two was also life imprisonment. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that Moore\u2019s advisory guidelines sentence on Count Two was a concurrent life sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">II. Advisory v. Mandatory</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">The government concedes, and we agree, that the district court appears to have mistakenly believed that a life sentence as to Count Two was mandatory rather than advisory. However, Count Two carries a statutory mandatory minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, not life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (providing that, if a violation involves five grams or more of cocaine base and if the defendant has a prior felony drug conviction, the defendant faces a term of imprisonment not \u201cless than 10 years and not more than life imprisonment\u201d). While Moore\u2019s advisory guidelines range under Count Two was life imprisonment, the district court erred to the extent it treated that guidelines range as binding. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 246, 125 S.Ct. 738, 757, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of Count Two\u2019s guidelines sentence of life imprisonment, but vacate Moore\u2019s sentence as to Count Two and remand to permit the district court to resentence Moore on Count Two in light of the advisory nature of that guidelines sentence and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We express no opinion, however, as to what sentence the district court should impose after considering the advisory guidelines sentence and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. The Court also remanded so the district court could fix a clerical error in the judgment and commitment order, but explicitly left \"undisturbed\u201d the life sentence on Count One. <em>Moore I, </em>303 Fed.Appx. at 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-16\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (providing that a \u201cstatutorily required minimum sentence\u201d is the guideline sentence when it \"is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. Section 5G1.2(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">Except as otherwise required by law <em>(see </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(a),(b)), the sentence imposed on each other count shall be the total punishment as determined in accordance with Part D of Chapter Three, and Part C of this Chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b). Part D of Chapter Three addresses how to group multiple counts of conviction in order to determine the combined offense level used to calculate the advisory guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1 to 3D 1.5. Part C of Chapter 5 addresses the imposition of terms of imprisonment using the Sentencing Table and the application of safety-valve relief to certain statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.1 to 5C1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-10\">. We also reject Moore's argument that the district court was required to hold a resen-tencing hearing. In <em>Moore I, </em>this Court issued only a limited remand as to Count Two; it did not vacate Moore's sentence in its entirety. Further, given that this Court affirmed Moore\u2019s life sentence on Count One, any sentence imposed on remand as to Count Two would not have made Moore\u2019s total sentence more onerous. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1518-20 (11th Cir. 1996) (concluding that the district court does not commit reversible error in failing to give the defendant an opportunity to allocute during resentencing when the remand was limited and \"the modification does not make the sentence more onerous\"); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>11 F.3d 149, 151 (11th Cir.1994) (concluding that a defendant's right to be present and allocute extends to resentencing when the \"original sentencing package is vacated in its entirety on appeal and a case is remanded for resentencing\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b74-15\">. As this is a limited remand, the parties may not reargue issues already and necessarily decided during the previous sentencing proceedings that either have been affirmed on appeal or could have been but were not raised on appeal. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that when the appellate court issues a limited mandate, \u201cthe trial court is restricted in the range of issues it may consider on remand\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
