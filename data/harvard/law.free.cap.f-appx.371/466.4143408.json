Granger\u2019s brief consists of one paragraph, without citation to the evidence presented at trial or to relevant authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Granger is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>and his pleadings are accordingly construed liberally. <em>See United States v. Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1994). Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, an appellant\u2019s brief must contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Such contentions and citations are required so that the court can determine if there is \u201csufficient evidentiary foundation\u201d to hold that the district court committed error. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009) Even <em>pro se </em>appellants must reasonably comply with this requirement. <em>See Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Because Granger fails to properly argue or present issues in his appellate brief, we consider those issues to be abandoned. <em>United States v. Beaumont, </em>972 F.2d 553, 563 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201c [Arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d). Because Granger has abandoned all issues on appeal, his appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Newsome v. EEOC, </em>301 F.3d 227, 233 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
