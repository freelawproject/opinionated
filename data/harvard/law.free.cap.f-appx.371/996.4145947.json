No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">This litigation has a ten-year history. The underlying facts are set out in two district court opinions and two opinions of this Court; we will state them only briefly here. In 1997, ALDOT notified Plaintiffs that their land was needed in order to widen a highway. In May 1998, the State commenced condemnation proceedings in the probate court; the probate court entered a condemnation decree and valued Plaintiffs\u2019 property at $85,000. Plaintiffs refused to vacate their property and appealed the condemnation award to the state trial court for a trial <em>de novo. </em>In December 1998, in a separate proceeding in state trial court, the State sought to evict Plaintiffs. In that proceeding, Plaintiffs complained that ALDOT intended to use their house for non-public purposes; no current need for the property existed, and ALDOT had no intention of razing the house. After trial, on 12 January 1999, a writ of eviction issued and possession of the property was granted to the State. Plaintiffs filed no appeal of this decision and vacated their house. Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the probate court\u2019s condemnation order was still pending in state trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">On 11 August 1999, Plaintiffs filed an \u201cAmended Appeal\u201d in the still pending appeal of the condemnation order. In this pleading, Plaintiffs complained that \u2014 contrary to ALDOT\u2019s earlier representations of immediate need \u2014 the State failed and refused to destroy Plaintiffs\u2019 home and to use the condemned property to expand the highway. On that same date, Plaintiffs filed documents complaining about the State\u2019s use of the property during the period since Plaintiffs were evicted. In September 1999, just before the condemnation proceeding was scheduled for a <em>de novo </em>trial in state circuit court, the parties settled the matter: Plaintiffs agreed to the condemnation, and the State agreed to pay them $145,000. The house was razed in November 1999, and a highway now sits in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">The dispute entered the federal court system in May 2000 when Plaintiffs brought this section 1983 action claiming they were forced out of their home from January through August 1999 so that contractors could use their property for office and living space. Plaintiffs contended that such use constituted a private use in violation of their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923), and <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). <em>Sophocleus v. Alabama Dept. of Transportation, </em>305 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.Ala.2004). In an unpublished opinion, we affirmed, 116 Fed.Appx. 246 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated by </em>546 U.S. 801, 126 S.Ct. 37, 163 L.Ed.2d 29 (2005); the Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in the light of <em>Exxon Mobil Coup, v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), wherein the Supreme Court clarified the scope and applicability of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. We, in turn, vacated the district court\u2019s opinion and remanded for the district court to consider its jurisdiction in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Exxon Mobil </em>opinion. 170 Fed.Appx. 608 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">On remand, the district court concluded <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>was no bar to its sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>ject-matter jurisdiction; applying Alabama\u2019s law of preclusion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court concluded the suit was barred by the doctrine of res <em>judicata. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">For <em>res judicata </em>to apply under Alabama law, these essential elements must be shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-5\">(1) a prior judgment on the merits, (2) rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) with substantial identity of the parties, and (4) with the same cause of action presented in both suits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\"><em>Hughes v. Allenstein, </em>514 So.2d 858, 860 (Ala.1987). And \u201c[i]f these essential elements are met, any issue that was <em>or could have been </em>adjudicated in the prior action is barred from further litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Plaintiffs\u2019 argument on appeal chiefly focuses on satisfaction of the fourth element: whether the state and federal suits present the same cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Applying <em>res judicata </em>under Alabama law, we have made this observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-10\">the principal test for comparing causes of action is whether the primary right and duty or wrong are the same in each action. <em>Res judicata </em>applies not only to the precise legal theory presented in the prior case, but to all legal theories and claims arising out of the same nucleus of operative fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\"><em>N.A.A.C.P. v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1990) (internal quotations and citations omitted). So, too, the Alabama Supreme Court has said, \u201c[i]f a claim, which arises out of a single wrongful act or dispute, is brought to a final conclusion on the merits, then all other claims arising out of the same wrongful act or dispute are barred, even if those claims are based on different legal theories or seek a different form of damages.... \u201d <em>Equity Resources Management, Inc. v. Vinson, </em>728 So.2d 634, 638 (Ala.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">In the state-court condemnation proceeding, Plaintiffs alleged improper nonpublic use of their property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>less, Plaintiffs contend that, even though then<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pleadings referenced the state\u2019s improper use of their property for non-public purposes, they never asserted a federal just-compensation constitutional claim in the state proceedings. \u201cClaim preclusion bars the litigation of matters that could have been litigated in an earlier suit.\u201d <em>Pelletier v. Zweifel, </em>921 F.2d 1465, 1501 (11th Cir.1991). As this Court and the district court have now each said twice, the arguments made by Plaintiffs in this action were or could have been raised in the Alabama condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">. In determining the <em>res judicata </em>effect of an earlier state court judgment, we apply the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine of the state whose decision is set up as a bar to further litigation. <em>See Green v. Jefferson County Com'n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1252 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">. The district court said that Plaintiffs raised no challenge to the third element \u2014 substantial identity of the parties \u2014 but Plaintiffs argue that they raised the privity issue in their brief. Plaintiffs do little more than assert that the privity challenge was made below; the issue is set out on appeal in only the most cursory and conclusory fashion. We conclude that a sufficient identity of interest exists between the parties in the state and federal actions to satisfy Alabama\u2019s substantial identity of the parties requirement. <em>See Gonzalez, LLC v. DiVincenti, </em>844 So.2d 1196, 1203 (Ala.2002) (\"Judgments can bind persons not party (or privy) to the litigation in question where the nonparties' interests were represented adequately by a party in the original suit. A person may be bound by a judgment even though not a party to a suit if one of the parties to the suit is so closely aligned with his interests as to be his virtual representative. Moreover, if a party has a sufficient laboring oar in the conduct of the litigation, then the principle of <em>res judicata </em>can be actuated.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also, N.A.A.C.P. v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">.Plaintiffs argue that the non-public use of their property post-dated the commencement of the probate and condemnation proceedings and, therefore, those proceedings can be no barrier to this federal suit. <em>See In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1298 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(res judicata </em>has no application where facts giving rise to claim post-date original pleading in earlier litigation). Under <em>Piper </em>a plaintiff is not obliged to supplement the pleadings by adding an after-acquired claim. <em>Id. </em>But Plaintiffs did supplement the pleadings; they set out their allegation of nonpublic use of their property in their amended appeal of the condemnation order and in pretrial submissions. Unlike the situation in <em>Piper, </em>the facts underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 non-public use claims actually were raised as the case unfolded. <em>See id. </em>at 1298-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
