The district court sentenced Vasquez to 97 months in prison, at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, and a life term of supervised release. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the district court committed any procedural errors. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we will then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Vasquez argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in sentencing him based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 because this Guideline was formulated on amendments by Congress directly, without empirical study and institutional support by the Sentencing Commission. He contends that the district court was prohibited from considering \u00a7 2G2.2 in sentencing him and that this court should not apply a presumption of reasonableness to the guidelines range calculated under \u00a7 2G2.2. Vasquez concedes that this argument was rejected in <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). However, he seeks to preserve the argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">Vasquez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in considering \u00a7 2G2.2 in sentencing him. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). He also has not established that this court may not apply a presumption of reasonableness to the sentence imposed within the applicable guidelines range. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 367. The imposition of the 97-month sentence is thus affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Vasquez also challenges the condition of his supervised release requiring him to participate in a sexual offender treatment program. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that the probation officer could determine the frequency and duration of such a program but that Vasquez \u201cwill be required to participate in such a program unless [his] Probation Officer waives that requirement with the approval of the Court.\u201d The written judgment, however, orders him to \u201cparticipate in a treatment program for sex offenders as deemed necessary and approved by the probation officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">Vasquez complains that the language used in the written judgment gives the probation officer exclusive authority to determine not only the details of the treatment program, but whether Vasquez must participate in any such program at all. Because the disputed language was not used at sentencing and Vasquez thus had no opportunity to object to it prior to the entry of judgment, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>States v. Warden, </em>291 F.3d 363, 365 n. 1 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In <em>United States v. Lopez-Muxtay, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 964, 965 (5th Cir.2009), we vacated and remanded a sentence in which the written judgment contained language identical to the language used in Vasquez\u2019s case and in which the district court\u2019s oral judgment was silent about the probation officer\u2019s involvement in the required mental health treatment. We remanded that case for clarification because \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s written judgment is unclear regarding whether the district court intended to grant Lopez\u2019s probation officer the authority not only to implement the condition but to determine whether Lopez should or should not undergo mental health treatment on supervised release.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that when the sentence imposed orally by the district court conflicts vrith the written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls). We now vacate the judgment in Vasquez\u2019s case and remand the ease for resentencing so that the district court may clarify the condition of supervised release at issue. We express no opinion on the proper resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
