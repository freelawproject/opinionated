They argue: (1) that the district court erred in striking their amended complaint and by closing discovery; (2) that the district court lacked jurisdiction to compel Glynis Bethel\u2019s appearance at a hearing; and (3) that the district court violated their Seventh Amendment rights by dismissing their case. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-23\">On 8 April 2006, Orlando and Glynis Bethel filed a <em>pro se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint against the Baldwin County Board of Education (\u201cthe Board\u201d), numerous employees and members of the Board and the Baldwin County school district, a Baldwin County judge, the Town of Loxley, Alabama, and several Loxley police officers, a judge, and prosecutor (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d). Doc. 1. The Be-thels alleged that they were denied access to County school facilities after hours, that the school system denied Glynis the opportunity to work as a substitute teacher because of her religion, and that she and Orlando were denied their constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>right to preach outside of Loxley Elementary School. <em>Id. </em>at 2-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The court granted the Bethels\u2019 request to give them until 20 January 2007 to complete their amended complaint and serve the defendants. Doc. 10 at 2. On 16 January 2007, the Bethels filed an amended complaint that comprised six different complaints totaling 436 pages. <em>See </em>Docs. 14 to 14-9. The first related to the Be-thels\u2019 original complaint. The second was brought against the Town of Loxley, numerous police officers, a prosecutor, two judges, and a bail bonds man, and was related to criminal charges levied against the Bethels after they were preaching in a public park. <em>See </em>Doc. 14-3 at 2. The third related to the Bethels\u2019 street preaching activities in Robertsdale, Alabama, and in the Town of Loxley. <em>See </em>Doc. 14-5 at 2-3. The fourth involved incidents that occurred in the city of Selma, Alabama. <em>See </em>Doc. 14-7 at 2. The fifth involved incidents occurring in the city of Mobile, Alabama. <em>See </em>Doc. 14-8 at 2-3. The sixth complaint involved the city of Daphne, Alabama. <em>See id. </em>at 3 \u2014 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The district court struck the Bethels\u2019 amended complaint because five of the six complaints included in it were not related to the Bethels\u2019 original complaint. Doc. 16 at 3. Though the first complaint appeared to be related to the Bethels\u2019 original complaint, the court struck it because it was filed along with the other complaints as a single document. <em>Id. </em>at 3 n. 6. The court gave the Bethels \u201cleave to refile an amended complaint to the extent any new allegations are related to [their] original complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response, the Bethels argued that their amended complaint complied with the federal rules, given that all of the defendants were related because all had violated the Bethels\u2019 constitutional rights. Doc. 20 at 1. The Bethels also stated that, because the district court acted with bias, tampered with evidence, committed fraud, and was wicked, they asked God to judge the court with a plague and to vindicate the Bethels. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">After the defendants filed motions to dismiss and the Bethels responded that they \u201coppose[d] any dismissals based on the Constitution alone as opposing \u2018arguments,\u2019\u201d the district court, on 22 August 2007, dismissed all claims except for that against the Board alleging that the school board unconstitutionally denied Glynis access to the Baldwin County public school facilities for \u201cBe a Model for the Gospel,\u201d which was a \u201cprivate Christian after school hours club.\u201d Doc. 52 at 16, 19-20; 49-2. From this point foiward, Glynis was the only plaintiff remaining in the case. <em>See </em>Doc. 52 at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">On 21 August 2008, the magistrate judge ordered a status conference to be held on 29 August 2008. Doc. 53. On 1 September 2008, the magistrate judge ordered that, because no action had been taken in the Bethels\u2019 case in over one year and because Glynis, at the status conference, only requested the production of a document that she already had in her custody, discovery was complete and the next event was the filing of a motion for summary judgment by the Board. On 3 September 2008, the Bethels filed a notice of intent to prepare service of discovery, stating that they were going to commence discovery within seven days. Doc. 57. The Board objected to further discovery, arguing that discovery had been closed by the magistrate judge\u2019s 1 September 2008 order. Doc. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">In an order to show cause, the district court noted that the Clerk of Court, Chuck Diard, had reported that, on 3 September 2008, Glynis \u201cwas verbally abusive to employees of the clerk\u2019s office because they would not provide her with free copies of court documents.\u201d Doc. 59 at 1. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>stated that, on 4 September 2008, Glynis \u201crepeatedly telephoned the Clerk\u2019s Office and engaged in abusive, harassing and threatening communications against various members of the court staff, including Mr. Diard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court asserted that it would not tolerate this type of behavior from any litigant and ordered Glynis to appear on 29 September 2008, 2008 WL 4493591, to show why it should not prohibit her \u201cfrom physically accessing, or tele-phonically contacting, the Clerk\u2019s Office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. The court <em>\u201cstrongly cautioned </em>[Glynis] that the failure to abide by [its] order may result in sanctions against plaintiff, including, dismissal of this action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">After the Board moved for summary judgment, the Bethels filed document requests, interrogatories, and requests for admissions. <em>See </em>Docs. 60-63. In an order on 23 September 2008, the district court gave summary judgment notice and informed the Bethels that they had until 6 October 2008 to respond to the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Doc. 75 at 1-2. The Bethels moved to strike the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment and moved to strike the district court\u2019s order, arguing that both the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the court\u2019s 23 September order violated their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. Doc. 76 at 1-2; Doc. 77 at 1-4; Doc. 81 at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">A hearing was held on 29 September 2008, but Glynis failed to appear as ordered by the district court. <em>See </em>Doc. 86 at 1. The district court then dismissed Glyn-is\u2019s case with prejudice because \u201cthere [was] a clear record of [her] intentional, willful, and contumacious failure to obey an order of this court and no lesser sanction [would] suffice to preserve the authority of this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The court found that Glynis had acted willfully and contumaciously when, before the hearing, she called the court thrice and left voice messages, stating that: (1) \u201cshe would not attend the hearing because it was illegal and unlawful and because the court had no jurisdiction over her\u201d; (2) \u201cshe received the order but would not attend the \u2018Kangaroo Court\u2019 or any corrupt activities at this court\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe only way she would attend would be if she were \u2018physically\u2019 brought to court in handcuffs by the U.S. Marshal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Glynis \u201cmade it clear that she was not going to attend the hearing, even though she was ordered to do so and was warned that failure to appear may result in dismissal of her lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The court accordingly found that no lesser sanction would adequately address her refusal to follow court orders. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Orlando moved to vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal, asserting that he was not scheduled to appear before the district court. Doc. 92 at 1-2. Glynis moved to vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal, contending that: (1) the court dismissed her case based on allegations; (2) she refused to attend a \u201cKangaroo Court\u201d hearing that had nothing to do with the merits of her case; and (3) the Board did not submit a motion to dismiss as required by Rule 41(b). Doc. 93 at 1-4. The district court considered both motions as motions to reconsider its order dismissing Glynis\u2019s case and it denied both motions. <em>See </em>Docket Sheet, entry 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Orlando and Glynis Bethel, <em>pro se, </em>appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. They appeal the district court\u2019s decision to strike their amended complaint and close discovery. They argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction to dismiss Glynis\u2019s case with prejudice after she refused to attend a hearing. They also argue that the dismissal violated their Seventh Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The Bethels argue that the district court violated Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f) by striking their amended complaint. We review the district court\u2019s decision to strike the Bethels\u2019 amended complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>See Fla. Evergreen Foliage v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., </em>470 F.3d 1036, 1040 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Under this standard, we do not disturb the district court\u2019s decision as long as it is within a range of reasonable choices and is not influenced by any mistake of law. <em>Betty K </em>Agencies, <em>Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Because the Bethels are proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we construe their filings liberally. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a district court may strike from a pleading \u201cany redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f). The district court may limit discovery if it determines that \u201cthe party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The amended complaint was a 436-page compilation of six complaints, five of which were unrelated to their original complaint. The district court gave the Bethels \u201cleave to refile the amended complaint to the extent any new allegations are related to [their] original complaint.\u201d <em>See </em>Doc. 16 at 3 n. 6. Rather than refile without the five unrelated claims, the Bethels argued that the amended complaint complied with federal rules and accused the district court of wickedness, bias, tampering with evidence, and fraud. Doc. 20 at 1. The court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the amended complaint, which included these immaterial and impertinent complaints even after the court granted leave to refile.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The Bethels argue that the district court denied them discovery by closing discovery. We also review the district court\u2019s discovery decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, </em>169 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.1999). Before the district court closed discovery, the Bethels had ample opportunity to obtain discovery. In fact, more than a year elapsed after the court dismissed the majority of the Bethels\u2019 claims and before it closed discovery. Further, the Bethels\u2019 discovery requests became moot once the district court dismissed Glynis\u2019s case with prejudice for failure to comply with a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The Bethels contend that the court lacked jurisdiction to hold a hearing about Glynis\u2019s interactions with the clerk\u2019s office. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 20-27. Thus, the Bethels have abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing Glynis\u2019s case. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 74, 172 L.Ed.2d 67 (2008). Even if, under a liberal construction of the Bethels\u2019 appellate brief, they challenge the district court\u2019s findings, as shown below, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Glynis\u2019s case with prejudice. The remaining issue is whether the district court had jurisdiction over its order to show cause and its order dismissing Glyn-is\u2019s case with prejudice. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 20-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a case for failure to comply with the rules of the court for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to Rule 41(b), a defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>move for dismissal if a plaintiff fails to comply with a court order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). \u201cAlthough the rule is phrased in terms of dismissal on the motion of the defendant, it is clear that the power is inherent in the court and may be exercised <em>sua sponte </em>whenever necessary to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Aransas County Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>570 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1978) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn addition to its power under Rule 41(b), a court also has the inherent ability to dismiss a claim in light of its authority to enforce its orders and provide for the efficient disposition of litigation.\u201d <em>Zocaras, </em>465 F.3d at 483. Moreover, a district court has \u201cinherent power to manage its docket.\u201d <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd., </em>432 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The Bethels assert that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order Glynis to show cause and to dismiss her case with prejudice, but concede that the court had jurisdiction over their \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See id. </em>at vii. The Bethels\u2019 contention that the district court lacked the jurisdiction to order Glynis to appear at a hearing is without merit because the district court has the inherent \u201cauthority to enforce its orders and provide for the efficient disposition of litigation.\u201d See <em>Zocaras, </em>465 F.3d at 483; <em>Lopez, </em>570 F.2d at 544. By ordering Glynis to appear and explain why it should not bar her from contacting the clerk\u2019s office, the district court was properly exercising it authority over its one of the cases on its docket. <em>See Betty K Agencies, Ltd., </em>432 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, the Bethels argue that the district court violated their Seventh Amendment rights by dismissing their case. The Seventh Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved....\u201d U.S. Const.amend. VII. Under our precedent, a district court can dismiss a case where a plaintiff willfully refuses to comply with a court order. <em>See Lopez, </em>570 F.2d at 544; Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Moreover, a district court is authorized to dismiss a plaintiffs case for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). A plaintiffs right to a trial by jury is not violated when a court dismisses a case based on a matter of law before trial. <em>See Garvie v. City of Fori Walton Beach, Fla., </em>366 F.3d 1186, 1190 (11th Cir.2004) (summary judgment context).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">It is unclear whether the Bethels are contending that the district court violated their Seventh Amendment rights by dismissing Glynis\u2019s case with prejudice for failure to comply with a court order or by granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss with respect to their other claims. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 29-31. Regardless, research has not revealed a case in which either the U.S. Supreme Court or we have held that a dismissal violated the Seventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In their brief, the Bethels\u2019 assertion that the district court dismissed the case in violation of the 7th Amendment does not contain any arguments, citations to the record, or citations to authority \u2014 merely a list of statements. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 29-31. Given that the statements are not arguments and do not contain any citations to the record or to authority, they are insufficient, in themselves, to raise an issue on appeal. Therefore, any other issue that the Bethels attempt to raise in this appeal has been abandoned. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874 (holding that a <em>pro se </em>appellant abandons an issue by failing to raise it on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Because a district court is authorized to dismiss a plaintiffs case where a plaintiff wilfully refuses to comply with a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>order or where a plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Bethels\u2019 case did not violate their Seventh Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Bethels\u2019 \u00a7 1983 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
