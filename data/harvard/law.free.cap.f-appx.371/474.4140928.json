Liddell pleaded guilty in 1997 to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. The district court sentenced him to a term of 135 months of imprisonment. In 2008, Liddell moved for a reduction in his sentence based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendments to the base offense levels for crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, amend. 706, amend. 711. The district court determined that Liddell\u2019s amended guidelines range of imprisonment would be 120-135 months, based on the amended guidelines and the statutory minimum term for his offense of conviction. After considering the guidelines amendments, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, and the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court declined to reduce Liddell\u2019s sentence based on his criminal history and his post-conviction conduct. The district court noted that, while incarcerated, Liddell \u201chad been sanctioned on five separate occasions for fighting with other inmates, once for failing to obey an order, and once for failing to stand count.\u201d Liddell timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The Government has moved to dismiss Liddell\u2019s appeal, arguing that it is barred by the appeal waiver contained in Liddell\u2019s written plea agreement. The provision states that Liddell \u201cwaives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case on any ground, including any appeal right conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and waives the right to contest the sentence in any post-conviction proceeding....\u201d We have held \u201cthat a motion for a sentence modification under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not properly considered an \u2018appeal\u2019 or \u2018collateral proceeding\u2019 under the terms of a general waiver of appeal ..., and, consequently, appellate review of the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not barred by such waivers.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). Liddell\u2019s appeal, therefore, is not barred by the waiver and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The district court properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and acted within its discretion in considering Lid-dell\u2019s post-conviction conduct in declining to reduce his sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1322-23 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672-73 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition far cert. filed </em>(U.S. Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
