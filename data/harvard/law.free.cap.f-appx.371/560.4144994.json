He argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion solely on the basis that his original sentence was below both the original and amended guidelines ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Although Powell has completed his term of imprisonment, he is currently serving his term of supervised release. Accordingly, this appeal is not moot. <em>See Johnson v. Pettiford, </em>442 F.3d 917, 918 (5th Cir.2006). We reject the Government\u2019s assertion that Powell waived the right to bring the instant appeal under the terms of his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full resentencing. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). Consequently, the bifurcated reasonableness review standard afforded sentencing decisions is inapplicable in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. <em>Id. </em>at 672. Rather, we review the district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 297. Wfiiere, as here, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), we discern no abuse of discretion. <em>See id.; United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
