Michel contends that she was persecuted \u2014 and would be again \u2014 on account of her political opinion in opposition to the Lavalas party. The IJ found that she did not testify credibly and therefore failed to show she was eligible for asylum, and the BIA affirmed. Upon careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In order to establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must provide \u201ccredible, direct, and specific\u201d evidence in the record showing that she is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A person qualifies as a refugee if she can establish she has suffered past persecution or has a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">If an applicant\u2019s testimony that she fears persecution is credible, it may be sufficient, without corroboration, to satisfy her burden of proof required to establish asylum eligibility. <em>Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). Likewise, a denial of asylum relief can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, which may be made on the basis of internal inconsistencies in an applicant\u2019s testimony. <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1348 (11th Cir.2008) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). If the court explicitly determines that the applicant lacks credibility, it must offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the finding. <em>Kueviakoe, </em>567 F.3d at 1305. The burden then shifts to the applicant to show why the credibility determination was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">When reviewing a decision issued by the BIA, we review only that decision, except where the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3cl 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2009). Because the BIA here expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under the \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d and must affirm those determinations \u201cif [] supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under this standard of review, we will reverse an IJ\u2019s credibility findings \u201conly if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">The IJ made an adverse credibility determination against Michel, and gave thorough, cogent, and specific reasons for that determination. Specifically, the IJ noted numerous discrepancies in Michel\u2019s testimony as well as the absence of material facts from her asylum application that Michel raised during her asylum hearing. The IJ also provided Michel the opportunity to explain discrepancies duxing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>hearing, but was unpersuaded by Michel\u2019s explanations. The IJ then weighed the totality of the circumstances, and determined that she found Michel not to be a credible applicant. On appeal, Michel offers possible explanations for the inconsistencies, but these not enough to compel this Court to reverse the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. As such, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination and resulting denial of Michel\u2019s asylum application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-16\">. Because Michel failed to establish eligibility for asylum, we also deny her applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (\"To qualify for withholding of removal or CAT relief, an alien must establish standards more stringent that those for asylum eligibility; thus, an alien unable to prove a well-founded fear of persecution based on a protected ground, as required for asylum relief, necessarily fails to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution, the standard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
