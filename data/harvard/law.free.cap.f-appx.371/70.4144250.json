On appeal, Joseph argues that his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) should have been two points lower because his previous conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07, was not a crime of violence. In support of this argument, he points out that, in <em>State v. Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211 (Fla.2007), the Florida Supreme Court held that battery on a law enforcement officer does not constitute a forcible felony for purposes of sentencing under Florida\u2019s violent-career-criminal statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.084.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">A federal grand jury indicted Joseph, charging him with the following offenses: (1) possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); and (2) possession of a firearm on which the manufacturer\u2019s serial number has been removed or altered, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k). Joseph ultimately pled guilty to Count 1, without the benefit of a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-18\">In preparing Joseph\u2019s pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer found that Joseph\u2019s base offense level was 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) because he committed the present offense after sustaining two previous felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. The officer found that Joseph\u2019s February 2007 conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer constituted a crime of violence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that his 2005 conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine constituted a controlled substance offense. The probation officer also increased Joseph\u2019s offense level by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) because the firearm that he possessed had an altered or obliterated serial number. Finally, the officer decreased Joseph\u2019s offense level by three levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, the probation officer determined that Joseph\u2019s total offense level was 25 which, when combined with his criminal history category of VI, produced a guideline range of 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The officer also noted, however, that pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), Joseph was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, the officer concluded that Joseph\u2019s guideline range effectively was 110 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">At sentencing, the court confirmed with Joseph that his only objection to the PSI was the probation officer\u2019s finding that his 2007 conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer constituted a crime of violence. The court overruled the objection, noting that precedent established that the Florida offense of simple battery was a crime of violence. The parties agreed that Joseph\u2019s total offense level was 25, his criminal history category was VI, and that this guideline range was 110 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The parties discussed the extent and nature of Joseph\u2019s criminal history, and Joseph apologized to the court for his offense. The court sentenced Joseph to a term of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment, stating that it had determined that a sentence at the low end of Joseph\u2019s guideline range was appropriate after its consideration of the advisory guideline range and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court asked the parties if there were any objections to its factual findings or the manner in which it pronounced the sentence, and Joseph stated that he wished to preserve his argument that his battery conviction did not constitute a crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u201cWe review questions of law with respect to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), a defendant\u2019s base offense level for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon is 24 if he committed the offense after sustaining at least two felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(2). If the defendant committed the offense after sustaining only one felony conviction for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, his base offense level is 22. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3). For purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d has the meaning given to the term under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, the career-offender guideline. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The career-offender guideline in \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">(a) The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). We have noted that the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, and the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d), are virtually identical, and that decisions addressing violent felonies under the ACCA thus provide important guidance in determining if a crime constitutes a crime of violence under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Rainey, </em>362 F.3d 733, 735 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u201cGenerally, in determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for enhancement purposes, we apply a \u2018categorical\u2019 approach, which means that we look no farther than the judgment of conviction.\u201d <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1273. In some cases, however, the judgment of conviction and the relevant statute are ambiguous, and it is impossible to discern whether the previous conviction is a qualifying offense. <em>Id. </em>In these cases, \u201cwe remand for the district judge to look at the facts underlying a state conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this determination, the district court \u201cis limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Under Florida law, an individual commits the crime of battery where he: \u201c(1) [ajctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; or (2) [intentionally causes bodily harm to another person. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(1). The crime normally constitutes a misdemeanor offense in the first degree. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.03(2). Where an individual commits battery against a law enforcement officer, however, the offense is upgraded to a third-degree felony. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.07(l)(d) and (2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In <em>United States v. Glover, </em>we held that the offense of battery on a law enforcement officer, as defined by Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07, constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2. 431 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2005). Subsequently, in <em>Heams, </em>the Florida Supreme Court held that battery on a law enforcement officer did not constitute a forcible felony for purposes of sentencing under Florida\u2019s violent-career-criminal statute, Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 775.084. 961 So.2d at 214, 218. The Florida Supreme Court reasoned that the offense of battery, as defined under \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07, would not invariably involve violent conduct because an individual could commit the offense by simply tapping a police officer on the shoulder without his consent. <em>Id. </em>at 219. In <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>we held that, even after <em>Heams, </em>a third-degree felony battery conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07 constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA, though it did not constitute a forcible felony under state law. 528 F.3d 1318, 1319-21 (11th Cir.2008), <em>rev\u2019d, Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The Supreme Court, however, recently reversed our decision in <em>Johnson. Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1273-74. The Court held that, while <em>Heams </em>is controlling as to the definition of simple battery under state law, it is not binding as to whether the offense constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA, which is a matter of federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 1269-70. The Court also held that, in order to constitute a violent felony under the ACCA, an offense must involve \u201cviolent <em>force\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271. Noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Hearns </em>made clear that the offense of battery could be accomplished by mere unwanted, intentional touching, the Court held that battery did not constitute a violent felony when accomplished in this manner. <em>Id. </em>at 1269-72, 1273-74. Because nothing in the record of the defendant\u2019s battery conviction permitted a conclusion that the defendant sustained the conviction due to behavior amounting to more than mere unwanted touching, the Court held that the defendant\u2019s previous offense was not a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69, 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Johnson, </em>we conclude that the Florida offense of simple battery, as defined by Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07, will not invariably constitute a crime of violence under the Guidelines. This is because, under the terms of the state statute, the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct could have involved the intentional infliction of bodily harm to another, but it also could have involved mere unwanted touching. Because the fact of the conviction and the elements of Florida\u2019s simple battery statute, standing alone, do not unambiguously establish that Joseph previously committed a crime of violence, the district court may consider the underlying conduct. In order to aid this consideration, the court may look to the charging document, a plea agreement, a plea colloquy in which Joseph assented to the factual basis for the plea, or a comparable judicial record of this information. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263. If such documents are unavailable, <em>Johnson </em>instructs that it should be assumed that Joseph committed the battery offense by mere unwanted touching. <em>See Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Joseph\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
