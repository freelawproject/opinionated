Perez contends his sentence is unreasonable because: it overstates the seriousness of the offense of conviction; and, it fails to account for his personal history and circumstances, namely, his family-related motives for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory guideline sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentence was within that range (within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Had Perez timely objected to the reasonableness of his within-guidelines sentence, review would be for abuse-of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Perez, however, did <em>not </em>raise such an objection, although he did request a sentence at the low end of the sentencing range. Accordingly, the Government contends review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Perez maintains that, despite <em>Peltier\u2019s </em>holding to the contrary, he was not required to object to the sentence based on reasonableness because <em>Peltier </em>is contrary to our prior plain-error precedent. Specifically, Perez contends <em>Peltier </em>is a nullity under our rule of orderliness because it conflicts with <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In <em>Castillo, </em>the district court downwardly departed based on Guideline \u00a7 5K2.0 (other grounds for departure) because the prosecutor revealed the defendant\u2019s HIV status, which had been under seal, in open court at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 241-43. After berating the prosecutor, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>downwardly departed. <em>Id. </em>at 242^13. The Government did not object to this downward departure but raised it as error on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 241. Our court considered whether plain-error review applied and concluded, <em>\u201cunder the unique set of cirmmstanees presented by this case, </em>the [G]overnment did not waive its objection ... by failing to object formally to it at sentencing\". <em>Id. </em>at 243 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">We see no conflict between <em>Peltier </em>and <em>Castillo. </em>The latter is obviously limited to its facts, which are in no way similar to the facts presented by the instant action. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009) (rejecting similar contention that <em>Peltier </em>should not be followed under the rule of orderliness). Therefore, review is for plain error. <em>Pel-tier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92; <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 n. 2 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe note a circuit split on the issue of whether a defendant must object at sentencing to preserve error on appeal. <em>Peltier </em>has settled this issue in our circuit ....\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Because the district court imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines sentencing range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Perez\u2019 assertion that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in the light of the non-serious nature of the offense of conviction and his family-related motives for reentering the United States is insufficient to overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(19 Feb. 2010) (No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>09-9216); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Therefore, there is no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Perez contends the presumption of reasonableness should not apply in his case because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States), the guideline under which he was sentenced, is not empirically supported. Perez correctly concedes, however, that this contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009), and <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). He raises it only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
