On May 1, 2008, the district court sentenced Rodriguez to 50 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">On November 29, 2008, Rodriguez mailed a motion to the district court, denominated as a \u201cMotion to Correct Final Sentence Pursuant to 18 [U.S.C.] \u00a7 3742.\u201d In the motion, Rodriguez argued that his sentence was unreasonable, and he asked that, taking various factors into account, the district court reduce his sentence by up to 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">On December 4, 2008, the district court construed Rodriguez\u2019s motion as requesting a reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C.. \u00a7 3582(c) and denied relief. On December 10, 2008, Rodriguez mailed an objection to the district court\u2019s ruling, arguing that his \u201cMotion to Correct Final Sentence\u201d was actually a notice of appeal filed in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 3742(d) and that the district court erroneously construed it as a \u00a7 3582(c) motion. On December 18, 2008, the district court rejected Rodriguez\u2019s claim that it had erred in treating his \u201cMotion to Correct Final Sentence\u201d as seeking relief under \u00a7 3582(c) and ordered the clerk to docket his objection as a notice of appeal from the December 4, 2008 order. The court also granted Rodriguez leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">On appeal, Rodriguez presents several arguments challenging his May 1, 2008 judgment of conviction and sentence. However, the district court properly found that Rodriguez\u2019s \u201cMotion to Correct Final Sentence\u201d did not evince an intent to appeal but sought relief from the district court itself. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that a document filed in the time period for taking an appeal should be construed as a notice of appeal if the document \u201cclearly evinces an intent to appeal\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Because Rodriguez has not filed a notice of appeal from the May 1, 2008 judgment of conviction and sentence as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), we dismiss his appeal to the extent that he challenges that judgment. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Rodriguez\u2019s December 10, 2008 objection likewise failed to \u201cclearly evince[ ] an intent to appeal\u201d as the \u201cprimary relief sought\u201d from the district court was reconsideration of the motion. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660 (determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>a filing did not clearly demonstrate an intent to appeal where request for leave to appeal is secondary to request for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Even if Rodriguez\u2019s objection were construed as a timely notice of appeal from the December 4, 2008 order, he has failed to brief any argument challenging the denial of his request for a sentence reduction. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, to the extent Rodriguez appeals the December 4, 2008 denial of his \u201cMotion to Correct Final Sentence,\u201d we dismiss his appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that the failure to identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Because this case does not present exceptional circumstances, we deny Rodriguez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
