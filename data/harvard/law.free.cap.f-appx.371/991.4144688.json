After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">I. Three Prior Post-Conviction Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">In 1996, Hernandez was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for hire, murder for hire, arson and mail fraud. This Court affirmed Hernandez\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>141 F.3d 1042 (11th Cir.1998). In October 1999, Hernandez filed his first motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied on the merits. In March 2004, Hernandez filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied without prejudice because Hernandez had not obtained permission from this Court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">In June 2007, Hernandez <em>pro se </em>filed a \u201cMotion for Relief from the Judgment,\u201d in which he argued that his convictions were improper because the district court had dismissed the original indictment. The district court summarily denied the motion. On appeal, this Court noted that if construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, Hernandez\u2019s motion was due to be dismissed as an unauthorized successive motion. However, the Court affirmed the denial on the merits, explaining that the counts upon which Hernandez was convicted and sentenced were in the third superseding indictment, which was not dismissed. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>No. 07-13231, slip op. at 3 (11th Cir. Sept. 11, 2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">II. Current \u00a7 2241 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">In May 2009, Hernandez <em>pro se </em>filed this \u00a7 2241 petition. Hernandez\u2019s petition reiterated his argument raised in his June 2007 Motion for Relief from the Judgment. The magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) recommending that the \u00a7 2241 petition be denied. The R&amp;R concluded that the \u00a7 2241 petition was \u201cin legal effect\u201d an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion, that Hernandez had not shown that the remedies under \u00a7 2255 were \u201cineffective or unavailable,\u201d and that Hernandez was merely trying to circumvent the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court adopted the R&amp;R over Hernandez\u2019s objection and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition. Hernandez filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [a defendant\u2019s] detention.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The savings clause does not permit a prisoner to circumvent the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion merely by filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>we established that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies only when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy, all three <em>Wofford </em>criteria must be met. <em>See id. </em>A petitioner may not argue issues raised in his petition until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 by demonstrating that the savings clause applies. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">On appeal, Hernandez argues the merits of his attack on his convictions and sentences; he does not argue that he meets any of the three <em>Wofford </em>criteria. Given that Hernandez does not point to any retroactively applicable Supreme Court precedent, much less one that might establish that he was convicted of nonexistent offenses, he has not shown the applicability of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. Accordingly, we, like the district court before us, do not consider the merits of his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the savings clause does not apply, the district court properly dismissed Hernandez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">. The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">. Although the magistrate judge construed Hernandez\u2019s notice of appeal as an applica-lion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and granted it, we note that a federal prisoner can appeal without a COA if he is proceeding under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">. Contrary to Hernandez\u2019s argument, even when a petitioner claims jurisdictional defects in the underlying criminal trial, the petitioner may not avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy unless the savings clause criteria are met. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1238, 1245 (applying the <em>Wofford </em>criteria to a claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over petitioner's underlying criminal conviction). Thus, we do not address Hernandez\u2019s argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter his underlying criminal convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
