He received concurrent terms of imprisonment of 360 months, 60 months, and 240 months, respectively, for each count. His 360-month sentence subsequently was reduced to 262 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Espericueta appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence. He argues that \u201c[g]iven the recent clarification of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d his sentence should be reduced because under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), a prior conviction for an insufficient funds check should not have been used to increase his criminal history score by three points. He specifies that amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines clarified this issue. Espericueta also moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. To obtain leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Es-pericueta must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">Because amendments to the Guidelines cannot be considered in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion unless they are listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and because amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), Espericueta has not shown that he is entitled to a reduction in his sentence. <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Espericueta has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a reduction of his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-19\">As Espericueta has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue, his request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
