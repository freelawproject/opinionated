He was sentenced to 121 months of imprisonment. Smith did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ALn\">Smith\u2019s sentence was re-examined, however, after the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s November 1, 2007, retroactive amendment to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. A motion to modify the sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was filed on Smith\u2019s behalf, which Smith was notified of on or about February 27, 2008. On January 16, 2009, the district court denied relief. Smith timely filed a document with the district court, titled a \u201cCombined Motion to Reconsider ... Motion to Rule on Defendant\u2019s Objections ... and Notice of Appeal As to the Same.\u201d In it, Smith stated that \u201cif the Court denies any part of this motion(s), the Defendant gives NOTICE to the Court of his intent to appeal all issues raised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A notice of appeal is required to confer jurisdiction on this court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(a). In <em>Mosley, </em>the court found that the notice of appeal was conditional, as it depended on the court\u2019s first denying the motion for reconsideration. <em>Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. Only if the document \u201cclearly evinces the party\u2019s intent to appeal\u201d will it suffice. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cobb v. Lewis, </em>488 F.2d 41, 45 (5th Cir.1974)) (alterations omitted). <em>Mosley </em>controls here. Smith\u2019s motion stated that he wished to appeal only in the event the motion for reconsideration was denied. Therefore, he has not clearly shown an intent to appeal. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiy\">We note that the district court\u2019s judgment denying relief is not final, as Smith\u2019s motion for reconsideration apparently is still pending. <em>See United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1466 (5th Cir.1992). Once the district court does rule, Smith may file a notice of appeal at that time if he is dissatisfied with the ruling. <em>Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">We lack jurisdiction over this appeal. APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AqM\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
