He asserts that he is entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base. He contends that his status as a career offender should not preclude the reduction of his sentence. He also asserts that he is eligible for a sentence reduction in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After Frank\u2019s brief was filed in this court, we issued our decision in <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789 (5th Cir.2009). The issues raised by Frank are foreclosed by <em>Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 789-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-19\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
