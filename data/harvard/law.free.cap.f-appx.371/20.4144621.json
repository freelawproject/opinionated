On appeal, he argues the district court\u2019s generalized recitation of its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, without more, was inadequate in light of the unique circumstances of his case. Specifically, Crummie asserts his substantial advancement, educationally, vocationally, and personally, during his 15 years of imprisonment, which is especially impressive given his unusually harsh and abusive childhood, warranted consideration under \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">A district court need not specifically articulate the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, as long as the record as a whole \u201cdemonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Eg-gersdorf, </em>we found sufficient the district court\u2019s order stating it had reviewed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the government\u2019s response in opposition, the record, and was \u201cotherwise duly advised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. We noted the motion and response had discussed factors that were relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>However, where nothing in the record shows the district court considered \u00a7 3553(a), a district court\u2019s mere mention in a form order that it had considered the defendant\u2019s motion is insufficient where the defendant\u2019s motion merely mentions \u00a7 3553(a), but does not set forth the factors, and there is no response from the government, nor a sentencing transcript reflecting that the factors were discussed by the parties. <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1220 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">In the case at bar, the district court did not err in determining the extent of the sentence reduction because the record demonstrates it took into account the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and, on remand, specifically indicated it had considered the statutory factors. Although the court did not actually discuss the factors, it noted it had considered Crummie\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion, which referenced the factors, and it had the benefit of his counseled supplement to the motion, as well as a response by the Government. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">. \"Post-sentencing conduct facts do not implicate the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\" <em>United States v.
