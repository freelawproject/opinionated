He argues that the district court abused its discretion when, despite his exemplary post-sentencing conduct, it denied his motion solely on the basis that the amended guidelines sentencing range overlapped with his original 100-month sentence. The Government asserts that Davis waived the right to bring the instant appeal under the terms of his plea agreement. We reject the Government\u2019s argument. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a full resentencing. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). Consequently, the bifurcated reasonableness review standard afforded sentencing decisions is inapplicable in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. <em>Id. </em>at 672. Rather, we review the district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Davis\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence included a request that the district court base its decision on mitigating factors set forth by Davis. The district court\u2019s ruling indicates that it considered the amended guidelines range but determined that no reduction in sentence was warranted. Where, as here, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 674; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent Davis is complaining that the district court failed to articulate reasons for denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
