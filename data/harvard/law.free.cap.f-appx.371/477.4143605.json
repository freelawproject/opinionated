This appeal is from the district court\u2019s order denying Cao\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), in light of the recent amendments to the crack cocaine sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In denying the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the district court noted that the original sentence was within the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Cao contends that the district court arbitrarily denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without regard to case-specific facts, such as his post-conviction rehabilitative conduct, or consideration of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Cao contends a \u201csentencing range overlap,\u201d by itself, cannot be used to justify the denial of a reduction. He claims that the district court should have cited case-specific reasons for denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667 (5th Cir. 2009). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the applicable guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, the sentencing court is not required to provide reasons for its denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or to explain its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74. If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Although the district court did not discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors expressly, the record reflects that it considered them. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. The district court\u2019s decision denying the motion indicates that it understood that Cao\u2019s original sentence was within the amended guidelines range and shows that the district court considered the amended guidelines range but determined that no reduction in sentence was warranted. Under these circumstances, the court gave due consideration to the motion to reduce sentence and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The record reflects that the district court was made aware of Cao\u2019s good conduct in prison, and there is no reason to believe that the district court believed erroneously that it could not reduce Cao\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, Cao has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010. The district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-23\">. The Government\u2019s contention that Cao waived in his plea agreement the right to challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on appeal is foreclosed by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
