Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence test, and will affirm the decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record as a whole. <em>Kuevia-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>koe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant to show that the credibility decision was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this test, we view all evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and will reverse the BIA\u2019s findings \u201conly when the record compels\u201d it. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Thus, even if the evidence could support multiple conclusions, we will affirm the agency\u2019s decision unless there is no reasonable basis for the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Shi has not challenged the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination in her petition. Even a liberal construction of Shi\u2019s brief compels the conclusion that Shi has waived her challenge to the adverse credibility findings made by the IJ and BIA. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. McClain of Ga., </em>138 F.3d 1418, 1422 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cIssues raised in a perfunctory manner, without supporting arguments and citation to authorities are generally deemed waived.\u201d). Alternatively, assuming Shi has not waived her challenge, she falls well short of her burden to demonstrate that the credibility decision was not supported by the record. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (holding that the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence). Because the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings have not been challenged, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Shi has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her practice of Falun Gong is supported by the record. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d). Therefore, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-23\">. The IJ and BIA also denied Shi's request for withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Shi petitions for review of only the denial of her application for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
