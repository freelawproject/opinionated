Ford has appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the method used by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to compute the good time credit against her sentence authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-26\">Regardless whether Ford\u2019s sentence is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3624(b) or her own, Ford\u2019s release is not imminent. In light of the \u201ctemporally distant and speculative nature of [Ford\u2019s] claim,\u201d she has failed to establish an \u201cimmediate injury\u201d that would be redressed by the relief that she seeks. <em>See Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2005). We conclude that Ford\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is not ripe for review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>we dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-18\">. Under our case law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) \"makes clear that good time credit must be earned by a prisoner on an annual basis; it is not awarded in advance.\u201d <em>Sample, </em>406 F.3d at 312. Accordingly, a case alleging loss of good time credit becomes ripe when the alleged accrued credit creates an \"immediate injury\u201d to the prisoner that this court could redress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
