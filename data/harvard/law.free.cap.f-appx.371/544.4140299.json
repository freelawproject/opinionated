He argues that the case should be remanded to the district court to conform the written judgment to the oral pronouncement of sentence by including the district court\u2019s recommendation that his sentence run concurrently with any pending state charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">After the parties\u2019 briefs were filed, the district court entered an amended judgment that includes the concurrent sentencing recommendation. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as moot. <em>See Spencer v.
