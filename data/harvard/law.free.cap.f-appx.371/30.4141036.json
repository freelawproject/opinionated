Because Legette cannot show plain error in the imposition of his sentences, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Legette pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (Count 1); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count 2); and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (Count 8). The two firearm charges involved the same firearm, and the indictment listed eight of Legette\u2019s prior convictions. He faced enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851 based on the prior convictions. The plea agreement advised Legette that he faced a five-year mandatory minimum on Count 2 that would run consecutively to the other sentences, and a fifteen-year mandatory minimum on Count 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">The probation officer prepared a presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), grouping Counts 1 and 3 together under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. The base offense level was determined by the most serious of the group, the \u00a7 922(g) offense, and because Legette had prior convictions, his base offense level was 24 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Legette\u2019s criminal history qualified him as an armed career criminal, which raised his offense level to 34 and set his criminal history category at VI. With a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the total adjusted offense level was 31. The resulting guidelines range for Counts 1 and 3 was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. Count 3 carried a mandatory minimum of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">Count 2, which was not part of the guidelines calculations, carried a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). When the mandatory 60-month sentence was added to the guidelines range, the total range became 248 to 295 months\u2019 imprisonment. Under \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2), (3), the guidelines range became 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Legette filed factual objections not rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>vant to the instant appeal, but he did not object to the sentencing guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Prior to sentencing, the government filed a motion for a reduction based on Legette\u2019s substantial assistance, which would permit the court to sentence Le-gette below the mandatory minimum sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, (n.l). At sentencing, Legette conceded that the appropriate guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and listening to the arguments, the court adopted the guidelines calculations and sentenced Legette to two concurrent 176-month sentences for Counts 1 and 3, and a 60-month consecutive sentence for Count 2. The court noted that it had departed from the sentencing range based on the government\u2019s motion for a reduction based on substantial assistance, \u00a7 5K1.1. Legette raised no objections to the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Legette now appeals, arguing that the court plainly erred by imposed the 60-month consecutive sentence on Count 2 because he faced a mandatory 180-month sentence on Count 3, and the court was not permitted to apply both mandatory m\u00edni-mums under the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Generally, we review pure questions of law <em>de novo. See United States v. McDaniel, </em>338 F.3d 1287, 1288 (11th Cir. 2003). But where a defendant fails to raise a sentencing issue before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). We will correct a plain error only if (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if ... the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">At issue in this case is whether \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s prefatory \u201cexcept\u201d clause prohibits the court from imposing the mandatory sentences on both the \u00a7 924(c) count and the \u00a7 922(g) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">This court has held that \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute expressly states that a term of imprisonment imposed under section 924(c) cannot run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, period.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>33 F.3d 1349, 1350 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cNo exceptions are provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Importantly, this holding predates the statute\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d language.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Even if the addition of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause called this court\u2019s precedent into question, Legette cannot show plain error. Legette contends that there is plain error because, although this court had not addressed \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d clause at the time he was sentenced, the other circuits to address it had consistently held that the two mandatory m\u00ednimums were impermissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to Legette\u2019s understanding, however, the fact that other circuits were consistent at the time does not establish plain error. \u201cIt is the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, at the time of Legette\u2019s sentencing, neither this court nor the Supreme Court had addressed the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, and there was no plain error in the court\u2019s interpretation. Legette\u2019s sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-11\">. Under \u00a7 4B 1.1(c), a defendant who was convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) offense and who is a career offender faces an increased guideline range. Because Legette fell into these categories, his guideline range became 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3). Legette does not dispute this calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">. This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\"><em>Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, </em>any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime \u2014 (i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.... (D) Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... (ii) no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (D) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b56-13\">. Apparently, the \u201cexcept'' clause was added to the statute in 1998. <em>See United States v. Easter, </em>553 F.3d 519, 527 (7th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1281, - L.Ed.2d -, 2010 WL 250549 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b57-6\">. Since Legetle\u2019s sentencing, there has been a circuit split on the interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)'s except clause. The Supreme Court has now granted <em>cert, </em>in two cases to address \u00a7 924(c)'s mandatory consecutive sentence in conjunction with mandatory minimum sentences for other offenses. <em>See United States v. Abbott, </em>574 F.3d 203 (3d Cir.2009), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1284, - L.Ed.2d - (Jan. 25, 2010), and <em>United States v. Gould, </em>329 Fed.Appx. 569 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1283, - L.Ed.2d -, 2010 WL 250523 (Jan. 25, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
