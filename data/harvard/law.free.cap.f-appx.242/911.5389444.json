We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the ruling that Zheng failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Zheng cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d). We also find that Zheng\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the immigration judge\u2019s decision to disallow Zheng\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the immigration judge. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
