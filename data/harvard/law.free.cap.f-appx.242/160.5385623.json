Garcia, and Tar-rant County Sheriffs Deputy/Jailer Parker. Hicks contends that the court erred when it <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim following an order requiring payment of the filing fee, before issuance of summons, without allowing him to amend his complaint to correct the deficiencies and without opportunity to develop his complaint factually through either a Spears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing or a questionnaire. This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Hicks argues that defendants violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by (1) failing to protect him, a pretrial detainee, from being assaulted by a fellow inmate even though he had informed them that the same inmate had previously threatened to kill him; (2) failing to train TCSD deputies on ways to protect pretrial detainees; (3) failing to follow policies on protecting restrained inmates from assaults by fellow inmates and other injuries; (4) failing to provide proper medical treatment; and (5) placing him in a restraining chair. The allegations in Hicks\u2019s complaint, if developed further, might have stated a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim. Therefore, dismissal without affording him an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>opportunity to offer a more detailed set of factual claims was premature, and further development of the allegations is required before a proper 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) dismissal may be imposed. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9-10 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. Hicks\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel and for reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s order denying his motion to file a supplemental brief are denied. We express no view on the ultimate merits of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">VACATE AND REMAND; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b185-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
