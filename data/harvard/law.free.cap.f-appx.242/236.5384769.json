At sentencing, the district court calculated his Sentencing Guideline range as 57 to 71 months and then selected a 50-month sentence. Devora-Zuniga appeals that sentence. He argues that he should be re-sentenced because the district court erred in calculating the sentencing range when it determined that his prior Colorado conviction for assault was a crime of violence. We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-16\">1. Devora-Zuniga failed to object to the district court\u2019s classification of his Colorado assault conviction as a crime of violence. We therefore review that alleged error to determine whether it is plain, and if so, whether it affected Devora-Zuniga\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United, States v. Gonzales.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-17\">2. As the Government concedes, the district court plainly erred when it determined Devora-Zuniga\u2019s conviction for violating section 18-3-204 of the Colorado Revised Statutes was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Garcia.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That error resulted in a Guideline range of 57 to 71 months; the correctly calculated range was 15 to 21 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-18\">3. The miscalculation also affected Devora-Zuniga\u2019s substantial rights. In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>we explained that this court has applied two different tests to determine whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights had been violated when a non-Guideline sentence was given based on an incorrect Guideline calculation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>times, we have applied a subjective test and held that a defendant\u2019s substantial rights are violated only when \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for the misapplication of the guidelines, a lesser sentence would have been imposed.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other times, we have applied an objective test and held that the proper inquiry is whether the district court \u201ccould\u201d have imposed the same sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This latter test requires us to determine whether the sentence imposed was reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">In <em>Jones, </em>we declined to determine which test was the appropriate one.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We again reserve that issue for another day. Devora-Zuniga\u2019s sentence cannot pass muster under either test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">5. There is a reasonable probability that, but for the misapplication of the Guidelines, Devora-Zuniga would have received a lesser sentence. The Government argues that the district court based its 50-month sentence solely on the particulars of Devora-Zuniga\u2019s case (specifically, his criminal history), as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) required it to, and the miscalculation that led to the Guideline sentence therefore played no part in the ultimate 50-month sentence. The Guideline sentencing range, however, <em>is </em>one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s discussion of Devora-Zuniga\u2019s criminal history and ultimate selection of a 50-month sentence was done with an eye toward the Guideline range \u2014 as we have put it, the Guideline range was the district court\u2019s \u201cframe of reference.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Walters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given that the court\u2019s frame of reference was significantly off the mark \u2014 the Guideline range used (57 to 71 months) was nearly four times as long as the correctly calculated range (15 to 21 months) \u2014 a reasonable probability exists that had the district court correctly calculated the Guideline range, the sentence given would have been lower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">6. The district court\u2019s sentence also was unreasonable. When a defendant is sentenced to a non-Guideline sentence, the district court is required to \u201cmore thoroughly articulate\u201d its reasons for the sentence than it would have had it given a Guideline sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the further a defendant\u2019s sentence varies from the correctly calculated Guideline range, the \u201cmore compelling the justification\u201d must be for the sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">Here, the sentence the defendant received (50 months) is over two times the top end of the correctly calculated Guideline range (15 to 21 months). The district court handed out that sentence after briefly discussing the defendant\u2019s criminal history and then concluding: \u201cBased on the information available to me, the circumstances of this case, and your particular cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>cumstances, the court is going to find that a reasonable sentence in this case is 50 months of incarceration.\u201d Given the difference between the defendant\u2019s sentence and the correctly calculated Guideline range, the district court needed to pi\u2019ovide a more compelling justification for the sentence. The sentence was therefore unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
