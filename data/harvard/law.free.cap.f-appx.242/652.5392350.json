Batchelor appeals the summary judgment in favor of the South Florida Water Management District and against his complaint under the self-care provision of the Family Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). The district court held that the suit was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">The issue we must decide is whether, in the light of <em>Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, </em>538 U.S. 721, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003), our holding in <em>Gairett v. University of Alabama Board of Trustees, </em>193 F.3d 1214, 1219 (11th Cir.1999), <em>reversed in part on other grounds, </em>531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001), that Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity through the self-care provision of the FMLA remains good law. Batchelor argues that the district court construed <em>Hibbs </em>too narrowly by holding that the decision only applied to the family-care provision of the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C). We agree with the district court; our decision in <em>Garrett, </em>193 F.3d at 1219, is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo. Cuvillier v. Rockdale County, </em>390 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment should be granted if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [ ] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>56(c). Only the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc can overrule the decision of a prior panel of this Court. <em>United States v. Mavte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Under the Eleventh Amendment, a State is immune from suit in federal court without its consent. <em>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 908, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). \u201cCongress may, however, abrogate such immunity in federal court if it makes its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Hibbs, </em>538 U.S. at 726, 123 S.Ct. at 1976. In <em>Garrett, </em>we held that Congress was without authority to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states from complaints under the self-care provision of the FMLA. 193 F.3d at 1219. The Supreme Court, in <em>Hibbs, </em>addressed the authority of Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity for claims arising under only the family-care provision of the FMLA. 538 U.S. at 725-740, 123 S.Ct. at 1976-1984. Our holding in <em>Garrett </em>that Congress is without authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity for claims arising under the self-care provision of the FMLA remains the law of this Circuit. <em>See Marte, </em>356 F.3d at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The summary judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
