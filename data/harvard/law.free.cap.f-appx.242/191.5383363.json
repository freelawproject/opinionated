He challenges as unreasonable the 180-month sentence of imprisonment imposed in his case. Ybarra contends that the district court improperly considered his 2004 arrest for aggravated assault and the facts underlying that arrest in determining where within his properly calculated sentencing guidelines range his sentence should fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-28\">Ybarra has cited no statute, guidelines section, or decision of this court precluding a district court from considering a defendant\u2019s arrest record or the facts underlying his arrest in determining where within an advisory sentencing guidelines range a sentence should fall. The information in Ybarra\u2019s presentence report pertaining to his 2004 arrest for aggravated assault had sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered at sentencing. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831-32 (5th Cir.1998). As Ybarra presented no rebuttal evidence to prove that the information was materially untrue, inaccurate, or unreliable, the district court was entitled to consider it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Ybarra has not shown that the district court district court clearly erred in exercising its broad sentencing discretion by imposing a sentence that failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or represented \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 21, 2007) (06-11834). Accordingly, Ybarra has not rebutted this court\u2019s assumption that his sentence imposed in his case is reasonable. <em>United States v.
