Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), Mitchell was sentenced to the statutorily mandated minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment plus three years of supervised release. Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting that the district court erred by imposing 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mitchell was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">Although Mitchell contends that his fifteen-year sentence is unreasonable considering the circumstances of his offense, the district court had no discretion to depart from the mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Mitchell\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Mitchell requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
