On appeal, we affirmed Evans\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>102 Fed.Appx. 836 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). Evans subsequently moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and the district court ordered that he be resentenced in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At Evans\u2019s resentencing, the district court again sentenced him to 188 months in prison and three years of supervised release. On appeal, Evans contends the district court erred by sentencing him based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and his sentence at the low end of his advisory guideline range was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). In sentencing a defendant, the district court must: (1) properly calculate the guideline range; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000); (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting the sentence, especially a sentence outside the range. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 457. In considering whether the sentence is reasonable, we review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, 441 F.3d 284, </em>287 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">Based on its findings by a preponderance of the evidence, the district court concluded Evans was responsible for 340.2 grams of cocaine base, resulting in a base offense level of thirty-four under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3) (2003), and that a two-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>for possession of a firearm should be applied. With a total offense level of thirty-six and criminal history category I, the advisory guideline range was 188 to 235 months. Evans does not challenge the facts underlying these calculations but argues the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by sentencing him based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We find no error. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Evans next contends his sentence is unreasonable, because it \u201cdisregards \u00a7 3553 factors regarding his age, prior criminal record, and the history of his case.\u201d We disagree. In sentencing Evans to the low end of his advisory guideline range, the district court noted it considered not only the nature and circumstances of the offense but also Evans\u2019s history and characteristics. While the court found it regrettable that Evans would be subject to a sentence of such length considering his young age and relatively minor criminal history, the court reasonably concluded a sentence within the advisory range was appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The court noted a sentence within the range reflected not only the seriousness of the offense but promoted respect for the law; provided just punishment for the offense; adequately deterred future criminal conduct; protected the public from future crimes; and allowed Evans to receive educational and vocational training. The court found there was no unwarranted sentencing disparity between Evans\u2019s sentence and that of his co-defendant, based on the co-defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government. Taking into account all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court reasonably found Evans\u2019s age and criminal history did not justify a variance, but that a sentence at the low end of the range was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
