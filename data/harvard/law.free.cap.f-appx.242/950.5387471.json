In our earlier decision, we vacated Gordon\u2019s sentence and remanded for re-sentencing consistent with <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>174 Fed.Appx. 744 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-23\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether the district court erred by failing to impose a variance sentence based on Gordon\u2019s post-incarceration vocational training and education. In a pro se supplemental brief, Gordon asserts that the determination of his Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> range violated his constitutional rights, that the district court erred in failing to properly consider and weigh the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) factors, and that the sentence imposed violates this court\u2019s directions on remand and is not reasonable. Gordon does not challenge the accuracy of the district court\u2019s factual findings and resultant Guidelines determinations. The Government declined to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-24\">At the resentencing hearing, Gordon acknowledged that the Guidelines range was properly calculated. The district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Gordon after considering the Guidelines range, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Moreover, the district court thoroughly discussed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, we conclude that Gordon\u2019s sentence, which is within the statutory maximum and the Guidelines range, is reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States,</em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We have reviewed the arguments advanced in Gordon\u2019s pro se brief and find them to be without merit. We therefore affirm Gordon\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Gordon, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Gordon requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-25\"> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
