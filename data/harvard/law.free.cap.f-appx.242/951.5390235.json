Regarding the denial of lMJ\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>One Male </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number><em>Juvenile v. United, States, </em>No. 2:06-cv-00030 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 6, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The order denying relief on lMJ\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a' constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that 1MJ has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny lMJ\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, deny as moot his motion to expedite the appeal, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
