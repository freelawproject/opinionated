(Metro) is the named insured on a commercial general liability policy (the policy) issued by Appellees OneBeacon Insurance Company and Pennsylvania General Insurance Company (collectively \u201cOneBeacon\u201d). OneBeacon sought a declaratory judgment in district court that it was not required to cover Metro for losses incurred as a result of a defective product supplied by Metro to a contractor. The district court granted summary judgment to OneBeacon. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-22\">On April 24, 2003, Metro entered into a supply contract with Berkel &amp; Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Contractors (Berkel) to supply concrete for various of Berkel\u2019s construction projects. That same day, Berkel issued an order to Metro for 1600 cubic yards of grout<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for use on a parking garage construction job in Baltimore, Maryland. Berkel constructed piles by first drilling sixty to seventy feet into the earth and placing steel rebar in the holes. Berkel then filled the holes with grout manufactured by Metro. After the grout hardened, other contractors constructed concrete pile caps and columns upon the piles.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">When Metro began manufacturing the grout, it inadvertently mixed the wrong ratio of water to cement, thereby making the grout defective and weaker than normal. To compound matters, Metro was not aware of the defect and delivered the grout to Berkel. After the caps and columns were installed on top of the grout, however, Berkel learned that the grout\u2019s strength was significantly lower than was specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">As a result of the defective grout, Chesapeake Contracting Group (one of Berkel\u2019s contractors) was required to take remedial steps. These steps included demolishing certain portions of the new construction and installing new pilings with new grout. Berkel paid Chesapeake $195,644.00 for the costs of the repairs. Berkel also incurred an additional $89,386.25 in costs, for a total loss of $285,040.25 as a result of the defective grout.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Berkel refused to pay Metro for unpaid invoices in the amount of $241,254.00 because of the defective grout. On May 6, 2004, Metro sued Berkel in state court. Berkel filed a counterclaim against Metro in August 2004, seeking reimbursement for the costs that it incurred as a result of the defective grout.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Metro notified OneBeacon of the counterclaim, but OneBeacon refused to provide coverage for the claim. Metro claims that it expected OneBeacon to provide coverage for the claim because OneBeacon\u2019s predecessor in interest had provided coverage for a similar claim under the previous year\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">On March 14, 2005, Metro and Berkel settled their dispute. Metro agreed to issue \u201ca credit memorandum in the full amount of all of Metro\u2019s invoices to Berkel that are unpaid as of the date of this settlement ..., and such Credit shall constitute full and final payment for the entirety of Berkel net claim.\u201d (J.A. at 161.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In effect, Metro agreed to forego payment for the supplied grout so long as Berkel did not seek payment for its costs incurred in repairing the defective grout. Thus, no actual payment was made by Metro. The parties also agreed to dismiss with prejudice all claims against one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">On June 8, 2005, OneBeacon \u2014 unaware of the settlement between Metro and Berkel \u2014 filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Metro, seeking a declaration that Metro was not entitled to coverage under the policy. After learning of the settlement, OneBeacon filed an amended complaint, seeking an additional declaration that it was not obligated to indemnify Metro for the claims asserted in Berkel\u2019s counterclaim because Metro did not have to pay any damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">On November 7, 2005, OneBeacon filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court awarded summary judgment to OneBeacon on April 19, 2006. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>court found that the dispute was moot with respect to the indemnification question because of the settlement. With respect to the coverage question, the district court found that there was no \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy because any damage caused by the defective grout did not constitute an \u201caccident.\u201d The district court, however, failed to address Metro\u2019s argument that OneBeacon was estopped from denying coverage because it had provided coverage on a similar claim the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Metro timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of OneBeacon, applying the same standard as did the district court. <em>See Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Because the facts are undisputed and we are presented with a purely legal question of insurance coverage, the case is ripe for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Metro contends that the district court erred in finding that there was no \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy and in failing to address Metro\u2019s estoppel claim. To answer these questions, we apply Maryland\u2019s substantive law regarding the interpretation of an insurance policy. <em>French v. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>448 F.3d 693, 700 (4th Cir.2006). We address each of Metro\u2019s arguments in tura.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">\u201cProvisions in insurance policies are to be interpreted like those of any other contract.\u201d <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Himelfarb, </em>355 Md. 671, 736 A.2d 295, 300 (1999). Maryland law does not require that an insurance policy be strictly construed against the insurer; rather, courts must give \u201ceffect [to] the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Rhodes, </em>127 Md.App. 231, 732 A.2d 388, 390 (Md.Ct. Spec.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Under Maryland law, there is an occurrence under a commercial general liability (CGL) policy only upon the happening of an accident. <em>Lerner Corp. v. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>120 Md.App. 525, 707 A.2d 906, 911 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1998). \u201cWhile [CGL policies generally] do not define the term \u2018accident,\u2019 controlling Maryland case law provides that an act of negligence constitutes an \u2018accident\u2019 under a liability insurance policy when the resulting damage takes place without the insured\u2019s actual foresight or expectation.\u201d <em>French, </em>448 F.3d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">In <em>French, </em>we addressed an insurance question under Maryland law. Jeffco Development Corporation constructed a single-family home for the Frenches. Jeffco finished the exterior of the home with a synthetic stucco system known as EIFS, which was installed by a contractor. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 703. Years later, the Frenches discovered extensive moisture and water damage to the walls of their home, which resulted from the defective EIFS. The Frenches filed suit against Jeffco and the question on appeal was whether Jeffco\u2019s insurer needed to cover the claim under their CGL policy. <em>Id. </em>at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">Interpreting Maryland law, we concluded that the insurer was required to cover any unexpected property damage that occurred to something other than the defective object as a result of the defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>object, but the insurer was not required to cover any damage to the defective object itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-4\">[I]f the defect causes unrelated and unexpected property damage to something other than the defective object itself, the resulting damages ... may be covered. For example, if a collapse of [a] veneer had injured a user of the facility or damaged property other than the veneer itself, these may well be covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 702 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Thus, when there is no property damage \u201cto otherwise nondefective parts of [a] building,\u201d there is no \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. In other words, coverage exists only \u201cto remedy unexpected and unintended property damage to the contractor\u2019s otherwise nondefective work-product caused by the ... defective workmanship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">OneBeacon \u2014 focusing on this distinction \u2014 contends that Metro\u2019s defective grout did not damage any other property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Metro, on the other hand, argues that the defective grout effectively damaged other property because the caps and columns that were placed on top of the grout were required to be removed. Because that property had to be destroyed to repair the defect, Metro contends it represents unintended property damage. The district court rejected this argument, finding it inconsistent with Maryland law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">In <em>Woodfin Equities Corp. v. Harford Mutual Insurance Co., </em>a hotel hired the insured to install an HVAC system. 110 Md.App. 616, 678 A.2d 116 (Md.Ct. Spec.App.1996), <em>overruled in pari on procedural grounds, </em>344 Md. 399, 687 A.2d 652 (1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The HVAC system was defective, and carpeting and drywall had to be destroyed to remedy the defect. <em>Id. </em>at 121, 131. The insured sought coverage for the costs of the carpeting and drywall. The Maryland court found that the insurer was not required to cover the property damage because pulling up carpeting and breaking through drywall to access the HVAC system was not property damage, but rather the \u201ccost incurred in replacing and repairing the HVAC systems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132 n. 8. The court further explained: \u201cVoluntarily pulling up carpeting or breaking through dry-wall to access the HVAC units is not property damage.... Even if it could be considered \u2018property damage,\u2019 we would hold that it was not caused by an \u2018occurrence,\u2019 because the so-called damage was not accidental.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">Under this analysis, we agree with the district court that there was no occurrence under the policy. The caps and columns that had to be removed or destroyed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>remedy the defect in Metro\u2019s product are on all fours with the carpeting and drywall that had to be removed or destroyed in <em>Woodfin </em>to remedy the defect in the HVAC units.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In <em>French, </em>we explained that if a product does not meet the contract requirements of a sale, it should not be unforseen that \u201cthe purchaser will be entitled to correction of the defect.\u201d <em>French, </em>448 F.3d at 701. Here, Metro put forth no evidence showing that the pile caps and columns that had to be removed were damaged by Metro\u2019s defective grout. Instead, any harm to the caps and columns occurred as a result of replacing the defective grout. This damage was not unforseen insofar as the term has been interpreted with respect to CGL policies under Maryland law. Moreover, that understanding is consistent with longstanding principles of insurance law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-6\">Replacement and repair costs are to some degree within the control of the insured. They can be minimized by careful purchasing, inspection of material, quality control and hiring policies. If replacement and repair costs were covered, the incentive to exercise care or to make repairs at the least possible cost would be lessened since the insurance company would be footing the bill for all scrap. Replacement and repair losses tend to be more frequent than losses through injury to other property, but replacement and repair losses are limited in amount since the greatest loss cannot exceed the cost of total replacement. If the insured will stand these losses, insurance can be provided more cheaply since the company will be freed from administering many small claims for repairs, and it can set a rate for the more unusual risk of injury to property other than the contractor\u2019s work or product. This risk can be the hazardous one since there are no natural limitations on the damage the contractor might do to a homeowner\u2019s or a neighbor\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Stewart Macaulay, <em>Justice Traynor and the Law of Contracts, </em>13 Stan. L.Rev. 812, 825-26 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Any damage done to the pile caps and columns while remedying Metro\u2019s defective grout cannot be deemed caused by an occurrence under the CGL policy \u201cbecause the so-called damage was not accidental.\u201d <em>Woodfin, </em>678 A.2d at 132 n. 8. Just as a company must be presumed to foresee that it will be forced to pay for any defects in its own property, the company must also foresee that it will be forced to pay for incidental costs that are incurred in remedying those defects. Accordingly, under Maryland law, there was no occurrence, and therefore, Metro is not covered under the policy for this event.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Metro further contends that even if its damages were not covered under the language of the policy, OneBeacon was estopped from denying coverage. The basis for Metro\u2019s contention is that OneBeacon\u2019s predecessor in interest had previously provided Metro coverage under a similar scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">In 2002, Metro provided defective concrete for a project, and that concrete was used in fabricating building columns. Metro\u2019s client was forced to demolish the columns and rebuild them. OneBeacon\u2019s predecessor in interest provided coverage, stating that \u201cbecause the defective columns encased the \u2018work and product\u2019 of others, there is in fact resulting property damage.... The only damages not covered would be the cost of supplying new cement.\u201d (JA. at 277.) Metro now argues that it renewed its policy with One-Beacon in reliance upon the predecessor in interests\u2019 actions granting coverage on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>that claim, and OneBeacon should therefore be estopped from denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Although Metro clearly presented this argument below, the district court, for some reason, failed to address it. Nevertheless, we address the matter de novo, as this is an appeal of a grant of summary judgment and a remand to the district court for initial consideration of this issue \u201cwould be an unnecessary waste of judicial and litigant resources.\u201d <em>O\u2019Reilly v. Bd. of Appeals, </em>942 F.2d 281, 284 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">As a general matter, Maryland law does not recognize estoppel as a means of creating a new contract. In <em>Sallie v. Tax Sale Investors, Inc., </em>for example, the Maryland court explained that, under Maryland law, \u201cwaiver or estoppel may occur only when it does not create new coverage; an extension of coverage may only be created by a new contract.\u201d 149 Md.App. 141, 814 A.2d 572, 575 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]f the loss was not within the coverage of the policy contract, it cannot be brought within that coverage by invoking the principle of waiver or estoppel. Waiver or estoppel can only have a field of operation when the subject-matter is within the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Brookman, </em>167 Md. 616, 175 A. 838, 840 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Metro, however, argues that there are exceptions to the general rule. Specifically, Metro relies on an exception outlined in <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Regional Electrical Contractors, </em>111 Md.App. 80, 680 A.2d 547 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1996). In <em>Nationwide, </em>one of the insured\u2019s switchboards exploded. A company representative immediately contacted Nationwide, and Nationwide told the company that it would \u201ctake care of it\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s why you have insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549. In reliance on those specific statements, the company made the repairs. Thereafter, Nationwide denied coverage. The court held that Nationwide was es-topped from denying coverage because Nationwide told the company that it was covered, and because of reliance on <em>that </em>misrepresentation, the insured had repaired damage and incurred additional costs. <em>Id. </em>at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\"><em>Nationwide </em>thus presented a factual scenario quite different from this case. In <em>Nationwide, </em>the agent\u2019s statements were made \u201ccontemporaneously with the transaction to which [they] relate[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553. Thus, Nationwide\u2019s specific comments at the time \u201cinduced Regional to proceed with the repairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nationwide was therefore estopped from denying coverage because it induced Regional to incur those costs. Nationwide\u2019s statements resulted in a change \u2014 a prejudicial change\u2014 in Regional\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Here, on the other hand, OneBeacon did nothing to induce Metro to supply faulty concrete or to pay for the results of the defects. Moreover, OneBeacon never once suggested that it was going to provide coverage to Metro for <em>this </em>incident. One-Beacon did nothing to prejudicially change Metro\u2019s conduct. The facts are therefore meaningfully different from the facts in <em>Nationwide. </em>Accordingly, the exception articulated in <em>Nationwide </em>does not apply. We therefore apply the general rule baring extension of coverage based on estoppel and reject Metro\u2019s opaque estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to OneBeacon.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-7\">. Grout is a construction material used to connect sections of pre-cast concrete, fill voids, and seal joints. Grout is generally composed of a mixture of water, cement, sand and sometimes color tint. It is applied as a thick liquid and hardens over time, much like mortar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-16\">. Citations to the J.A. refer to the joint appendix filed with this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. In light of the settlement between Metro and Berkel, OneBeacon further contends that Metro suffered no damages under the policy because \"the amount that Metro now seeks coverage for has nothing to do with damage to property, but is actually the amount of the invoices for Metro\u2019s own product, which Berkel refused to pay.\u201d (Appellee's Br. at 28.) Although this argument has some intuitive appeal, we assume, for the sake of argument, that Metro suffered damages under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b964-9\">. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals has since explained the Court of Appeals' partial reversal of <em>Woodfin </em>as \"based on the failure of the trial court to issue a declaratory judgment; it had merely dismissed the suit. What was affirmed was the holding that (1) Wood-fin had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action against Hartford Mutual and (2) that the insurance policy in question did cover certain damages sustained by Woodfin.\u201d <em>Howard v. Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co., </em>145 Md.App. 549, 805 A.2d 1167, 1172 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2002). Most important to our inquiry, Maryland courts continue to find <em>\"Woodfin </em>instructive on the interpretation of CGL policies generally.\u201d <em>Lerner Corp. v. </em>Assurance <em>Co. of Am., </em>120 Md.App. 525, 707 A.2d 906, 910 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
