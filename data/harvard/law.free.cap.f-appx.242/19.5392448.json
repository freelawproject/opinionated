We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Brown\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Brown v. Dotson, </em>No. l:07-cv-00114-03MU, 2007 WL 1033359 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 2, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
