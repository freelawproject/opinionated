The declaratory judgment action was brought by Selective seeking a ruling that Selective did not have a duty to defend under an insurance policy issued by Selective. We affirm the opinion of the district court denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In accordance with the agreed statement of facts submitted by the parties, the facts of the case are as follows: Selective issued a Commercial General Liability policy to A. Widmeyer Driving School(\u201cWidmeyer\u201d). (Joint Appendix at 50, 111). Widmeyer is the only named insured on the policy. (JA at 50, 112). The Selective policy does not specifically identify Thomas Oglebay as an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy. (JA at 50, If 3). The definition of the term \u201cinsured\u201d includes \u201cemployees ... but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.\u201d (JA at 50, 114). The Selective policy provides coverage for damages due to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cpersonal and advertising injury.\u201d (JA at 50, lilt 5-7).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Widmeyer employed Mr. Oglebay to teach driving instruction. (JA at 51, 118). Tracey Mayhew is a mildly mentally retarded adult who was enrolled at Widmeyer by her mother, Carmella Bone, pursuant to a special program where individuals with learning disabilities could learn to drive. (JA at 51,119).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In March and April 2002, when Mr. Oglebay was supposed to be teaching Ms. Mayhew how to drive, Mr. Oglebay sexually assaulted Ms. Mayhew. (JA at 51, 1110). In particular, following classes at the driving school after other students had left, Mr. Oglebay began to sexually abuse Ms. Mayhew. (JA at 51, K 10). Mr. Ogle-bay continued his activity during driving sessions in a vehicle owned by Widmeyer and at Mr. Oglebay\u2019s personal residence. (JA at 51, 1110, 17). All contact between Mr. Oglebay and Ms. Mayhew occurred during the period of time that Ms. May-hew was scheduled for driving instruction. (JA at 53, 1118). Mr. Oglebay has stated that he did not expect or intend to injure Ms. Mayhew through his conduct. (JA at 53,1119).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">When Ms. Bone became aware of the abuse, she filed a civil action in Maryland state court against Mr. Oglebay and Widmeyer alleging \u201cvarious acts of vulnerable adult abuse, sexual assault, battery, and rape upon Ms. Mayhew.\u201d (JA at 51, If 10). The state court entered summary judgment in favor of Ms. Bone on a false imprisonment claim. (JA at 53, If 20). After the entry of summary judgment, Ms. Bone and Mr. Oglebay agreed to a consent judgment against him in the amount of $300,000 apportioned as follows: $275,000 for emotional pain and suffering sustained as a result of the false imprisonment and negligence claims and $25,000 for Ms. Bone for past and future economic damages. (JA at 54, H 21). Ms. Bone agreed not to attempt to collect anything in excess of $10,000 personally from Mr. Oglebay in exchange for Mr. Oglebay\u2019s assignment of rights against Selective. (JA at 54, 1122). At all times during the course of the state tort suit, Selective took the position that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Mr. Oglebay. (JA at 54,1123).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Following entry of judgment in the state court action, Selective filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland seeking a declaration of coverage under the policy. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The district court granted Selective\u2019s motion for summary judgment holding that there was no coverage because Mr. Oglebay was not an \u201cinsured\u201d as that term is defined in the policy. At the district court, the parties agreed that under Maryland law, the intentional acts committed by Mr. Oglebay were not \u201cwithin the scope of his employment\u201d and that the dispositive issue before the district court was whether Mr. Oglebay\u2019s acts were committed \u201cwhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>performing duties related to the conduct\u201d of Widmeyer (the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision).</p>\n<p id=\"AJE\">The district court noted that the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision \u201cmust be interpreted consonant with, even if more broadly than, the \u2018scope of employment\u2019 phrase.\u201d Ultimately, however, the district court found there was no coverage under the policy. In particular, the district court noted that the acts occurred during Mr. Oglebay\u2019s working hours, but rejected the argument that the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d clause was broad enough to encompass intentional sexual misconduct. Ms. Bone timely filed a Notice of Appeal. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Under Maryland law, an insurer is obligated to provide its insured with a defense to a tort action when there exists a potentiality that the claim could be covered by the policy. <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Educ. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>383 Md. 527, 860 A.2d 909, 915 (2004); <em>Litz v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>346 Md. 217, 225, 695 A.2d 566, 570 (1997)(explaining that \u201cthe mere possibility that the insurer will have to indemnify triggers the duty to defend\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">This potentiality determination typically involves a two part test: (1) what coverage and defenses exist under the terms of the policy; and (2) whether the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 193, 438 A.2d 282, 285 (1981). The first factor \u201cfocuses upon the language and requirements of the policy, and the second [factor] focuses upon the allegations of the tort suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it is well-established under Maryland law that any doubt as to whether there is a potentiality of coverage under an insurance policy should be \u201cresolved in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>See U.S.F. &amp; G. v. Nat\u2019l Pav. Co., </em>228 Md. 40, 55, 178 A.2d 872, 879 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The question before this court is whether the district court properly concluded that Mr. Oglebay\u2019s actions were not acts committed \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of\u2019 Widmeyer\u2019s business. Ms. Bone asserts that the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision must be construed more broadly than the \u201cscope of employment\u201d provision and that when construed broadly, the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision would provide coverage for Mr. Oglebay\u2019s conduct. Specifically, Ms. Bone asserts that because all of Mr. Oglebay\u2019s misconduct was committed during the time that Mr. Oglebay was supposed to be teaching Ms. Mayhew how to drive, such conduct was committed while Mr. Oglebay was performing duties related to the conduct of his employer. Essentially, Ms. Bone claims that Mr. Oglebay\u2019s tortious conduct is covered under the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision because there is a temporal-spatial connection between his duties as a Widmeyer driving instructor and his tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Maryland courts have not yet interpreted the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision specifically at issue in the case. In <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Ward, </em>166 Fed.Appx. 24 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished opinion), we had occasion recently to address the interpretation of a nearly identical insurance policy provision under Virginia law and find that approach instructive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">The question before the court in <em>Ward </em>was whether an employee who was finishing her day\u2019s work and locking up the business\u2019 premises was acting \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>[the employer\u2019s] business\u201d when she flicked her cigarette ashes into a wastebasket, resulting in a fire that destroyed the building. We conducted our analysis by identifying the discreet act in question, flicking cigarette ashes, and comparing that with her duties as an employee: \u201cIndeed, because the act of smoking was not within the Employees\u2019 job description or needed to perform a job-related duty, the subsidiary act of flicking ashes also cannot be characterized as the exercise of a duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In this case, the act complained about is false imprisonment arising from sexual abuse and sexual assault. There is no suggestion that sexual contact in any form constituted part of Oglebay\u2019s job description nor that the subsidiary act of accomplishing it in an assaultive way could be characterized as the exercise of a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">To perform the analysis using the more expansive temporal-spatial criteria rejected by the panel in <em>Ward, </em>would result in coverage for a \u201cvirtually limitless number of activities\u201d beyond the anticipation of either the insurer or the employer simply because they \u201ccoincide with a job-related duty.\u201d Ms. Bone cites no authority suggesting that the Maryland courts would adopt that approach, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In <em>Wolfe v. Anne Arundel County, </em>374 Md. 20, 821 A.2d 52 (2003), the Court of Appeals of Maryland specifically rejected a temporal-spatial argument similar to the argument advanced by Ms. Bone. The <em>Wolfe </em>court had to determine whether a tort suit resulting from a rape committed by an on-duty police officer was covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provided coverage for \u201clitigation arising out of acts within the scope of his/her employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 821 A.2d at 58. The rape victim in <em>Wolfe </em>had asserted that \u201c \u2018but for\u2019 [the officer\u2019s] position as a county police officer he could not have gained access to and control of his victim and the opportunity to rape her inside the police vehicle.\u201d Id. at 32 n. 4, 821 A.2d at 59 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The <em>Wolfe </em>court rejected this \u201cbut for\u201d argument noting that \u201cthe litigation arose out of the \u2018act\u2019 of raping Ms. Wolfe and not out of the \u2018act\u2019 of the traffic stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 821 A.2d at 61. The <em>Wolfe </em>case involved interpretation of a clause containing the phrase \u201cscope of employment\u201d and thus is not dispositive of the issue before us, namely interpretation of the more broad \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision. However, the <em>Wolfe </em>court\u2019s rejection of a temporal-spatial standard is instructive in predicting the manner in which Maryland courts would interpret the \u201cwhile performing duties\u201d provision at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">In this case, Widmeyer\u2019s business was providing driving instruction. As a Widmeyer employee, Mr. Oglebay\u2019s duties were to teach his students, such as Ms. Mayhew, how to drive. It is undisputed, however, that Mr. Oglebay was not teaching Ms. Mayhew how to drive during the times that Ms. Mayhew was with him. Rather, Mr. Oglebay sexually assaulted Ms. Mayhew in lieu of performing his duties, i.e. providing driving instruction. Mr. Oglebay\u2019s sexual assault of Ms. May-hew, even if committed during the time or at a place related to his employment as a driving instructor, was certainly not the performance of a duty related to the conduct of his employer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Ms. Bone also argues that the district court erred by \u201cignoring the underlying trial court\u2019s finding on the merits that Oglebay falsely imprisoned Tracey May-hew which was specifically covered under the policy.\u201d (JA at 295). In support of this issue, Ms. Bone refers to a portion of the policy that specifically provides coverage for claims of false imprisonment. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Bone asserts that because the complaint in the underlying tort action specifically included a claim for false imprisonment there was at least the possibility of coverage, thus triggering the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">As noted above, application of the potentiality standard under Maryland law requires consideration of two questions. First, what coverage and defenses exist under the terms of the policy? Second, do the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Here, the policy provides coverage for damages resulting from \u201cfalse imprisonment.\u201d The complaint in the underlying tort suit included a section entitled \u201cFacts Applicable to All Counts.\u201d (JA at 133-34). The factual recitation in this portion of the complaint focuses exclusively on the sexual misconduct of Mr. Oglebay. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the \u201cFalse Imprisonment\u201d section of the complaint, Count III, states that \u201cOgle-bay\u2019s repeated acts of sexual assault and battery and vulnerable adult abuse, as described previously in this Complaint, constituted intentional acts of force or threats of force that restrained Tracey Mayhew.\u201d JA at 136. Thus, although the complaint identifies a claim for \u201cfalse imprisonment,\u201d the factual allegations supporting the false imprisonment claim arise exclusively from the sexual misconduct of Mr. Oglebay. As discussed in detail above, Mr. Oglebay is not an insured under the policy for such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The trial court did not err by not considering whether .the fact that false imprisonment is covered under the policy would create a potentiality of coverage triggering the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
