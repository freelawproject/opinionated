A violation of \u00a7 1326(a) normally carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, but because Gordon had committed an aggravated felony prior to his deportation, the maximum sentence was increased to twenty years imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The PSR calculated Gordon\u2019s advisory guidelines range at 57 to 71 months imprisonment. The district court, after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, imposed a 57-month sentence. Gordon now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">He contends that his conviction under \u00a7 1326 should be overturned because it suffers from two constitutional infirmities: (1) the statutory maximum was increased based on a sentencing factor that was not charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of the Sixth Amendment; and (2) his prior conviction was used to enhance his sentence, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Because Gordon did not raise either contention before the district court, we review them for plain error. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 225, 166 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006). We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Gordon\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). There, the Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to use those convictions to enhance his sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 235-39, 118 S.Ct. at 1226-29. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is still good law until the Supreme Court tells us otherwise. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2096, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Gordon\u2019s double jeopardy argument is also foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. In <em>Mange v. California, </em>524 U.S. 721, 118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615 (1998), the Court held that \u201c[a]n enhanced sentence imposed on a persistent offender ... is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes but as a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 118 S.Ct. at 2250 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">As to his sentence, Gordon contends that we should reverse it as unreasonable. Gordon argues that his 57-month sentence is unreasonable because (1) his offense was nonviolent, (2) he re-entered the United States only after he abandoned his drug problem that was the cause of his original deportation, (3) he cares for his three children, and (4) if he had pleaded guilty a few weeks later, he would have qualified for the \u201cfast-track program\u201d and received a guidelines range of between 41 and 51 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">We expect that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Gordon bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the burden of demonstrating that his sentence is unreasonable based on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the record evidence. <em>Id. </em>He has not done that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We have held that in crafting a reasonable sentence the district court need not consider the disparity in prison time between a defendant who qualifies for fast-track consideration and one, like Gordon, who doesn\u2019t. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2006). As to the other mitigating factors relied on by Gordon, they do not overcome our expectation that the 57-month sentence is reasonable in light of Gordon\u2019s multiple convictions for drug dealing while he was living in the United States illegally; his knowing return to the United States in violation of the deportation order; and his continued lawless conduct (selling counterfeit trademarks) while again living in this country illegally. We have no problem concluding that a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of twenty years is reasonable under the facts of this case. <em>See United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 758-59 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that 60-month sentence for illegally re-entering the county was reasonable where the defendant had engaged in other unlawful conduct and the sentence was at the low-end of the advisory guidelines range); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.) (concluding that 87-month sentence was reasonable for violating \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because, among other things, the sentence was \u201calmost one-third the length of the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2946, 165 L.Ed.2d 976 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
