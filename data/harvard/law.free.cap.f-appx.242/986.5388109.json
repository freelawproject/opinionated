He claims: the district court erred by imposing consecutive sentences that totaled 28 months\u2019 imprisonment; and the district court did not properly consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-25\">Before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release was reviewed to determine whether it violated the law or was plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 925 (5th Cir.2001). Since <em>Booker, </em>our court has not decided whether the same standard applies or if a revocation sentence is reviewed only for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>\u201cunreasonableness\u201d <em>vel non. United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). As in <em>Hinson, </em>we need not choose one of these standards of review because Ruiz\u2019 sentences are proper under either. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The 14-month terms of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release did not exceed the statutory maximum terms of imprisonment the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Moreover, the 14-month sentences were within the guidelines range recommended by Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.4(a). The district court had the authority and discretion to impose consecutive sentences upon revocation of Ruiz\u2019s concurrent terms of supervised release. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 925-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The district court stated the ends of justice and the best interests of the public would not be served if Ruiz remained on supervised release. And, because the sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release were within the applicable advisory guidelines range, we infer that the district court considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in evaluating the relevant factors regarding Ruiz\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
