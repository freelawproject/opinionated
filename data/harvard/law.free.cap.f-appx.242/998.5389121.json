In that \u00a7 2241 petition, Davis challenged his convictions and sentences for conspiracy, wire fraud, travel and transportation of securities for fraudulent purposes, and money laundering. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>226 F.3d 346, 348 (5th Cir.2000). During the pendency of this appeal, Davis was released from prison, and he completed his term of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>vised release. As a result, Davis\u2019s claims have been rendered moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, this appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Davis\u2019s abuse of the judicial system warrants the imposition of a sanction. From this date forward, Davis is no longer allowed to file any documents or pleadings in this court or in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction without first obtaining permission from a judge of this court. The Clerk of this Court and the clerks of all federal district courts within this Circuit are directed to refuse to file any pro se civil complaint or appeal by Davis unless Davis submits proof that he has obtained the permission of this court. If Davis attempts to file any further notices of appeal or original proceedings in this court the clerk will docket them for administrative purposes only. Any other submissions which do not show proof that the sanction has been satisfied will be neither addressed nor acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
