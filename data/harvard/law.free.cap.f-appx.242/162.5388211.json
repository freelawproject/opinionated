(\u201cCapital\u201d). We review de novo and affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">1. Mercer failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting test because she did not show that she was replaced by someone substantially younger than herself. <em>See O\u2019Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., </em>517 U.S. 308, 313, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 1310, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Mercer contends that she witnessed two younger employees take over her duties at the storage facility for a number of weeks. But Capital adduced evidence that the two younger employees were merely temporary and that Mercer\u2019s permanent replacements were approximately the same age as Mercer. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. Mercer has offered no proof to rebut Capital\u2019s assertion that the persons replacing her were not substantially younger than she was. Therefore, Mercer has not met her burden to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">2. Even if Mercer had established a prima facie case, she failed to demonstrate that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons that Capital offered for her termination were pretextual. Capital asserts that Mercer failed to implement directives, secretly recorded phone calls between herself and her managers, and criticized Capital to Equity Based Services, Inc. (\u201cEBS\u201d), the owner of the business by, among other things, sending a fax to EBS stating that Capital would \u201ccost [EBS] severely if something is not done very soon.\u201d These are legitimate reasons for termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">Mercer argues that these problems derived from chain-of-command issues between EBS and Capital; however, Mercer\u2019s difficulties with the chain-of-command do not make it more likely that Capital discriminated against Mercer because of her age. Mercer\u2019s strongest evidence in favor of age discrimination is that one employee witnessed the hiring of many young workers and felt that Capital was threatened by older employees; and that another employee told Mercer he heard a supervisor say that \u201chigher-ups\u201d wanted younger people, although the \u201chigher-ups\u201d were not identified. But the vague feelings of one worker and a statement by a supervisor who did not identify the \u201chigher-ups\u201d who allegedly wanted younger employees (thus making it unclear whether the people to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>supervisor referred were the same people who terminated Mercer) do not sufficiently prove that Capital\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for terminating Mercer were pretextual. Moreover, the district court did not err in holding that the \u201csame actor inference\u201d applies to Capital, weakening Mercer\u2019s case. Capital interviewed and hired Mercer, thus lessening any possible inference that Capital later fired her because of her age. <em>See Nieto v. L &amp; H Packing Co., </em>108 F.3d 621, 624 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
