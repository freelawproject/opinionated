Hampshire contends the district court erred in failing to reduce his base offense level by four pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-25\">In <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>979 F.2d 41 (5th Cir.1992), this court affirmed the denial of a \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(3) adjustment to a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>dant who walked away from a federal prison camp that was similar to the one from which Hampshire escaped. <em>See Shaw, </em>979 F.2d at 42-43. Hampshire\u2019s argument that his case is factually distinguishable from <em>Shaw </em>is unavailing; he has failed to establish that the federal prison camp in which he was confined is similar to a community corrections center, community treatment center, or halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in refusing to reduce the sentence under \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(3). <em>See Shaw, </em>979 F.2d at 45; <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
