He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">Maldonado-Malagon argues that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court failed to consider his arguments for a below-guidelines sentence, failed to analyze on the record the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and gave too much weight to the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. The 46-month term of imprisonment imposed in Maldonado-Malagon\u2019s case fell within his properly calculated guidelines range and is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness pursuant to <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maldonado-Malagon has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in exercising its broad sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>tencing discretion by imposing a sentence that failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or represented \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007). He has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Maldonado-Malagon also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 46-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Maldonado-Malagon\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Maldonado-Malagon properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\">. Maldonado-Malagon argues that his sentence should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness. He raises the issue to preserve it for en banc or Supreme Court review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>Rita v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). The Supreme Court decided <em>Rita </em>on June 21, 2007, and held that a \"court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Rita v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In light of that decision, Maldonado-Malagon\u2019s argument is foreclosed. Maldonado-Malagon\u2019s motion for this court to stay his appeal pending a decision in <em>Rita </em>is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
