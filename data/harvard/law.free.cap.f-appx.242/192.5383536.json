He appeals the sentence imposed by the district court, arguing that the district court erred in holding that his prior California conviction for possession of a controlled substance was an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) in view of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Because Roldan-Olivares did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>410 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2005). This court may correct a forfeited error only when the appellant shows: (1) there is an error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The eiTor must be clear or obvious under current law at the time of the appeal. <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007). If these factors are established, the decision to correct the forfeited error is within the sound discretion of the court, and the court will not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The Government argues that because Roldan-Olivares had two prior convictions for possession of controlled substances, his second conviction constituted recidivist possession under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) and an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(43)(B). The Government argues that because Roldan-Olivares\u2019s second prior possession conviction was an aggravated felony, the district court did not err in increasing his offense level by eight levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Roldan-Olivares was arrested for possession of a narcotic controlled substance on July 1, 1983 and convicted of this offense on February 11, 1985. On October 10, 1984, he was again arrested for possession of a narcotic controlled substance and was convicted of the second offense on October 31, 1984. Prior to <em>Lopez, </em>this court held that \u201cit is only when a person violates \u00a7 844(a) after a prior conviction for a controlled substance violation has become final that the offender may be sentenced under the statute\u2019s recidivist sentencing enhancement provisions for a period in excess of one year, elevating the offense to that of a felony.\u201d <em>Smith v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir.2006). At the time that Roldan-Olivares committed the second possession offense on October 10,1984, he had not yet been convicted of the first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">Because Roldan-Olivares\u2019s first possession conviction had not yet occurred\u2014 much less become final \u2014 at that time that he committed the second possession offense, he could not have been sentenced under the recidivist sentencing enhancement provision of \u00a7 844(a) for the second possession offense. <em>See Smith, </em>468 F.3d at 277. Under <em>Lopez, </em>Roldan-Olivares\u2019s second state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance was not an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 630-33; <em>see United States v. Estrada-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d at 258, 260-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1845, 167 L.Ed.2d 340 (2007). Therefore, the district court erred in enhancing Roldan-Olivares\u2019s sentence by eight levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) based on his prior possession conviction. The error is clear or obvious under the law in effect at the time of this appeal. <em>See Salinas, </em>480 F.3d at 756. Without the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), his offense level would have been 5 and his guidelines range would have been one to seven months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. Therefore, the error affected Roldan-Olivares\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Because the error resulted in an increase in Roldan-Olivares\u2019s sentence, the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Accordingly, Roldan-Olivares\u2019s SENTENCE is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing in view of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b217-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
