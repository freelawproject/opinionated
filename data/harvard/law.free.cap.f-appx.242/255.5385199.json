Lollis, Texas prisoner #04759-068, was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, distribution of cocaine, and a related firearms offense, and he was sentenced to 248 months of imprisonment. Lollis filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the district in which he was convicted, and the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">Lollis filed in the district court a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, seeking relief pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Lollis failed to meet the conditions of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. Lollis filed a motion in the district court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP). The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">Lollis\u2019s claims do not fall under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255; thus, he may not pursue relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>2005); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Lollis\u2019s appeal presents an issue that \u201cis frivolous and entirely without merit.\u201d 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. Accordingly, his appeal is dismissed. Lollis\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
