The district court twice modified Robinson\u2019s terms of release, but Robinson continued to violate the terms of his supervision. The record reflects that the district court properly considered the 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing Robinson\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Robinson\u2019s sentence, which was the statutory maximum, was neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
