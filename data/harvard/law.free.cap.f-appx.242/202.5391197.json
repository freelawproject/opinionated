He argues that his Rule 60(b)(4) motion was proper because he was raising a jurisdictional challenge to his conviction. He also argues that the current federal habeas statutes were never properly enacted into law and that the district court should therefore have construed his post-conviction motion as one pursuant to former federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 451 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">Rule 60(b) provides relief from judgment in civil cases, not in criminal cases. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>169 F.3d 281, 289 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Alexander\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. Moreover, to the extent that Alexander\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court correctly found that Alexander had not obtained the requisite authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 529-31, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551-53 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147, 151 (5th Cir.1999); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255. Finally, Alexander provides no support for his argument that his motion could have been brought under a now-repealed federal habeas statute. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
