New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 90-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">Pacheco-Salazar\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Appreyidi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Toyres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Pacheco-Salazar properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">Pacheco-Salazar also argues that the 16-level enhancement was improper because his 1993 burglary conviction under Florida Statute \u00a7 810.02 was not a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). This court reviews the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo because Pacheco-Salazar raised the issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 256 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1076, 125 S.Ct. 932, 160 L.Ed.2d 817 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">The charging document, on which the enhancement was based, expressly charged Pacheco-Salazar with entering or remaining \u201cin a certain dwelling,\u201d and the judgment for the Florida conviction expressly refers to a \u201cdwelling.\u201d Because the definition of dwelling in \u00a7 810.011(2) includes \u201cthe curtilage thereof,\u201d Pacheco-Salazar\u2019s offense may have occurred on the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of the property, which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>not constitute a \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United, States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303-04 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Pacheco-Salazar was not convicted of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Because the district court improperly calculated the sentencing guideline range, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
