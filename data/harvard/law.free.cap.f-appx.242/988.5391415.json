The BIA agreed with the IJ that Sanchez had waived his opportunity to file an application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">BIA rulings denying motions to remand are reviewed under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir.2000)). Under this standard, a BIA decision must be upheld \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 304 (quoting <em>Pritchett v. I.N.S., </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Sanchez wholly fails to address the BIA\u2019s ruling: pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(b) and (c), Sanchez was required to submit a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) receipt for payment of required fees with his application for cancellation of removal; the receipt had to be submitted before the deadline imposed by the IJ; and, because Sanchez did not file a DHS receipt before the deadline, the IJ properly deemed his application abandoned. Sanchez concedes he did not produce a DHS receipt before .the deadline, but claims his application was nevertheless timely. Because Sanchez fails, however, to address the bases of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal and denial of remand, he has abandoned any contention that challenges the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
