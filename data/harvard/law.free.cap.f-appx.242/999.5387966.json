He argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it treated the guideline range as the presumptively appropriate sentence and placed little, if any, weight on the other sentencing factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The record does not support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Herrera contends that affording a presumption of reasonableness to his sentence merely because it is within the guideline range is a violation of the Sixth Amendment. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Herrera claims his sentence is unreasonable. The record shows that the district court gave adequate, proper reasons for its choice of a sentence within the pertinent guideline range. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 21, 2007) (No. 06-11834); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
