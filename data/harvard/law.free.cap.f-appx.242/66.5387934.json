The district court sentenced him to fifteen months in prison. Crenshaw appealed, and counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), finding no meritorious issues for appeal but discussing the adequacy of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and the reasonableness of his sentence. Crenshaw was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief; however, he has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-16\">Because Crenshaw did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, his challenge to the adequacy of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). We conclude the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Crenshaw\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews a sentence to determine whether the district court has correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range and has considered the range, as well as the factors set out \u00a7 3553(a), and whether the sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005). A sentence within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). We conclude Crenshaw\u2019s sentence was presumptively reasonable because the district court sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>him to the lowest sentence within the correctly calculated guidelines range and below the statutory maximum after considering the factors in \u00a7 3558(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Crenshaw\u2019s conviction and sentence. This coui\u2019t requires that counsel inform Crenshaw, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Crenshaw requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Crenshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
