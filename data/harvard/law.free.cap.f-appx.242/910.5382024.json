We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-22\">The Attorney General may cancel removal of an alien who is deportable from the United States if the alien: (1) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application; (2) has been a person of good moral character during such period; (3) has not been convicted of certain enumerated offenses; and (4) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1) (2000). The applicant bears the burden of showing eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997, 997-98 (9th Cir.2005). Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (West 2005), \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d We find the evidence does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
