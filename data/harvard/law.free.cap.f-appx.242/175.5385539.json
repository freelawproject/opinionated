After obtaining a search warrant, a Deputy resumed the search and found two boxes of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Jones claims he did not consent to the search and, because the Deputies did not have a warrant, the search was unconstitutional. He contends that, before Deputies can gain an occupant\u2019s consent with the \u201cknock and talk\u201d approach, they must reasonably suspect criminal activity is afoot. He further contends his conviction should be set aside because the Deputies testified untruthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">For a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact for clear error, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>E.g., United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 405 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1505, 167 L.Ed.2d 243 (2007). Jones\u2019 claim that false testimony was used to obtain his conviction is a mixed question of law and fact. We review the underlying facts for abuse of discretion; the legal conclusions based on those facts, <em>de novo. E.g., United States v. O\u2019Keefe, 128 </em>F.3d 885, 893 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">\u201cFederal courts have recognized the \u2018knock and talk\u2019 strategy as a reasonable investigative tool when officers seek to gain an occupant\u2019s consent to search or when officers reasonably suspect criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>239 F.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir.2001). Here, the Deputies properly employed the \u201cknock and talk\u201d strategy to seek Jones\u2019 consent. Accordingly, we must consider whether Jones voluntarily consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">Voluntariness, a question of fact, is determined according to a six-factor test: (1) Jones\u2019 custodial status; (2) the presence or absence of coercive law-enforcement tactics; (3) the nature and extent of Jones\u2019 cooperation with the Deputies; (4) his knowledge of his ability to decline to give consent; (5) his intelligence and educational background; and (6) his belief that no incriminating evidence will be found. <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>99 F.3d 170, 175-76 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">In denying Jones\u2019 motion to suppress, the district court analyzed these factors, noting: Jones was at home, not in custody when he consented to the search; the Deputies were investigating a complaint of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>narcotics activity and there was no evidence of coercive law-enforcement tactics; Jones remained cooperative throughout the investigation by consenting to the search, waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and speaking with Deputies on two separate occasions; there was no indication Jones lacked the education or intelligence to understand he was waiving his rights by consenting; and Jones arguably believed his residence contained no incriminating evidence by telling Deputies he did not have narcotics. The district court applied the proper legal standard, and the factual findings made pursuant to that standard are <em>not </em>clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Jones further claims that, because a Deputy testified at trial that the Deputies went to his apartment after receiving a call from an unknown person rather than a reliable confidential informant, as one Deputy stated in an affidavit to obtain the search warrant, his conviction should be set aside. For a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the Government, a new trial will be granted only if \u201c(1) the statements in question are shown to be actually false; (2) the prosecution knew that they were false; and (3) the statements were material\u201d. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d at 893. At trial, the defense cross-examined one of the Deputies about the alleged discrepancy. The court explicitly found the testifying Deputy credible. Furthermore, the firearms and bulletproof vest were uncovered during the search pursuant to Jones\u2019 consent, making the discrepancy regarding the tipster immaterial to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
