The district court increased Mata\u2019s base offense level by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because it determined that Mata\u2019s prior conviction in Tennessee for reckless aggravated assault was a crime of violence. Mata argues that the enhancement was improper because the Tennessee offense is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of aggravated assault. Mata\u2019s argument is unavailing in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Mungia-Portillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 816-17 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Mata also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
