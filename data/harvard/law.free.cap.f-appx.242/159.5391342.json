Bonvillian, III appeals the district court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment to defendantsappellees, and dismissing his other claims without prejudice. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and damages against the defendants, who are the owners and operators of an apartment building, for alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604, and Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The substance of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the FHA is that the defendants\u2019 decision to close the apartment building following Hurricane Katrina had a disparate impact on the disabled and elderly, and on racial minorities, because a majority of the residents apparently fall within these protected categories. <em>See Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank, </em>83 F.3d 1546, 1555 (5th Cir.1996) (holding that proof of a significant discriminatory effect is sufficient to establish a violation of the FHA).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">However, as the district court noted, the building is closed to <em>all </em>potential tenants. In other words, members of classes protected under the FHA are being treated the same as everyone else. Therefore, all tenants were equally affected by the closure and there is no \u201csignificantly greater discriminatory impact on members of a protected class.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">For the foregoing reasons, and those stated by the district court in its Order and Reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
