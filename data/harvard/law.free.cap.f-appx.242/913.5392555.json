The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that Donaldson\u2019s base offense level be increased pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) (2005). Section 2K2.1(c)(1) cross-referenced to USSG \u00a7 2X1.1, which increased Donaldson\u2019s base offense level for his use of the firearm in a robbery. The district court adopted the findings of the PSR, denied Donaldson\u2019s motion for a variance, and sentenced Donaldson to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Donaldson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that the district court erred in sentencing Donaldson. Donaldson was apprised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but elected not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence post <em>-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post-Aoo/c<em>er </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">On appeal, counsel first questions the propriety of the district court\u2019s decision to cross-reference the robbery charge in determining Donaldson\u2019s advisory guideline range. The cross-reference found at USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(c) directs the application of USSG \u00a7 2X1.1, if the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with another offense. As Donaldson used a firearm in the commission of a robbery, the district court correctly concluded that the cross-reference applied. Accordingly, the district court properly applied the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">Next, counsel questions whether the district court erred in denying Donaldson\u2019s motion for a variance. Donaldson\u2019s sentence was at the bottom of the 120-150 month advisory guideline range and within the ten year statutory maximum. Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
