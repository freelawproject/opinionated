Holler challenges his 1987 indictment and conviction and argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights during his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The magistrate judge\u2019s order denying Holler\u2019s motion was entered on June 17, 2005. Although Holler filed a motion to dismiss his conviction and a \u201cmotion for appeal and/or habeas corpus,\u201d Holler did not \u201cclearly evince\u201d his intent to appeal the order. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. Rather, Holler sought to have his conviction reversed or the judgment denying his \u00a7 2255 motion vacated. This motion should not have been construed as a notice of appeal, but rather an unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Accordingly, Holler\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1021-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
