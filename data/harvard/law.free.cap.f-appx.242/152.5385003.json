Fogarty rear-ended a truck while making a delivery in Adams County, Pennsylvania, during the course of his employment as a truck driver for Appellee USA Truck, Inc. USA Truck terminated Fogarty shortly thereafter. In a subsequent Pennsylvania state-court action initiated by the driver of a third vehicle involved in the accident, Fogarty and USA Truck were represented by Pennsylvania attorney Marc T. Levin. Levin withdrew from the litigation because he perceived a potential conflict of interest in the simultaneous representation of Fogarty and USA Truck. Fogarty then retained another Pennsylvania attorney, David Colecchia, only to fire him later. The state-court suit was eventually settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-21\">After moving to Texas, in September 2005 Fogarty filed a <em>pro se </em>action on behalf of his wife, daughter, and himself in the district court for the Northern District of Texas against Levin, Colecchia, USA Truck, and Eric McConnell, a USA Truck Insurance Risk Manager. Though it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>difficult precisely to ascertain the nature of the allegations Fogarty raised in his original complaint, they ostensibly include: (1) legal malpractice and breach of contract against attorney Colecchia; (2) legal malpractice and \u201cinsurance bad faith\u201d against attorney Levin; and (3) wrongful termination, negligence per se, and \u201cinsurance bad faith\u201d against USA Truck and McConnell. After an independent survey of the pleadings and record, the district court adhered to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and dismissed all claims against Colecchia and McConnell for lack of personal jurisdiction, and all claims against Levin and USA Truck for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Because Fogarty did not timely object to any of the rulings below, the litigants contend that the plain-error standard governs our review. We do not agree. Even though a party\u2019s failure timely to file written objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions typically gives rise to plain-error review on appeal, when, as here, the district court undertakes an independent review of the record, we review <em>de novo. See Guillory v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>434 F.3d 303, 308 (5th Cir.2005). This exception to the usual plain-error standard is especially relevant in the context of pro <em>se </em>cases. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1430 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). Our review here is thus <em>de novo. Guillory, </em>434 F.3d at 308. Irrespective of the standard we use, however, there was no error below.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Claims Against Colecchia</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Fogarty does not contest the magistrate judge\u2019s findings that personal jurisdiction over Colecchia was lacking and that venue in the Northern District of Texas was improper. Instead, citing <em>Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, </em>369 U.S. 463, 82 S.Ct. 913, 8 L.Ed.2d 39 (1962), Fogarty contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss without prejudice or transfer the case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) or \u00a7 1406(a). This argument is meritless. <em>Goldlawr </em>stands only for the proposition that a district court <em>may </em>transfer a case even when it lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendants. 369 U.S. at 466-67, 82 S.Ct. at 916. Nothing in <em>Goldlawr requires </em>a district court to transfer a case, nor do any of the circumstances cited by the <em>Goldlawr </em>Court militate against dismissal here. See <em>id. </em>at 466, 82 S.Ct. at 915-16. The record reveals no reason to second-guess the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss all claims against Colecchia or its refusal to transfer the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Claims Against Levin</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Fogarty likewise argues that <em>Goldlawr </em>applies to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Levin. Those claims, however, were not dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, but instead for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Goldlawr </em>does not apply to dismissals made under Rule 12(b)(6). Moreover, Levin did not challenge personal jurisdiction or venue. He relied only on Rule 12(b)(6). Fogarty cannot simply bootstrap his jurisdiction and venue arguments against Levin when only a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is at issue. Finally, Fogarty makes only a perfunctory challenge to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that he failed to plead facts sufficient to withstand summary judgment on the malpractice and insurance bad faith claims. No facts are pleaded to support those claims. The district court did not err with respect to Levin.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Claims Against USA Truck &amp; McConnell</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">Because Fogarty has not briefed his negligence per se and wrongful-termination claims, they are waived. <em>Man Ro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>land, Inc. v. Kreitz Motor Express, Inc., </em>438 F.3d 476, 481 n. 7 (5th Cir.2006); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Next, his argument that the district court\u2019s failure to transfer the USA Truck and McConnell claims was error fails for the reasons given above in relation to the Levin claims: <em>Goldlawr </em>does not apply to dismissals made under Rule 12(b)(6). As to the bad-faith insurance claim Fogarty raises, he has pled no facts to indicate that USA Truck was obliged to provide him with legal representation in the Pennsylvania state-court action. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the existence of such a duty, USA Truck did initially provide Fogarty with attorney Levin\u2019s services. Our review of the record reveals no facts to substantiate Fogarty\u2019s claim that USA Truck violated a duty of good-faith due to him, if one existed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of all claims against Appellees is</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
