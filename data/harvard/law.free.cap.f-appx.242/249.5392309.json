California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cox has filed a response and a request for appointment of counsel. Cox\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is DENIED. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Cox\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
