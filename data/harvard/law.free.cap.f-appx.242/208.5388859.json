Stark argues that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court failed to give due . consideration to the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and did not give sufficient reasons for its choice of sentence. Stark also challenges this court\u2019s application of a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a sentence that falls within the defendant\u2019s guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-22\">These arguments lack merit. The record shows that the district court gave adequate, proper reasons for its choice of a sentence within the pertinent guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 21, 2007) (06-11834); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). Stark\u2019s challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is unavailing. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Stark\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that the district court erred by increasing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) is, as he concedes, foreclosed by this court\u2019s jurisprudence. <em>See United States v. Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d 234, 240 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Stark has shown no error in the judgment of the district court. Consequently, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
