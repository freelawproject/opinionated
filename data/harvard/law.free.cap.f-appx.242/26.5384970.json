We previously granted a certificate of appealability, and after further briefing, we find that Oriakhi\u2019s motion was not successive. Thus, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">In 1992, Daniel Oriakhi was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to distribute heroin and possession with intent to distribute heroin. Oriakhi was sentenced to 300 months imprisonment, and we affirmed his convictions and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d 1290 (4th Cir.1995). On July 9, 1998, Oriakhi filed three documents, which were docketed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and a motion for court records. On August 3, Oriakhi resent the documents and requested that an enclosed copy be date stamped and returned to him. He described the documents as a request for court records with \u201can attached 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 form, and a sworn ... indigent affidavit.\u201d These documents do not appear to have been filed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">On August 10, the district court entered an order requiring the Government to respond to Oriakhi\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion within sixty days. When Oriakhi received this order, he wrote a letter to the court dated August 18, stating that his motions dated July 2 and August 3 were for release of court records under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753 (2000). He stated that his motions did \u201cnot in any form or fashion represent, a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct sentence, as mis-eonstrued by the court.\u201d The district court then directed the Government to answer Oriakhi\u2019s motion for court records. The Government promptly filed a response to the motion for court records. However, the Government did not address the \u00a7 2255 motion until March 5, 1999, when it filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-17\">On March 11, the district court found that Oriakhi\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely and, therefore, declined to reach the merits of Oriakhi\u2019s transcript request. Oriakhi filed a motion for reconsideration, stating that, because he never received any of his requested records, he never filed a \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>motion. The district court denied <em>the </em>motion in a margin order. We denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Oriakhi\u2019s appeal. <em>United States v. </em>Oria<em>khi, </em>No. 99-6513, 1999 WL 604101 (4th Cir. Aug.11, 1999) (unpublished). In 2001 and 2005, Oriakhi filed additional \u00a7 2255 motions. These motions were never docketed nor ruled upon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In 2005, Oriakhi filed a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He sought to raise a claim under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also claimed that his first \u201c \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d should not count against him for purposes of restrictions against second or successive motions because he did not intend for the motion to be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion and he was not given notice that the district court intended to recharacterize it or an opportunity to withdraw. He cited to <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In <em>Castro, </em>the Supreme Court held that, before a district court recharacterizes a motion that a pro se federal prisoner has labeled differently as his first \u00a7 2255 motion, the court must notify the litigant of the intended recharacterization, warn the litigant of the possible repercussions, and provide the litigant with an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. 540 U.S. at 383, 124 S.Ct. 786. If the district court fails to provide the warning, \u201cthe motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\u2019s \u2018second or successive\u2019 restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding that Oriakhi\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion was improperly recharacterized, we denied the motion for authorization as unnecessary, citing <em>Castro </em>and noting that leave from this court was not required for Oriakhi to proceed in district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Oriakhi then filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court raising two claims: (1) ineffective assistance in failing to properly counsel Oriakhi regarding a plea offer and (2) unconstitutional sentence under <em>Booker. </em>The district court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to consider the motion absent authorization from this court, despite this court\u2019s prior ruling that authorization was unnecessary. The district court stated that, after reviewing the record, \u201cit is apparent that <em>Castro </em>has no applicability in this case because none of the Motions to Vacate filed by Petitioner were ever re-characterized by this Court.\u201d The court reasoned that this court\u2019s erroneous order resulted from overlooking the denial of Oriakhi\u2019s previous motion for authorization and from relying on Oriakhi\u2019s misleading description of the procedural background of the case. Oriakhi timely appealed. After we granted a certificate of appealability, the Government filed a brief, arguing that Oriakhi\u2019s motion was \u201cclearly successive\u201d and that this court was likely \u201cunaware\u201d of the motions filed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">On appeal, Oriakhi challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his \u00a7 2255 motion was successive. The question is whether Oriakhi\u2019s 1998 filings eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>stituted a first \u00a7 2255 motion. On the one hand, Oriakhi did file a \u00a7 2255 form. On the other hand, Oriakhi repeatedly informed the court that he did not intend his filings to be a \u00a7 2255 motion and that he submitted the form as support for his motion for court records. He explained that he sought the court records in order to file a properly supported \u00a7 2255 motion. After a review of the record, we conclude that Oriakhi\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion did not constitute a \u201cfirst\u201d motion under <em>Castro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Moreover, we concluded in an identical manner when denying as unnecessary Oriakhi\u2019s 2005 motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, even if the district court disagreed with our conclusion, it was still bound to apply our holding. <em>See South Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Riese, </em>356 F.3d 576, 584 (4th Cir.2004) (observing that mandate rule forecloses litigation of issues decided by appellate court).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Oriakhi\u2019s motion as successive and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion on the timeliness or the merits of Oriakhi\u2019s motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\">. In its brief, the Government appears to state that these motions were denied; however, it provides no evidence to support this assertion and admits that the motions were never docketed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\">. We denied a previous motion for authorization filed by Oriakhi in 2001, prior to the decision in <em>Castro,</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-12\">. Oriakhi\u2019s 2001 and 2005 \u00a7 2255 motions were neither docketed nor considered, and thus, neither counted as Oriakhi's \u2019\u2019first\u201d \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Sosa, </em>364 F.3d 507, 509-10 n. 2 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
