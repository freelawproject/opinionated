In 1998, while serving a five-year term of supervised release following a 1995 fraud conviction, Powell pleaded guilty to using interstate commerce facilities in connection with a murder-for-hire scheme. The district court sentenced him to 10 years in prison on the murder-for-hire conviction. The court also revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 36 months in prison for the revocation to run consecutively to the 10-year sentence. In 2006, Powell filed a motion for immediate release from custody, challenging the legality of the 36-month revocation sentence. The district court denied the motion and also denied Powell\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Powell now seeks IFP status from this court and the appointment of counsel to appeal the denial of his motion. Powell\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-24\">Powell\u2019s argument that the revocation sentence is unlawful in light of <em>Affronti v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 79, 76 S.Ct. 171, 100 L.Ed. 62 (1955), is misplaced. The probation statute at issue in <em>Affronti </em>was repealed by the Sentencing Reform Act, which expressly allows for imposition of a term of supervised release and a sentence of imprisonment if that supervised release is revoked. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), (e). The sentence on revocation may run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 927-28 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-25\">Powell has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on them merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Powell\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is also DENIED. Powell is cautioned that the filing of frivolous appeals will result in the imposition of sanctions. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 807-08, 811-12 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
