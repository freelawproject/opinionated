Rose, the trustee in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding, appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order finding that a conveyance of certain real property was an avoidable post-petition transfer under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549 (2000), but reducing the amount of the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment in her favor from $68,929.18 to $22,080.05. We have reviewed the record, including the opinions of the courts below, as well as the Trustee\u2019s brief and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision for the reasons stated in its opinion affirming as modified the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. <em>Rose v. Bargeski (In re </em>Bargeski); Case Nos. 8:05-cv-00962-RWT; 8:05-cv-01410-RWT; BK-04-01432, 2006 WL 1238742 (D.Md. Mar. 31, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
