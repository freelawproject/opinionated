Faced with a guideline range of 24 to 30 months, the district court sentenced Dezern to serve 30 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution to his former employer in the amount of $282,922.82. On appeal, Dezern argues (1) that his 30-month sentence is unreasonable, and (2) that the district court improperly delegated to the probation officer the task of setting the terms of Dezern\u2019s restitution repayment schedule. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">A. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">Conceding that the district court correctly calculated his guideline range, Dezern nevertheless argues that the length of his within-guideline sentence is unreasonable. It is unreasonable, Dezern says, because the district court did not sufficiently explain how its decision was influenced by the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not address the specific concerns he raised during the sentencing hearing. Dezern says that the following circumstances render his sentence unreasonable: (1) the fact that he has a nearly non-existent criminal history; (2) the fact that he has a deep sense of remorse over stealing money from his employer and ruining his employer\u2019s business; (3) the fact that he suffers from various physical and mental ailments; (4) the fact that crimes like his are typically prosecuted in state, not federal, court; (5) the fact that similarly situated offenders typically receive sentences more lenient than the one he received; (6) the fact that a 30-month sentence overstates the seriousness of his offense; and (7) the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>that he could pay more restitution if he were not required to serve a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the sentence imposed by the district court, we will \u201cconsider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) for the proposition that \u201c[w]e do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we held that, in imposing a sentence, the district court must first accurately calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range and must second consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Those factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with needed medical care; (4) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar histories who have committed similar conduct; and (5) the kinds of available sentences and the sentencing range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We have further explained that, \u201c[although a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range will not be considered <em>per se </em>reasonable, \u2018when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The record in this case reveals that: (1) the district court correctly calculated the guideline range of 24 to 30 months; (2) the district court gave due regard to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) the district court sentenced Dezern within the guideline range. Additionally, we note that the calculated guideline range already accounted for Dezern\u2019s minimal criminal history. No allegation has been made that Dezern will receive inadequate medical care in prison. Nor has Dezern provided any support for the assertion in his brief that his sentence is disproportionate to the sentences imposed on other similarly situated offenders. And even assuming that Dezern would be better able to pay restitution to his victims if he were not incarcerated, we recognize that one of the goals of \u00a7 3553(a) is to provide just punishment for the crime committed. Just punishment may include the need for imprisonment as well as the need for restitution, especially in a case like this one, where the district court explicitly found that Dezern\u2019s conduct \u2014 abusing his position of authority and trust by stealing a substantial amount of money from his employer \u2014 was \u201cegregious and reprehensible.\u201d On this record, we cannot say that Dezern\u2019s 30-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>B. Restitution Order</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Dezern does not challenge on appeal the amount of restitution ordered by the district court. Rather, he makes only an improper-delegation argument, saying that \u201cthe district court erred in leaving it to the probation officer to determine Mr. Dezern\u2019s <em>ability to pay </em>restitution during Supervised Release.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14 (emphasis added). Dezern relies upon our decision in <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir.2002), for the proposition that \u201ca district court judge may not delegate <em>the amount of </em>the monthly <em>restitution </em>payment to a Probation Officer.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15 (emphasis added). In his reply brief, Dezern asserts that the district court violated <em>Prouty </em>because it \u201cclearly did delegate <em>the amount of the payment </em>to the probation officer.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 3 (emphasis added). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Ordinarily, we review a district court\u2019s restitution order de novo. <em>See Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1251. But de novo review is not appropriate in this case. That is because the improper-delegation argument Dezern presses on appeal was not made in the district court. There, Dezern objected only to the amount of the court\u2019s restitution order and not to the court\u2019s alleged delegation of discretion to the probation officer. <em>See </em>R2 at 22-23. So we will review the action said to have been taken by the district court \u2014 the allegedly improper delegation of the court\u2019s statutory obligation \u2014 for plain error. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhere a defendant raises a sentencing argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error.\u201d). \u201cFor this Court to correct plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">According to the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA), a district court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572, \u201cshall ... specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2); <em>see also Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1254. \u201cA restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and in-kind payments.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(3)(A). \u201cIf the ... restitution order ... permits other than immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court, but shall be the shortest time in which full payment can reasonably be made.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Applying these provisions of the MVRA, we have held that the statute imposes an obligation on the district court to set a restitution schedule and to determine the schedule\u2019s duration \u2014 obligations that the court may not delegate to the probation office. <em>See Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1254-55. In <em>Prouty, </em>the defendant objected to the district court\u2019s order that his restitution be paid \u201cimmediately\u201d on the ground that he did not have sufficient funds to make such a payment. <em>Id. </em>at 1254. The defendant asked the court \u201cto impose a reasonable payment schedule,\u201d but the court refused. <em>Id. </em>After the defendant requested the imposition of a payment schedule, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>THE COURT: I will leave that to the discretion of the Probation Office or whoever does that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">Does that fall within your province?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">[PROBATION OFFICER]: When he is released, Your Honor, they do work out payment plans with the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think the statute allows it to be left. I think the statute says, [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">THE COURT: I will tell you what. He will pay what he could pay. That\u2019s the reality of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s fair. I just don\u2019t want an order hanging out there that he is in default of some judgment or some order. He will obviously pay what he could pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations in original). We vacated the district court\u2019s restitution order because it required \u201c \u2018immediate\u2019 payment with an informal understanding that the probation office shall set a repayment schedule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255. We concluded that such an arrangement was impermissible because it \u201cwould in practice defeat the statutory requirement that the court establish any installment schedule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">This case is easily distinguished from <em>Prouty </em>in which the district court declined to set a repayment schedule at all \u2014 a course of action flatly forbidden by the MVRA. Here, by contrast, the district court stated twice during the sentencing hearing that, as a condition of his supervised release, Dezern would be required to make monthly payments of $400 to the extent of any unpaid restitution. In addition to its unambiguous oral statements regarding restitution, the district court, days after the sentencing hearing, entered a written judgment that provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">Restitution totaling $282,922.82 as a condition of supervised release is to be <em>paid </em>at the <em>monthly </em>minimum <em>rate of $lp00.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aik\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">And in a separate recitation of the special terms of Dezern\u2019s supervised release, the court\u2019s judgment went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Als\">Any portion of the restitution that is not paid in full at the time of the defendant\u2019s release from imprisonment shall become a condition of supervision and be <em>paid in monthly installments of $\u00ed00.00 over a period of 36 months </em>to commence 30 days after the date of this judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3U\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Thus, contrary to Dezern\u2019s argument on appeal, the record makes clear that the district court did not waver from: (a) its imposition of a repayment schedule, or (b) its imposition of a $400-per-month payment under that schedule. The district court did not leave either of those decisions up to the probation office. Instead, unlike in <em>Prouty, </em>the district court here fully complied with its statutory obligations. First, the court expressly prescribed \u201cin the restitution order the manner in which [$400 payments], and the schedule according to which [monthly during supervised release], the restitution is to be paid.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2). And second, the court prescribed \u201cthe length of time over which scheduled payments will be made [36 months],\u201d something that the statute says \u201cshall be set by the court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(2). Accordingly, Dezern\u2019s reliance on <em>Prouty </em>is misplaced, and we find unpersuasive his argument that the district court delegated to the probation office the judicial task of setting a payment schedule and prescribing its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">In support of his argument, Dezern points to one comment made by the district court. After the court imposed the $400-per-month restitution obligation, De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>zern\u2019s attorney objected to that amount, saying that, given Dezern\u2019s likely diminished earning capacity after 30 months in prison, \u201cI think a $400 monthly payment is more than the defendant could possibly pay.\u201d Recognizing that Dezern\u2019s $400-per-month obligation would not take effect for over two and a half years, and that his attorney\u2019s objection was therefore speculative, the district court responded: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave <em>that </em>[Dezern\u2019s ability to pay] to the discretion of the probation officer <em>at that time </em>[upon the vesting of the monthly obligation].\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We view the district court\u2019s comment as simply acknowledging two commonsense facts. First, that a probation officer\u2014 who, unlike a district judge, monitors very closely a defendant serving a term of supervised release \u2014 is uniquely positioned to assess a defendant\u2019s financial condition at the future date of release from prison (i.e., to gather the appropriate information, to form a considered judgment, and to report to the court the defendant\u2019s ability to comply with a monthly restitution obligation at which time the court can adjust the monthly payments pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k)). Second, that any contemporary assessment about a defendant\u2019s likely ability to comply with a <em>future </em>restitution obligation must necessarily be made in the future, not on the date of sentencing over two years before the defendant\u2019s monthly obligation begins. In short, we doubt that the comment made by the district court in this case is error under <em>Prouty </em>because the court, despite its passing mention of the word \u201cdiscretion,\u201d did not by that comment delegate to the probation officer any authority to alter either the amount or the duration of the restitution repayment schedule already ordered. And even if error, it is not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that (1) Dezern\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable, and that (2) the district court did not delegate any of its sentencing obligations to the probation officer. Accordingly, Dezern\u2019s 30-month sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
