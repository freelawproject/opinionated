We reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">In March 1999, AMG and Ellis entered into a Property Management Agreement (PMA), the following provisions of which are relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-19\">4.1 <em>Insurance. </em>[AMG], at its expense, shall obtain and keep in force adequate insurance ... against liability for loss, damage or injury to property or person which might arise out of the occupancy, management, operation or maintenance of the Property covered by this Agreement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-20\">4.2 <em>Agent\u2019s </em>Insurance..... [Ellis] must maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance in an amount not less than $10,000,000, Combined Single Limit naming [AMG] and Maritime Realty Corporation. [AMG] must be named as an additional insured as its interest may appear on [Ellis\u2019] insurance policies....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-22\">4.4 <em>Waiver of Subrogation. </em>Any insurance carried by either party with respect to the Property or any occurrence thereon shall, if it can be so written without additional premiums or with an additional premium which the other par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ty agrees to pay, include a clause or endorsement denying to the insurer rights of subrogation against the other party to the extent rights have been waived by the insured hereunder prior to occurrence of injury or loss. Each party, notwithstanding any provisions of this Management Agreement to the contrary, hereby waives any right or recovery against the other for injury or loss due to hazards covered by such insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">8.7 <em>Indemnification. </em>A. [Ellis] shall at all times indemnify and hold harmless [AMG], its partners, members, shareholders and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, actions, proceedings and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, disbursements and court costs) arising out of (I) any breach of the representations and warranties made by [Ellis] in this Agreement or any breach of any term, covenant or condition to be performed or observed by [Ellis] under this Agreement, or (ii) any negligent acts or omissions or willful and deliberate misconduct by [Ellis], its employees, contractors or agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">B. [AMG] shall at all times indemnify and hold harmless [Ellis], its partners, members, shareholders and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, actions, proceedings and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, disbursements and court costs) arising out of (I) ownership or operation of the Property prior to the commencement of the term of this Agreement, or (ii) any breach of the representations and warranties or covenants made by [AMG] in this Agreement or (iii) any negligent acts or omissions or willful and deliberate misconduct by [AMG], its employees, contractors or agents (other than [Ellis]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APl\">J.A. 235-36, 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In accordance with its obligations under the PMA, AMG obtained a policy from Liberty\u2019s predecessor-in-interest, Employers Insurance of Wausau, with limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence, $2,000,000 general aggregate other than products-completed operations, and $2,000,000 products-completed operations. The policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsA\">We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 157. In addition to naming AMG as an insured, the policy also included as \u201can insured,\u201d \u201c[a]ny person (other than your \u2018employee\u2019), or any organization while acting as your real estate manager.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. Finally, the policy contained the following \u201cother insurance\u201d provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">a. Primary Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">This insurance is primary except when b. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">b. Excess Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">(2) Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 169, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">Also as a result of the PMA, Ellis obtained a policy from Zurich that contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the same limits as the Wausau policy and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 840. It included the following Blanket Additional Insured-Contractual Endorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">WHO IS AN INSURED (Section II) is amended to include as an insured any person or organization with whom you have executed a written contract prior to the occurrence of a loss with respect to liability arising out of the performance of that written contract between you and that person or organization, and subject to the specific provisions of the written contract where the provisions of the contract require that the person or organization be included as an insured....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 859. It also contained an \u201cother insurance\u201d provision, which states that the insurance \u201cis excess over ... [a] ny insurance policy which extends coverage to you as a real estate manager.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">On March 2, 2000, Helen Fields-Moore was allegedly injured when she tripped over an electrical cord in a parking garage in Towson, Maryland that Ellis managed pursuant to the PMA. Fields-Moore subsequently filed suit in Baltimore County Circuit Court against AMG, AMG\u2019s parking lot operator (Landmark Parking, Inc.), and other defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties eventually settled the action for $175,000, with AMG and Landmark each paying one-third of that amount, and Fields-Moore agreeing to forgo collection of the remainder for 12 months or until the conclusion of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Liberty subsequently brought suit against Appellants in federal district court, alleging that Zurich breached its duty to defend and indemnify AMG regarding Fields-Moore\u2019s claims and that Ellis breached its duties under the PMA to maintain the required insurance and to indemnify AMG in the Fields-Moore suit. Ellis later filed a third-party complaint against AMG, and the district court granted Appellees\u2019 motion to realign the parties. In considering cross-motions for summary judgment, the court concluded that consideration of the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions of the two policies demonstrated that Liberty holds primary insurance for Fields-Moore\u2019s claims and Zurich holds only excess coverage. The court nevertheless determined that Ellis was obliged under the PMA to indemnify AMG regarding Fields-Moore\u2019s claims. On that basis, the district court granted summary judgment to Appellees and denied Appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the disputed facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Bacon v. City of Richmond, </em>475 F.3d 633, 637 (4th Cir.2007). When reviewing the disposition of cross-motions for summary judgment, \u201cwe consider each motion separately on its own merits to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637-38 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-17\">The parties agree that Maryland law applies here and that the policies pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>vide coverage for Fields-Moore\u2019s claims. They also do not challenge the conclusion of the district court that, absent Ellis\u2019 promise to indemnify AMG for claims such as those advanced by Fields-Moore, the Liberty policy would provide primary coverage and the Zurich policy would provide only excess coverage. Appellants argue, however, that the district court erred in ruling that, notwithstanding the language of the respective policies, Ellis\u2019 promise to indemnify AMG for Ellis\u2019 own negligence required Appellants to indemnify Appellees for the costs relating to Fields-Moore\u2019s claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">As Appellants maintain, Ellis\u2019 indemnification promise does not apply to Fields-Moore\u2019s claims because Ellis agreed to indemnify AMG only for losses that were not covered by insurance. Although Article VIII of the PMA provides that Ellis and AMG will indemnify each other for their own negligent acts and omissions, Article IV states that \u201c[e]ach party, <em>notwithstanding any provisions of this Management Agreement to the contrary, </em>hereby waives any right or recovery against the other for injury or loss due to hazards covered by\u201d \u201cinsurance carried by either party with respect to the Property or any occurrence thereon.\u201d J.A. 236 (emphasis added). These provisions, when read together, plainly demonstrate the parties\u2019 intent to indemnify each other for <em>uncovered </em>losses arising from their own negligence but to look only to their insurers, and not to each other, in the event of a covered loss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Fields-Moore\u2019s claims are indisputably covered by insurance, Ellis\u2019 indemnification promise does not apply. Accordingly, Zurich\u2019s policy provided only excess coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, because the settlement was within the limits of Liberty\u2019s primary coverage, Zurich breached no duty by refusing to indemnify AMG for any part of the settlement, or to participate in the legal defense of those claims, <em>see Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Rairigh, </em>59 Md.App. 305, 475 A.2d 509, 518 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1984) (\u201c[T] he excess insurer is not obligated to defend until the primary limits are exhausted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Our holding that Ellis\u2019 indemnification promise does not apply to Fields-Moore\u2019s suit forecloses all of Appellees\u2019 claims except the claim that Ellis breached its duty under the PMA to obtain insurance that would provide primary coverage for any claims that were also covered by AMG\u2019s insurer. This claim fails for a different reason, namely, that the PMA creates no such duty. Article IV, on which Liberty relies, requires Ellis only to \u201cmaintain Commercial General Liability Insurance in an amount not less than $10,000,000, Combined Single Limit nam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ing [AMG] and Maritime Realty Corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> J.A. 236. But, that same article also requires AMG to obtain insurance for loss, damage or injury to property or person that might arise out of the \u201coccupancy, management, operation or maintenance of the Property\u201d covered by the PMA. <em>Id. </em>at 235. The agreement is silent regarding which insurance would be primary in the event that both covered a particular claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In sum, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Appellees and in denying summary judgment to Appellants. Accordingly, we reverse the district court order and remand for entry of judgment in favor of Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">. Fields-Moore subsequently amended her complaint to allege claims against Ellis, but those claims were dismissed as being time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-5\">. The district court concluded that this reading would \"render Ellis\u2019 promise to indemnify AMG meaningless.\" J.A. 483. But that is simply not the case. The indemnification promise clearly applies to any loss for which the policies do not provide coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">. Moreover, even if Ellis\u2019 indemnification promise applied to Fields-Moore's claims, the Zurich policy still would provide only excess coverage. As we recently held on materially identical facts, the indemnification agreement between the insureds here affects only liability between those parties; it does not define the obligations that the respective insurers have to their insureds. <em>See Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>444 F.3d 217, 224-25 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, even if Ellis\u2019 indemnification promise required it to indemnify AMG for all of the costs relating to Fields-Moore\u2019s claims, that still leaves the question of which policy provides primary coverage for Ellis' liability. That question necessarily must be resolved by the language of the respective policies, which establishes that Liberty provided primary coverage for such liability and Zurich\u2019s coverage was excess only. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-17\">. Ellis apparently maintained insurance in the amount of only $1,000,000. The district court noted, however, that the parties agree that this apparent failure to comply with the terms of the PMA is not at issue since Fields-Moore\u2019s claims amount to less than $1,000,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
