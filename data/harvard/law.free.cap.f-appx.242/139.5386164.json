Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Smith argues on appeal that Leonard, the Galveston County Sheriffs Department, and the County of Galveston acted with gross negligence by failing to place a shower mat in the shower exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>As </em>to Smith\u2019s claims against Leonard, to the extent that Smith is arguing that Leonard merely was negligent in failing to provide a shower mat, negligence does not impose liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1329 n. 3 (5th Cir.1996). Smith\u2019s brief also may be liberally construed to contend that Leonard\u2019s actions violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Smith contends that Leonard knew about the slippery conditions in the shower because another inmate had filed a grievance about them, because Leonard had worked in the jail before becoming sheriff, and because the medical infirmary had a nonslip shower exit. Because Smith did not raise the latter two arguments in the district court, he may not raise them for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). As to his first argument, Smith has not shown that there was an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303-04 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As to Smith\u2019s claims against Galveston County, Smith has not shown that an official policy or custom of the County of Galveston mandated the lack of nonslip shower exits or that the County had any authority to make such a policy. Accordingly, the fact that the district court did not address Smith\u2019s claims against the County of Galveston is not reversible error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Smith also contends that he included the Galveston County Sheriffs Department as a defendant in the case when he sued Leonard in his official capacity and added the phrase \u201cET AL\u201d after Leonard\u2019s name. However, because Smith did not name the Sheriffs Department as a defendant in his complaint, he may not raise a new claim against the Sheriffs Department on appeal. <em>See Leverette, </em>183 F.3d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Smith\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaint as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Smith v. Leonard, </em>No. 3:06-CV-179, 2006 WL 1737528 (S.D. Tex. June 22, 2006). Smith is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See \u00a7 </em>1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
