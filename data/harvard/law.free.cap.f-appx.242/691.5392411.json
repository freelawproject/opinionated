Johnson generally contends the district court erred by adding two points to his criminal history score, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d), rendering him ineligible for safety-valve relief. We address his specific arguments in turn, and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>When calculating the defendant\u2019s criminal history score, the sentencing court must add two criminal history points \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). The commentary to this guideline further explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">[a] defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding <em>(e.g., </em>a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, comment, (n.4). A defendant who commits the instant offense while a probation-violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1(d) if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Johnson first contends, without legal support, that his 1998 probation-violation warrant was too remote in time to be considered active. \u201c \u2018The plain language of the Guidelines indicates that two points are to be added whenever an outstanding warrant is in existence, regardless of whether the warrant is stale pursuant to state law at the time of sentencing, and irrespective of whether state authorities may have been lax in attempting to execute the warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>313 F.3d 1300, 1305 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Elmore, </em>108 F.3d 23, 27 (3d Cir.1997)). \u201c[Rjegardless of how long a warrant has been outstanding, as long as a violation warrant exists, it is a criminal justice sentence for purposes of the criminal history calculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Johnson conceded there was an outstanding warrant against him at the time he committed the instant offenses. Further, Johnson did not dispute that the sentence for which the probation-violation warrant was issued, namely, his first-degree forgery conviction, was otherwise countable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(m). It was irrelevant whether the warrant became invalid due to the lack of diligence by state authorities in failing to execute it, or that it was too remote in time to be considered. <em>See Davis, </em>313 F.3d at 1305-06. Moreover, the Government was not required to prove that the warrant was not stale. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the argument the warrant was too remote is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Johnson also maintains, again without legal support, that the assessment of two additional criminal history points was improper because no evidence showed that Johnson had notice that a violation of probation warrant was pending. A defendant is not required to know that a probation-violation warrant is outstanding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). Further, Johnson admitted that he violated the terms of his probation by failing to report to probation authorities in Florida. Moreover, our decision in <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>413 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1030, 126 S.Ct. 1594, 164 L.Ed.2d 318 (2006), is instructive with respect to this argument. In <em>Phillips, </em>we held a defendant\u2019s subjective belief regarding whether or not his parole term had expired was irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>at 1292. Similarly, in the instant case, Johnson\u2019s subjective belief regarding whether or not a probation-violation warrant had been issued against him was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Finally, Johnson argues, citing a case from another circuit, that it would be unfair to assess criminal history points if his inability to pay restitution was the basis for the probation-violation warrant. This argument is without merit because we have held the district need not inquire into the warrant\u2019s validity or the reason the warrant was issued before applying the two-point enhancement under \u00a7 4A1.1(d). <em>See Davis, </em>313 F.3d at 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in adding two points to Johnson\u2019s criminal history score, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). <em>See id., </em>313 F.3d at 1305 (reviewing \u201ca district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de </em>novo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
