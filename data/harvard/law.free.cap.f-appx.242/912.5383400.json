The district court entered its final judgment order denying Jordan\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and that judgment disposed of Jordan\u2019s pending motions, including his motion to compel production of transcripts. This court subsequently denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed his appeal of that order. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>223 Fed.Appx. 272 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished). We therefore deny Jordan\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus as moot. We grant Jordan leave to proceed in forma pauperis in this court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
