The district court overruled Williams\u2019 objections to the presentence report and adopted the recommended enhancements for a loss in excess of $51,000 and theft from the person of another. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(D), (b)(3) (2005). The court also departed above the advisory guideline range of 30-37 months pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., and imposed concurrent sentences of five years (the statutory maximum) for Count One, and ninety-six months for Counts Two and Three. Williams appeals his sentence, arguing that (1) the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning the sentence violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), (2) the district court\u2019s upward departure was unreasonable, and (3) the district court failed to make findings of fact to support enhancements for the loss amount and theft from a person. We affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory guideline range, but conclude that the court\u2019s explanation for the departure was inadequate. We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Williams first contends that this Circuit\u2019s precedents have effectively made the guidelines mandatory despite <em>Booker </em>and that, consequently, the district court\u2019s factual findings violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We disagree and, in any case, may not overrule the decision of another panel. <em>United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Next, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Dalton, </em>477 F.3d 195, 197 (4th Cir.2007) (standard of review). The court noted that no criminal history points were given for eleven of Williams\u2019 prior sentences, that ten of the prior offenses were felonies involving conduct similar to that underlying the instant offenses and that they were committed while Williams was on probation or free on bond. However, given the extent of the departure, the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasons for departing to a sentence of ninety-six months was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">We agree with the government that the district court erred when it structured the departure by treating Williams as a de facto career offender. A defendant may be sentenced under \u00a7 4A1.3 as a de facto career offender if he would qualify for sentencing as a career offender but for the fact that one or both of his predicate convictions may not be counted. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>58 F.3d 115, 118 (4th Cir.1995). Williams had the necessary predicate convictions, but did not otherwise qualify as a career offender because the instant offenses are not crimes of violence. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">The district court\u2019s alternative explanation for the ninety-six-month sentence did not comply with the procedure set out in \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B) for a departure above category VI, which states that the court \u201cshould structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.\u201d <em>See Dalton, 477 </em>F.3d at 199. The district court arrived at an offense level of 24 (reduced to 21 for acceptance of responsibility) and a range of 77-96 months by treating Williams as a de facto career offender. The court did not explain how, using the alternative extrapolation method, it again arrived at a sentence of ninety-six months. Because the departure sentence was more than two and a half times the top of the advisory guideline range, a \u201cmore extensive justification\u201d for the extent of the departure is necessary. <em>Dalton, 477 </em>F.3d at 199-200. Therefore, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Williams also argues that, if the district court did not violate his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, the sentence was unreasonable because the court failed to make factual findings concerning the amount of loss and theft from the person of another. He acknowledges that the court adopted the recommendations in the presentence report, but maintains that the court\u2019s failure to make explicit findings makes the sentence procedurally unreasonable. <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 344 (4th Cir.2006) (reasonableness has both procedural and substantive aspects). In this case, the district court\u2019s decision to overrule Williams\u2019 factual objections and adopt the calculation in the presentence report did not require detailed findings because undisputed facts supported both contested enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision to apply enhancements for loss and theft from a person under USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D) and (b)(3). However, because the court\u2019s explanation of its upward departure was insufficient, we vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\"> Count Two of the indictment charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.
