Stell Gaines, Sr., Texas prisoner # 843480, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his petition invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The district court recharacterized it as a petition for mandamus because Gaines was requesting that the district court issue an order directing the state courts in the performance of them duties. Because Gaines did not challenge the manner in which his sentence was being executed, the district court did not err in recharacterizing Gaines\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a petition for mandamus. <em>See Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 694 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cSection 2241 ... is the proper habeas remedy for challenging the execution of a sentence.\u201d). Nor did the district court err in then dismissing it. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, De Kalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973) (\u201c[A] federal court lacks the general power to issue writs of mandamus to direct state courts and their judicial officers in the performance of their duties where mandamus is the only relief sought.\u201d). Gaines also argues that under <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), the district court was required to notify him before recharacterizing his petition. Gaines\u2019s reliance on <em>Castro </em>is misplaced, as <em>Castro </em>imposes a notice requirement \u201cwhen a court recharacterizes a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 383, 124 S.Ct. 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">. Gaines\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s use of the PLRA\u2019s standard of review is unavailing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Gaines does not need a COA to appeal from the denial of either a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition or a petition for mandamus. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001); \u00a7 2253(c)(1). Gaines\u2019s request for a COA is therefore DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
