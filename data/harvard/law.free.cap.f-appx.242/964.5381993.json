He argues for the first time on appeal that PCP is a Schedule II controlled substance and that the district court, therefore, erred by using the statutory maximum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) when applying the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). He also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the career offender enhancement on the ground that PCP was a Schedule III controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">Contrary to McDade\u2019s assertion, PCP is a Schedule II controlled substance. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(a); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12. Accordingly, McDade has not shown that the district court erred by using the statutory maximum sentence set forth in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">Any objection to the application of \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) on the ground that PCP was a schedule III controlled substance would have been frivolous. Accordingly, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this issue before the district court. <em>See United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 392-93 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Green v. Johnson, </em>160 F.3d 1029, 1037 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b989-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
