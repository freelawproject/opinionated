Razaq argues that the BIA applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that he had not rebutted the presumption that his prior conviction was for a particularly serious crime. <em>See In re Y-L-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 270, 276-77 (BIA 2002). We review this contention de novo. <em>See Soriano v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 318, 320 (5th Cir.2007). However, to the extent that Razaq is challenging the merits of the determination that his crime was particularly serious, we lack jurisdiction over his claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B), 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931, 933 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">Under the INA, an alien is statutorily ineligible for the withholding of removal after \u201chaving been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime.\u201d \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B). Because the withholding of removal under the CAT also shall be denied if the alien falls within \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B), a respondent who has been convicted of a particularly serious crime is likewise ineligible for withholding of removal under the CAT. 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u00a7 1208.16(d)(2). An alien may rebut the presumption that his conviction was for a particularly serious crime by satisfying six criteria set forth in <em>Y-L- </em>28 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 276-77. One of those criteria is \u201cmerely peripheral involvement by the alien in the criminal activity, transaction, or conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Razaq argues that under <em>Y-L-, </em>the peripheral-involvement criterion \u201clooks to the alien\u2019s own \u2018involvement\u2019 in any drug \u2018conspiracy,\u2019 separate and apart from the person\u2019s involvement in a particular \u2018activity\u2019 or \u2018transaction.\u2019 \u201d He argues that the BIA thus erred when it rejected his claim based solely on the conclusion that his involvement in the criminal activity or transaction was not peripheral. Razaq\u2019s argument is untenable, however, because Razaq was convicted as a seller, not as a member of a conspiracy. His suggested interpretation of <em>Y-L- </em>is not rational, and his reliance on <em>Lavira v. Attorney General, </em>478 F.3d 158 (3d Cir.2007), is unavailing. Accordingly, his petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
