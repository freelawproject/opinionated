In implementing a mandate upon remand, the district court \u201cmust proceed within the letter and spirit of the mandate by taking into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>account the appeals court\u2019s opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\u201d <em>United, States v. Pineiro, </em>470 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.2006). The district court complied with this court\u2019s mandate by allowing the Government\u2019s informant to testify and assessing the credibility of his testimony with respect to drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Aguirre argues that the preponderance of the evidence did not show that the Government\u2019s informant was credible or that Aguirre was responsible for distributing over 3000 kilograms of marijuana. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court continues to review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). The district court extensively questioned the Government\u2019s informant at resentencing and also heard the informant\u2019s testimony on redirect and cross-examination, which allowed the district court to evaluate the credibility of the informant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The informant\u2019s testimony showed that his various trips to Houston to transport marijuana were all part of the same course of conduct and, thus, constituted relevant conduct. Based upon the informant\u2019s testimony, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Aguirre was responsible for over 3000 kilograms of marijuana. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 172 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Aguirre also argues that the district court erred by denying him a reduction based on acceptance of responsibility. Notwithstanding the Government\u2019s assertion to the contrary, Aguirre\u2019s argument is properly before this court. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>619 F.2d 366, 367 (5th Cir.1980). The district court\u2019s determination that Aguirre did not accept responsibility for what the evidence showed his conduct was is not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
