The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez v.

He therefore would not legally be able to attend any resentencing, as is required by Fed. R.Crim. P. 43, should this court remand his case. We are unable to grant Sifuentes relief. His appeal is moot and is dismissed. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 25, 2007) (No. 06-12082).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
