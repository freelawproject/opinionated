Maniklal-Patel has abandoned any challenges to the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the motion to reopen he filed with the immigration judge by failing to brief any issues relevant to that motion. <em>See Al Ra\u2019id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 33 (5th Cir.1995). Maniklal-Patel argues that his BIA motion to reopen met the requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Maniklal-Patel has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
