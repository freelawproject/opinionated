Moreno-Parada\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Moreno-Parada\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Moreno-Parada was given an opportunity to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guidelines range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. A sentence within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-18\">At sentencing, Moreno-Parada failed to object to the calculation of the guidelines range as set forth in the presentence report. The district court imposed a sentence of ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within the advisory guidelines range of seventy-seven to ninety-six months and well below the statutory maximum of twenty years\u2019 incarceration. Accordingly, the sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range and properly noted that it had considered the relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). Moreno-Parada has made no showing that the sentence is proeedurally or substantively unreasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Therefore, we find that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this ease and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Moreno-Parada\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
