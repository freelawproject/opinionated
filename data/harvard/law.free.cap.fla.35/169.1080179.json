Carter, Appellant, vs. James. R. Smith, Appellee.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b209-6\">1, If a bill for relief is so vague and indefinite that it does not state any case upon which a court of equity will grant relief, it will be demurrable .for want of equity.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b209-8\">2. No such practice is known in equity as compelling a plaintiff to join as a co-plaintiff a person not a party, on the application of such person.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b209-10\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Levy county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An\">statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-11\">This is a suit brought by the appellee against the appellant in the Circuit Court for Levy county, in chancery, and the ultimate relief prayed for in the bill is that the appellee be made a co-plaintiff in another suit pending in the same court against the appellant, to which he is not a party, and be allowed to participate in the relief prayed for in the bill in that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-12\">The appellant interposed a general demurrer to the bill. The cause was afterwards heard upon this demurrer, and the court made an order overruling the demurrer and requiring the appellant to answer the bill. Whereupon the appellant appealed to this court, and assigned this order for error in his petition of appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-13\"><em>Syd. L.

These matters are left to conjecture. In the absence of information touching them, we are unable to discover from the bill that the appellee is either a necessary or proper party to that other suit. The bill, therefore, is-so vague and indefinite that it does not state any case-upon which a court of equity will grant relief. Besides, there is no practice in equity which will authorize the court, upon the application of a person not a party to a suit, to compel a plaintiff to make such, person a co-plaintiff.
