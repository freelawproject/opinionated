D. Bloxham, Comptroller, and John A. Pearce, Sheriff, Appellants, vs. Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad Company, Appellee.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b665-7\">1. A claim that the exemption of certain railroad property from; taxation provided for in the eighteenth section of the Internal Improvement act (Chapter 610 laws of Florida, act of 1855-6, McClellan\u2019s Digest, sec. 21, page 596) is a continuing exemption, that is an incident of the property attached to the <em>renn, </em>and follows it into whosoever hands the same may come, can not be maintained.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b665-9\">2. That the right of exemption from taxation which under the Internal Improvement act, referred to in the preceding headnote, vested in the original owners and builders of the roads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>exempted, was a personal privilege, and did not pass with the assignment <em>of </em>the property, is by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company vs. Palmes, </em>109 <em>U. S., </em>244, a proposition beyond the reach of cayil or controversy, and is no more open to discussion in this State.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b666-5\">3. No corporation can be created in this State since the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, or the amendments of 1875, capable of ; accepting and enjoying the privilege of exemption from taxation provided for in the eighteenth section of the Internal Improvement act, referred to in preceding head-cotes.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b666-6\">1. Railroads built or acquired by corporations coming into existence after the adoption of our Constitution of 1868, whether in the hands of the original building corporations or their assignees and successors, were liable to taxation under that Constitution in like manner as other property.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"Ama\">5. A State can not be sued without its consent. The suit in the -court below, while against two officers of the State named as defendants, was, as to one of the objects sought to be accomplished by it, to all intents and purposes a suit against the State for the recovery of money, and a judgment or decree against such officers would have been a judgment or decree against the State. This branch of the suit should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AEq\">6. <em>By </em>saying that a State can not be sued without its consent, as stated in preceding head-note, it is not meant that no judicial action under any circumstances whatever can be taken against the State, but, confining ourselves to the facts of this particular csase, that a suit like that before us \u2014 a suit for the recovery of money \u2014 whether in' the form of a bill in equity, or in the nature of an action of assumpsit, does not lie against the sovereign State.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b666-9\">7. The Constitutions of this State, both of 1868 and <em>1885, contain, </em>a section as follows: \u201c Provision may be made by general law for briging suits against the State as to all liabilities now existing or hereafter originating,\u201d but no such provision having-been made by the Legislature, these sections were inoperative to change the general principles upon which we hold that the State is not liable to be sued.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AcA\"><em>8. </em>Appellee claimed that it is entitled to have certain railroad property exempted from taxation, because it and its predecessors contracted and invested their money in the property under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>judicial construction once prevailing in .this State declaring that the exemption provided for in the eighteenth section of the Internal Improvement act attached to property of this kind as an incident, without regard to changes in ownership of the same; that they relied upon such judicial construction, and invested their money upon faith in the exemption from taxation therein declared: <em>Held, </em>Without determing the effect of such judicial construction, that appellee should not have its property declared exempt from taxation by reason thereof, because the more important and vital question as to whether the appellee or its predecessors were such corporations as under the Constitution of 1868 could avail themselves of such exemption from taxation, had not been determined in this State, and upon the proper determination of this question the property would be liable to taxation in the hands of appellee and its predecessors without reference to the judicial construction referred to. It can not avail appellee that the property was exempt from taxation if it and its predecessors were such corporations as were prohibited by the Constitution from holding the same \u25a0as exempt.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b667-5\">9. All property in the State ought to bear its just burden of taxation, and there can be no doubt, because it is well established by authority, that if property lawfully liable thereto escapes taxation for any one or more years, it is competent for the Legislature to provide for the collection of such taxes in arrears from the owners of the property during the time for which it escaped taxation, or from purchasers of the same, whose rights or titles accrued after a lien for such taxes had been acquired by the State by subjecting the property taxed to the payment of the same.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b667-6\">10. When the time for the assessment and collection of taxes has passed, and the taxing statute affixes no lien to the property, the State has made no assessment, or taken any other step to collect the same, real estate can not be pursued for back taxes when it has gone into the hands of innocent purchasers for value. Railroads, under the statute of this State, are real estate.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b667-8\">11. Under our laws, as they existed prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes, there was no lien upon real estate for its taxes until fixed by an assessment of the same.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b667-10\">12. We hold that under the facts and circumstances of this case, upon principles of law stated in the next three succeeding head-notes, that the appellee was not an innocent purchaser for value of the property sought to be subjected to taxation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>13. <em>A </em>transfer of property subject to taxation by persons in their individual capacity to themselves as constituting a corporation, does not constitute such corporation an innocent purchaser of said property so as to defeat the State\u2019s claim for taxes thereon.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b668-6\">14. When a new corporation is created by the consolidation of two or more other corporations, and no provision is made by statute or the articles of incorporation for the payment of the debts and liabilities of the constituent corporations, the new corporation assumes all the debts and liabilities of the constituent companies, which follow as an incident of the consolidation; and under such circumstances such consolidated corporation is not an innocent purchaser for value of the property of its constituent companies, so as to prevent the State from subjecting the same to payment of taxes thereon.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b668-8\">15. A corporation from whom taxes are due the State can not defeat the collection thereof by vesting its property subject to taxes in another corporation, of which it remains a constituent part.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b668-10\">16. Lines of railroad which were not in existence during the years 1879,1880 and 1881 can not be taxed for those years that passed away before they were built; neither can they be subjected to sale for payment of taxes due upon other railroads by reason of the accidental circumstance that they have become the property of the same corporation that owns the roads liable-to taxation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b668-12\">17. The act of 1885 (Chapter 3558 laws of Florida) is general in its terms, embraces all of a class \u2014 all railroads in a similar condition. It is not a special or local law for the assessment and collection of taxes, but is of general and uniform operation throughout the State, and is not in conflict with any provision of the State Constitution.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b668-14\">18. The courts can not be influenced in their action by objections. which apply not to the constitutionality, but only to the policy, the justice and wisdom of the law. The relief from such legislation, if the objections urged are well taken, must come from the legislative, and not the judicial department of the government. The courts are bound to uphold the statutes unless they are clearly in conflict with the Constitution.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-16\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Leon county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>STATEMENT.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">The Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad Company filed its bill in equity in the Circuit Court of Leon county against William I).

That her population was as poor as it was sparse, and her people with their own -available resources were totally unable to perfect any works of improvement in the way of encouraging settlement and facilitating the development of its resources, and the utilizing of its commercial advantages.

And your orator avers that the righc to levy any additional tax on the values of said property, if it exists at all, exists only as against the -owners at the time of the property, and that the same is not now a lien on the property of your orator.

Gulf Central Railroad Company, the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad Company, the Florida Railroad Company, the Tallahassee Railroad Company, and the other roads meptioned in complainant\u2019s bill, and designated as D, F, G, H, J, EL, L, M, were exempt from taxation for thirty-five years, and that by reason of the Florida Central &amp;

Gulf Central Railroad Company, the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad Company, the Florida Railroad Company, the Tallahassee Railroad Company, and embraced in the roads of the Florida Central &amp; Peninsular Railroad Company, from taxation for the term of thirty-five years, the said Legislature transcended its constitutional powers, and the said acts can not be construed or held as exempting the property of the Florida, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Central Railroad, the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad Company, the Tallahassee Railroad Conrpany, and the Florida Railroad Company, for defendants allege that said exemption was not extended to all railroad companies and their property, in the State of Florida.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-6\">That defendants are advised and charge that the alleged grant of exemption, if made, was made gratuitously and without consideration, and if there was any consideration, it was not such consideration as to preclude the people of Florida and their Legislature, by their subsequent organic law and legislation, from subjecting even the Florida, Atlantic &amp;

That even if the said acts cited by complainant\u2019s bill did intend and did constitutionally exempt, the property of the Florida, Atlantic <em>&amp; </em>Gulf, the Pensacola &amp; Georgia, the Tallahassee, and the Florida' Railroad companies, organized prior to the Constitution of 1868, and acquired by the Florida Central <em>&amp;r </em>Peninsular Railroad Company, from taxation, as* claimed in its bill, these defendants say they are advised that such exemption did not pass by the several, mesne conveyances to the complainant, for these defendants aver that by said acts there was only exempted the capital stock, railroad and other property of the Florida, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Central, the Pensacola &amp; Georgia, the Tallahassee, and the Florida. Railroad companies, and defendants aver that with the exception of a part of the right-of-way, and probably a portion of the roadbed, and perhaps a few other insignificant items, that the railroad and property upon which the taxes are now sought to be collected, are not the same property which was the property of the said. Florida, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Central Railroad Company,, the Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>Georgia Railroad Company, the Tallahassee Railroad Company, and Florida Railroad!

But, on the contrary, these defendants are advised and charge that under the laws of Florida the complainant acquired nothing more than the property purchased by it from the chartered railroads named in complainant\u2019s bill, and acquired none of the said railroads\u2019 franchises, privileges or immunities and alleged exemptions from taxation as a railroad company duly chartered, empowered to exercise the franchises and enjoy the privileges and immunities thereof in the State of Florida.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-5\">Defendants further answering, say that as to the allegations that the lines of railroad designated as 4\u2018A,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d were built, accepted the provisions of the said act according to the provisions of the said act, and were accepted by the trustees of said Internal Improvement Fund as completed; and as to the allegations that for nonperformance with the requirements of the Internal Improvement act, in the payment of semi-annual interest, the roads mentioned as \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d were bought and afterwards owned and operated, the defendants have not sufficient information to either admit or deny the same, and demand strict proof thereof, and especially that said railroads were or are constructed as required by said acts and amendments thereto; andas to the allegations that the Jacksonville, Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>Mobile Railroad Company built the line of road designated as \u201cD,\u201d and that the president and directors of the Florida Railroad Comp&gt;any set off the construction of the road between Waldo and Ocala as alleged, and that the Florida Railroad Company set off to be constructed the road between Ocala and Tampa Bay, defendants have no knowledge and demand strict proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Defendants further answering, deny that the Florida Central &amp; Western Railroad Company was by sale of complainant\u2019s line between Jacksonville and Chattahoochee, and branches to Monticello and St. Marks, to Edward J. Reed, and by deed of said Reed, 28th day of February, 1882, invested with all the rights, privileges and immunities covered by said mortgage and of the charters and statutory benefits of the several constituent companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-5\">These defendants further answering, say that they deny that by reason of the several consolidations of roads mentioned, into the Florida Central <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Comyany, the Florida Transit &amp; Peninsular Company, and the Florida Railway <em>&amp; </em>Navigation Company, there was anything in, or any existing laws of \u2022such property acquired by which they, or the complainant herein, can claim or receive any immunity or exemption from taxation, or the taxes demanded now from them by the State of Florida herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-6\">And the defendants further answering, deny that the effect of the legislation in said bill set forth was -an exemption of all complainant\u2019s lines of roads which were built on the lines indicated in the fourth section of the Internal Improvement act from taxation as claimed. That the exemption as aforesaid was such an immunity as the Legislature was not empowered by the Constitution of Florida to give and grant, and was and is unconstitutional, null and void, and was not, and is not such an immunity as could or does pass to the complainant through the several conveyances and purchases as set forth in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-7\">Defendants further answering, deny that the exemption of the said lines of railroad set forth in said bill from taxation for the periods of time alleged became hy contract of the State a part and parcel of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>erty value of said roads, and that this exemption became a part of the value of the property of the railroad which complainant acquired in- its acquisition of each and all of its said lines, and deny that this was the law of the property as declared by the courts of this State, when the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company acquired the same; and that as to so much of complainant\u2019s bill as sets forth the claim that complainant is exempt from the payment of the taxes demanded by the State of Florida, and by these defendants sought to be collected by the levy and proposed sale complained of, these defendants claim all the benefits they could have from a demurrer interposed thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b706-5\">Defendants answering further, say they deny the charge contained in that paragraph of complainant\u2019s bill alleging that neither the Internal Improvement act, nor acts amendatory thereof, wherein was granted the alleged exemption, nor the acts under which said lines of road were constructed, contained any reservation of power in the Legislature to alter, amend or repeal the said immunity of exemption from taxation, and that any and every act of the State of Florida attempting to revoke, repeal or annul the same was violative of complainant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b706-6\">Defendants further answering, say that they deny that the act under which W. D. Barnes, Comptroller, claimed to assess back taxes for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, was not a law of the State of Florida, but aver that it was a law of Florida, and that said act does sufficiently designate and specify the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company, because said company embraced such railroad property as designated by said act to have escaped the payment of taxes for the years mentioned, and defendants deny that said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>act- of assessment was in violation of eoihplainant\u2019s alleged exemption, and the said act is null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-5\">Defendants deny that the assessment made by Wm.

S. 244, but will proceed to discuss the other two in their order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b715-8\">We will first inquire whether Chapter 3558 is a special law for the assessment of taxes for State and county purposes and in conflict with section 17, article 4, of the Constitution of 1868. Under the provisions of this statute it is made the duty of the Comptroller in all cases in which any railroad or other properties thereto belonging or appertaining in this State in the tax years commencing on March 1st, 1879, 1880 and 1881, or any of such years, were not assessed for taxes for such years, to cause the same or so much thereof as were not assessed to be assessed for State and county purposes at the same amount as they would have been had they been assessed in such years or any of them as to which there was a failure to assess.</p>\n<p data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b715-9\">This statute is limited in its operation to one class \u25a0of property, viz: railroads and other properties belong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ing thereto or appertaining, but operates alike on all property of this class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b716-5\">The objects of taxation consists of such a variety of' property as necessitates a classification of them for the-purpose of taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b716-6\"><em>No </em>general statute can be devised for the assessment and collection of taxes for State and county purposes that operates uniformly and justly upon every variety of property without a proper classification of the objects of taxation; hence it is a common practice for legislatures to enact laws for the assessment and collection of taxes for State and county purposes upon real estate by one mode of procedure and upon personal property by another mode of procedure and upon railroads by another mode of procedure, and upon telegraphs by another mode of procedure, and so on ad infinitum. And our own legislature has pursued this practice in this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b716-7\">Now a revenue law which provides for the assessment and collection of taxes for State and county purposes upon real estate alone and operates alike upon all real estate is not a special law because it does not operate upon personal property also; nor is a statute which provides for the assessment and collection of taxes for State and county purposes upon personal-property alone, and operates alike upon all personal property a special law because it does not operate-upon real estate also; nor is a statute which provides for the assessment and collection of taxes for State and county purposes upon railroads alone, and operates alike upon all railroads, a special tax because it does not operate upon real estate also; hence the statute under consideration is not a special law and in conflict-with section 17, article 4, of the Constitution of 1868,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>because it does not operate upon real estate and all other classes of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b717-5\">The term \u2018\u2018general\u201d is used in contradistinction to \u201cspecial\u201d in the section and article of the Constitution above referred to, and when so used means relating to all of a class, instead of to one or a part of that class. A statute, therefore, which relates to operate upon all of a class of things is a general law in contradistinction to a special law which relates to and operates upon one or a part of that class. Now the statute under discussion operates alike upon all of a class of objects of taxation and not upon one or a part of that class only; hence it is a general law and not a special one. 23 vol.

Ency. of Law, 148 and notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b717-6\">It is provided in section 25, Chapter 4115 laws of Florida, that if any assessor when making his assessments shall discover that any land in his county was omitted in the assessment roll of either or all of the three previous years, or that any land was illegally sold for taxes and was then liable to taxation, he shall in addition to the assessment of such lands for that .year assess the same separately for such year or years that it may have been so omitted or was illegally sold, at the cash value thereof in such year, noting distinctly the year in which such omission occurred, and such assessment shall have the same force and effect as it would have had if made in the year the same was omitted, and taxes shall be levied and collected thereon in like manner and together with the taxes of the year in which the assessment is made, but no land shall be assessed for more than three years arrears of taxes and all lands shall be subject to such taxes omitted to be assessed into whosoever hands they may come. It is apparent to the most casual observer that this section -of the act is limited in its operation to lands and can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>not be extended to railroads, telegraph lines or personal property. It is, however, a general law, because' it relates to all of a class of objects of taxation. But if it had been limited in its operation to a portion of the lands of the State instead of all of them it would have been a special law, and for that reason unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-5\">There is no law in this State which authorizes back taxes to be assessed upon personal property, railroads- or telegraph lines for the years that such property may have been omitted from the assessment rolls of the several counties and thus escaped taxation, except Chapter 3558, yet the section of the act above referred to is not a special law and unconstitutional because it does not relate to and operate upon all other objects of taxation.

Prior to this time-the line of railroad from Fernandina to Cedar Keys had continuously been the property of the railroad company that constructed the same; and to which company the exemption from taxation for thirty-five years from its completion (say 1860) attached under the Internal Improvement act. The consolidation of the various companies into the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation-Company, in February, 1884, is also set out fully on-pages 16-18 of the bill. It is established that both these-consolidations were accomplished by radical changes in the holdings of the capital stock, and with the introduction into the new companies, respectively, parties not before interested in either- of the constituent companies; and that such changes in holdings were equal to more than one-half in value of each and every of said properties. Were the companies thus formed new, or the old companies? To take away the exemption from taxation under the Internal Improvement act, generally from such of the lines constructed thereunder, and j)articularly and necessarily from the line.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>from Cedar Keys to Fernandina, it is necessary to-hoM. that the companies formed were new companies.

Article I, section 10, clause 1; Revised Statutes of Florida, page 5. And is obnoxious to the Constitution of Florida (Bill of Rights, section 17, R.

He might, as he attempted to; act under that authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and assess for the three previous years, 1881, 1882 and 1883, but this assessment should have been against the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; West India Transit Company, the Transit &amp; Peninsular Railroad Company, and the Florida Central &amp; Western Railroad, etc., the several owners of the roads for the year of assessment.

For this case manifestly only railroad properties that were not assessed for taxes for the years 1879, 1880 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>1881, or any of such years, were authorized to be assessed for omitted years. When by the very next act, Chap. 3559, lands of the St. Johns Railway Company, which had escaped taxation wholly or in part for years covering the same period as the years charged against this railroad property, were subjected to a change to be effective in the future, and properties of large values, to-wit. lands, etc., (see bill, page 25) which were omitted from assessments for like years, were permitted to remain untaxed. The act was not one of classification of property for purposes of taxation, and the valuation of different classes by different methods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"309\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b745-5\">The assessments were proper to be made without the act of 1885, or were improperly made, for that act was clearly so discriminating against this railroad\u2019s property, and in favor of the other properties of large values which had escaped taxation, as to be without uniformity or equality, and to amount to a special act for the assessment of taxes on a particular property.

Under similar statutes the same views were adopted by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in First Devison of the St. Paul &amp; Pacific R. R.

A general statement of law in this authoritative manner is always dangerous; and the court in laying down this hroad rule violated the obligations between the State and the holders of these properties, as it never would have permitted a State court to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"315\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The exemption was not a gratuity, but it was a studied, careful, business like incentive to capital to discount the future, to build a system of railroads over the entire State whose population was less than three to the square mile, and where it was unreasonable to hope that for many years there would be any return for the money thus invested in the work of development.</p>\n<p data-order=\"316\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b747-5\">The contention for exemption made for these properties can be placed on a basis distinguished from that of the road from Pensacola to the Alabama State line, upon whose claim the Palmes case in 109 U.

The first two objects of relief were refused by the court below, but the third was granted. Both parties allege in their briefs that the complainant and the defendants each appealed from the final decree below. The record shows an appeal by the defendants only. Both sides have presented the whole case upon the principle that an appeal in chancery is practically a rehearing, and opens up the whole case to the respondents. Southern Life Insurance Company vs. Cole, 4 Fla. 359. We consider the whole case, and whether the complainant below was entitled to any of the different matters of relief for which it prayed in its bill of complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The question involved in the first relief prayed for is easily disposed of. The claim that the exemption provided for in the 18th section of the Internal Im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>provement act, Chapter 610 laws of Florida (acts of 1855-6, page 16, McClellan\u2019s Digest, sec. 21, page 596), is a continuing exemption, that- it is an incident of property attached to the <em>rem, </em>-and following it into whosoever hands the same may come, can not be maintained in this State. Neither the complainant in this case nor its immediate predecessor is the original builder of the railroads which are sought to be exempted, and both are corporations organized since 1868. That the right of exemption which under the Internal Improvement act of 1855 vested in the original owners and builders of the roads exempted, was a personal privilege and did not pass with the assignment of the property, is by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, 109 U. S. 244, a proposition beyond the reach of cavil or controversy. It is no more open to discussion in. this State. The complainant is a corporation which has come into existence since the adoption of the Constitution of 1868 and the amendments thereto in 1875. Section 24 of Article XVI of the Constitution of 1868, as amended by Article XI of the amendments of 1875, as shown by Chapter 2041 laws of Florida, reads as follows: \u201cThe property of all corporations, whether heretofore or hereafter incorporated, shall be subject to -taxation, unless such property be held and used exclusively for religious, educational or charitable purposes.\u201d No corporation could be created since the adoption of this Constitution, capable of accepting and enjoying the exemption from taxation, which was claimed by the complainant. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">It is alleged in the bill of complaint, and admitted by. the answer, that certain lines of railroad of the -complainant built in the years 1877, 1881 and 1883 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>were built upon the lines designated by the Internal Improvement act, in accordance with the provisions of the same, and had been duly accepted by the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund as completed; and that they were acquired by the complainant by purchase from corporations composed wholly or in part by consolidation of the building corporations. It can not be justly claimed that there was a vested right to exemption from taxation of these roads under the eighteenth section of the Internal Improvement act. They were all property built or acquired by corporations coming into existence after the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, and whether in the hands of the original building corporations or their assignees and successors, were clearly liable to taxation under that Constitution. The relevant portion of the Constitution of 1868, as amended in 1875, has already been quoted. As it originally stood, section 24 of Article-XVI of the Constitution of 1868 read as follows: \u201cThe property of all corporations, whether heretofore or hereafter incorporated, shall be subject to taxation, unless such corporation be for religious, educational or charitable purposes.\u201d The only change made by the amendment of 1875 was that instead of excepting from taxation the general property of religious, educational or charitable corporations, the property excepted was required \u201cto be held and used exclusively for religious, educational or charitable purposes.\u201d Under the section of the Constitution under discussion, as it originally stood, or as it stood after the-amendment of 1875, the railroad and other property of corporations is brought into existence and acquired while the above quoted constitutional provisions were-in force, were subject to taxation in like manner as. other property. Whatever might be said of vested. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>rights of exemption from taxation of railroads built under the Internal Improvement act before the adoption of the Constitution of 1888, while remaining the-property of the corporations which built them, there can be no force in an argument which claims that notwithstanding the constitutional provisions quoted, the-eighteenth, or exemption, section of the Internal Improvement act conferred a vested right to exemption from taxation of railroads built by corporations created after the Constitution of 1868 became the paramount law of the State. It can not be said that it impairs a vested right to enforce the provisions of the Constitution as to things done and to property created and acquired after they are in full force and effect, and after the exemption provisions of the eighteenth section of the Internal Improvement act were thus repealed by a later Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The second matter of relief sought by the bill of complaint was to recover from defendants the sum of $140,812.47, alleged to have been paid by the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company on the 28th of May, 1885, to William D. Barnes, Comptroller of the State of Florida. This money, as shown by the bill, was claimed by the State of Florida for taxes assessed against said Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company for the years 1881, 1882, 1883 and 1884. These taxes are alleged to have been paid under duress, because the State\u2019s officers, including the executive of the State, had threatened to sell the railroad of said company on account of said taxes, and to put the purchaser at such sale into possession. The taxes collected are alleged to be illegal on account of the exemption, of the property from taxation. The money sought to be recovered was paid to the Comptroller officially,, and for the State for which he was acting. The recov-</p>\n<p id=\"A9i\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ery is not sought from the defendants individually, but from the State. We can not enter into the merits of this portion of the controversy. The defendants in their answer denied the jurisdiction and power of the Circuit Court to grant this part of the relief prayed for in the bill of complaint. The court below denied the relief upon the ground that the money sought to be recovered had been \u201clawfully exacted and collected\u201d by the State. The correct order would have been to have dismissed this branch of the case for want of jurisdiction to hear and determine it. The suit for this purpose, while against the two officers of the State named as defendants, -was to all intents and purposes a suit against the State of Florida; a judgment or decree against them would be a judgment and decree against the State. A State can not be sued without its \u00abconsent. If it were admitted that the defendants who were sued as officers of the State could bind the State by consent to the suit, the State did not so consent in this case. On the contrary, they especially reserved \u201c all advantage of exception * * to the jurisdiction and power\u201d of the court \u201cto grant the relief\u201d in question. The nonliability of a sovereign State to be sued, is a principle old, well-established and universally prevalent. Cornwall vs. Commonwealth, 32 Va. 644, S. C. 3 Am. St. Rep. 121, Carr vs. State, 121 Ind. 264, S. C. 22 Am. St. Rep. 624; McWhorter vs. Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>A. R. R. Co., 24 Fla. 417, 5 South. Rep. 129; Hans vs. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1. By saying that the State can not be sued, it is not meant that no judicial action whatever can be taken against the State, but confining ourselves to the facts of this particular case, that a suit like that before us, whether in the form of a bill in equity or in the nature of an action of assumpsit, or for the recovery of money, does not lie against the</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>-sovereign State. Opinion of Iredell, Justice, in Chisholm vs. Georgia, <em>2 </em>Dall. 419. In speaking upon this subject the Supreme Court of the United States, in the conclusion of ,xts opinion in the case of Hans vs. Louisiana, <em>supra, </em>say: \u201cTo avoid misapprehension, it might be proper to add that although the obligations of a State rest for their perforrhance upon its honor and good faith, and can not be made the subjects of judicial cognizance, unless the State consents to be sued or comes itself into court, yet where property or rights are enjoyed under a contract or grant made by a State, they can not be wantonly invaded. While the State can not be compelled by suit to perform its contracts, any attempt upon its part to violate pi-operty or rights acquired under its contract, may be judicially resisted,\u201d etc. It is only upon the principles announced in the two last sentences of the quotation above, that the court below had jurisdiction to determine the matters involved in the other object of relief sought by the complainant beside that now under immediate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Constitution of Florida- of 1885, section <em>22 </em>of Article III, is as follows: \u201cProvision may be made by general law for bringing suits against the State as to all liabilities now existing or hereafter originating. The nineteenth section of Article IY of the Constitution of 1868 was the same. No such provision having-been made by the Legislature, the section quoted is inoperative to change the general principles xxpon which we hold that the State is not liable to be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The next and third object sought to be accomplished by the bill of complaint was decided in' favor of the complainant below. This was the relief prayed for and granted, adjoining the collection of taxes for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, upon certain railroads and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>appurtenant property of the complainant. These taxes were assessed and levied under the act of 1885, Chapter 3558 laws of Florida, page 4. Said act reads as follows: \u201cThat in all cases in which any railroad or the properties thereto belonging or appertaining in this State, in the tax years commencing March 1st, 1879, 1880 and 1881, or any of such years, were not. assessed for taxes for such years, it shall be the duty of the Comptroller to cause the same, or so much thereof as were not assessed, to be assessed for State and county taxes, and twenty <em>per centum </em>of the taxes so assessed for said years, and now unpaid, shall be collected at the same time the taxes for the - year 1885-shall be assessed and collected-; and each year thereafter an additional twenty <em>per centum </em>of said taxes-shall be collected, at the same time and in the same-manner as the taxes for such year are collected, until the whole amount of said unpaid taxes for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881 are paid. The taxes to be assesed under this act shall be the same in amount as they would have been had they been assessed in such years or any of them as to which there was a failure to-assess. \u2019 \u2019 The warrant issued and the levy was made and. proceedings to enforce the collection of the taxes by sale of the railroads assessed were taken under the act,. Chapter 4073, laws of Florida. Appendix to Revised Statutes of Florida, page 1010. This act reads as follows: \u201cThat the State and county taxes assessed by the-Comptroller of the State of Florida upon any railroads, and the properties thereof in said State for the years-1879,1880 and 1881, under and in pursuance of \u2018An act. to provide for the assessment and collection of taxes, on railroads, and the properties thereof, for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, as to which there was no assessment,\u2019 but which have not been collected, shall be col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>lectecl, and the payment thereof enforced at the same times and in the same manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law for the collection and the enforcement of the payment of taxes assessed upon the railroads and the properties thereof in the State of Florida. Section <em>2. </em>That this act shall take effect immediately after its passage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Various objections were made in the bill of complaint to the proceedings to enforce the collection of the taxes claimed by the State. Among other things which are insisted upon, and which it is necessary for us to determine, it was alleged, substantially, (1) that Chapter 3558, above set out in full, was obnoxious to-the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, forbidding States to pass laws impairing the obligations of contracts, and to similar provisions in the Constitution of the State of Florida; (2) that it is a special law for the collection of taxes for State and county purposes, and obnoxious to the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Florida, that it does not provide for a uniform assessment of all omitted property, and is discriminating in the mode of payment; (3) that the act was incomplete in itself, is retrospective, and interfered with vested rights; (4) and it-is also claimed, in effect, that at the time the predecessors of the claimant, and through whom it claims, acquired the property assessed, the years 1879, 1880- and 1881 had expired, that the taxes now sought to be collected had not been assessed against it, that the-State had no lien upon it for the said taxes, and that-the right of complainant to the property is superior to. the claim of the State for the taxes sought now to be-collected by a sale of the property. (5) It is also-alleged in the bill of complaint that the exemption of railroads from taxation under the eighteenth section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>of the Internal Improvement act enured to the complainant because at the time of the purchase of the road by its predecessors through whom it claims title, such exemption from taxation was the law pf the property as declared by the Supreme Court of the State of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The greater portion of the argument of counsel for appellee, upon the alleged conflict between the act of 1885, Chapter 3558 laws of Florida, and the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida, is based upon the assumption that the exemption provided for by the 18th section of the Internal Improvement act attached to the railroad property as an incident of the same, and was a contract by the State for a continuing exemption of the property in the hands of whosoever might acquire the same. As already stated, since the decision of the case of Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the proposition contended for has been so finally settled that it is no longer open to discussion in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">It is also contended by appellee that the act, Chapter 3558, supra, interferes with the vested rights claimed of exemption from taxation of the complainant\u2019 s property, because those rights accrued, under a judicial construction declaring that the exemption from taxation provided for in the 18th section of the Internal Improvement act, attached to the property as an incident without regard t\u00f3 changes in the ownership of the same. This contention is supported by reference to the opinions of this court in the cases of Allen vs. Atlantic &amp; Gulf R. R. Co., 15 Fla. 637, delivered at the June Term, 1876, and Genzales vs. Sullivan, 16 Fla. 791, delivered at the June Term, 1878. The first mentioned case did not, but the latter mase undoubtedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>did construe the act in question as claimed by appellee. Such construction continued to stand until overruled by the case of Palmes vs. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co., 19 Fla. 231, decided at the June Term, 1882, and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, 109 U. S. 244, decided in November, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In effect, the complainant says that while it may be-that the railroad property 'sought to be sold for the-taxes for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, was really subject to taxation in those years, yet it had been by a mistaken construction of the law declared not liable to taxation, and that the complainant, relyiug upon such construction, and upon faith of the exemption from taxation, had contracted and-invested its money in the property. In this case it is unnecessary to determine what effect a change of judicial decision will have-upon contracts made, while a former and different construction of the law prevailed. In reading the cases, of Palmes vs. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co., and Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, supra, it is evident that only one phase of the liability to taxation of the property in dispute was before the court and involved in its adjudication. The only point, of non liability decided in Gonzales vs. Sullivan was, that the exemption provided for in the Internal Improvement act attached to the property and continued as an incident of it after its transfer from the original owners and builders. The more important and vital question, as to whether a corporation coming into existence since the adoption of our Constitution of 1868: could hold such property as exempt, was not determined in the Gonzales-Sullivan case; nor has it ever been determined in any other case by this court. Therefore, that one branch of the question had been. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>determined in favor of the complainant\u2019s contention can not avail it in this controversy. Of what value was it to complainant that the exemption from taxation under the statute passed with the property, if it and its predecessors were such corporations as were prohibited by the Constitution from holding the property as exempt <em>? </em>The same contention here presented was also made in the case of Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, (sec. 109 U. S. 244, text page 255 <em>et seq.) </em>In that case it was urged that the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company had acquired its title after the decision of this court in Gonzales vs. Sullivan,- and may be presumed to have acted upon the faith of such decision. The court, however, held the property liable to taxation, and one of the principal reasons alleged therefor was that the effect of the provisions of the Constitution of 1868 upon the capacity of a corporation created after its adoption to accept the privilege and benefit of the exemption was not raised or adjudged in Gonzales vs. Sullivan. The complaint and its predecessors through several antecedent transfers were corporations organized since 1868, and could not avail themselves of any exemption from taxation. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. vs. Palmes, <em>supra; </em>Keokuk <em>&amp; </em>W. R. Co. vs. County Court of Scotland County, 41 Fed. Rep. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Another matter is worthy of attention in considering the effect of the judicial construction of the statute from which the complainant claimed his privilege of -exemption from taxation accrued. By reference to the bill of complaint and to the act (Chapter 1646 laws of Florida, pamphlet laws of 1868, page 143; McClellan\u2019s Digest, 1006) it will be seen (in the preamble to the act found in the original, not in McClellan\u2019s Digest) that at the time of the passage of the act, July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>29th, 1868, William E. Jackson and his associates were the owner of that portion of complainant\u2019s line of railroad which extends from Jacksonville to Lake City. They had purchased the same at a sale made by the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund, as the property of the Florida, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Central Railroad Company, and by the act ref erred to Jackson and his associates were vested with the powers and franchises granted said last named corporation, and were incorporated under the name of the Florida Central Railroad Company. Said Jackson and associates accepted such act of incorporation, and in such corporate name owned and operated such line of railroad. The sixth section of said act of incorporation reads as follows: \u201cThat nothing in this act shall be so construed, nor shall it be so operative, as to divest the State of the right to make the said Florida Central Railroad, and all its property of every sort, character and description, the subject-matter of taxation on the part of the State.\u201d Whatever might be said as to other portions of complainant\u2019s line of road, as to which similar statutory provisions were not in existence, there could, in the face of this section, be no reasonable ground for belief that this especial portion of the line was exempt from taxation. As this section had never been construed by this court, and the question of the liability of this portion of the line to taxation, had not been determined, we see no reason for an assumption that a judicial construction of a statute should become a rule of property of a line of railroad, the liability of which to taxation must depend wholly or in part upon a statute which has never been construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The complainant says further, in effect, that at the time its predecessors purchased the property the taxes claimed had not been assessed against it, that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>was no lien in favor of the State for such taxes, and the act upon which the proceedings to collect taxes are-being taken, was not upon the statute book, and that it acquired the property free of the State\u2019s claim for taxes. It contends upon this view of the facts that its right or title to said property is superior to any claim or right of the State to subject the same to the payment of the back taxes claimed against it; that if such back taxes can be assessed and collected at all, it could only be against the owners of the property during the years for which taxes are claimed, and can not be so-collected from its purchasers, or by sale of the same. That if the statute intended to create a lien upon the property in the hands of purchasers for value, it would, to that extent, deprive its owners of their property without due process of law, and would be unconstitutional. This contention presents some complicated and difficult questions. All property in the State ought to bear its just burden of public taxation, and there can be no doubt, because it is well established by authority, that if property, lawfully liable thereto, escapes taxation for any one or more years, that it is competent for the Legislature to provide for the collection of such taxes in arrears. Perry and Hale Counties vs. Selma, Marion &amp; Memphis R. R. Co., 65 Ala. 301; Perry County vs. Selma, Marion &amp; Memphis R. R. Co. (and other cases); 58 Ala. 546; Tallman vs. City of Janesville, 17 Wis. 71; North Carolina R. R. Co. vs. Commissioners of Alamance, 82 N. C. 259; Burroughs on Taxation, 483. There is no doubt of the authority to collect such back taxes from the owners of the property during the time from which it escaped taxation, or from purchasers of the same whose rights or titles accrued after a lien for such taxes had been acquired by the State, by subjecting the property taxed to the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the same. If the State has the power to pursue- property for the payment of taxes when it has ceased to be in the possession or ownership of the persons to whom it belonged during the time for which such assessment was made, in the hands of innocent purchasers for value, such power must arise from some specific charge or lien upon the property in favor of the State for the taxes thereon. The question therefore arises, whether the complainant is such innocent purchaser for value. We do not think that the time for the assessment and collection of the taxes has passed, and. the taxing statute affixes no lien to the property, the State has made no assessment, or taken any other step to collect the same, that real estate can be pursued for back taxes when it has gone into the hands of innocent purchasers for value. The property sought to be taxed in this case is by the law of this State real estate. McClellan\u2019s Digest, sec. 30, p. 286, Chapter 3099 Laws of Florida, act of 1879, sec. 3, p. 17. Under our laws as they existed prior to the Revised Statutes there was no lien upon such property for its taxes until fixed by; an assessment of the same. Spratt vs. Price, 18 Fla. 289, text 301, <em>et seq.; </em>L\u2019Engle vs. Florida Central &amp; Western R. R. Co., 31 Fla. 353. The only exception to this rule is that provided in various revenue acts, in effect, that assessors might assess real estate which had escaped taxation for any of the preceding years, not exceeding three, and that such - land should be liable for such back taxes in whosoever hands they might come. Both parties agree that this provision is riot applicable to the present case. We do not think the power of the State to subject the property in question to the payment of the back taxes claimed by the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>rests upon the basis of a lien upon the property which enables the State to reach it in the hands of innocent purchasers for value. We do not think, under the facts of this case, that the complainant below is shown to be an innocent purchaser for value. In other words, it does not appear that it purchased the property after the time for the assessment and collection of the taxes had passed without any assessment or other effort on the part of the State to collect such taxes. We will, as briefly as is consistent with clearness, state the facts upon which these views are announced, together with some principles of law applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">As different portions of the property rest upon different bases of fact, we will have to separate them in such statement. First, we will examine the nature of the title of the complainant to the line extending from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee, with branches to Monticello and St. Marks. For present purposes, it is only necessary to trace this chain of title to the acquisition of the property by Edward J. Reed and associates, in September, 1879. Their title was acquired at a sale on foreclosure of a statutory lien on behalf of the State against the Jacksonville, Pensacola &amp; Mobile Railroad Company. The property was owned and operated by said Reed and associates, but under what firm or corporate name is not shown by the record, until February 8,1882. On this date Reed and his associates organized a corporation under the general laws of the State of Florida, under the name of the Florida Central &amp; Western Railroad Company, and on the 28th of February, 1882, conveyed the property to said corporation. An inspection of these articles of incorporation on file in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>shows that Reed and his associates were incorporated as the same persons who had pnrcha'sed the property at said foreclosure sale. This corporation, in February, 1884, was, with other companies, consolidated into the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company. This latter corporation owned the property until May, 1889, and during the time the assessments complained of were made. The complainant acquired title through a purchase by one W. B. Cutting, as agent, at a judicial sale of the property; said Cutting and associates organized the complainant corporation. The complainant bought and took possession, with the assessments upon the property. We concede, however, that complainant would not be bound by such assessments, if they had been illegal as against the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company, its immediate predecessor. Therefore the inquiry arises, whether the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company was such innocent purchaser as we have hereinbefore stated could hold the. property as against the State\u2019s claim for taxes. The only changes which had occurred in the ownership of the property, between the time of its. acquisition by Reed and his associates in September, 1879, and its assessments for taxation, were by a sale by the persons organizing a corporation to the corporation composed of themselves, and by a consolidation of the corporation owning it into another corporation of which it remained a constituent part until the assessments were made. It would be defeating the State of its taxes upon the merest technicality to hold that such transfers of the property as these constituted an innocent purchaser, as the transferees, Reed and his associates, came into the ownership of the property in September, 1879. At this date the time under the then existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>laws had not expired when the State might assess and collect the taxes from the property. Secs. 45, 46, pp. 30, 31, acts of 1879, Chapter 3099. They took the property when it was liable to taxation for 1879, and. held it while it became and was liable for the taxes of 1880 and 1881. These taxes, while not liens upon the property, were obligations due by the owners and for which the property might be made liable. Can this obligation and liability <em>be </em>discharged by the transfer of the property by the owners as individuals to themselves in a corporate capacity? We think not; such, transfers are more nominal than real. In the case of Western Division of the Western North Carolina R. R. Co. vs. Drew, Governor, etc., 5 Woods (C. C.), 691, text 701, a question somewhat similar arose, in which it was determined that where persons holding as individuals railroad property subject to a lien, passed the title to a corporation composed of themselves clothed with corporate power, the lien was not thereby divested. 1 Morawetz on Private Corporations, sec. 239, thus states the same principal: \u201cIf an association of persons owning property subject to equitable claims obtains an act of incorporation, the property will remain subject to those claims after it is vested in the corporate name. * *\u201d To similar effect also is Beach on Private Corporations, sec. 797. We have not been able to find a case where the precise question here involved (i. &lt;?., the liability for taxes of property transferred by an association of persons to themselves as a corporation) has been adjudicated. We find a number of cases where it has been held that such a transfer would not relieve the property of liability for an indebtedness contracted by the association which after-wards became a corporation. The case of Hancock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>vs. Holbrook, 40 La. Ann. 53, 3 South. Rep. 351, was a case where the stockholders of a corporation, through the medium of an individual who was not a stockholder, bought property at a judicial sale in the name of the corporation, and immediately conveyed the same to a new corporation composed of the same stockholders and the individual through whom the property was purchased. The court (text, page 61), speaking upon the contention that the property in the hands of the new corporation was not liable for the debts of the company, says: \u201cThe new corporation was simply the Herald Company <em>plus </em>Holbrook, as evidenced by the glaring fact that its stock, except that assigned to Holbrook, was distributed without other consideration among the Herald stockholders in exact proportion to their stock therein. The proposition that the stockholders of a corporation can buy property in its name on credit, immediately thereafter form a new corporation in which their interests are the same and based on no new consideration, transfer the property bought to the new corporation, and then hold it free from any liability to the vendor or creditors is one which cannot be sustained in reason or by authority. It is perfectly plain that the new Picayune Company, <em>quoad </em>this property, stood in the shoes of the Herald Company and was bound for the latter\u2019t debt to the extent of its value.\u201d To similar effect also are Brum vs. Merchants\u2019 Mutual Insurance Co., 16 Fed. Rep. 140, S. C. 4 Woods, 156; Blair vs. St. Louis, Hannibal &amp; Ceekuk R. R. Co., 22 Fed. Rep. 36; Georgia Ice Company vs. Porter &amp; Meakin, 70 Ga. 637. In the case of Hibernia Insurance Co. vs. St. Louis &amp; New Orleans Transportation Co., 13 Fed. Rep. 516, S. C. 4 McCrary, 432, upon this subject it is aptly said: \u201cIt is the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>of the court to examine the whole transaction, and to cut through mere paper transfers designed to obstruct or destroy the rights of parties. The evidence sufficiently discloses that the new corporation was a mere continuance of the old, with substantially the same parties in interest \u2014 a mere change of name. Whether that change, with attendant transfers, was designed or not to defeat all outstanding demands of the old corporation, it is evident that substantially the two corporations are the same, and that the new must respond to the obligations of the old. * * A mere change of name can not avoid obligations. The new corporation took all the property of the old, went forward with its-business, had the same stock holders, except a few formal ones, was, in short, the old corporation, and now seeks to escape the obligations of the old, rescuing-the property of the latter from the demands the former was bound to meet. Can this be done? The old corporation and its property were liable to the demands of the plaintiff. The new corporation must respond to the extent of the property acquired, and possibly to the full extent; that is, if property sufficient therefor is in its possession.\u201d The principles announced in the cases cited were in proceedings to collect debts. A tax upon property, technically speaking, is not a debt. Ordinarily an action of assumpsit and recovery of judgment does not lie thereon; yet it is an obligation to the State for which the owner and the property are liable. It is the highest obligation which can rest upon property. Without the power to enforce the obligation, law and order could not be maintained, and all the functions-of government would be practically suspended. We know of no reason why the rights of the State in the-pursuit of alienated property subject to taxation-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>should not rest upon as high, if not higher, grounds as the rights of an individual who seeks satisfaction of a private debt out of the same property. Respectable authority maintains the doctrine that the claim of the State for taxes is paramount to the claim of other creditors, and should be first paid, and that the property might be seized by the State. This was in a case where the property had been assigned for the benefit of creditors. State vs. Rowse, 49 Mo. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The next point requiring demonstration is, that the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company did not become an innocent purchaser by reason of the consolidation of the Florida Central &amp; Western Railroad Company into it. This consolidation was accomplished by virtue of the statutes \u2014sec. 27, p. 285, and sec. 37, p. 288, McClellan\u2019s Digest. The statutes under which the consolidation was made makes no provision as to the payment of the debts and liabilities of the constituent companies which, by the consolidation, become absorbed into a new corporation.' Neither does it appear by- the bill of complaint, nor the articles of incorporation on file in the office of the Secretary of State, that any provision of this kind was made in such articles. In such a state of affairs all the authorities seem to agree that unless the statute or articles of consolidation make express provision therefor, the new corporation assumes all the debts and liabilities of the constituent companies. In the absence of express statutory provision, or an assumption by agreemenb-of the new company, the debts and liabilities of the original companies follow as an incident of the consolidation, and become- by implication the obligations of the new corporation.

S. 665. In Western Division of the Western North Carolina R. R. Co. vs. Drew, Governor, etc., 5 Woods (C. C.) 691, text 701, the court, speaking of the consolidation of two railroad companies, one of which had a lien upon its property, says: \u201cThis consolidation, by which the two companies joined their properties together, did not discharge the lien. The property of the Tallahassee company was brought into the common concern with all preexisting equities attaching thereto. The consolidated company having, as one of its component parties, the Tallahassee company, which held subject to the lien, can not be regarded as a <em>dona fide </em>purchaser without notice. The notice with which that company was affected, in relation to the property brought with it Into the common fund, affected also the consolidated company.\u201d While we have found no c\u00e1se, and none has been pointed out to us by counsel, upon the express point of the liability of a consolidated corporation for the taxes due the State from one of its constituents, whose property it had received into a common corporate fund, yet there are numerous cases holding the liability of the consolidated corporation for the debts and obligations of its constituent companies. What has hereinbefore been said as to the high degree of the obligation that rests upon persons and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>property for taxes due the State has equal application to the present matter. A corporation from whom taxes are due the State can not defeat the collection thereof by vesting its property subject to such taxes in another corporation, of which the defaulting corporation remains a component part.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In ascertaining the title of the complainant to the line of railroad from Fernandina to Cedar Keys, it is necessary only to go as far back as a judicial sale, made in certain proceedings in the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Florida, in a suit between one Doggett, Receiver, and the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; West India Transit Railroad Company. The bill does not allege the date of this alleged sale, but it appears with certainty that it was before the year 1881 and probably before the year 1879. Applying that rule by which all allegations in a pleading are taken most strongly .against the pleader, we are warranted in construing the bill as alleging this sale as occurring before 1870. It does not clearly appear by what corporate name the road was operated after this purchase. The property was purchased at the sale mentioned by E. N. Dickerson and C. D. Willard; who organized a corporation with the same name as that which had formerly owned it. The bill alleges that this company\u2019s name was changed in 1881 to the Florida Transit Railroad Company. But it also alleges that the company under the old (not the new) name was, in December, 1882, consolidated, with other corporations, into the Florida Transit &amp; Peninsular Railroad Company. This last named company was likewise consolidated, with others, into the Florida Railway <em>&amp; </em>Navigation Company; in February, 1884. The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>plainant- acquired title to the property at the same-time, in the same manner, that it acquired the line-from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee and its branches, and what was said in reference to the effect thereof is. equally applicable to the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">There is some variance as to what lines are advertised for sale, as stated in the allegations contained in the body of the bill of complaint, and in the sheriff\u2019s, advertisement attached to the bill of complaint and \u00a1made an exhibit to and part' thereof. Three lines advertised by the sheriff are (1) that from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee, (2) Eernandina to Tampa, and (3). Waldo to Cedar Keys. In the bill the line is described as from Eernandina to Cedar Keys. The line leading southwest from Eernandina branches into two lines at Waldo, one of which branches leads to Cedar Keys,, and one leads to Tampa. The latter branch in the bill of complaint is described as several different roads built by different companies, as follows: Line F, Waldo to Ocala, built in 1877 by the Peninsular Railroad Company, and line Gf, Ocala to Wildwood, built in 1881 by the Tropical Florida Railroad Company. These companies were consolidated, in 1882, with another company, into the Florida Transit &amp; Peninsular Railroad Company. This latter company, as we have-before seen, was consolidated into the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company in February, 1884. The first of these lines, that from Waldo to Ocala, is liable to the payment of the taxes sought to be enforced against-it, for reasons already stated. The line from Ocala to Wildwood is alleged to have been built in 1881 \u2014 what period of said year is not stated. Acting upon a rule-of construction already announced, we construe this-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>allegation as showing that it was bnilt early enough in the year 1881 to be subject to taxation for that year, and taxes for that year only can be collected from it. The line K, from Wildwood to Plant City, was built in 1887; and the line M, from Plant City to Tampa, was built in 1891. The latter lines were not in existence during the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, and can not be taxed for years that passed away before they were built; neither can they be subjected to sale for payment of taxes due upon other railroads, by reason of the accidental circumstance that they have become the property of the same corporation that owns the roads, liable to taxation. The statute of 1885, under which these assessments were made, refers only to railroads which were in existence during the years named, and ought to have been, assessed for taxes during these years, but were not so assessed. Several other lines of road are described in the bill of complaint;, but there is no allegation or showing that they are advertised or sought to be subjected to taxes of 1879, 1880 or 1881, and we need not further discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Another objection to the proceedings to collect the taxes involved herein is, that the act of 1885, under' which the assessments were made, is a special law for the collection of taxes for State and county purposes, and obnoxious to the provisions of the Constitution of 1868, in force at the time the act was passed. The portion of this Constitution with which the act is claimed to be in conflict is the provision in the seventeenth section of Article IY, forbiding the Legislature to pass, special or local laws for the assessment and collection of taxes for State, county and municipal purposes. The eighteenth section of the same article provides. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>that in such cases all laws shall be general and of uniform operation throughout the State. Is the act in question a general or special law ? If the first, it is constitutional and valid; if the latter, it is unconstitutional and void. This court has passed upon the general question, as to what constitutes a special law, within the meaning of the provision of the Constitution prohibiting such laws, in the case of <em>ex parte </em>Wells, 21 Fla. 280. It there held that an act providing that whenever any city or town, incorporated under the general municipal corporation act, approved February 4th, 1869, is indebted to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, and has defaulted, and still defaults, in the payment of its interest account, the charter of said city or town shall be and is hereby declared to be repealed, and the corporation thereof dissolved, was not a special law, within the prohibition of sections 17 and 18 of Article IY of the Constitution of 186S, but was a general law. In this case the court approved definitions previously laid down by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as follows: \u201cA statute which relates to persons or things as a class is a general law, while a statute which relates to particular persons or things of a class is special, and comes within the constitutional prohibition.\u201d It might be that the railroads of the complainant is the only property affected by the act. Such a state of affairs would not make it a special law. Speaking upon a similar contention this court has also quoted with approval, in the case of <em>ex parte </em>Wells, supra, from the Supreme Court of New Jersey, the following language: \u25a0\u201cA law so framed <em>(i. e., </em>general in its terms) is not a special or local law, but a general law without regard to the consideration that within the State there hap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>pens to be but one individual of the class or one place-where it produces effects.\u201d It has also been said, as-; applied to statutes, that the word general, as distinguished from special, means all of a class, instead off part of a class. 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 148 and authorities cited. In the case of McAunich vs. Mississippi &amp; Missouri R. R. Co., 20 Iowa, 338, it is said, speaking of statutes of this character: \u201cThese laws are general and uniform, not because they operate upon every person in the State, for they do not, but because every person who is brought within the relations and circumstances provided for, is affected by the-law. They are general and uniform in their operation upon all persons in like situation, and the fact of their being general and uniform is not affected by the number of persons within the scope of their operation.\u201d To same effect is Iowa Railroad Land Co. vs. Soper, 39 Iowa, 112, in which a number of cases are collected; also Coal Run Coal Company vs. Finlen, 124 Ill. 666, 17 N. E. Rep. 11, and State vs. Yard, 42 N. J. L. 357. The act in question is general in its terms. It embraces all of a class \u2014 all railroads in a similar condition \u2014 and. is not in conflict with the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The bill also alleges, in substance, that the act complained of was enacted to reach only property of the-class of complainant; that other properties of large-values and lands elsewhere in the State were improperly omitted from assessment for taxes for the years-1879, 1880 and 1881, and that no act has been passed toreada such property; that the act complained of does not attempt to secure a just valuation and assessment of all classes of property. These objections do not show any constitutional infirmity in the act. The fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>that the statute does not embrace all classes of owners and of property, omitted from taxation for the years mentioned, would not, under the definitions given, make the act a special law. Neither does the Constitution require that every tax act shall provide for the just valuation and assessment of all classes of property. These objections apply, not to the constitutionality, but only to the policy, the justice and the wisdom of the law. The relief from such legislation must come from the legislative, not the judicial, department of the government. The courts are bound to uphold the statutes, unless they are clearly in conflict with the \u2022Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">From what has been said herein, it follows that the lines of railroad of. the complainant from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee, with St. Marks and Monticello branches, the line from Fernandina to Cedar Keys, and the line from Waldo to Ocala, are subject to the taxes sought to be collected from them. The line from Ocala to Wildwood is subject only to such taxes for the year 1881. The lines above mentioned, except that from Ocala to Wildwood, are the ones in existence and assessed by Barnes, Comptroller, as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The decree of the Circuit Court holding the lines of railroad described therein as subject to taxation in 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885 and 1886, and refusing injunction against the assessment and collection of taxes thereon for 1886, and refusing to direct return of taxes paid for 1882,1883 and 1884 by the Florida Railway <em>&amp; </em>Navigation Company, is affirmed, except that portion which holds the line from Ocala to Tampa subject to taxation as aforesaid. Only that part of the latter line which extends from Ocala to Wildwood was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ject- to such taxation. The decree is reversed in so far \u2022as it makes subject to taxation, for the years named, that portion of the line from Ocala to Tampa, described in the bill of complaint as the line from Wildwood to Plant City, and the line from Plant City to Tampa. So much of said decree as holds that the statute under which the assessment was made, and under which proceedings are being taken by the .defendants to collect taxes of the complainant, is ~a special statute for the collection of general revenue, and unconstitutional and void, is reversed. So much of the decree \u2022of the Circuit Court as holds that the several lines of railroad sought to be subjected to the payment of taxes herein was not assessable against the Florida Railway <em>&amp; </em>Navigation Company for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, and which enjoins the defendants from selling or attempting to sell the same, under the assessment aforesaid, or any part thereof, for the taxes for said years, or from in any manner interfering with or attempting to collect said taxes, is reversed. Said decree should have enjoined the collection of taxes only upon the following portions of the property so levied upon, to-wit: that portion leyied upon and advertised by the defendants as the line from Jacksonville to Tampa, which is described in the bill of complaint as the line from Wildwood to Plant City and the line from Plant City to Tampa. The defendants might likewise have been properly enjoined as to the taxes for the years 1879 and 1880, upon the line from Ocala to Wildwood.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
