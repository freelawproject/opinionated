Pruitt, </em>430 <em>N. J.Super. </em>261, 63 A.3d 1225 (App.Div.2013), the Law Division held a hearing and determined that during jury selection at defendant\u2019s criminal trial, the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to remove the only African-American juror did not \u201cdisclose a constitutional violation.\u201d Defendant Markees Pruitt appeals from the remand order dated July 9, 2013. After reviewing the record in light of the applicable legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">The background is set forth at length in our prior opinion and need not be repeated here. In brief, defendant was on trial for multiple counts of illegal drug distribution, and the State\u2019s case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>was based on evidence of a series of drug purchases from defendant by undercover police officers. Defendant is African-American, and there were only two African-Americans in the jury pool. One African-American juror was excused for cause, and the prosecutor later excused the other, who was Juror Thirteen, using a peremptory challenge. As soon as the prosecutor used the peremptory challenge, defense counsel asked the trial judge to conduct a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 535-39, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986). <em>See also Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>79, 96-98, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1712, 1723-24, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, 87-89 (1986). The judge denied the request because the prosecutor had only excused one African-American juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On appeal, we concluded that the judge\u2019s decision was contrary to the principles set forth in <em>State v. Osorio, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>486, 973 A.2d 365 (2009), which stated the following standards for determining whether a defendant has presented a prima facie case in mounting a <em>Gilmore </em>challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">In determining whether a defendant has produced evidence sufficient \u201cto draw an inference that discrimination has occurred!,]\u201d the Court directed trial courts to consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">(1) that the prosecutor struck most or all of the members of the identified group from the venire; (2) that the prosecutor used a disproportionate number of his or her peremptories against the group; (3) that the prosecutor failed to ask or propose questions to the challenged jurors; (4) that other than their race, the challenged jurors are as heterogeneous as the community!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\"><em>[Pruitt, supra, </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 270-71, 63 A.3d 1225 (first alteration in original) (quoting <em>Osorio, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 973 A.2d 365).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Applying those standards to the circumstances presented by this case, we determined that a remand was required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">[B]ecause there was only one qualified member of the cognizable group in the jury panel; the defendant was also a member of that same group; the prosecutor failed to ask the juror any follow-up questions; and, other than her race, the juror was as heterogeneous as the community as a whole, the trial judge should have required the prosecutor to explain his non-discriminatory reason for the challenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 264, 63 A.3d 1225.] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Since the original trial judge was no longer sitting in the Criminal Division, the remand was conducted by a second judge. At the remand hearing, the second judge required the prosecutor to explain his reasons for striking Juror Thirteen. The prosecutor stated that he asked that she be excused because she worked at the Woodbine Developmental Center (Center), a residential facility for men with developmental disabilities. The prosecutor recalled that, during voir dire, the juror told the court that she took care of the men at the Center. The prosecutor told the second judge that he typically would use peremptory challenges to excuse social workers, because he felt they were too likely to be sympathetic to the accused, and he perceived Juror Thirteen\u2019s job to be akin to that of a social worker. The prosecutor also stated that over the years his office had prosecuted a number of both residents and employees from the Center for drug offenses and other crimes, and as a result, he always struck jurors who worked there.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In his argument, defense counsel did not compare Juror Thirteen to any of the other jurors whom the prosecutor excused or did not excuse. In other words, he did not offer any specific evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s explanation was unreasonable, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>genuine, or a pretext for discrimination. Rather, he argued that, without the presence of Juror Thirteen, the remand placed the defense in the unfair position of being unable to ask the court to direct further questions to the juror, designed to address the prosecutor\u2019s expressed concerns about her possible bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s position, the judge noted that recalling Juror Thirteen was not within the scope of the remand. He also evaluated the prosecutor\u2019s explanation and found that it was neutral, plausible, case specific, and not \u201ca ruse\u201d to cover up discrimination. He therefore concluded that the defense had not carried its burden of demonstrating a <em>Gilmore </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">As the Court held in <em>Osorio, </em>once a defendant presents a prima facie case that the prosecutor made discriminatory use of a peremptory challenge, the prosecutor must present a clear and specific explanation justifying the peremptory challenge \u201c \u2018on the basis of concerns about situation-specific bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>Osorio, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 973 A.2d 365 (quoting <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 537, 511 A.2d 1150).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">In gauging whether the party exercising the peremptory challenge has met its burden, the trial court must engage in a balancing process: it must determine whether the proffered explanations are genuine and reasonable grounds for believing that potential jurors might have situation-specific biases that would make excusing them reasonable and desirable, given the aim of empanelling a fan1 and impartial petit jury, or, on the other hand, sham excuses belatedly contrived to avoid admitting acts of group discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 504-05, 973 A.2d 365 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 537-38, 511 A.2d 1150).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The trial court must make specific findings as to each allegedly improper challenge, to determine whether the State\u2019s explanation is relevant to the specific case, and whether there is any evidence that the explanation is nonetheless apparently pretextual. For example, the court should consider whether the prosecutor was even-handed in excusing non-minority jurors with that same allegedly disqualifying characteristic. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 973 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>A.2d 365 (citing <em>State v. Clark, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 473-74, 720 A.2d 632 (App.Div.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"> On this appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, so long as the judge properly applied the legal standards set forth in <em>Osorio. See id. </em>at 509, 973 A.2d 365. Because the second judge had the opportunity to hear the prosecutor\u2019s explanation first-hand, we also owe some deference to his ability to gauge the credibility of the explanation. <em>See State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Having reviewed the entire voir dire transcript, we find no abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion in reaching his conclusion. We agree with the second judge that the prosecutor\u2019s explanation was reasonable, related to the case, and not obviously pretextual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We cannot say it was unreasonable for the prosecutor to excuse a juror whose job he perceived as being akin to social work, and some of whose clients may have been prosecuted by his office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge did not specifically compare Juror Thirteen to any other jurors, but on the other hand, defense counsel did not argue that there were any other allegedly similarly situated jurors whom the prosecutor did not excuse. Based on our own review of the record, we note that the court excused for cause a juror who worked at a drug treatment facility and who expressed \u201cempathy\u201d for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>On this appeal, defendant argues for the first time that the prosecutor did not strike a number of jurors who themselves had drug or alcohol problems in the past or who had relatives with drug problems. We conclude those issues were waived, because the judge had no opportunity to consider them and the prosecutor had no opportunity to respond to them. <em>See State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1, 20-22, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009). However, even if we consider the issues, we find the argument unpersuasive. Defendant was accused of being a drug dealer, and a prosecutor could rationally believe that jurors who had drug problems in the past, or had family members with drug problems, would not necessarily be sympathetic to a drug dealer. Further, several jurors with family members who had drug problems also had relatives who were police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Defendant also points out, for the first time on appeal, that the prosecutor did not excuse a juror (Juror One) with past experience caring for the elderly. However, that juror had only a few years as a direct caregiver before she was \u201cpromoted to [working in] the office.\u201d By contrast, Juror Thirteen had spent twenty years earing for the residents at the Center. There also was no evidence that any of the employees or clients of Juror One\u2019s elder care agency had been criminally prosecuted, and early in the voir dire she stated that she was related to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In thus reviewing the evidence de novo, because these issues were not presented to the trial court, we nonetheless emphasize that it was defendant\u2019s burden to prove a <em>Gilmore </em>violation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Osorio, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 503-04, 973 A.2d 365. This means that it was defendant\u2019s burden to specify for the trial court, at the time of the remand hearing, which allegedly comparable jurors the prosecutor failed to strike. Further, as noted above, in failing to raise these issues during the remand hearing, defendant deprived the prosecutor of the opportunity to explain why he did not strike the allegedly comparable jurors. Defendant\u2019s additional appellate arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In summary, we find no abuse of discretion or other error in the remand court\u2019s decision. Thus, defendant\u2019s conviction stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\"> The \"heterogeneous\u201d standard warrants a brief clarification. It is drawn from <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 <em>Cal.3d </em>258, 148 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>890, 583 <em>P.2d </em>748 (1978), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>where the court noted that in establishing a prima facie case, a defendant may show that the prosecutor excused jurors who \u201cshare only this one characteristic \u2014 their membership in the group \u2014 and that in all other respects they are as heterogeneous as the community as a whole.\" <em>Id. </em>at 764 (quoted in <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 511 A.2d 1150). In a footnote, illustrating what \u201cheterogeneous\" meant in that context, <em>Wheeler </em>explained: \u201cFor example ... it may be significant if the persons challenged, although all black, include both men and women and are of a variety of ages, occupations, and social or economic conditions.\" <em>Id. </em>at 764 n. 27, 583 P.2d 748. Obviously, that example cannot be applied where the prosecutor has only excused one minority juror. However, it is still relevant whether that one juror has characteristics in common with other jurors whom the prosecutor did not excuse; whether the juror has characteristics similar to other excused jurors; or whether the juror has a unique characteristic, other than his or her race, that could warrant the use of a peremptory challenge. By analogy with the employment discrimination cases cited in <em>Gilmore </em>and Osorio, it is relevant whether the prosecutor treated similarly situated minority and non-minority jurors the same or differently. <em>See Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 533-34 &amp; n. 7, 511 A.2d 1150; <em>Osorio, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 500-01, 973 A.2d 365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> Some of the trial judge\u2019s language was ill-chosen, for example, in stating that the prosecutor\u2019s reason was not \"ridiculous.\u201d That is not the standard for judging the legitimacy of the prosecutor's stated reason. <em>See Clark, supra, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 469-70, 720 A.2d 632. However, viewing that language in the context of the judge\u2019s entire oral opinion we conclude he applied the correct standard. Nonetheless, we have carefully scrutinized the record ourselves and agree with his ultimate conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> There was no evidence as to the racial composition of the workforce at the Center, and hence no basis to infer that a prosecutor\u2019s invariable habit of striking Center employees from juries was more likely to be a proxy for racial discrimination. We note with disapproval defendant\u2019s citation of other facts about the Center that are not in the record. We decline to consider factual assertions that are not of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
