Defendant argues the motion judge erred in failing to compel the parties to submit to mediation or alternatively conduct a plenary hearing to address and resolve the disputed material factual issues raised by the parties. Most importantly, defendant argues the judge failed to interview the fourteen-year-old child at the center of this dispute, as mandated by <em>Rule </em>5:8-6, and failed to \u201cspecifically place on the record the factors which justify any custody arrangement not agreed to by both parents.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2\u20144(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">After reviewing the record developed before the Family Part, we agree with defendant\u2019s arguments and remand this matter for the trial judge to refer this matter to mediation as required under <em>Rule </em>5:8-1. If mediation fails to resolve the custody and parenting time issues raised by the parties, the judge shall then conduct a plenary hearing to resolve the factual disputes contained in the parties\u2019 account of events, and thereafter place on the record his factual findings and conclusions of law as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(f) and <em>Rule </em>1:7-4(a). As part of this hearing, the judge must comply with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 by either interviewing the parties\u2019 now sixteen-year-old son concerning the custody and parenting time issues raised by his parents, or otherwise place on the record the reasons for his decision not to interview this child. In reaching this decision, the judge must consider the factors outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c), including \u201cthe preference of the child,\u201d given his age and capacity to reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">We discern the following facts from the record developed before the Family Part.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The parties had a dating relationship from 1996 to 2000. Their son \u201cJeremy\u201d (a fictitious name to protect his privacy) was born in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>December 1998. Represented by separate counsel, the parties agreed to mediate the legal issues concerning their son and entered into a Consent Order for Joint Custody and Parenting Time dated April 26, 2002. This Consent Order comprehensively addressed and resolved all of the issues generally associated with the rearing of the parties\u2019 then three-year-old son, including agreeing that the child would reside with plaintiff (mother), while giving defendant (father) \u201creasonable and liberal parenting time with the child.\u201d The Consent Order included a detailed description of the terms governing defendant\u2019s parenting time with his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Neither party sought judicial intervention to modify the terms of this Consent Order until defendant filed a motion on November 7, 2012, \u201crequesting changes in the custody/parenting time terms of the [consent] order to reflect the current practice and agreement.\u201d Defendant claimed plaintiff had voluntarily agreed to this modification permitting Jeremy to reside with him because her relationship with her then thirteen-year-old son had deteriorated and become too difficult to handle, given the demands of time and effort associated with her then recent employment as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Defendant attached to the notice of motion an \u201cinformation sheet\u201d dated October 28, 2012, setting forth the basis for his request that the court recognize and approve what he claimed was a de facto, mutually agreed upon voluntary modification of the custodial arrangement established in the 2002 Consent Order. The following account of events is based upon the allegations defendant made in support of this motion. Specifically, defendant claimed that since the Consent Order \u201cwas issued almost ten years ago, the [p]laintiff and I have on many occasions informally modified the custody and parenting time terms of the Court Order to better align with [Jeremyjs needs and best interest.\u201d Although he recognized that his son had been academically successful during the time he had resided with his mother, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>claimed the child had also experienced \u201cintermittent disciplinary and behavioral issues____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">These issues became more acute as the boy reached his teenage years. Defendant attributes his son\u2019s behavioral problems, at least in part, to plaintiffs \u201cparenting style,\u201d which defendant characterizes as \u201cill-suited and ineffective in addressing\u201d Jeremy\u2019s disciplinary problems. Defendant alleges he \u201cregularly got phone calls\u201d from both plaintiff and Jeremy \u201cexpressing frustration and anger, or complaints about the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The relationship between Jeremy and his mother continued to deteriorate during the boy\u2019s pre-teen years. Eventually plaintiff told defendant that \u201cshe thought it would be better if [Jeremy] lived with [him] permanently.\u201d Defendant claimed that during the summer of 2012, when Jeremy was thirteen years old, he and plaintiff \u201creached [an] agreement that [he] would take primary custody of [Jeremy], to begin \u2018officially\u2019 when school started in September [2012].\u201d They agreed upon a parenting time schedule that permitted Jeremy to meet with his mother on Wednesdays \u201cafter school\u201d and stay with her overnight on \u201calternate weekends.\u201d Defendant represented to the court that this arrangement \u201chas been in effect at least since September [2012].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">With respect to child support, defendant claimed plaintiff agreed to file a motion to modify the Consent Order \u201cto reflect this understanding in December 2012 when she graduated from police academy training. In the meantime, [p]laintiff agreed that she would reimburse me in the amount of the child support payments I made pending the modification.\u201d According to defendant, he decided to file the motion seeking judicial recognition of this oral agreement because plaintiff told him \u201cshe did not have time [to do it herself] because she was too busy due to her police academy obligations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Plaintiff submitted her own certification disputing all of the material allegations defendant made in support of his motion. As a starting point, plaintiff emphasized defendant \u201chas a law degree from Harvard and a MBA [Master\u2019s Degree in Business Administration] from the University of Pennsylvania.\u201d She described defendant\u2019s conduct during their initial attempts in 2002 at resolving the custody and parenting time issues as confrontational and less than completely candid and forthright on defendant\u2019s part. She was nevertheless thankful that they were able to reach an agreement that lasted for eleven years \u201cexcept for very brief periods of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Plaintiff cited the summer of 2012 when she began her academy training to become a police officer as an example of one of the \u201cbrief\u2019 departures from the custodial arrangement reflected in the 2002 Consent Order. Because the time demands imposed on her by this training coincided with defendant being unemployed, plaintiff \u201cthought it would be a fine opportunity for \u2018father and son\u2019 to spend more time together.\u201d She insisted, however, that this was a temporary custodial arrangement intended to end when she graduated from the police academy on December 14, 2012. Because the exigency that necessitated this custodial arrangement had ended, plaintiff claimed it was in her son\u2019s best interest to return to her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">With respect to her son\u2019s welfare, plaintiff alleges Jeremy \u201cis exposed to violence at [defendant\u2019s] home and that his needs are being neglected.\u201d Her concern over her son\u2019s safety emanates from defendant\u2019s wife. Plaintiff characterizes defendant\u2019s relationship with his wife as \u201cquite violent.\u201d She claims three domestic violence restraining orders have been filed between defendant and his wife, \u201cbelieves\u201d each has filed municipal court charges against the other, and claims \u201cthe police have been called to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>home on multiple occasions.\u201d She thus fears that Jeremy is \u201coften put in the middle\u201d of defendant\u2019s violent and dysfunctional relationship with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">By way of proof, plaintiff presented to the trial court (and included in the appellate record) three emails allegedly sent by Jeremy on the morning of April 11, 2012. The first email, sent at 9:22 a.m., states: \u201cMOM CALL THE POLICE SEND THEM TO MY DADS [sic] HOUSE [naming defendant\u2019s wife] HAS A KNIFE PLEASE CALL PLEASE CALL THE POLICE AND SENT THEM TO [defendant\u2019s home address]! PLEASE PE-LASE [sic] PLEASe [sic].\u201d The second email, sent at 9:23 a.m., states: \u201cCALL THE POLICE AND SENT IT TO MY DADS [sic] HOUSE PLEASE PLEASDE [sic] PLEASE.\u201d The third and final email, sent at 9:24 a.m., states: \u201cSEND THEM TO MY DADS [sic] HOUSE SEND THEM TO MY DADS [sic] HOUSE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoM\">Plaintiff claims she was shopping one block away from defendant\u2019s residence when she received the first email, and \u201crushed over.\u201d When she arrived at defendant\u2019s apartment, she \u201chad to knock on the door really hard and had to yell out for him.\u201d When she finally gained access to the apartment, her son told her</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">that he locked himself in his room when he saw the knife. As we were leaving, I saw [defendant] outside the building with his daughter [identifies her by name]. I asked him what happened. He simply said that \u201c[his wife] was having a hormonal moment and left the house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Plaintiff characterizes defendant\u2019s response to the violence between him and his wife as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d As a result, she \u201cdid not allow [Jeremy to go his father\u2019s home] for the next 3 weeks.\u201d Plaintiff also claims that at some unspecified time defendant and his wife were involved \u201cin a court battle for their [six-year] old daughter.\u201d It is plaintiffs \u201cunderstanding\u201d that defendant\u2019s wife \u201clost the case because of her violent tendencies and her drug use.\u201d Plaintiff alleges defendant and his wife \u201chave since reconciled and live together.\u201d Plaintiff concluded this aspect of her certification by describing defendant\u2019s home as \u201can unstable, violent place for our son. A custody transfer to [defendant] would not be in [Jeremy\u2019s] best interest whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Despite making these highly inflammatory allegations against defendant and his wife, plaintiff conceded that she \u201cmodified\u201d the custodial arrangement at the start of Jeremy\u2019s freshman year of high school for \u201capproximately two months.\u201d She claims, however, that the custodial arrangement defendant described in his statement ended when defendant\u2019s wife \u201cstarted having problems with our son.\u201d Specifically, plaintiff claims defendant\u2019s wife called her to complain about having to drive Jeremy around because he \u201cwasn\u2019t her child or her responsibility.\u201d Instead of immediately terminating the arrangement, plaintiff claims she told defendant\u2019s wife \u201cto discuss the matter with [defendant]. After all, [Jeremy] was his responsibility as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Plaintiff describes her personal life as nonviolent and happy. She has a stable relationship with \u201canother police officer.\u201d She claims her \u201c \u2018significant other\u2019 loves [Jeremy] and [Jeremy] loves him.\u201d She does not have a criminal record and \u201clookfs] forward to a long career with [the] [p]olice [department.\u201d Finally, because she does not have any other children, she can focus her attention on Jeremy.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Defendant filed a reply certification noting that he had not made any inflammatory allegations against plaintiff in support of his motion, and then lamenting the <em>ad hominem </em>attacks plaintiff had made against him and his wife. Defendant addressed and refuted the many instances of impropriety alleged by plaintiff. He also emphasized that plaintiff had not objected to his regular overnight contacts with his son since 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Despite defendant\u2019s alleged intent to remain above the fray and take the moral high ground in this dispute, his reply certification is replete with disparaging allegations of plaintiffs confrontational parenting style, including resorting to striking Jeremy \u201crepeatedly with a broomstick\u201d and threatening him \u201cwith a baseball bat.\u201d We pause here to note the same seeming contradictions in defendant\u2019s position we noted when we reviewed plaintiffs certification. That is, despite these highly disturbing accusations and concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>about plaintiffs parenting style, defendant allowed his young son to reside with his allegedly violent mother for over ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\n<em>The First Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Both sides were represented by counsel at the time defendant\u2019s motion to modify the 2002 Consent Order came before the Family Part on December 21, 2012. Unfortunately, the attorneys\u2019 demeanor and arguments echoed the vitriolic tone reflected in the warring certifications submitted by their respective clients. We are compelled to note at this time the informality with which the trial judge conducted this motion hearing. Although the parties were technically \u201csworn\u201d by a Sheriffs Officer at the start, the environment created by the informal, conversational style of the proceeding was more akin to a mediation session than an adjudicative hearing. This had the unintended, yet unfortunate effect of yielding more heat than light, ultimately leaving unresolved the central issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The judge interacted with the parties on the record in a highly informal manner, asking questions and receiving material and conflicting factual assertions in response from both the parties and their respective counsel. Despite these conflicting material accounts involving key events, the judge seemed at times to accept or reject these proffers and representations wdthout having the benefit of a factual record developed through a traditional eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Through this freewheeling colloquy, plaintiff conceded that Jeremy had been residing with defendant since she entered the police academy at the start of the summer of 2012. In fact, when the judge asked plaintiff whether \u201cas a practical matter,\u201d Jeremy resided with his father \u201cright now,\u201d plaintiff answered: \u201cRight now he\u2019s staying there, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">However, defendant asserted (without being subjected to cross-examination) that by mutual agreement with plaintiff, Jeremy had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>been residing with him since he graduated eighth grade in 2010. The judge addressed defendant directly to ensure he understood his position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">THE COURT: Okay. So your position is since 2010 [Jeremy] has been \u2014 when you say staying with you what do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. I mean Monday through Friday with an understanding that he would \u2014 she\u2014he would be over with her on the weekends. And' \u2014 and actually quite frequently during those weekends because of the confrontations that they would have he would actually call me to have him \u2014 pick him up____So actually he would end up spending more than that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel asked the judge \u201cto put the same question to [plaintiff.]\u201d In <em>response, </em>the judge asked plaintiff: \u201cWhat do you have to say?\u201d After some equivocation, plaintiff denied defendant\u2019s account and offered to produce her parents and other friends as witnesses to support her position. In the midst of this freewheeling exchange, the judge made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKB\">THE COURT: We can \u2014 and we can have [Jeremy] come in here too, but I really don\u2019t want to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ag-dedup-0\">DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">THE COURT: All right. Let me make that clear. But don\u2019t \u2014 let\u2019s\u2014let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that now, all right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Despite the parties\u2019 intransigence and conflicting positions, the motion judge continued to press for some form of mediated solution. Showing his frustration, the judge addressed the parties directly and asked: \u201cWhy do I have to make a decision for the two of you about where your son should stay?\u201d The record shows that fourteen transcript pages of argument and colloquy transpired thereafter. The judge never received a direct answer to his poignant, yet seemingly rhetorical question. At that point, the judge addressed the parties once again with these final words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap5\">All right. I\u2019m going to say something \u2014 now, I\u2019m going to say something. [Addressing plaintiff] Let\u2019s stop talking about [defendant\u2019s wife] too, all right, if you don\u2019t mind. I know you don\u2019t mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>I \u2014 I think, look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m trying to resolve it, I want to resolve it. It doesn\u2019t make sense for the both of you to keep coming back here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">The both of you are working. The both of you are intelligent people. Now, come on. Now, the court order that was in effect which has not been amended since 2002, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">All right. Then that\u2019s what I am inclined to continue in effect. Now, the question becomes what are we going to do to effect liberal parenting time. And when I say liberal I don\u2019t mean necessarily every other weekend, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some other way we can effectuate long weekends or what. I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m not going to go through here trying to work out a parenting schedule, all right. Now, you can either go to mediation, you can go today if we can arrange it, or the two of you, or all four of you can go into my conference room, sit down, and come up with a parenting schedule where [defendantj gets liberal parenting time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">We can do that ... We can send the parties to mediation and see what develops. I\u2019d like to think, as I said, and I\u2019m not saying this \u2014 and I don\u2019t say this to everyone who appears in front of me, you\u2019re two very intelligent people. Take a step back for a moment and try to work this out. Yes or no? Are going to try to do something since we have the parties here?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">As an accommodation to the attorneys\u2019 schedule, and in light of the pending holiday recess, the court scheduled the matter to return for mediation on Thursday, January 10, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">\n<em>The Second Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">When the parties returned on January 10, 2013, nothing substantive had changed. The parties remained barricaded behind their intransigent, materially-conflicting positions. Plaintiffs counsel apprised the judge that \u201cbecause there has been no specific parenting plan [defendant] has taken it upon himself to keep the child and take the child sometimes more often than not thereby basically ignoring Your Honor\u2019s court order and thereby depriving my client of residential custody.\u201d Defense counsel responded by asserting that the parties were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">at an impasse in terms of residential custody. There\u2019s this kind of amorphous liberal parenting time plan where the 14-year old who wants to stay at his father\u2019s house, has demanded to stay at his father\u2019s house, has been staying at his father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>house during the week and there has been ongoing conflict between the child and his mother. There\u2019s no violation of the court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">What we have is a 14-year old who is as big as [his father] who goes to school, who\u2019s successful in school, who wants to stay with his father. We have two parents. We have a mother who is demanding that the child stay at the house during the week when she\u2019s at work at \u2014 at last report until eight o\u2019clock at night and [defendant] has taken on the responsibility of being the custodial parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The proceedings continued to be conducted from this point on in the same informal manner that characterized the December 21, 2012 hearing. The attorneys continued to make conflicting factual representations to the judge without any competent evidence to support them. Plaintiffs counsel pressed the judge to reaffirm his prior ruling and order, and reaffirm plaintiffs role as the residential custodial parent. As the following passage indicates, however, in making this argument plaintiffs counsel implicitly conceded defense counsel\u2019s claim that the child was, as a matter of fact, residing on a fulltime basis with his father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: Your Honor\u2019s order needs to be enforced. This 14-year-old child is being a 14-year-old child. He\u2019s being rebellious. He doesn\u2019t like the discipline that my client has at her home. At [defendant\u2019s home he gets to sit in his room all day playing his computer games.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: And that\u2019s not what happens at [plaintiffl\u2019s home. So I ask that Your Honor finalize this case, end this case, not let a 14^-year-old dictate the terms of a court order, remind [defendant] that there is an enforceable court order in \u2014 it\u2019s actually a criminal violation, Judge, as Your Honor knows better than anyone else, to deprive someone a court-ordered custody or parenting time for more than 24 hours. He\u2019s done that time and again [apparently referring to defendant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">This vitriolic exchange of unsupported accusations by the attorneys continued throughout this hearing, interrupted intermittently only by the judge\u2019s acknowledgment of any particular statement. At one point, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I think that the [e]ourt should, A, determine what the real problem is here, because if this 14-year old wanted to go stay at his mother\u2019s that\u2019s where he would be. [Defendant] has said it to me. If the child wants to get on the bus after school and take the bus to his mother\u2019s house he could do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">[T]hat\u2019s true that he\u2019s been with [defendant] for two years. And determine \u2014 and determine what this child is saying, because I have a client who\u2019s telling me, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>child, \u2014 and I say child, he\u2019s 14, wants to stay with me, is doing well with me, has conflict with his mother. And you have a mother saying the child should be with me because there\u2019s an order from 2002 that says that he should be with me. I think the [c]ourl needs to determine exactly whaU-which of those things is true. THE COURT: Yeah, well how do I do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, A\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: And \u2014 and the way my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">THE COURT: How do I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: Hold on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">THE COURT: No, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on. I\u2019m directing the question to [defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">THE COURT: How do I do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: A, take testimony from the parties; B, interview the 14-year old, because he is certainly mature enough to express to the Lclourt\u2014 PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: I would object to that, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Of course they\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-15\">THE COURT: <em>Well </em>\u2014 well, <em>you see, now this is where we </em>\u2014 this <em>is where we go because I test </em>\u2014 taking <em>testimony from the parties is not going to give me the insight that I need because, as you </em>said, <em>they are diametrically opposed. Their [perspective] of what\u2019s going on, all right, is of course, tainted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-16\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: ... I think what the [elourt needs is a third-party [perspective] on exactly what\u2019s going on, because I think the [c]ourt is right, when you\u2019re faced with two diametrically opposed views I think that an interview with the child, or at the very least appointing an evaluator, a psychologist to look at the child, look at the parents, and find out exactly what\u2019s going on. Because otherwise there\u2019s not going to be a resolution, because the parties are not going to agree. [ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">Plaintiffs counsel continued to press for enforcement of the judge\u2019s supposed \u201cfinal decision\u201d requiring residential custody to remain with plaintiff and relisting the matter only for a determination of the parenting time arrangement. Plaintiffs counsel concurred with the judge\u2019s decision that taking testimony from the parties in a formal evidentiary hearing, subject to cross-examination \u201cis not going to resolve anything.\u201d With respect to the suggestion that the judge interview Jeremy, plaintiffs counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-18\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: I will go a step further than that[, | to bring a 14-year old in, a very smart, perceptive, intelligent, understanding 14-year old into Your Honor\u2019s chambers, into what is a very, no offense to any of us, unpleasant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>atmosphere and choose. Well, there\u2019s police officers here, there are people being handcuffed here.

Split the custody 50/50, come up with the days, and that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do.

And both parents, of course, have to abide by the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Several more transcript pages later, defendant addressed the judge directly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">DEFENDANT: The [custody arrangement] that\u2019s proposed now, given what\u2019s happened just since the last time we were in this courtroom in trying to \u2014 to have [Jeremy] abide by that agreement.

I don\u2019t like being put in the position where I\u2019m made to somehow look like I\u2019m in contempt because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">THE COURT: No, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">DEFENDANT: \u2014he absolutely refuses to go with his mom or \u2014 or to leave when she comes to pick him up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">The judge then asked defendant if certain variations with the days of the week in the custody order would be likely to obtain Jeremy\u2019s compliance. This prompted defendant to respond: \u201cWe can put in another order, but I\u2019m almost certain that we\u2019ll be right back here again because he will not abide by it.\u201d Thereafter, plaintiffs counsel again pressed the court to reaffirm what he claimed to have been the court\u2019s prior order, giving plaintiff full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>residential custody of her son. With respect to defendant\u2019s admonition, emphasizing the likelihood that Jeremy would \u201cnot abide\u201d the court\u2019s order, plaintiffs counsel argued that \u201c[t]his child has to be encouraged and <em>pushed to comply with the order.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">This prompted the following response by the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">THE COURT: All right, here\u2019s the order of the court. It\u2019s split custody 50/50. You [workl out a plan how you do it, all right. You work it out, you give it to me before the end of the day.

That\u2019s the order of the [elourt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">[T]ell the young man he\u2019s got to abide by the [e]ourt order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">On January 17, 2013, just one week alter the court\u2019s order, plaintiff filed an Order to Show Cause (OTSC) against defendant before a different judge seeking Jeremy\u2019s return by \u201c8:00 p.m. on January 18, 2013.\u201d Plaintiff submitted a certification claiming defendant had \u201ccompletely disregarded\u201d two court orders and as a result, she had not seen her son in ten days. To induce the court to issue this emergent relief, plaintiff averred that defendant: (1) refused to bring Jeremy to her home; (2) rebuked her efforts to retrieve Jeremy; (3) \u201calmost never answers\u201d her phone calls; and (4) had told Jeremy not to come home.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">On January 15, 2013, plaintiff sent her sister to pick up Jeremy at defendant\u2019s home, and \u201c[w]hen she was unsuccessful, [her sister] called the police.\u201d Plaintiff did not have any personal knowledge of what transpired when police officers arrived at defendant\u2019s home in response to her sister\u2019s call. Despite this legal impediment, plaintiff averred to the judge who issued the OTSC that \u201c[sjhortly after the officers arrived, [defendant] told them that we were still \u2018waiting for a decision\u2019 and the \u2018court process is still going on.\u2019 This was a blatant, bold-faced lie!!!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_5\">Plaintiff asked the OTSC judge to issue a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest if he failed to comply with the emergent relief she was seeking. The judge who entered the OTSC awarded plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>custody of Jeremy \u201cuntil further order,\u201d and set the matter down for a hearing on January 24, 2013, before the first judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>The Third Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The trial judge opened this hearing by expressing his regrets that the OTSC had been entered on the week he was on vacation. After this short preliminary remark, the judge addressed the parties and counsel directly stating: \u201c[Y]ou guys can appeal me you can do whatever you want, but I\u2019m going to say something. This is coming to an end. One way or the other. Today this is over. That\u2019s the preface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Despite the judge\u2019s resoluteness and good faith efforts, the informality and disregard for the rules governing judicial proceedings continued unabated. By way of example, in response to the judge asking plaintiffs counsel \u201cwhat\u2019s been going on since [Jeremy] has been with your client over the past week?\u201d, counsel responded: \u201c[Jeremy told] my client ... T have no problem living by this 50/50 arrangement if you stop my father\u2019s child support.\u2019 \u201d This brazen attempt at impugning defendant\u2019s credibility with incompetent hearsay evidence was left unchallenged by defense counsel, and apparently accepted by the judge without reservation. In fact, in response to plaintiffs counsel\u2019s assertion, the judge noted: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about what you raised about the child support statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">This prompted some discussion about whether the provision in the 2002 Consent Order addressing child support should be amended to reflect the current joint-custody arrangement the judge had ordered on January 10, 2013. The discussion returned to the issue of custody, and plaintiffs counsel claimed that things between Jeremy and his mother were going <em>\u201csmooth.\u201d </em>Plaintiffs counsel also made the following representation to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE9\">[Jeremy] is 14-years old. We have every confidence that if [Jeremy] was encouraged to comply by [defendant] that he would. He\u2019s an impressionable young 14-year-old man who has to \u2014 really has to \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to sound \u2014 engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>psychobabble here, he has to compete for his father\u2019s attention with two younger children who also live in the home. And so it\u2019s not surprising that he's shown a bit of [resistance].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">But when he is \u2014 when it\u2019s told to him and it\u2019s emphasized that there are consequences for non-compliance he stays out at the home. He\u2019s been there since Sunday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">When asked by the judge to respond, defense counsel immediately seized upon his adversary\u2019s characterization of things going \u201csmooth\u201d between Jeremy and his mother to claim that in fact the converse was the case. According to defense counsel, \u201crough\u201d was a more apt description of what had taken place since the police arrived at his client\u2019s home. Defense counsel noted the irony in this situation, because it was plaintiffs counsel who argued against the judge interviewing Jeremy in chambers to avoid exposing him to the traumatic experience of seeing armed police officers in the courthouse. At plaintiffs request, local police officers responded two times to defendant\u2019s home in the seven-day period between the January 10, 2013 hearing and the January 17, 2013 OTSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Defense counsel claimed to have seen text messages sent by Jeremy to his father asking him repeatedly to come and pick him up and take him away from plaintiffs home. According to defense counsel, Jeremy decided on his own to walk to his father\u2019s home, which is located approximately three miles from plaintiffs residence. Again, following the consistent theme of this case, counsel\u2019s representation was unsupported by competent evidence. This prompted the judge to speculate: \u201cMaybe he got ill because of all this constant bickering ... between the mother and the father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">After again drifting into discussions concerning child support, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys responded to defense counsel\u2019s comments concerning Jeremy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: Your Honor knew that there would be some [resistance] to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: There\u2019s less resistance now then there had been, because when Your Honor entered the first order, entered the second order, the kid said I\u2019m not going, I don\u2019t care what any judge tells me. Now he\u2019s complying. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>That\u2019s progress, okay. He\u2019s at mom\u2019s house since \u2014 for a week now, okay. Your Honor made a wise, <em>well-informed, decision. ... </em>I\u2019m not trying to patronize Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: ... After Your Honor entered the order from December 21st, 2012 giving my client residential custody and continuing the order from 2002 [defendant] took the child as he pleased, kept the child as he pleased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">THE COURT: You made your point, you made your point why we\u2019re here. You made your point____ So let\u2019s not argue what we argued last time. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_G\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, the real problem here, and this is \u2014 I guess it\u2019s a dispute, I guess it\u2019s something that the [c]ourt is going to have to get to the bottom ... of, we have a 14-year old [boy.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">We have a child that does not want to be at his mother\u2019s. You sent the \u2014 they\u2014 they sent the police to his house. He goes to the mother\u2019s house, he leaves the mother\u2019s house. Now, the police come back to his house. And all the while all they\u2019re saying to you is [defendant] is at fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">There\u2019s a problem here. The problem isn\u2019t [defendant]. He didn\u2019t make his son leave her house. He didn\u2019t make her son not want to go there. If the 14-year old wanted to go there he would have went there. Nobody\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s not in a cage. He\u2019s a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">At this point, the judge interrupted defense counsel to advise both attorneys that he had received that day a \u201ccase blurbs from the bar association\u201d concerning an unpublished opinion from this court. According to the judge, in this non-precedential decision this court reversed the Family Part for failing to interview a fifteen-year-old child in a matter involving a change of custody application. The judge conceded that he did not have the full opinion, but immediately thought of this case after reading the synopsis. To his credit, the judge candidly admitted that he had been reticent to interview Jeremy because he wanted to spare the child the emotional trauma associated with his parents\u2019 feud.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">The judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">But it may have come to that point. Because we cannot have the situation continue here where there\u2019s police involvement, for reasons that I already alluded to. And then we have a request made that I should enter an order that there be an immediate arrest if there\u2019s non-compliance. That\u2019s not happening. I\u2019ll tell you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that right now. There might be other sanctions first, monetary or otherwise, but they\u2019ll be no such order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">So now here\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. You\u2019re right though why we\u2019re here. And I don\u2019t want to expand the reason why we\u2019re here. But it\u2019s clear to me that despite what I think on my best efforts to try to have the two of you come together it\u2019s not happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, the current order remains in full force and effect. It has to be obeyed. If either one of you want to file an application that includes specifically that we interview the child you may do so. Or if the two of you agree to that you may do so, but you\u2019re going to have [to] file a motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">I\u2019d like the two of you, if you could, to take a look at the case. I\u2019m going to try to get the case____It\u2019s unreported, but it\u2019s Ipersuasive].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: But someone has to file the application, Your Honor. THE COURT: Right. I\u2019m not doing it \u2014 no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">THE COURT: No, no. I\u2019m not doing it on my own motion. Maybe you can\u2014 you \u2014 I still \u2014 let me try one other \u2014 one other approach, and I know at one time we discussed this, mediation. Is mediation out of the question?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Defendant\u2019s counsel indicated his client was \u201copen to mediation\u201d; plaintiff herself made clear she was not. Following plaintiffs unequivocal rejection, defense counsel indicated his client was equally unwilling to submit to this alternative process. Despite the judge\u2019s best efforts to convince them to change their minds, they remained committed to their position not to mediate.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">On January 31, 2013, defendant filed a motion requesting the court to: (1) reconsider the January 10, 2013 order; (2) grant defendant primary residential custody of Jeremy; (3) order the parties to submit to mediation; (4) interview Jeremy; (5) reinstate the parenting time that prevailed from September 2012 to the end of 2012; and (6) modify defendant\u2019s child support obligation commensurate with his status as a parent with primary residential custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion came before the trial judge on March 18, 2013. The attorneys recounted the tortured procedural history of the case, and continued to make unsupported factual allegations. Conspicuously missing from this exchange is any reference to legal authority supporting or undermining the arguments advanced by either side. No statute, court rule, or case law was cited. At the conclusion, the judge again reaffirmed his previous order and declined to interview Jeremy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Against this record, defendant now appeals, arguing the trial judge erred in failing to order the parties to submit to mediation as required under <em>Rule </em>5:8-1, and failing to consider and apply the factors outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-4 before reaching a final decision on who should be Jeremy\u2019s primary residential custodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">We start our legal analysis by reaffirming that \u201cthe best interests of the child\u201d is the fundamental legal principle that will guide our review of this case. <em>Kinsella v. Kinsella, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>276, 317-18, 696 A.2d 556 (1997). This overarching consideration \u2014 \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d \u2014 was defined by our Supreme Court nearly fifty-nine years ago as a paramount judicial responsibility to consider and safeguard \u201cthe safety, happiness, physical, mental and moral welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Fantony v. Fantony, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>525, 536, 122 A.2d 593 (1956). The Legislature has also adopted the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard as a matter of public policy. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 9:2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Determining what custodial arrangement is in the best interest of a child requires the Family Part judge to apply the statutory factors outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4, as complimented by the relevant court rules governing an award or change of custody, and reach a conclusion that is supported by the material factual record. \u201cAbsent exigent circumstances, changes in custody should not be ordered without a full plenary hearing.\u201d <em>Faucett v. Vasquez, </em>411 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>108, 119, 984 A.2d 460 (2009), <em>certif. denied, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>435, 3 A.3d 1225 (2010) (citing <em>R. </em>5:8-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Our Supreme Court has noted that, as a general proposition, we should accord great deference to discretionary decisions made by Family Part judges, provided they are supported by adequate, substantial, and credible evidence in the record. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-13, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). A proper exercise of judicial discretionary authority \u201cconnotes conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action; it takes into account the law and the particular circumstances of the case before the court.\u201d <em>Higgins v. Polk, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>490, 493, 103 A.2d 1 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Here, our extensive examination of the record developed before the Family Part over three separate hearings did not reveal any instance in which the trial judge applied, considered, or even mentioned any of the relevant statutory and regulatory standards to determine whether a change in residential custody was in the best interest of this then fourteen-year-old boy. The Family Part\u2019s unexplained departure from the established policies governing change of custody applications leaves us with no other alternative but to remand this matter for the court to consider and apply the required procedural guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\n<em>Mediation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">With respect to mediation, <em>Rule </em>5:8-1 makes clear that \u201c[i]n family actions in which the court finds that either the custody of children or parenting time issues, or both, are a genuine and substantial issue, the court <em>shall </em>refer the case to mediation in accordance with the provisions of <em>[Rule </em>] 1:40-5.\u201d (Emphasis added). In order to provide a reasonable and meaningful opportunity for mediation to succeed, the trial court should confer with counsel and thereafter enter a ease management order: (1) identifying the issues the mediator should address to resolve the parties\u2019 custodial dispute; and (2) setting an initial two-month deadline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>report back as required under <em>Rule </em>5:8-1, with the proviso that this time period can be extended \u201con good cause shown.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the parties are not required to present expert opinion testimony during the mediation process, they are free to agree otherwise. <em>Ibid. </em>In short, the court must give the parties and the mediator all rights conferred under <em>Rule </em>5:8-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The case management order must also include a clear and definitive date for ending the mediation process. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial judge is ultimately responsible for the progress of any litigation. The judge thus remains in control of the case at all times, and must guard against either party abusing the mediation process by treating it as tactic to delay, frustrate, or otherwise undermine the custodial or parenting time rights of the adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Given the parties\u2019 acrimonious relationship, as reflected in the manner they have behaved throughout this litigation, it appears to us unlikely that mediation will be successful. However, a professionally trained mediator is capable of creating an environment that fosters compromise over intransigence, enabling these litigants to subordinate their emotionally-driven personal interests to the higher needs of their teenaged son to have <em>both of his parents involved in his life. </em>That being said, when the mediation process fails to reach a <em>timely </em>acceptable outcome, the court needs to quickly and decisively reassert its authority over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\n<em>Plenary Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The record we have described here in great detail illustrates the parties have asserted what the judge correctly characterized as \u201cdiametrically\u201d opposing positions regarding what type of custodial arrangement would be in the best interest of their now sixteen-year-old son. Plaintiff claims defendant\u2019s home life has been and continues to be dominated by domestic violence, which places her son in a physical danger and creates an emotionally chaotic home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>environment, rendering defendant utterly ill-suited to be Jeremy\u2019s residential custodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Defendant has refuted these allegations and claims plaintiffs overly confrontational, needlessly punitive parenting style has alienated Jeremy from his mother to such an extent that the teenager is not willing to reside with her. As an example of plaintiffs alleged inappropriate parenting-behavior, defendant \u201ctold\u201d the trial judge that plaintiff has at times used excessive corporal punishment to discipline Jeremy. According to defendant, Jeremy\u2019s age and level of maturation has reached a point that it would be physically futile and emotionally counterproductive to force him to live with his mother by judicial decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Given the parties\u2019 allegations, and to assist the trial judge in reaching the exquisitely difficult decision concerning what kind of residential custodial arrangement would be in Jeremy\u2019s best interest, we strongly suggest the court consider appointing an independent mental health professional to evaluate the current psychological and emotional state of Jeremy and his parents. <em>Rule </em>5:3-3(b) provides the trial judge with the discretionary authority to appoint a mental health expert to perform parenting/custody evaluations of the parties and Jeremy. The mental health expert appointed by the court is mandated to conduct a \u201cstrictly non-partisan\u201d evaluation to opine what would be in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Ibid. </em>Such an evaluation \u201cshould consider and include reference to criteria set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4, as well as any other information or factors they believe pertinent to each case.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">We conclude our discussion of this issue by cautioning the trial court that reports by mental health care experts may at times include the expert\u2019s opinion or recommendation to the court on the ultimate question of custody. These experts may also believe, or outright express in their reports, that their professional training and experience gives them unique insights into the dynamics of troubled families, and they may urge the court to adopt their recommendations or at least defer to their professional judgments on the issue of custody and/or parenting time. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>opinions of mental health practitioners or of any other professionals in the various fields related to the human psyche should be carefully considered by a judge when appropriate, such opinions do not relieve the trial judge from the ultimate responsibility of determining what type of custody arrangement is in the best interest of the child. The burden of making and explaining that decision remains at all times the exclusive obligation of the trial judge and can never be delegated to any other party. <em>See Mackowski v. Mackowski, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 13, 721 A.2d 12 (App.Div.1998) (\u201cCeding fact-finding responsibility to another party dilutes our ability, as judges, to decide issues based on the \u2018best evidence\u2019 [of the child] available.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Interviewing Jeremy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The record here shows that at various times during the multiple hearings conducted by the trial judge both the parties and attorneys made allegations, proffers, and representations describing Jeremy\u2019s emotional state concerning his various interactions with the parties and them respective spouse and/or \u201csignificant other.\u201d The central figure in this family drama is unquestionably this now sixteen-year-old juvenile. Both parties made glowing representations to the trial judge about his intellectual attributes, his academic prowess, and his emotional maturity. Unfortunately, both sides have also claimed Jeremy has been significantly harmed while in the physical custody of the other parent, and will be exposed to even <em>greater </em>harm if forced by the court to reside with the other parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In our view, the discretionary authority conferred to the trial judge under <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 was precisely intended to be exercised in eases such as this one. We recognize a previous version of <em>Rule 5:8-6 </em>provided that <em>\u201cthe [trial] court shall ... at the request of a litigant conduct an interview with the children) if the child(ren) are age 7 or older.\u2019\u2019 Mackowski, supra, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 11, 721 A.2d 12 (emphasis added). We also acknowledge that at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>recommendation of the Family Practice Committee and based, in part, on the reasoning expressed by our colleague Judge Kestin in his concurring opinion in <em>Mackowski</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court amended <em>Rule </em>5:8-6, effective September 3, 2002. The rule now reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Where the court finds that the custody of children is a genuine and substantial issue, the court shall set a hearing date no later than six months after the last responsive pleading. The court may, in order to protect the best interests of the children, conduct the custody hearing in a family action prior to a final hearing of the entire family action. As <em>part of the custody hearing, the court may on its own motion or at the request of a litigant conduct an in camera interview with the child(ren). </em>In the absence of good cause, the decision to conduct an interview shall be made before trial. If the court elects not to conduct an interview, it shall place its reasons on the record. If the court elects to conduct an interview, it shall afford counsel the opportunity to submit questions for the court\u2019s use during the interview and shall place on the record its reasons for not asking any question thus submitted. A stenographic or recorded record shall be made of each interview in its entirety. Transcripts thereof shall be provided to counsel and the parties upon request and payment for the cost. However, neither parent shall discuss nor reveal the contents of the interview with the children or third parties without permission of the court. Counsel shall have the right to provide the transcript or its contents to any expert retained on the issue of custody. Any judgment or order pursuant to this hearing shall be treated as a final judgment or order for custody. <em>[Rule </em>5:8-6 (emphasis added). I</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">By replacing the word <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>in the pre-2002 version of the Rule with the word <em>\u201cmay,\u201d </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the decision whether to interview a child in a contested custody case is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, which, as in all matters affecting children, must be guided by the best interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>of the child. The Rule also provides that \u201cin the absence of good cause,\u201d the trial judge should decide whether to interview the child <em>before the start of the trial.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Of particular relevance here, <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 also contains equally clear, non-discretionary mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">If the court elects not to conduct an interview, it <em>shall </em>place its reasons on the record. If the court elects to conduct an interview, it <em>shall </em>afford counsel the opportunity to submit questions for the court\u2019s use during the interview and <em>shall </em>place on the record its reasons for not asking any question thus submitted. [ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Without belaboring the point, the record developed before the trial court shows no effort by the trial judge to comply with these requirements. Although the Rule also directs that a certain protocol be followed if the judge decides to interview the child, these issues are not relevant here because the judge\u2019s ambivalence about whether to interview Jeremy left us without a reviewable record on the vital threshold issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In the interest of providing the Family Part with some guidance on how to address the difficult discretionary decision of whether to interview a child, we suggest our colleague at the trial level consider the following words written by Judge Carchman in <em>Mackowski </em>over sixteen years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">We appreciate the concern expressed by the judge that by compelling [this sixteen-year-old girl] to submit to an interview, the judge was compromising her loyalty to both parents by requiring her to \u201cchoose between the two.\u201d While such a view may have surface allure, in reality, it is both too narrow and, ultimately, unfair to the child. In making a determination as to an award of custody, or in this case a change in custody, a judge is charged with considering the factors set forth in N.J.S.A 9:2-4, including an assessment of \u201cthe preference of the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent decision.\u201d <em>The proper assessment of a child\u2019s ability to participate in the decision-making process, a right protected by statute, cannot be performed by a simple reading of an affidavit or letter from the child. </em>We do not countenance such decision-making where there are contested issues requiring a plenary hearing, and we cannot accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the denial of a hearing premised on a notion or hope that such denial is protecting the child. <em>The child has a right to be heard and voice an opinion to the finder of fact and ultimate decision-maker. The court need not be bound by the child\u2019s view but that cannot be a basis for denying the child the right to express a view if he or she chooses to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">We recognize that some judges prefer not to be involved in a process which can be uncomfortable for both the judge and the child. That, however, provides no justification for abrogating the responsibility to perform a function mandated by our rules [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] of court and necessary to fulfill a statutory duty. The concern that judges are ill-equipped to conduct such interviews speaks to the need for enhanced judicial training. <em>A carefully conceived and conducted interview can produce facts, mchiding, among other things, information about interests, activities with parents, living arrangements and friends, that may be dispositive and at no time require that the child be confronted with the ultimate question requiring that an election between parents be made. </em>We agree that no child should be asked to select between two opposing parents, and <em>R. </em>5:8-6 does not speak in such stark terms. In this case, [the child] was sixteen years old, less than two years from majority. She filed a letter with the court expressing her preference for living with her father. An interview was necessary to allow the judge to carefully test the bona fides of [the childj\u2019s alleged choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\"><em>[Mackowski, supra, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 12-13, 721 A.2d 12 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">As we noted earlier, the amendment to <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 making the decision to interview a child in a custody dispute discretionary by the judge came to past in part by recommendations made by the Family Practice Committee. Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comments on <em>R. </em>5:8-6 (2015). The report of the Family Practice Committee included the recommendations of the Custody and Parenting Time Subcommittee that formed, at least in part, the basis for amendments to <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 adopted by the Supreme Court in 2002. The Subcommittee\u2019s report emphasized and contrasted the Rule\u2019s then inflexible command for the trial judge to interview a child who was at least seven years old, with the more balanced and sensitive approach endorsed by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>This criticism of the Rule\u2019s inflexibility before the 2002 amendment was well-founded. By contrast, the preamble to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2^1 describes the public policy underpinning its requirements and strikes the proper balance to guide the court in its implementation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public policy of this State to assure minor children of frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage and that it is in the public interest to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child rearing in order to effect this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Towards that end, <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:2-4(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">In making an award of custody, the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: the parents\u2019 ability to agree, communicate and cooperate in matters relating to the child; the parents\u2019 willingness to accept custody and any history of unwillingness to allow parenting time not based on substantiated abuse; the interaction and relationship of the child with its parents and siblings; the history of domestic violence, if any; the safety of the child and the safety of either parent from physical abuse by the other parent; <em>the preference of the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent decision; the needs of the child; </em>the stability of the home environment offered; the quality and continuity of the child\u2019s education; the fitness of the parents; the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019 homes; the extent and quality of the time spent with the child prior to or subsequent to the separation; the parents\u2019 employment responsibilities; and the age and number of the children. A parent shall not be deemed unfit unless the parents\u2019 conduct has a substantial adverse effect on the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGL\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">This statute identifies the key elements the Family Part Judge must address when confronted with the awesome responsibility of deciding who should have custody of the child. The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cin all custody determinations, the preference of the children of \u2018sufficient age and capacity must be accorded \u2018due weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>480, 501, 432 A.2d 63 (1981). Given Jeremy\u2019s age, alleged emotional maturity, and level of intelligence, the trial judge here was clearly required to take into consideration Jeremy\u2019s feelings and desires concerning where and with whom he should live. At the very least, <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 required the judge to place on the record his reasons for not interviewing this fourteen-year-old boy. <em>Peregoy v. Peregoy, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 206, 817 A.2d 381 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>If the judge elects to interview Jeremy, (as the prevailing circumstances here strongly indicate he should), <em>Rule </em>5:8-6 <em>mandates </em>the court to: (1) conduct an interview with the child in camera <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (2) \u201cafford counsel the opportunity to submit questions for the court\u2019s use during the interview\u201d; (3) \u201cplace on the record its reasons for not asking any question thus submitted\u201d; (4) create and preserve a stenographic or recorded audio record of each interview in its entirety; and (5) provide transcripts of the interview(s) to counsel and the parties<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> upon request and payment for the cost. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The court should also ensure and make clear that \u201cneither parent\u201d is permitted \u201cto discuss nor reveal the contents of the interview with the children or third parties without permission of the court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We recommend the court enter a case management order to memorialize this particularly important aspect of the interview process. This order must make clear that any violation of this confidentiality provision may expose the responsible individual to sanctions pursuant to either a motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights brought by a party under <em>Rule </em>1:10-3, or Summary Contempt Proceedings initiated by an Order to Show Cause under <em>Rule </em>1:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We sympathize with the trial judge\u2019s consternation and share his concern for the emotional trauma Jeremy may experience during the interview process. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c) does <em>not </em>require the judge to ask a child to select between two opposing parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The statute only requires the judge to consider the child\u2019s \u201cpreference,\u201d when he or she is \u201cof sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent deeision[.]\u201d In going about this exquisitely delicate task, we strongly suggest trial judges to keep in mind Judge Carchman\u2019s wise observations in <em>Mackowski:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">Too often, judges deciding issues in the Family Pai-t must rely solely on the \u201cvoices\u201d of the attorneys who prepare the competing affidavits and certifications on the pretense that the litigant is speaking. [The judge\u2019s interview] insures that where custody is a \u201cgenuine and substantial\u201d issue, the judge will not be insulated from seeing and hearing the subject of <em>the </em>dispute. The \u201cvoice\u201d seen and heard will not be that of the lawyer or litigant but that of the child who is the subject of the dispute. The value of a properly conducted interview enabling the judge to see and hear the child first-hand outweighs the possibility of harm that may befall a child by being subjected to the interview process. On balance, it is not the interview that is ultimately harmful, but the custody dispute between the parties that potentially wreaks havoc with the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\"><em>[Mackowski, supra, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 14, 721 A.2d 12].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Supreme Court has recognized that Family Part judges have developed a special expertise in dealing with family and family-type matters. <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 412-13, 713 A.2d 390. We have complete confidence that this judge, indeed all of the judges assigned to the Family Part, will strive to conduct the difficult task of interviewing children in contested custody cases with dignity, compassion, and great sensitivity to the extraordinary circumstances that have brought this child before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The record shows the trial judge was unaware that under <em>Rule </em>5:8-1 he was obligated to refer this case to mediation because Jeremy\u2019s custody and parenting time were genuine and substantial issues in dispute. We are therefore compelled to remand this case for the parties to submit to mediation. The record also reveals that the parties have been heretofore utterly unwilling to subordinate their antipathy for each other and reach a compromise position that would be in the best interest of their now sixteen-year-old son.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>We thus strongly suggest the trial court closely monitor the mediation process by way of periodic reports from the mediator. Unless the court is satisfied that the mediation process is producing meaningful and measurable progress, the court should reassert jurisdiction and schedule a plenary hearing forthwith. On this point, we are compelled to note that the informality that permeated all of the court\u2019s interactions with the parties and their respective attorneys here were not only unproductive, but ultimately undermined the solemnity and decorum necessary for effective courtroom management. We reaffirm the standard we articulated twelve years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Trial judges are given wide discretion in exercising control over their courtrooms. However, the trial judge has the ultimate responsibility of conducting adjudicative proceedings in a manner that complies with required formality in the taking of evidence and the rendering of findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">[Flaetual findings must be supported by evidence admitted during the hearing, which shall be held on the record. All documentary exhibits considered by the court must be clearly identified for appellate review. <em>R. </em>1:2-3. Testimonial evidence must be presented through witnesses who are under oath, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>603, and subject to cross-examination. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>611.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\"><em>[N.J.

J.Y., </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 264-65, 800 A.2d 132 (App.Div.2002) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Here, the parties\u2019 dramatically different and conflicting factual accounts need to be carefully scrutinized by the professionally trained eyes of an experienced Family Part Judge, but only after both parties have been subjected to aggressive cross-examination, the best tool we know for clearing up obscurity, minimizing hyperbole, and revealing truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Reversed and remanded.

Once a judge, as decision maker, conducts an interview with a child when the pending question is custody, nothing the judge or any other person can say or do will ever convince the child that he or she is not responsible for the ultimate decision that is made.
