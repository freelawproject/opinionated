The SDA casts a \u201cbroad net\u201d of liability, <em>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. Mercer County Soil Conservation District, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 221, 40 A.3d 107 (Ch.Div.2009), so that its remedial purpose \u2014 \u201cto protect the public from the loss of life and property in the event a dam fails, regardless of whether it is privately or publicly owned\u201d \u2014 is served. <em>Id. </em>at 218, 40 A.3d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Under the SDA, the Commissioner (the Commissioner) of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is vested with sweeping regulatory and enforcement powers. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-3 (permitting the Commissioner to request surveys and plans of dams and reservoirs); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-4 (permitting the Commissioner to inspect any dam or reservoir); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-5(b), (d) (granting the Commissioner broad remedial powers regarding unsafe dams, including the power to enter onto lands and remove the dam).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The SDA also imposes significant obligations upon \u201c[a]n <em>owner or person having control </em>of a reservoir or dam.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-5(a) (emphasis added). Such person must \u201c[implement all measures\u201d required by the SDA or its accompanying regulations, provide any reports or information requested by DEP, and \u201c[i]m-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>plement any action ordered by the Commissioner\u201d to rectify unsafe conditions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-5(a)(1)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Commissioner is vested with broad enforcement powers whenever the SDA, \u201cor any rule or regulation adopted, or permit or order issued pursuant thereto\u201d is violated. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-6(a). The remedies available to the Commissioner are numerous and include the right to file a summary civil action seeking injunctive relief, costs and civil penalties. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-6(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In this case, DEP filed a civil enforcement action alleging violations of the SDA by defendants William R. Cobb, the County of Salem (the County) and Alloway Township (the Township) (collectively, defendants).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At issue was defendants\u2019 involvement with the Cobb\u2019s Mill Dam (the dam), a 288-foot earthen structure that forms a private lake, Cobb\u2019s Mill Lake, in the Township, and along the top of which runs a paved road, Cobb\u2019s Mill Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">All parties moved for summary judgment. Chancery Judge Anne McDonnell granted DEP summary judgment on its amended verified complaint and denied defendants\u2019 motions. She entered an interlocutory order thereafter, apportioning the costs of compliance among the three defendants, sixty-five percent to the County, twenty-five percent to Cobb, and ten percent to the Township. After carefully considering the specific penalties requested by DEP, Judge McDonnell entered judgment in favor of DEP and ordered defendants to pay civil penalties totaling $19,250, apportioned $7312.50 to the County, $7932.50 to Cobb, and $4005 to the Township.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Cobb appeals and argues that the SDA does not apply to him, the \u201cmere owner\u201d of the lake bed without any authority to \u201c \u2018control, operate or maintain\u2019 \u201d the dam in question. He argues that the County is solely responsible because it owns the right of way in which Cobb\u2019s Mill Road is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In its cross-appeal, the County argues that material factual disputes regarding its contacts with and control of the dam should have foreclosed summary judgment. In particular, the County argues that the judge mistakenly found as a fact that title to the public right of way for Cobb\u2019s Mill Road vested with the County pursuant to a document recorded in the late 19th century.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In its cross-appeal, the Township argues that since it never \u201cmaintained, managed, operated or controlled the structure,\u201d it cannot be responsible for any violations of the SDA. The Township further contends that since the County installed the structures appurtenant to the roadway, including a culvert for spill-off from the lake, the County is solely responsible for compliance with the SDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">DEP urges us to affirm in all respects the orders entered by Judge McDonnell. It argues that because Cobb owns the lake and historically maintained the dam, the County owns the \u201cbridge and culverts\u201d that are part of the dam, and the Township owns and maintains the road, all defendants are responsible for the dam structure and any concomitant violations of the SDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment we \u201c \u2018employ the same standard ... that governs the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>W.J.A. v.

Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 231, 903 A.2d 513. In this regard, \u201c[w]e review the law de novo and owe no deference to the trial court ... if [it has] wrongly interpreted a statute.\u201d <em>Zabilowicz v. Kelsey, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>507, 512, 984 A.2d 872 (2009) (citing <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The motion record regarding defendants and their involvement with the dam, sometimes described as a bridge in the record, and its appurtenant structures was largely undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Cobb owns several parcels of land on Cobb\u2019s Mill Road, and he has held many public offices and appointed positions in the municipality and the County. The land has been in his family since 1705, and Cobb\u2019s home and active saw mill are on parcels that are adjacent to the dam. During his deposition, Cobb testified that he owned the land beneath the dam and all the land on both sides of it, as well as all the land surrounding Cobb\u2019s Mill Lake. Additionally, in a 2000 letter to DEP, Cobb said that he was the owner of the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Cobb surmised the dam was built by his ancestor Elisha Dilks, sometime in the early 1800s, and the structure was known for some time as the Dilks\u2019 Mill Dam. A recorded document from 1876, the import of which was in dispute, set courses for the construction of a road over the dam, indicating that at that time, the dam was owned by Calvin Dilks, Cobb\u2019s relative. A document in the record dated September 20, 1923, entitled \u201cDams in New Jersey \u2014 Reference Data,\u201d lists a business, \u201cThomas Cobb &amp; Sons,\u201d as the owner of the dam, and states that the dam was rebuilt in 1903 by the County and Calvin Dilks. Cobb testified that his business, Cobb\u2019s Mill, LLC, is the successor to Thomas Cobb &amp; Sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Cobb also testified that he has looked after the dam on an almost daily basis, operating the flood gates to control the water level in the lake, inspecting for cracks and, on occasion, making minor repairs. He mows the grass on both sides of the road and the lake-side embankment of the dam. On occasion, Cobb plows snow from Cobb\u2019s Mill Road when the Township is too slow in responding.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In his deposition, Alloway Township public works director Kenneth McKelvey testified that the Township never maintained the dam. McKelvey believed that Cobb was responsible for opening and closing the dam\u2019s flood gates and \u201cmaintaining the land around the dam.\u201d McKelvey conceded, however, that the Township maintained Cobb\u2019s Mill Road and routinely patched potholes and applied sealant to the roadway. The Township also received grant money from the State to repave the road, which it last did in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Since at least the early twentieth century, the County has maintained portions of the dam. In 1923, the County placed \u201cnew caps and abutment planks on the dam,\u201d and then replaced the planks with steel pipes in 1932. In 1988, the Board of Chosen Freeholders passed a resolution remedying \u201ca potentially dangerous situation\u201d at the lake and approving \u201cthe installation of a ... [c]ulvert with a new valve type structure [to] decrease the poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tial danger for downstream residents and County structures.\u201d The resulting structure, known as \u201cCobb\u2019s Mill Sluice,\u201d was installed about ten years after Cobb was forced to cut a trough through Cobb\u2019s Mill Road during a flood to prevent the road from entirely washing away.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">As noted, the import of a January 1876 recorded document was disputed. The document records an \u201c[application ... made to the Court by Gerald Hitchner and others more than 10 Freeholders and residents of the County of Salem who think a public road to be necessary in the Township of Upper Alloway Creek in said County.\u201d The document sets forth a metes and bounds description for a proposed road, and reflects a recommended \u201cassessment of damages to the ... owners of the land taken for the laying out of the aforesaid road.\u201d The document further states that those sums would be paid by the \u201cinhabitants\u201d of the Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Cobb asserted that the document amounted to the creation of a public right-of-way over the dam, and the road, therefore, was owned by the County. The County steadfastly maintained that the document did not create any public right of way in favor of the County, but rather reflected the then-existing practice of permitting municipal residents to petition a court to lay a public road, thereby making Cobb\u2019s Mill Road a municipal, not County, road.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">After considering oral arguments of the parties on the various motions for summary judgment, in a written opinion Judge McDonnell concluded that all defendants were \u201cowners or persons in control of a dam or reservoir within the meaning of the [SDA].\u201d The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">The County has accepted responsibility for the culvert over the years. The Township\u2019s road and the supporting embankments are the sole reason for the existence of the County\u2019s bridge/culvert. Both the County and the Towmship have control of the right-of-way and each has the right to remove structures. Because the County and the Township have control of the right-of-way and the structures within it, each is a person in control of the Cobbfls Mill Dam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Mr. Cobb has legal and beneficial ownership of Cobb[\u2019]s Mill Pond. As the owner of the lake bed, Mr. Cobb is the owner of a reservoir within the meaning of the [SDA]. Further, Mr. Cobb has exercised control over the embankments and dam over the years. Mr. Cobb is an owner and a person in control over the dam or reservoir within the meaning of the [SDA],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">[T]he history and legal title of the dam itself are irrelevant, as the clear legislative purpose of the amendments is to cast a broad net of responsibility that includes owners and persons in control of a dam or reservoir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">[ (Citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVg\">After considering further oral arguments regarding the penalty to impose and how it should be apportioned, Judge McDonnell issued the order for judgment referenced above, together with a bench memorandum explaining the apportionment. She stayed payment of the penalties pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We first consider Cobb\u2019s argument that he cannot be responsible for violations of the SDA because, although he owned the land upon which the dam was situated, as well as the bed of the reservoir of water created by the dam, he lacked any control over the dam\u2019s structure or the roadway and was not responsible for maintaining them. Cobb relies primarily upon the Chancery Division\u2019s decision in <em>Mercer County, supra, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 40 A.3d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In that case, DEP brought an enforcement action against private property owners upon whose lands two publicly-funded dams were constructed fifty years earlier, and which were subject to easements in favor of public entities providing access for maintenance of the dams. <em>Id. </em>at 215-217, 40 A.3d 107. DEP argued the defendants, as owners of the servient estates, were \u201cowners\u201d of the dam for purposes of the SDA. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 40 A.3d 107. The Chancery judge disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Interpreting the SDA\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cowner or person having control of a reservoir or dam,\u201d the judge reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">There are two reasonable ways to interpret this language. One interpretation is to read the word \u201cowner\u201d separate from the phrase \u201cperson having control,\u201d in which case being an owner of the land could make you the owner of any improvements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>118 ] upon the land even if you had no control thereof. While an otherwise perfectly acceptable interpretation under the common law, there are plenty of exceptions to which this do[es] not hold true, including utilities transmission wires, sewer pipes, and telephone poles; such items are more often than not located in or on private easements, but are not considered to be owned by the underlying properly owner. The second possible interpretation, then, is to read the words \u201cowner or persons having control\u201d together as one phrase, such that either the owner who has control or another person having control would be responsible for the improvements upon real property. This construction implies that having control is a necessary element of being an \u201cowner\u201d under the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 220, 40 A.3d 107.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The judge found further support in DEP\u2019s own regulation, which defines \u201c[o]wner and/or operator\u201d as \u201cany person who owns, controls, operates, maintains, manages or proposes to construct a dam.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:20-1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The judge then listed four factors to be considered in determining whether a person was an \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of the SDA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">(1) The nature and extent of any legal title to the underlying real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">(2) Whether the alleged owner constructed or participated in the structure\u2019s construction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">(3) Whether the alleged owner controls, ever controlled, or participated in the control of the structure to more than a <em>de minimis </em>extent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">(4) Whether the alleged owner has legal authority to exercise control of the structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">[Id. at 223, 40 A.3d 107.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The judge held that the defendants were \u201cnot owners or persons having control of the subject dams or reservoirs as contemplated by the [SDA],\u201d and he dismissed DEP\u2019s complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 40 A.3d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Cobb argues that application of these four factors to this case should have resulted in summary judgment in his favor. We need not consider the merits of that argument. We conclude that the court in <em>Mercer County </em>erred in construing the terms \u201cowner or person having control of a reservoir or dam\u201d as used in the SDA. In that limited regard, we respectfully overrule the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Our analysis begins by noting that \u201c[i]n statutory interpretation, a court\u2019s role \u2018is to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. K.O., </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>83, 91, 85 A.3d 938 (2014) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>(quoting <em>Allen v. V. &amp; A Bros., </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>114, 127, 26 A.3d 430 (2011)). The first step in divining legislative intent is to consider the statute\u2019s plain language, <em>Town of Kearny v. Brandt, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>76, 98, 67 A.3d 601 (2013), which \u201cshould be given its ordinary meaning and be construed in a common-sense manner.\u201d <em>K.O., supra, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>at 91, 85 A.3d 938. \u201c[W]e must examine that language sensibly, in the context of the overall scheme in which the Legislature intended the provision to operate[J\u201d <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Huber, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>338, 365, 63 A.3d 197 (2013). Additionally, we may consider \u201cthe interpretation and cognate enactments of the agency to which the Legislature has entrusted the statute\u2019s implementation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Courts are further guided by \u201cthe bedrock assumption that the Legislature did not use any unnecessary or meaningless language.\u201d <em>Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Melcar Util. Co., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>576, 587, 59 A.3d 561 (2013) (quoting <em>Patel v. N.J. Motor Vehicle Comm\u2019n, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>413, 418-19, 982 A.2d 445 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore presume that each of the statute\u2019s words means something and \u201c \u2018is not mere surplusage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Cast Art Indus. v. KPMG LLP, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>208, 222, 36 A.3d 1049 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The SDA compels compliance from \u201c[a]n owner <em>or </em>person having control of a reservoir <em>or </em>dam.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-5(a) (emphasis added). A common sense reading of this language indicates there are four classes of people who are subject to the statute: (1) dam owners; (2) reservoir owners; (3) those who control the dam; and (4) those who control the reservoir. It follows that if a party fits into any one of those categories, the Commissioner may seek enforcement of the SDA against that person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The Chancery Division\u2019s construction of the statute in <em>Mercer County </em>implied that, to be brought under the enforcement umbrel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>la of the SDA, a person must have more than legal ownership of a dam or reservoir. Such person also must have constructed or exercised some degree of control over the dam or reservoir, or have had the legal authority to exercise control. <em>Mercer County, supra, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 223, 40 A.3d 107. The commonsense understanding of the word \u201cowner\u201d does not support that interpretation. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1214 (9th ed. 2009) (\u201cAn owner may have complete property in the thing or may have parted with some interests in it (as by granting an easement or making a lease).\u201d). Additionally, by interpreting the SDA\u2019s use of the term \u201cowner\u201d to necessarily include qualities similar to that of a \u201cperson in control,\u201d the court in <em>Mercer County </em>conflated two separate statutory terms, thereby rendering the phrase \u201cowner\u201d surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Moreover, even though it chose to use the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d the Legislature did not mean that <em>either </em>the \u201cowner\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cthe person in control,\u201d but not both, could be subject to DEP\u2019s enforcement action. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 <em>S.Ct. </em>557, 567, 187 L.Ed.2d 472, 484 (2013) (\u201c[T]he operative terms are connected by the conjunction \u2018or.\u2019 While that can sometimes introduce an appositive \u2014 a word or phrase that is synonymous with what precedes it (\u2018Vienna or Wien,\u2019 \u2018Batman or the Caped Crusader\u2019) \u2014 its ordinary use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to \u2018be given separate meanings.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>330, 339, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2326, 2331, 60 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 931, 937 (1979))). Rather, the Legislature intended the SDA to have the broadest possible remedial application and envisioned enforcement actions against multiple responsible parties. <em>See Gallenthin Realty Dev., Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>344, 368, 924 A.2d 447 (2007) (\u201c[I]t has long been settled that the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 in a ... statute may be construed as the conjunctive \u2018and\u2019 if to do so is consistent with the legislative intent.\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Holland, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 24, 331 A.2d 626 (App.Div.1975))).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The recent legislative history and language in other parts of the SDA make this clear. In 2004, for example, Burlington County suffered severe flooding after several dams failed. <em>See </em>39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4894(a) (Nov. 19, 2007). As a result, DEP concluded that it \u201clacked [the] necessary tools to efficiently enforce the provisions of the [SDA].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Legislature subsequently broadened DEP\u2019s enforcement powers, noting its proposed amendment would \u201cstrengthenf ] the DEP\u2019s authority to take action regarding failing and failed dams and to integrate these measures with the provisions of the [SDA].\u201d <em>Senate Environmental Committee, Statement to S. 1895 (Oct. </em>18, 2004). One of the sections enacted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-5(c), explicitly authorizes \u201callocation of the cost of removal among the liable owners or persons having control of the dam or reservoir <em>whenever two or more owners or such persons are </em>liable.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Finally, our conclusion that the SDA permits enforcement of its provisions against both owners <em>and </em>persons in control of dams and reservoirs is consistent with DEP\u2019s interpretation of its authority. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. and Energy v. Cnty of Cumberland, </em>94 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>111, 119 <em>(Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. and Energy) </em>(\u201cBy nature of a party\u2019s decision to engage in either ownership or control of a dam, such party incurs such statutorily established liabilities.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In this case, Judge McDonnell properly found that Cobb was within the reach of the SDA\u2019s regulatory and enforcement powers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>He admitted being the owner of the dam, as well as the reservoir created by the dam. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>7:20-1.2 (defining reservoir as \u201cany impoundment or any potential impoundment that will be created by a dam, dike or levee\u201d). Moreover, Cobb has historically exerted some level of control over the reservoir by admittedly operating the spillway. For all these reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment and the amount of the judgment entered against Cobb.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The Township argues that, because it \u201cnever maintained, managed, operated or controlled the structure ... [it] cannot be held responsible under the [SDA].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">DEP\u2019s regulations define a \u201cdam\u201d as \u201cany artificial dike, levee or other barrier, <em>together with appurtenant works, </em>which is constructed for the purpose of impounding water.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:20-1.2 (emphasis added). The word \u201cappurtenant\u201d means \u201c[a]nnexed to a more important thing.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>118 (9th ed. 2009). In this case, Cobb\u2019s Mill Road is a work \u201cappurtenant\u201d to the preexisting Cobb\u2019s Mill Dam, the entire length of which the road traverses. The issue then becomes whether the Township\u2019s routine work on the road brings it within the SDA\u2019s regulatory scheme, i.e., is the Township a \u201cperson[] having control of a reservoir or dam\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Although the case is not on all fours, we find persuasive the Law Division\u2019s decision in <em>Braun v. Twp. of Mantua, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 637 A.2d 238 (Law Div.1993). There, the court considered whether Mantua Township (\u201cMantua\u201d), which had removed snow, cleared weeds, replaced gravel and generally maintained a road traversing a dam, could be compelled to make repairs when the dam collapsed due to heavy rains. <em>Id. </em>at 406-08, 637 A.2d 238. Recognizing that the roadway and dam were \u201cinterrelated,\u201d the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_\">Although the legally required duty of Mantua may only encompass a duty to provide safe passage for users of the road, that safe passage can only be assured if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the dam itself is secure. The most exhaustive efforts by Mantua to maintain and control the roadway, which it provides for public use and accommodation, would be for naught, unless the underpinning of the road, in this instance the dam, is also vigilantly and safely maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 411, 637 A.2d 238.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The Court also reasoned that under the SDA, the owners of the dam \u2014 owners of the adjoining properties \u2014 were also responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 637 A.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In this ease, it is undisputed that the Township regularly maintained Cobb\u2019s Mill Road, and that the road had been and remained an integral part of Cobb\u2019s Mill Dam. In maintaining the road, the Township exercised some level of control over one of the dam\u2019s appurtenant structures. We affirm the grant of summary judgment against the Township, as well as the amount of penalties assessed against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The County argues Judge McDonnell erroneously found that \u201cit [had taken] title of a public right of way over Cobb\u2019s Mill Dam ... in the late 19th Century,\u201d and that there were material factual issues in dispute regarding the County\u2019s contacts with and historic control of the dam. The argument lacks sufficient merit to warrant extensive discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We need not decide whether the disputed 1876 recorded instrument created a public right-of-way over the dam in favor of the County or the Township. It is undisputed that the County assisted in reconstructing the dam in 1923, that it made improvements to the dam in 1932, and that in 1988, it installed a culvert to \u201cdecrease the potential danger for downstream residents and County structures.\u201d These acts alone are sufficient to render the County subject to the Commissioner\u2019s enforcement powers under the SDA as \u201ca person in control\u201d of the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\"> Since none of the appellants contest DEP\u2019s right to bring the action, or its entitlement to the relief accorded by the judge, we do not elaborate upon the factual and procedural history that preceded the commencement of the enforcement action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\"> All civil penalties under the SDA are deposited in the Environmental Services Fund and appropriated to DEP for the removal of dams in the state. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4\u20146(j); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:20-2.8. In a single sentence in its brief, the County states that it \"cannot be determined to have the lion's share of responsibility for remedial activity or sanctions.\u201d It provides no legal argument why the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>mistakenly exercised her discretion in fixing and apportioning the penalty. An issue that is not briefed is deemed waived upon appeal. <em>Fantis Foods v. N. River Ins. Co., </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 266-67, 753 A.2d 176 (App.Div.2000); Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J.

We are convinced, however, that DEP's enforcement powers are not limited to a single \"owner or person in control\" of a dam or reservoir. Such an interpretation would be at odds with the remedial purpose of the statute. <em>See A.B. </em>v. <em>Div. of Med.
