Although Moran suffered disabling injuries in this incident, the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (Board) denied his application for an accidental disability retirement pension. Applying <em>Richardson v. Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 212-13, 927 A.2d 543 (2007), the Board found that Moran\u2019s disability was not due to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>traumatic event within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7, because the incident was \u201cnot \u2018unexpected and undesigned.\u2019 \u201d We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">As background, it is helpful to begin with the pension statute, as construed in <em>Richardson. </em>Entitlement to an accidental disability pension requires proof that, \u201cduring and as a result of\u2019 performing \u201chis regular or assigned duties,\u201d a member suffered a disabling injury \u201cas a direct result of a traumatic event.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7(1). To put these terms in context, we quote the statute\u2019s proof requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">the member is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties and that such disability was not the result of the member\u2019s willful negligence and that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of his usual duty and of any other available duty in the department which his employer is willing to assign to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In <em>Richardson, </em>the Court clarified the meaning of the term \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d stating that \u201ca traumatic event is essentially the same as what we historically understood an accident to be \u2014 an unexpected external happening that directly causes injury and is not the result of pre-existing disease alone or in combination with work effort.\u201d <em>Richardson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 212, 927 A.2d 543. The Court found that in using the term \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d the Legislature did not mean generally to raise the bar for injured employees to qualify for accidental disability pensions. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 927 A.2d 543. Rather, the Legislature intended \u201cto excise disabilities that result from pre-existing disease alone or in combination with work effort from the sweep of the accidental disability statutes and to continue to allow recovery for the kinds of unexpected injurious events that had long been called \u2018accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 927 A.2d 543. In making that point, the Court noted that \u201csome of our cases failed to recognize that critical limitation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>purpose and persisted in the entirely wrong notion that the term traumatic event was intended, in itself, to more significantly narrow the meaning of accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 927 A.2d 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The Court then set forth the factors a pension system member must prove to obtain accidental disability benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">1. that he is permanently and totally disabled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">2. <em>as a direct result of a traumatic event that is</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">a. identifiable as lo time and place,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">b. <em>undesigned and unexpected, </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">c. caused by a circumstance external to the member (not the result of pre-existing disease that is aggravated or accelerated by the work);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">3. that the traumatic event occurred during and as a result of the member\u2019s regular or assigned duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-15\">4. that the disability was not the result of the member\u2019s willful negligence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-16\">5. that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated from performing his usual or any other duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-18\"><em>[Id, </em>at 212-13, 927 A.2d 543 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">Prior to Moran\u2019s administrative hearing, the parties stipulated that Moran met all of the above-cited criteria, except one. They disagreed as to whether the incident that caused his disability \u201cwas undesigned and unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">Undisputed evidence at the hearing established that firefighting duties were divided between two different units, each of which would arrive at a fire in a different fire truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Breaking into burning buildings was not Moran\u2019s normal unit assignment. He was part of an \u201cengine company\u201d whose role was to \u201ctake[ ] the hoses into the [burning] building ... and put[ ] out the fire.\u201d A different unit, the \u201ctruck company,\u201d was responsible for forcing entry into a burning structure and rescuing any occupants. The truck company carried various special equipment specific to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>functions. The two units were supposed to respond to a fire scene at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">At about 2:00 a.m., Moran\u2019s engine company responded to a fire in what was reported to be a vacant, boarded-up house. Hence, no one expected that it wouM be necessary to rescue anyone inside. Instead, the plan was to mount a \u201cdefensive attack\u201d to keep the fire from spreading to other buddings. When Moran started fighting the fire, the truck company had not yet arrived on the scene. Moran stated that when he arrived, he observed a \u201cheavy, heavy body of fire\u201d in the building, and his captain called \u201cemphatically for a truck company for the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">As Moran was unrolling the hose toward the building, which was engulfed in flames, he unexpectedly heard screams from people trapped inside the structure. He testified that a truck company would have had special equipment, such as a \u201c[hjydraulie ram, a battering ram, [and a] haligon tool with an ax.\u201d He testified that he had none of those tools with him and typically would not have them. But, because he heard people screaming inside the building, he used his \u201cshoulder, leg and back\u201d to break down the door. He testified that the door \u201cwas well fortified, but [he] eventually did\u201d break through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Although his fire training involved using tools such as a \u201chydraulic ram\u201d to break down doors, not forcing entry with his body, Moran testified that if he had not opened the door, the people inside would have died. He also testified that, but for the unexpected presence of the victims in the burning building, and the unexpected absence of the truck company, he would not have tried to open the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">A fire captain, who was present at the scene as Moran\u2019s commanding officer, corroborated Moran\u2019s testimony. On cross-examination, the fire captain stated that the only tool the engine company had on its truck which the truck company would also have had was an \u201cax.\u201d However, he stated that the ax was not available to Moran when this emergency presented itself, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Moran \u201cwas grabbing the hose line at the time which [was what] he was supposed to be doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Board presented no evidence to contradict Moran\u2019s proofs that he encountered an unexpected life-and-death emergency for which he was carrying no tools. The Board did not present testimony from any other firefighter that, faced with the same situation, he or she would have gone back to the truck and looked for an ax, leaving the fire victims to their fate in the meantime. Nor did the Board present evidence that the ax on the truck was even the appropriate tool to use in breaking down a fortified door.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In a lengthy opinion, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found both Moran and the lire captain to be credible witnesses. The ALJ found that the incident involved an unexpected situation which required Moran to respond in a manner unanticipated by his training and experience.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">[P]etitioner was dispatched to a burning, purportedly vacant house as a member of the fire department\u2019s engine company that advances hoses to extinguish fires and relies upon the truck company to provide access and perform search-and-rescue operations. Quite unexpectedly, as petitioner performed his assigned duties and prepared an external defensive attack to contain the raging blaze, he heard voices from within the boarded building. Also unexpectedly, and contrary to standard procedure, the truck company was not on the scene. For the first time in his ten-year career as a firefighter, he was confronted with a raging fire in a purportedly vacant house that actually had occupants trapped inside, and the fire squad that provides access and performs rescue operations was unpredictably absent. But for that sudden and emergent circumstance, he would not have used and injured his body in entering the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Relying on <em>Richardson, </em>the ALJ rejected the Board\u2019s argument that the incident was not undesigned or unexpected because it resulted from Moran\u2019s intentional act of breaking down the door. The ALJ reasoned that Moran was responding to a \u201csudden and emergent circumstance\u201d that required him to respond with unanticipated extreme physical exertion, causing his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">In its decision, the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings. However, the Board rejected his legal conclusions, reasoning that \u201c[sjimply kicking in a door or intentionally using one\u2019s back to force entry does not constitute an \u2018unexpected happening,\u2019 as Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Moran\u2019s very intent in partaking in these happenings would necessarily render such happenings to be expected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Board also reasoned that, according to the Civil Service job description, a fire fighter\u2019s job duties included rescuing people and, hence, Moran \u201cdid intentionally perform a duty within the scope and performance of his regular' duties for which he had been specifically trained.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">Here, the work activity itself was not undesigned or unexpected. Mr. Moran was disabled as a direct result of performing the work he intentionally set out to do. When he heard screams from inside the building, he intentionally slammed his body against a door in order to force it open. These facts do not lend themselves to any unexpected activity or accident____ Mr. Moran\u2019s disabling injury, while unfortunate, was caused by ordinary and intended, if due, work effort \u2014 not by an undesigned and unexpected external mishap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">On this appeal, we defer to the agency\u2019s factual findings, but we owe no deference to its legal conclusions, \u201cparticularly when \u2018that interpretation is inaccurate or contrary to legislative objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russo v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>14, 27, 17 A.3d 801 (2011) (quoting <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 170, 723 A.2d 612 (1999)). In this case, we are persuaded that in denying accidental disability benefits to a firefighter whose heroic response to an undesigned and unexpected traumatic event left him disabled, the Board has misconstrued <em>Richardson </em>and reached a result at odds with the legislative intent in adopting the \u201ctraumatic event\u201d standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>As previously noted, the 1964 amendments to the disability pension statute were not intended to make it generally more difficult for injured employees to obtain an accidental disability pension. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 927 A.2d 543. Rather, the amendments were intended to weed out disabilities stemming from a member\u2019s pre-existing medical condition, even if the condition was exacerbated by a work incident. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 927 A.2d 543. Thus, a firefighter with a heart condition could not collect an accidental disability pension for a disabling heart attack suffered while fighting a fire, and a custodian likewise is not entitled to such benefits if he suffers a heart attack while performing his janitorial duties. <em>See Cattani v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret Sys., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 586-87, 355 A.2d 625 (1976); <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142, 154, 299 A.2d 697 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In this case, the Board determined that Moran\u2019s injury did not qualify him for an accidental disability pension because it occurred while he was conducting one of his expected work-related duties, rescuing fire victims. The Board further reasoned that what occurred was not an \u201caccident\u201d because Moran intended to throw his body against the door. We conclude that the Board\u2019s decision misread <em>Richardson, </em>misapplied the statute, and took an unduly narrow view of what constitutes an \u201cunexpected and undesigned\u201d traumatic event.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We harken back to <em>Richardson, </em>in which the Board made a similar error in denying an application from a corrections officer injured during a scuffle with an inmate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">The Board contends that because subduing an inmate is part of the anticipated work of a corrections officer and was not unexpected or unintended, Richardson cannot satisfy the traumatic event standard. That is a misreading of the statute, which <em>requires </em>that the traumatic event occur \u201cduring and as a result of the performance of [the member\u2019s] <em>regular or assigned </em>duties.\u201d To be sure, when the \u201cnormal stress and strain\u201d of the job combines with a pre-existing disease to cause injury or degeneration over time, a traumatic event has not occurred. <em>See Cattani, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 585 [355 A.2d 625]; <em>Russo, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 151 [299 A.2d 697]. That is quite different from saying that a traumatic event cannot occur <em>during </em>ordinary work effort. Indeed it can. A policeman can be shot while pursuing a suspect; a librarian can be hit by a falling bookshelf while re-shelving books; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>social worker can catch her hand in the car door while transporting a child to court. Each of those examples is identifiable as to time and place; undesigned and unexpected; and not the result of pre-existing disease, aggravated or accelerated by the work. Thus, each meets the traumatic event standard. So long as those members also satisfy the remaining aspects of the statute, including total and permanent disability, they will qualify for accidental disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">In sum, the fact that a member is injured while performing his ordinary duties does not disqualify him from receiving accidental disability benefits; some injuries sustained during ordinary work effort will pass muster and others will not. <em>The polestar of the inquiry is whether, during the regular peifmmance of his job, an unexpected happening, not the result of pre-existing disease alone or in combination with the wmk, has occurred and directly resulted in the peimanent and total disability of the member.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\"><em>[Id, </em>at 213-14, 927 A.2d 543 (alteration in original) (final emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We agree with the ALJ that in this case the traumatic event must be viewed with a wider lens than the one the Board applied. The undesigned and unexpected event here was the combination of unusual circumstances that led to Moran\u2019s injury: the failure of the truck unit to arrive, and the discovery of victims trapped inside a fully engulfed burning building, at a point when Moran did not have available to him the tools that would ordinarily be used to break down the door.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, he was forced to carry out his paramount duty to rescue fire victims, by manually kicking in the door. Had he not responded immediately to break down the door, the victims would have died. That was Moran\u2019s unrebut-ted, credible testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">While this was not a classic \u201caccident\u201d in the sense that the house did not collapse on Moran, nor did he trip while carrying a fire hose, it was clearly an unexpected and undesigned traumatic event that resulted in Moran\u2019s suffering a disabling injury while performing his job. Viewed in context, the injury was also caused by an event, or series of events, \u201cexternal\u201d to Moran. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 212-13, 927 A.2d 543; <em>see Brooks, supra, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 40 A.3d 1166. By analogy, had Moran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>become hopelessly trapped by fire on an upper floor of the house, and saved himself by jumping out a window thereby suffering disabling injuries, he would not be disqualified for benefits because he \u201cintentionally\u201d jumped.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Nor was this a situation in which Moran should have expected to find himself. We acknowledge that in <em>Russo, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 17 A.3d 801 the Court reasoned that an ambulance squad member disabled by emotional trauma after coming upon a horrible auto accident \u201cwill not satisfy <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>\u2018undesigned and unexpected\u2019 standard because that is exactly what his training has prepared him for.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, this case is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The Board, having adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, was obligated to render its legal conclusions based on those findings. In this case, the ALJ found that Moran\u2019s training had not prepared him to break into burning buildings without the battering rams and other specialized equipment used by the truck company. Indeed, there was no evidence to the contrary. Further, as the ALJ found, no equipment was available to Moran at the moment he had to make the life-or-death decision that confronted him. Nothing in the history of the pension statute, as exhaustively reviewed in <em>Richardson, </em>suggests that the Legislature would have intended to deny Moran an accidental disability pension in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Accordingly we reverse the Board\u2019s decision and remand with direction to grant Moran an accidental disability pension.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-22\"> At the Office of Administrative Law hearing, most of the facts were stipulated. Moran testified briefly, as did a fire captain who had been present at the fire. The Board presented no witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\"> This is not the first time the Board's cramped view of the <em>Richardson </em>standards has resulted in an unjustified denial of benefits. <em>See Russo, supra, 206 N.J. </em>at 26-27, 17 A.3d 801 (rejecting Board\u2019s denial of benefits to a police officer, who suffered emotional trauma after being unexpectedly called upon to rescue five victims); <em>Brooks v. Bd. of Trs., Public Emps. Ret. Sys., </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 283-84, 40 A.3d 1166 (App.Div.2012) (rejecting the Board's conclusion that a teacher did not suffer an \u201cundesigned and unexpected\" accident because \"he should have anticipated the dangers involved\" in helping students carry a heavy object).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\"> We reject the Board\u2019s backhanded criticism of Moran, in referring to his \"deviating\u201d from his training in failing to use the ax on the truck. The Board presented no testimony at the hearing to dispute the captain\u2019s assertion that the ax was not available to Moran at the time he needed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
