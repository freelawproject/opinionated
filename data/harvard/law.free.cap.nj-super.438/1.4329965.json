Because we conclude that the Constitution does not compel that result, we affirm the denial of those firearms permits to Winston.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Winston was convicted in New York in 1974 of attempted assault in the second degree, an offense carrying a penalty of up to four years\u2019imprisonment. <em>N.Y. Penal Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 120.05; 110.05; 70.00 (McKinney 2008). He was convicted in 1989 of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of one year\u2019s imprisonment. <em>N.Y. Penal Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 220.03; 70.15 (McKinney 2008). In 2011, he obtained certificates of relief for both convictions from courts in New York. Each certificate bears the following legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">This certif\u00edcate is issued to the holder to grant relief from all or certain enumerated disabilities, forfeitures, or bars to his employment automatically imposed by law by reason of his conviction of the crime or of the offense specified herein. This certificate shall NOT be deemed nor construed to be a pardon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Each certificate further provides that it \u201crelieve[s] the holder of all disabilities and bars to employment, excluding the right to be eligible for public office.\u201d Each also notes that the \u201ccertificate shall be considered permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">After obtaining the certificates, Winston submitted an application to the Chief of Police in Clifton for a firearms purchaser identification card and a handgun purchase permit. In response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>to questions nineteen and twenty on the application form, which ask whether one has ever been convicted in New Jersey or elsewhere of any crime or misdemeanor \u201cthat has not been expunged or sealed,\u201d Winston disclosed his New York convictions and his attendant certificates of relief. Following investigation, the Chief denied Winston\u2019s application on account of his criminal record and advised Winston of his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Winston filed a timely appeal and the Law Division judge held a hearing at which the detective responsible for reviewing Winston\u2019s application appeared. The det\u00e9ctive testified that Winston\u2019s background check revealed not only the two New York convictions but also instances of domestic violence, one of which resulted in a temporary restraining order in late 2005, a twenty-year old conviction for driving under the influence, and some \u201cneighbor disputes,\u201d from 2007 to 2009, culminating in cross-complaints that were ultimately mediated and dismissed. The detective testified that following the background check, Winston\u2019s application was denied on the basis of his criminal record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">After hearing the testimony and the arguments of counsel, the judge announced her decision, later amplified in a written statement of reasons, finding that the New York certificates are not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>equivalent of an expungement under New Jersey law and thus \u201cthe two prior New York state convictions bar [Winston] from obtaining a firearms purchaser identification card under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(l), which states that said card shall not be issued to anyone who has been convicted of any crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">On appeal, Winston renews the argument he made to the Law Division that the Full Faith and Credit Clause forbids New Jersey from viewing his New York criminal convictions, for which he has received certificates of relief from disabilities, as disqualifying under New Jersey\u2019s gun permitting law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3. He also argues that to the extent the judge rested her decision on the \u201cpublic health, safety or welfare\u201d exception found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5), she erred as the State stated expressly that the decision to deny Winston the permits was based solely on his New York convictions, and there is inadequate evidence in the record to support a finding that issuance of the permits to Winston would not be in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare. Finally, he argues that application of the \u201cpublic health, safety or welfare\u201d exception violates his rights under the Second Amendment. We reject those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Article IV, section 1 of the Constitution provides that \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\u201d The clause applies to matters between states, <em>see, e.g., Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>717, 722-24, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2117, 2122-23, 100 L.Ed.2d 743, 752-54 (1988), and to matters between a state and the federal government, <em>see, e.g., Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Ed., </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>75, 81, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>892, 896, 79 L.Ed.2d 56, 61-62 (1984). Although characterizing the command of the clause as \u201cexacting\u201d with respect to \u201c \u2018[a] final judgment ... rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court has deemed it \u201cless demanding with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>choice of laws.\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Bd. v. Hyatt, </em>538 <em>U.S. </em>488, 494, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>1683,1687,155 L.Ed.2d 702, 709 (2003) (quoting <em>Baker v. General Motors Corp., </em>522 <em>U.S. 222, </em>233,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>657, 663-64, 139 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>580, 592 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Against that backdrop, we turn to consider New Jersey\u2019s permit law, part of the \u201c \u2018careful grid\u2019 of regulatory provisions\u201d comprising our firearms law. <em>In re Preis, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>564, 568, 573 A.2d 148 (1990) (quoting <em>State v. Ingram, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>489, 495 n. 1, 488 A.2d 545 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">In order to lawfully acquire a firearm in New Jersey, one must have first secured a firearms purchaser identification card and, in the case of a handgun, a permit to purchase a handgun. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3a and b. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 508, 453 A.2d 239 (App.Div.1982). Those permits are not available to a person who has been convicted of a crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(l). A 1979 amendment which removed the words \u201cin this State\u201d from paragraph c(l), leaves no doubt as to the Legislature\u2019s intent that a person convicted of a crime in another state is disqualified from gun ownership in this State. <em>See L. </em>1979, c. 179, \u00a7 11. Both of Winston\u2019s New York convictions qualify as crimes under our law as each carries a sentence in excess of six months. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-4c; <em>State (E.L.) v. G.P.N., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 175-76, 728 A.2d 316 (App.Div.1999). Accordingly, Winston\u2019s New York convictions, without consideration of their attendant certificates of relief from disabilities, would disqualify him from obtaining a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3c(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The question then is whether the certificates alter that result. For that answer, we turn first to consider the statutes pursuant to which the certificates were issued to understand the purpose and effect of such certificates under New York law. <em>Cf. Ritz v. Motor Vehicle Com\u2019n, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 611, 46 A.3d 601 (App.Div.2012) (considering whether a violation of a South Carolina statute imposing a \u201ccivil fine\u201d constitutes a conviction for a drug offense within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:5-30.13).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The provision of the New York statutes creating the certificates on which Winston relies is not in New York\u2019s criminal code but in Article 23 of its Correction Law, entitled \u201cDiscretionary Relief from Forfeitures and Disabilities Automatically Imposed by Law.\u201d Section 701, \u201cCertificates of Relief from Disabilities\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">1. A certificate of relief from disabilities may be granted as provided in this ai*ticle to relieve an eligible offender of any forfeiture or disability, or to remove any bar to his employment, automatically imposed by law by reason of his conviction of the crime or of the offense specified therein. Such certificate may be limited to one or more enumerated forfeitures, disabilities or bars, or may relieve the eligible offender of all forfeitures, disabilities and bars. Provided, however, that no such certificate shall apply, or be construed so as to apply to the right of such person to retain or to be eligible for public office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">3. A certificate of relief from disabilities shall not, however, in any way prevent any judicial, administrative, licensing or other body, board or authority from relying upon the conviction specified therein as the basis for the exercise of its discretionary power to suspend, revoke, refuse to issue or refuse to renew any license, permit or other authority or privilege.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">[N.Y. <em>Correct. Law </em>\u00a7 701 (McKinney 2014).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Section 706 of the statute further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">Nothing contained in this article shall be deemed to alter or limit or affect the manner of applying for pardons to the governor, and no certificate issued hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a pardon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\"><em>[N.Y.Correct. Law </em>\u00a7 706 (McKinney 2014).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">The courts of New York have explained \u201cthat the intent of the legislature in enacting [the certificate provision] was to enable eligible offenders who have shown certain indications of having been rehabilitated to avoid some of the restrictions immediately flowing from their convictions, such as the bar against holding certain civil service positions and the loss of the right to vote.\u201d <em>Able Cycle Engines, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>84 A.D.2d 140, 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>N.Y.S.2d 469, 473 (1981). There is no question but that the certificates relieve Winston from the automatic disqualification his convictions would otherwise pose to his possessing a firearm in New York. <em>See N.Y. Penal Law </em>\u00a7 400.00 (McKinney 2008), <em>Matter of Hecht v. Bivona, </em>306 <em>A.D.2d </em>410, 761 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>485, 485 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">New York\u2019s courts, however, have not found that the legislature intended \u201cthat all indirect consequences of the conviction ... be eradicated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Able Cycle Engines, supra, </em>445 N.Y.S.2d at 473. Most important for our purposes, those courts have been explicit in holding \u201c[the] granting of a certificate of relief from disabilities in no way eradicates or expunges the underlying conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472 (quoting <em>Matter of Da Grossa v. Goodman, </em>72 <em>Misc.</em>2d 806, 339 N.Y.S.2d 502, 505 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1972)). New York\u2019s Attorney General agrees. In an informal opinion published in 1981, the Attorney General opined that \u201cthe certificate is to be used to mitigate the impact of a criminal record, not to eliminate it.\u201d 1981 N.Y. Op. (Inf.) Att\u2019y Gen. 281, No. 81-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">A review of these New York authorities plainly establishes that a New York certificate of relief from disabilities does not alter or affect the criminal conviction to which it relates. Instead, it merely removes certain disabilities and bars to employment normally attendant to the conviction under New York law. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>such, full faith and credit is not implicated in New Jersey\u2019s reliance on the existence of the convictions to bar Winston from gun ownership in New Jersey. <em>Cf. People v. Laino, </em>32 <em>Cal.4th </em>878, 11 <em>Cal.Rptr.3d </em>723, 87 P.3d 27, 37 (2004) (holding full faith and credit no bar to California determining under its law whether guilty plea in Arizona resulting in judgment of dismissal constituted prior conviction for purposes of three strikes law).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">There is no constitutional requirement that New Jersey deem Winston not disqualified for a permit under its firearms law just because New York has seen fit to do so under its law. The Supreme Court has long held that the Pull Faith and Credit Clause \u201cdoes not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.\u201d <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm\u2019n, </em>306 <em>U.S. </em>493, 502, 59 <em>S.Ct. </em>629, 633, 83 <em>L.Ed. </em>940, 945 (1939). That Winston argues that the certificates remove a disability under federal firearms law is irrelevant as the federal firearms statutes are not at issue here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Accordingly, we hold that Winston\u2019s New York convictions disqualify him from gun ownership in New Jersey under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(l), notwithstanding his certificates of relief from disabilities for those convictions. The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require New Jersey to ignore its law that treats such convictions as automatically disqualifying simply because the certificates remove that automatic disqualifier under New York\u2019s gun laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Winston\u2019s remaining arguments require only brief comment. While noting that a decision to deny a permit as not in the interest of public health, safety or welfare under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5), requires a fact-sensitive analysis, the Law Division judge clearly based her decision on the disqualification presented by Winston\u2019s New York convictions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(l) and not the public health, safety and welfare provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5). Accordingly, while Clifton may have uncovered reasons beyond the convictions that would allow a court to find that issuance of the permits to Winston would not be in the interest of public health, safety or welfare, it elected to proceed solely upon his New York convictions and the judge limited her decision accordingly. We need not address whether the evidence would have supported denial of the permits on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Although hardly critical here as the decision under review rested elsewhere, we note that this court has addressed, and rejected post <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>570, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), Winston\u2019s argument that the public health and safety exception of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5) is unconstitutionally vague. <em>In re Dubov, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 196\u2014 97, 981 A.2d 87 (App.Div.2009). We do not find that <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago, </em>561 <em>U.S. </em>742, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>3020, 3026, 177 L.Ed.2d 894, 903 (2010), alters our thinking, as it did not address due process issues but merely extended <em>Heller\u2019s </em>holding to the States. \u201cWe cannot conclude that the [Second] Amendment or the Court\u2019s recent decisions require this State to dismantle its statutory scheme addressing the risks of misuse and accidental use [of firearms] in public places devised long ago and developed over many years. This scheme is crafted to burden the exercise of the right to use handguns for lawful purposes as little as possible, without abandoning this effort to maintain order and safety in public places.\u201d <em>In re Wheeler, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 617, 81 A.3d 728 (App.Div.2013) (addressing constitutionality of the State\u2019s carry permit law).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> The transcript reveals that counsel for the parties disputed the extent to which Clifton could rely on the domestic violence incident in this proceeding apparently because of a related expungement obtained in New Jersey. After supplemental briefing and a discussion in chambers, the judge asked the prosecutor to \u201cplace on the record what the State ultimately is relying on in its denial of [Winston\u2019s] application.\u201d The prosecutor responded that the State was \u201crelying on the fact that this applicant has two prior convictions in the State of New York, one for [attempted] assault and one for possession of CDS.\u201d Accordingly, although the nature and contours of the dispute over Winston's involvement in a domestic violence incident are unclear from the record, what is clear is the State's election to rely solely on the New York convictions in meeting its burden before the Law Division. <em>See Weston v. State, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>36, 46, 286 A.2d 43 (1972) (explaining that burden of proof of the existence of good cause for denial of a firearms purchaser identification card at review hearing under prior statute was on the State); <em>In re Osworth, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 77, 838 A.2d 465 (App.Div. 2003) (applying <em>Weston </em>to current statute), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>310, 845 A.2d 135 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b35-13\"> Winston's argument that this section does not apply to him based upon the explanation on the reverse of the certificates is meritless. The reverse of the form itself notes that the law is as set forth in Article 23 and that the excerpted portions are summarized for convenience and \"are not intended as administrative interpretations and they do not relieve any party of full knowledge of and compliance with the applicable provisions of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> New York's highest court has noted that the statute expressly does not preclude a court or authority from relying on the conviction for which a certificate has been obtained in exercising its discretionary function. <em>Matter of Arrocha </em>v. <em>Bd. of Ed., </em>93 <em>N.Y. </em>2d 361, 690 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>503, 712 <em>N.E.2d </em>669, 671-73 (1999) (upholding denial of teaching license based on prior felony drug conviction notwithstanding applicant's possession of certificate of relief from disabilities). Accordingly, even in New York a convicted felon possessing a certificate of relief from disabilities for the conviction can lawfully be denied a gun permit on the basis of the conviction. <em>See Matter of Caputo </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>117 <em>A.D.3d </em>644, 987 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>46, 47 (2013) (\u201cAlthough petitioner's Certificate of Relief from Disabilities removed the automatic bar to licensure occasioned by his prior convictions, it 'did not prevent respondent from relying on the convictions in the exercise of his statutoiy discretion to deny a [firearm] license for lack of good moral character or good cause.' \u201c (quoting <em>Hines v. Kelly, 222 A.D.2d </em>277, 635 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>31, 32 (N.Y.App.Div.1985))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> The question of whether full faith and credit required the federal government to give effect to a state pardon under federal firearms law was resolved by Congressional action. <em>See Thrall v. Wolfe, </em>503 F.2d 313, 316 (7th Cir.1974) (holding full faith and credit did not require elimination of federal statutory disability based on state conviction despite existence of state pardon, where pardon not expressly based on a determination of innocence), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 <em>U.S. </em>972, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1392, 43 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>652 (1975), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Firearms Owners Protection Act, <em>Pub.L. </em>99-308, 100 <em>Stat. </em>450.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
