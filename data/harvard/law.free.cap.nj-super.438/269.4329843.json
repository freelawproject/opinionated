After extensive administrative hearings conducted within the hospital, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>which the surgeon and his attorney participated, the hospital\u2019s Board of Trustees revoked the surgeon\u2019s clinical privileges. The surgeon contended that the actions taken against him by the hospital were arbitrary, unreasonable, and unduly punitive. He sought relief in the trial court, based on several legal theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The trial court dismissed the surgeon\u2019s lawsuit. In doing so, the court relied upon immunities from monetary damages conferred by federal and New Jersey statutes upon hospitals and the participants in peer review processes when evaluating a physician\u2019s performance and in making decisions about that physician\u2019s clinical privileges. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11111 to 11112 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.10. The court found that plaintiff had failed to present sufficient evidence or indicia to overcome those statutory immunities. The court further ruled that plaintiff had not justified the taking of depositions, or the pursuit of other additional discovery, before the immunity issues were adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs complaint, the rejection of his request to amend his pleadings a third time to amplify his allegations, and the court\u2019s determination that plaintiff had failed to justify additional discovery. In particular, we concur with the trial court that the hospital and the participants in the hospital\u2019s internal review processes are statutorily immune in this case from monetary liability. We further agree with the court that plaintiff has not identified sufficient grounds to establish that the hospital conducted its investigation without a reasonable basis for doing so, or that the hospital\u2019s revocation of plaintiffs privileges was imposed without a reasonable belief that such action was in furtherance of quality health care objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Additionally, we sustain the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs conclusory allegations of wrongdoing by the hospital and the participants in the internal review process are insufficient to warrant depositions or the taking of other additional discovery. We hold that a challenger\u2019s right to obtain discovery, particularly depositions, in cases involving these immunity statutes is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>absolute. Instead, the court may curtail discovery in its discretion if there are no reasonable indicia that a factual basis to surmount the immunities will be uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We derive the following chronology of events from the record, describing them solely to the extent that they are pertinent to the case-dispositive immunity questions raised before us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, we acknowledge that plaintiff disagrees with some of the hospital\u2019s findings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of his deficient performance and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>vigorously contests the sanction of revocation that the Board of Trustees ultimately imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Initial Review of Plaintiff\u2019s Performance and the Temporary Suspension of His Privileges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Plaintiff James B. Hurwitz, M.D., is a board-certified general surgeon licensed in the State of New Jersey. Plaintiff has been granted clinical privileges at several hospitals, including Overlook Hospital (\u201cOverlook\u201d or \u201cthe hospital\u201d), where he first obtained privileges in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Eventually, concerns arose regarding the care that plaintiff had provided to certain patients at Overlook. As a result, in June 2010, the hospital\u2019s Chief of Surgery referred cases of two of plaintiffs patients for review by an outside expert, a faculty member at New York University School of Medicine. The outside reviewer is not affiliated with Overlook. Plaintiff was not concurrently informed that those cases had been sent out for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The outside reviewer issued a report in August 2010, opining that, with respect to one of the two patients in question, plaintiff had not been \u201cproactive in managing [the patient\u2019s] care\u201d and also that he had failed to \u201cintervene when the clinical situation required.\u201d The reviewer reached similar conclusions with respect to the second patient. The reviewer recommended \u201ccounseling, monitoring, and consideration of restricting [plaintiffs] clinical privileges!,]\u201d and if such measures had already been taken, \u201cterminating [plaintiffs] privileges at Overlook Hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Soon thereafter, on September 29, 2010, the hospital\u2019s Medical Executive Committee (\u201cMEC\u201d) convened to consider authorizing an internal investigation into plaintiffs clinical competence. On that same day, the twenty-six MEC members in attendance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>unanimously voted in favor of commencing such a formal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The next day, September 30, 2010, the president of the hospital\u2019s medical staff issued a letter to plaintiff, notifying him that the MEC had begun the investigation. As a consequence of the pending investigation, the president temporarily suspended plaintiffs clinical privileges. This temporary suspension was imposed pursuant to the hospital\u2019s bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>The Chancery Division Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Less than a week later, on October 1, 2010, plaintiff filed an action in the Chancery Division seeking injunctive relief to restrain and enjoin the hospital from suspending his privileges. Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint in the Chancery action, adding as a co-defendant the hospital\u2019s medical staff (\u201cthe Medical Staff\u2019). The hospital and the Medical Staff filed opposition to the injunctive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">After hearing initial oral argument, the Chancery Division judge presiding over the matter, Hon. John F. Malone, granted plaintiffs request for certain expedited discovery and scheduled further argument on the injunction. Among other things, Judge Malone directed defendants to provide plaintiff with a copy of the hospital\u2019s bylaws, written notice of the reasons for any adverse action taken or proposed, results of any investigation taken, medical charts, records, and any written report of the hospital\u2019s findings, including a \u201crecitation of the [hospital\u2019s] actions and recommendations ... and the basis for [plaintiffs] summary suspension without [a] hearing[.]\u201d The judge declined to issue temporary restraints restoring plaintiffs privileges. Certain paper discovery, including responses to interrogatories, apparently were thereafter provided in the Chancery action, but no depositions were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>The Investigating Committee\u2019s Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Meanwhile, as a follow-up to the September 2010 MEC meeting, the hospital created an Ad Hoc Investigating Committee (\u201cthe Investigating Committee\u201d), appointed by the Medical Staff, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>undertake the investigation and to submit a report with its findings and recommendations to the MEC. Five physicians were named to the Investigating Committee. The Investigating Committee met several times between October 2010 and December 2010. Plaintiff was invited to provide written submissions, and he did so in a letter from his counsel and also in his own separate letter. Plaintiff declined, however, three opportunities to meet with the Investigating Committee in person and to answer questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On December 20, 2010, the Investigating Committee issued its report, along with various recommendations. The report noted that the Committee had reviewed plaintiffs care that he had provided to six patients over a year-and-a-half period. Based on its review of those six cases, the Investigating Committee reached certain unfavorable conclusions. In particular, its report found that plaintiffs care was \u201cnotable for poor documentation of care plans and delays in managing complications of surgery, which resulted in adverse outcomes.\u201d Given its findings, the Investigating Committee presented the following recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">Our recommendation is to remove I plaintiff] from the ER [Emergency Room] call schedule and to institute ad hoc review of 25 inpatient surgical eases [in which plaintiff had acted] as primary surgeon by the Surgical Care Review Committee. If [plaintiffs] performance of the eases were felt to be adequate, he would be able to return to the ER roster.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\n<em>Dismissal of the Chancery Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The hospital then filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs Chancery action, in lieu of an answer, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e). That motion was granted on January 21, 2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>On the same day that Judge Malone granted the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss the Chancery action, the MEC issued its decision based on the Investigating Committee\u2019s report. In a letter dated January 21, 2011, the MEC informed plaintiff that it had voted to impose a continued suspension of his privileges, subject to various terms and conditions. Specifically, the MEC stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">After thoughtful consideration and deliberation, the MEC voted to impose <em>an additional suspension of your clinical privileges commencing upon your receipt of this notice for a minimum of three (S) months or until such time as you complete professional courses at your expense </em>approved by the MEC addressing Medical Ethics and Professionalism, Medical Record Documentation and General Surgical Review. <em>Upon completion of the suspension, your clinical privileges will be reinstated at which time you will be required to undergo a concurrent review of twenty-five (25) cases by a supervising surgeon </em>assigned by the Chairman of the Department of Surgery. During the concurrent review, you will be <em>ineligible for the Emergency Department on-call schedule, you mil not be provided routine resident coverage for your patients, and any and all elective cases will require review and approval by the Chairman </em>of the Department of Surgery prior to scheduling a patient for the OR [Operating Room] or otherwise admitting a patient to Overlook Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">[(Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">A little less than a month later, Judge Malone denied plaintiffs outstanding motion for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Law Division Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Although it is not entirely clear from the record, plaintiff apparently filed a new or a reinstated complaint in the Law Division some time between January 2011 and November 2011. Despite the fact that the Chancery action had already been dismissed in January 2011, plaintiff obtained an order in May 2011 \u201ctransferring\u201d his ease from the Chancery Division to the Law Division. Plaintiff also requested that his case be reassigned to the complex commercial track, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:5A-2(b), so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>to enable a lengthier period for discovery. That tracking request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In November 2011, the hospital moved to dismiss plaintiffs Law Division complaint, without prejudice, \u201cpending a resolution or completion of the hospitales] hearing and appeal process.\u201d The hospital noted that, under its applicable bylaws, plaintiff was entitled to a formal internal hearing to contest the MEC\u2019s investigative findings and recommendations. In fact, plaintiff had already requested such an internal hearing under the bylaws, and that hearing had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Plaintiff did not oppose a without-prejudice dismissal of his Law Division action at that time. As his counsel represented to us, plaintiff agreed to such a dismissal to accommodate the hospital\u2019s internal administrative procedures, in light of the costs and burdens of challenging the hospital\u2019s actions in two separate proceedings at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Consequently, plaintiff and the hospital entered into a Consent Order on January 19, 2012, dismissing plaintiffs Law Division action, expressly \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d pending a resolution or completion of the hospital\u2019s internal hearing and appeals process. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Order, plaintiff was permitted to reinstate his amended complaint in the Law Division \u201cwithout regard to any statute of limitations issues.\u201d Aside from this, the Consent Order specified that the parties \u201creserve[d] all rights concerning the claims and defenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\n<em>The Hospital\u2019s Internal Hearings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The hospital\u2019s internal hearings began in June 2011. After a substantial delay of eight months due to scheduling conflicts of plaintiffs counsel, the hearings were resumed and completed February 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The hearing panel consisted of three physicians and a presiding member from an outside organization. Both plaintiff and the MEC were represented by counsel. We are advised that fact and expert witnesses for both parties presented sworn testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the panel, and were subject to cross-examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Documents were presented into evidence, including medical records of the specific patients whose cases were the subject of the MEC investigation. The parties submitted post-hearing briefs for the panel\u2019s consideration. A certified shorthand reporter prepared a verbatim transcript of the hearings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">On May 2, 2012, the hearing panel issued its report. The panel concluded that plaintiff had been deficient in his care and treatment of the four patients whose cases it had reviewed. With regard to those patients, the panel concluded that plaintiff \u201cin various respects, demonstrated poor surgical judgment, a lack of attentiveness to patients, untimely post-operative management of surgical complications and/or a failure to document thought processes and plans of care.\u201d In addition, the panel faulted plaintiff for, as it found, entering a note in the chart of one of those four patients, which \u201cfalsely indicated that [plaintiff] had met with the patient\u2019s mother.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Based on its factual findings, the hearing panel recommended that the terms of plaintiffs suspension as set forth by the MEC should be adopted. The panel also indicated that more stringent sanctions beyond such a suspension were not warranted. More specifically, the panel recommended in its written report, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">3. [T]hat the suspension of [plaintiffs] clinical privileges and other restrictions imposed by the MEC were fair and reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety of patients____[and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>5. The record does not support the imposition of greater sanctions on [plaintiff] than those imposed by the MEC, including the revocation of his clinical privileges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>The Board of Trustees\u2019 Revocation of Plaintiffs Privileges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Pursuant to the hospital\u2019s bylaws, the hearing panel forwarded its report to the Board of Trustees. Focusing in particular upon the hearing panel\u2019s discrete finding that plaintiff had falsified a patient record, the Board of Trustees revoked his clinical privileges, effective immediately. It conveyed that decision in a letter to plaintiff dated July 26, 2012. Plaintiff did not pursue any further appeal within the hospital of the Board of Trustees\u2019 decision, although the bylaws entitled him to appeal the decision to a \u201cReview Panel composed of not fewer than three persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Motion to Reinstate His Law Division Case and Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">After the Board of Trustees informed him of its decision to revoke his privileges, plaintiff moved to reinstate his action in the Law Division but simultaneously moved to file a proposed Second Amended Complaint. His pleadings, as originally framed and then revised in the proposed Second Amended Complaint, asserted several legal theories for the recovery of damages, including breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of plaintiffs due process rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendants opposed the reinstatement motion. They argued, among other things, that the proposed Second Amended Complaint failed to state a cause of action as a matter of law because of defendants\u2019 federal and state statutory immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">After hearing oral argument, the Presiding Judge of the Law Division, Hon. Kenneth J. Crispin, entered an order on March 12, 2013, accompanied by a written Statement of Reasons, denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>plaintiffs reinstatement motion, without prejudice. Specifically, Judge Grispin found in his Statement of Reasons that plaintiffs proposed Second Amended Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">[flailed to plead malice on the part of the hospital, or its staff, which was required to rebut the presumption of reasonableness pursuant to [42] <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a). Moreover, [plaintiffs] proposed amended complaint fails to state a cause of action as to the Board for the very same reasons____Similarly, [plaintiffs] alleged \u201cdue process\u201d claim, contained in Count Three of the proposed amended complaint, cannot be sustained against a non-profit hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Thereafter, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration and for leave to file a further amendment to his Law Division complaint. In support of his motion, plaintiff submitted a proposed Third Amended Complaint naming as defendants \u201cAHS Hospital Corp.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Board of Trustees.\u201d The proposed pleading also names various fictitiously-named parties who have yet to be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Following another round of oral argument, Judge Grispin denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. In a second Statement of Reasons dated May 27, 2013, Judge Grispin concluded that plaintiffs proposed Third Amended Complaint still \u201cfailed to articulate sufficient facts which would demonstrate malice on the part of Overlook which unjustly prejudiced [plaintiff] or that the internal administrative hearing process was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d The judge granted defendants\u2019 cross-motion to dismiss the Law Division action, conclusively, specifying that the dismissal was \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\n<em>The Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court acted prematurely in enforcing defendants\u2019 claimed immunities. He argues that the court should have afforded him an opportunity to conduct depositions, which he asserts might have uncovered admissible evidence to overcome the immunities and which potentially could demonstrate that defendants acted maliciously, arbitrarily, or unreasonably. Although his counsel acknowledged at the appellate oral argument that plaintiff had not handled the patient cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>in question \u201cperfectly,\u201d and that some degree of \u201cremediation\u201d of his conduct is appropriate, plaintiff asserts that the sanction of revocation imposed by the Board of Trustees is unduly harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Plaintiff argues that the Board of Trustees\u2019 imposition of the sanction of revocation, which is more severe than the conditional suspension recommended by the MEC and the hearing panel, circumstantially shows that the Board of Trustees engaged here in arbitrary and unreasonable decision-making. Plaintiff also contends that the hospital and its agents waived in the Consent Order their ability to oppose the reinstatement of his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Plaintiff therefore urges that the trial court\u2019s dismissal order be vacated. In particular, he seeks to have his lawsuit reinstated for the completion of discovery and for a decision on the merits with a fuller record.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In response, defendants maintain that the trial court correctly enforced the terms mandated by and the public policies reflected in the federal and state immunity statutes. Those statutes, defendants emphasize, are designed to protect hospitals and the participants in internal peer reviews from having monetary liability to doctors who are sanctioned as a result of such internal processes. Defendants further submit that they did not waive in the Consent Order their right to oppose a reinstatement of plaintiffs lawsuit on legal grounds, here being the substantive immunities they are afforded under the federal and state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Defendants further assert that the trial court sensibly rejected plaintiffs request to conduct depositions and to pursue other discovery. They maintain there is no indication in the record, apart from plaintiffs conclusory assertions and suspicions, that the hospital or its representatives engaged here in the sort of ill-founded or nefarious behavior that could nullify their statutory immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The critical focus of this appeal centers upon the application of the federal and state immunities that have been invoked by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>defendants. We begin our analysis with an examination of the federal statutory provisions, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11111 to 11112.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The federal immunities are part of the larger Healthcare Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (\u201cHCQIA\u201d), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11101 to 11152, which provides, in relevant part, that in a \u201cprofessional review action of a professional review body ... (A) the professional review body, (B) any person acting as a member or staff to the body, (C) any person under a contract or other formal agreement with the body, and (D) any person who participates with or assists the body with respect to the action\u201d shall not be hable in damages under any law \u201cwith respect to [any review] action,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11111(a)(1), if the review action is taken:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">(1) in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">(2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">(3) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fan- to the physician under the circumstances, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">(4) in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph (3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">[ 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">A \u201cprofessional review body,\u201d as that term is used in the HCQIA, is broadly defined. The term encompasses \u201ca health care entity and the governing body or any committee of a health care entity which conducts professional review activity, and includes any committee of the medical staff of such an entity when assisting the governing body in a professional review activity.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11151(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">A \u201cprofessional review action,\u201d defined earlier in the HCQIA, consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">an action or recommendation of a professional review body which is taken or <em>made in the conduct of professional review activity, </em>which is based on the competence or professional conduct of an individual physician (which conduct affects or could affect adversely the health or welfare of a patient or patients), <em>and which affects (or may affect) adversely the clinical privileges, </em>or membership in a professional society, of the physician. Such term includes a formal decision of a professional review body not to take an action or make a recommendation described in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>previous sentence and also includes professional review activities relating to a professional review action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">[ 42 <em>U.S.G.A. </em>\u00a7 11151(9) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Further, the HCQIA defines \u201cprofessional review activity\u201d to cover any activity of a health care entity with respect to an individual physician conducted \u201c(A) to determine whether the physician may have clinical privileges with respect to, or membership in, the entity, (B) to determine the scope or conditions of such privileges or membership, or (C) to change or modify such privileges or membership.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11151(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Significantly, the HCQIA imposes a rebuttable presumption that an adverse professional review action undertaken by a hospital against a physician is protected by the immunity. As the statute recites, \u201c[a] professional review action shall be presumed to have met the preceding standards necessary for the protection set out in section [42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11111(a)] unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a). The only specified qualification to this broad immunity coverage, then, is if a plaintiff demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant took action without a reasonable belief in initiating the action, failed to provide adequate notice and hearing procedures, or otherwise took action without a reasonable belief it was warranted by the facts after a reasonable investigation. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 11112(a)(1) to -(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u201cHCQIA immunity is a question of law for the court to decide and may be resolved <em>whenever </em>the record in a particular case becomes sufficiently developed.\u201d <em>Bryan v. James E. Holmes Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>33 F.3d 1318, 1332 (11th Cir.1994) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1019, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1363, 131 L.Ed.2d 220 (1995). As the House of Representatives Committee that took part in the HCQIA\u2019s passage explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">The [immunity] provisions would allow a court to make a determination that the defendant has or has not met the standards specified in section [11112(a)]. <em>The Committee intends that the court could so rale even though other issues in the case remain to be resolved.

Other courts applying the statute have expressed comparable deference to hospitals, their peer reviewers, and their internal decision-makers. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Bradley Mem.

Like the federal law, the New Jersey statute provides broad immunity for damages to qualified persons for actions taken as part of a hospital\u2019s peer review process. As is relevant here, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A84A-22.10 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\"><em>Any person </em>who serves as a member of, is staff to, under a contract or other formal agreement vrith, participates with, or assists with respect to an action of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">d.

Before delving into that analysis, we dispose first of two procedural matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">First, we reject plaintiffs argument that the Consent Order should be construed as a waiver of defendants\u2019 right, based on their federal and state immunities, to oppose plaintiffs claims. The terms of the Consent Order cannot be reasonably interpreted to bar defendants from interposing their immunity arguments. The plain language of the Consent Order provides that the parties \u201creserve all rights concerning the claims <em>and defenses.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">A consent order is, in essence, an agreement of the parties that has been approved by the court. As the Supreme Court has consistently noted, one of the \u201c \u2018fundamental canons of contract construction require that we examine the plain language of the contract and the parties\u2019 intent, as evidenced by the contract\u2019s purpose and surrounding circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Highland Lakes Country Club &amp; Cmty., Ass\u2019n v. Franzino, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>99,115, 892 A.2d 646 (2006) (quoting <em>State Troopers Fraternal Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>38, 47, 692 A.2d 519 (1997) (citations omitted)). The plain language of the Consent Order here is not ambiguous, nor is it obscured by the surrounding circumstances. Defendants clearly did not forfeit in the Consent Order their right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>to invoke their statutory immunities, or their right to invoke them as soon as the litigation was reactivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Moreover, our Court Rules explicitly state that a request to dismiss for failure to state a claim \u201cmay be made in <em>any </em>pleading permitted or ordered or by motion for summary judgment <em>or </em>at the trial on the merits.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:6-7 (emphasis added). Thus, by its very terms, <em>Rule </em>4:6-7 permits a party to raise the defense of a failure to state a claim as late as trial, as well as sooner on motion. <em>See Buteas v. Raritan Lodge No. 61 F. &amp; A.M., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 591 A.2d 623 (App.Div.1991); <em>see also </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>cmt. 1 on <em>R. </em>4:6-7 (2015) (stating that a defense under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) \u201cmay be raised as late as trial\u201d). We further note that defendants did, in fact, assert the defense of failure to state a claim in response to plaintiffs amended verified complaint that he had filed earlier in the Law Division, albeit in a footnote in their motion papers, before the Consent Order was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We recognize that defendants agreed in the Consent Order that plaintiff could reinstate his amended complaint. However, as plaintiff stated at the appellate argument, he sought to \u201creinstate\u201d not his First Amended Complaint but his Second Amended Complaint. In any event, had defendants acceded to reinstatement of his First Amended Complaint and then opposed further amendment or moved to dismiss, the end result would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">A second preliminary facet that we must address is the appropriate procedural context in which to evaluate defendants\u2019 case-dispositive motion. To be sure, defendants\u2019 motion was couched as a motion to dismiss under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. However, both parties in their submissions respecting that motion, as well as the trial court, made reference to and relied upon documentary materials from the hospital\u2019s internal review process. Those materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>were beyond the four corners of the complaint, although excerpts of them were quoted or referred to in the complaint. In his ruling, the judge at times referred to the entire record presented to him, which clearly went beyond the discrete excerpts quoted and otherwise referred to in the pleadings. As such, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss most properly should be \u00a1conceived as a dismissal motion converted to a motion for summary judgment under <em>Rule </em>4:46-1 to -6, as is permitted under the last sentence of <em>Rule </em>4:6-2.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Viewed properly in this more expansive context, we must evaluate the record before us under the customary standards of summary judgment practice. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). In particular, we are to read the record in a light most favorable to plaintiff and accord all favorable inferences to plaintiff that can be reasonably drawn from that record. <em>See R. </em>4:46-2; <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146; <em>see also Murray v. Plainfield Rescue Squad, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>581, 584, 46 A.3d 1262 (2012) (applying the same <em>Rule </em>4:46 standards on appellate review of a summary judgment order). Upon doing so, we are satisfied, for the reasons we explain, <em>infra, </em>that the trial court\u2019s entry of final judgment in defendants\u2019 favor was sound and not premature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We turn to the substance of the immunity arguments. Even viewing the record in a light most favorable to plaintiff, we agree with Judge Grispin that defendants are entitled to immunity from damages as a matter of federal and New Jersey statutory law, and that plaintiff has failed to present a sufficient basis to vault those immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As Judge Grispin correctly found, defendants are clearly within the presumptive scope of the federal immunity under the HCQIA. The hospital\u2019s internal review of plaintiffs performance unquestionably comprises a \u201cprofessional review activity\u201d under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11151(10). The participants in the review, including the Medical Staff, the Investigating Committee, the MEC, the hearing panel, and the Board of Trustees are all \u201cprofessional review bodies\u201d within the ambit of the statute. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11151(11). The various recommendations and decisions to impose sanctions upon plaintiff \u2014 initially a recommended suspension and ultimately the Board of Trustees\u2019 revocation of plaintiffs clinical privileges \u2014 comprise \u201cprofessional review actions\u201d as defined under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11151(9), because they adversely affected plaintiffs status at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">As we have already noted, defendants and the other participants in the hospital\u2019s internal review process are presumptively immune under the HCQIA from monetary damages if they acted in \u201cthe reasonable belief that the[ir] action[s] were in the furtherance of quality health care,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a)(1), \u201cafter a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a)(2), after \u201cadequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician ... or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a)(3), and with a \u201creasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts\u201d and after appropriate notice and fair procedures. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>More simply stated, the federal immunity presumptively governs this case, so long as the hospital and its participants proceeded in a fair and reasonable manner and with a reasonable belief that the actions taken were in furtherance of quality health care and warranted by the facts. The record provides no evidence, nor even a plausible indication, that defendants failed to comport with these norms of fairness and reasonableness. Plaintiff failed to carry his burden to rebut the presumption, or even create a material issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The judicial power to intervene in disputes over a physician\u2019s clinical privileges is circumscribed. As this court held almost thirty years ago in an opinion coincidentally involving another physician whose privileges had been terminated at Overlook, \u201cijjudicial review of hospital decisions regarding admission to medical staff, extent of privileges and termination is very limited.\u201d <em>Zoneraich v. Overlook Hosp., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 90, 514 A.2d 53 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>32, 526 A.2d 126 (1986). \u201cHospital officials are vested with wide managerial discretion, to be used to elevate hospital standards and to better medical care.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Greisman v. Newcomb Hosp., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>389, 403, 192 A.2d 817 (1963)). \u201cSo long as hospital decisions concerning medical staff are reasonable, are consistent with the public interest, and further the health care mission of the hospital, the courts will not interfere.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Desai v. St. Barnabas Med. Ctr., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>79, 510 A.2d 662 (1986), and <em>Belmar v. Cipolla, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>199, 208, 475 A.2d 533 (1984)). Although <em>Zoneraich </em>did not involve the HCQIA (which, as it so happened, was enacted by Congress that same year), these same general principles pertain in applying that federal immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">That said, our courts have also recognized that \u201ca physician is entitled to fundamentally fair procedures in a nonprofit hospital\u2019s consideration of staff membership, the extent of privileges and termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 514 A.2d 53. Accordingly, the hospital seeking to suspend or oust a physician must provide notice to the affected physician of the charges or the hospital\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>proposed action before an internal hearing. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe tribunal must be fair and unbiased.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The physician has a qualified right to retain counsel and a right to disclosure of certain information, <em>\u201climited by </em>recognition of competing rights to privilege and confidentiality.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>Garrow v. Elizabeth Gen. Hosp. &amp; Dispensary, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>549, 566-68, 401 A.2d 533 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">As our Supreme Court noted in <em>Garrow </em>and we reiterated in <em>Zoneraich, </em>\u201c[j]udicial review of a hospital board action \u2018should properly focus on <em>the reasonableness </em>of the action taken in relation to the several interests of the public, the [physician], and the hospital.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zoneraich, supra, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 91, 514 A.2d 53 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Garrow, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 565, 401 A.2d 533). Because of the internal nature of the hospital\u2019s private hearing, \u201c \u2018[t]he proper standard upon review is not identical with that customarily applied to administrative agencies, that is, substantial competent credible evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Garrow, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 565, 401 A.2d 533). \u201c \u2018However, the record should contain sufficient reliable evidence, even though of a hearsay nature, to justify the result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Garrow, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 565, 401 A.2d 533).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The HCQIA likewise affords deference to hospitals and their representatives when they make these difficult decisions concerning a physician\u2019s clinical privileges. That deference is manifested by the federal law\u2019s express presumption that the immunity from damages applies unless the physician challenging the hospital\u2019s adverse decision proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the decision-makers took action without a reasonable belief that it was in furtherance of quality health care, failed to provide adequate notice and hearing procedures, or took action without a reasonable belief based on the facts known after a reasonable investigation. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The \u201creasonable belief\u2019 concepts in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(4) of Section 11112 are objective standards. In fact, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>House Committee report explains, the drafters of the federal immunity revised the bill to replace a \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement contained in an earlier version to \u201ca more objective \u2018reasonable belief \u201d standard. H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 10 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>6392-93. The Committee noted \u201cconcerns that \u2018good faith\u2019 might be misinterpreted as requiring only a test of the subjective state of mind of the physicians conducting the professional review action.\u201d Ibid. The Committee further declared its intention that the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 test \u201cwill be satisfied if the reviewers, with the information available to them at the time of the professional review action, would reasonably have concluded that their action would restrict incompetent behavior or would protect patients.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Committee also expressed its \u201cbelief that this standard will be met <em>in the overwhelming majority </em>of professional review actions[.]\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). Consistent with the drafters\u2019 intent, case law has repeatedly treated the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 test under the statute as an objective test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The HCQIA does not specify that a reviewing court must be provided with transcripts of the hospital\u2019s internal hearing in order to evaluate the adequacy of the hospital\u2019s proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Although we recognize that the trial court in <em>Zonemich </em>was apparently supplied with a record of the hospital\u2019s internal proceedings, we do not construe the HCQIA to require that such transcripts be furnished in every case. \u25a0 The transcripts are not vital where, as here, the other documents provided to the court sufficiently establish that the physician was afforded a fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard, and show that the hospital\u2019s ultimate decision was reasonably attained based upon factual determinations generated from those internal hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.10 extends a similar form of immunity protection for hospitals, peer reviewers, and decision-makers. The provision broadly covers \u201cany person\u201d involved in such review of a physician \u201cfor any action taken or recommendation made by [that person] within the scope of [that person\u2019s] function\u201d in that role. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.10(e). This state-law immunity applies, so long as \u201csuch action or recommendation was taken or made <em>without malice and in the reasonable belief after reasonable investigation </em>that such action or recommendation was warranted upon the basis of facts disclosed.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.10(e) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Although the term \u201cmalice\u201d is not defined within <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-22.10, the conventional meaning of that term suggests that the sanctioned physician must prove that the hospital defendants acted, in essence, either with ill will, without just cause,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>reckless disregard of the truth of the facts regarding the physician\u2019s quality of care.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The \u201creasonable belief1\u2019 aspect of the New Jersey statute is also undefined. We discern no basis to construe it any differently than the federal immunity statute\u2019s usage of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We have no doubt that plaintiff was provided here with a procedurally fair opportunity to be heard during the hospital\u2019s internal process. He was given multiple opportunities to provide written submissions to the hospital\u2019s reviewers and decision-makers. He was advised before the formal hearing conducted by the hearing panel of the specific patient cases that would be the subject of review. He was represented in the internal hearings by able and experienced counsel who is a certified civil trial attorney. He apparently testified and also presented his own expert witness. The findings of the Investigating Committee and, thereafter, of the hearing panel, were clearly detailed in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">By all indications, these procedures comported with the HCQIA, the New Jersey statute, and case law. It is not as if plaintiff had been abruptly summoned before the Board of Trustees without warning and summarily stripped of his privileges for no articulated reasons. To the contrary, the Board\u2019s final decision was the culmination of a lengthy and elaborate process, one in which plaintiff had many opportunities to present opposition and, presumably, to settle the matter on the terms recommended in succession by the internal reviewers.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Attempting to meet his burden to establish unreasonableness or other improper conduct, plaintiff points to three aspects of the chronology that he contends are indicia that defendants\u2019 statutory immunities should be overcome. He specifically alleges in his reply brief that: (I) defendants did not have a reasonable belief that their actions as to him were in the furtherance of quality health care; (2) they failed to provide him with adequate notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the first investigation and of the initial referral to the outside reviewer; and (3) they lacked a reasonable belief that the sanctions recommended and imposed were warranted. As to that latter point, plaintiff emphasizes that the sanction of revocation ultimately imposed by the Board of Trustees was harsher than the conditional suspension recommended by both the MEC and the hearing panel. We concur with the trial court that there is no merit to these contentions of unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The record provides an ample basis to justify the hospital\u2019s decision to pursue a review of the care that plaintiff had provided to several of his patients. Indeed, those concerns were borne out by the adverse findings of the outside reviewer, the Investigating Committee, and the hearing panel. The documents in the appendices readily show that defendants had a reasonable basis to believe that the professional review and remedial action they took was pursued to further the quality of health care being provided to the hospital\u2019s patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In general, the applicable nexus to the \u201cquality of health care\u201d will be satisfied under the HCQIA if the reviewing body, based on the information before it, \u201cwould reasonably have concluded that [its] action would restrict incompetent behavior or would protect patients.\u201d <em>Gordon, supra, </em>423 F.3d at 202 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 10 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>6393). As the Fifth Circuit has noted, the HCQIA \u201cdoes not require that the professional review result in an actual improvement of the quality of health care, nor does it require that the conclusions reached by the reviewers were in fact correct.\u201d <em>Poliner, supra, </em>537 F.3d at 378 (quoting <em>Imperial v. Suburban Hosp. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>37 F.3d 1026, 1030 (4th Cir.1994)). That observation is consistent with the fact that Congress prescribed, under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(c), that a professional review board may immediately suspend clinical privileges \u201cwhere the failure to take such an action may result in an imminent danger to the health of any individual.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As the Third Circuit has observed, \u201cthe good or bad faith of the reviewers [under the HCQIA] is irrelevant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Brader v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp., </em>167 F.3d 832, 840 (3d Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cBrader II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">At the time its nearly year-long review process began, the hospital had outstanding concerns regarding plaintiffs management of his patients and his documentation of their treatment. Indeed, as the outside reviewer concluded in his report, plaintiff \u201ceither did not understand the appropriate steps in management or approached the situation too passively. Neither is acceptable.\u201d Moreover, plaintiff himself acknowledged in his Second Amended Complaint that two of his patients \u201chad recognized complications associated with their surgeries.\u201d The fact that those patients eventually recovered is not dispositive. The record manifestly shows that the hospital\u2019s initiation of the review process was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We also reject plaintiffs next claim that defendants are disentitled to immunity because they faded to provide him with advance notice of the first steps of the outside review and investigation. As federal case law instructs, \u201cnothing in the [HCQIA] requires that a physician be permitted to participate in the review of his [own patient\u2019s] care.\u201d <em>Singh, supra, </em>308 <em>F.</em>3d at 44 (citation omitted). The HCQIA applies to \u201cdiscrete decisions, not an ongoing course of conduct.\u201d <em>Wojewski v. Rapid City Reg\u2019l Hosp., Inc., </em>730 N.W.2d 626, 636 n. 9 (S.D.2007) (applying the HCQIA\u2019s immunities).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Plaintiffs third argument, contending that defendants lacked a reasonable belief that the sanctions against him were actually warranted, is similarly flawed. He contends that the Board of Trustees \u201cconsistently and inexplicably disregarded\u201d the independent recommendations made regarding his performance. In his view, the Board of Trustees did not possess a reasonable belief that its decision to revoke his privileges was warranted. The trial judge rejected this specious assertion, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Courts generally agree that \u201cthe reversal of a peer review committee\u2019s recommendation of an adverse professional review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>action by a higher level peer review panel does not indicate that the initial recommendation was made without a reasonable belief that the recommendation would further quality health care.\u201d <em>Singh,, supra, </em>308 F.3d at 41 (citing <em>Austin v. McNamara, </em>979 <em>F.</em>2d 728, 735 (9th Cir.1992) (granting immunity in a situation where a hospital\u2019s judicial review committee overturned a medical executive committee\u2019s recommendation of an adverse professional review action)). The converse is also true.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The mere fact that, as plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s phrased it at oral argument before us, the hospital decision-makers \u201cratcheted up\u201d the sanctions as the matter progressed does not signify that the Board of Trustees or the other hospital decision-makers acted unreasonably or maliciously. In the motion arguments below, Judge Grispin aptly analogized the present case to attorney discipline cases, in which the Supreme Court sometimes imposes a harsher ultimate sanction on a licensee than that recommended by the Disciplinary Review Board.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The ultimate authority to make privilege decisions within the hospital rests with the Board of Trustees under the hospital\u2019s bylaws, and the Board\u2019s selection of a harsher penalty in this case does not mean that it acted maliciously or unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The Board had a reasonable cause for serious concern after the hearing panel concluded from the testimony it heard that plaintiff had made a false entry on a patient chart. Whether or not that discrete finding is actually true is beyond our limited scope of review. True or not, the finding alone reasonably sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ported the Board of Trustees\u2019 discretionary decision to revoke plaintiffs privileges. Moreover, plaintiff apparently bypassed numerous opportunities to resolve this matter with the lesser sanctions recommended by the MEC, the Investigating Committee, and the hearing panel before the matter reached the Board level.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">As a final matter, we consider plaintiffs argument that the trial court acted prematurely in dismissing his lawsuit without further discovery, particularly in denying his request for the depositions of persons involved in the hospital\u2019s review, investigation, and decision-making process. We are satisfied that Judge Grispin did not misapply his discretion in curtailing further discovery and in adjudicating the immunities of defendants on the law and on the record supplied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Neither the HCQIA nor <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.10 specifies what amount of discovery, if any, is warranted before a trial court may adjudicate the merits of the immunities invoked by a hospital or individual defendants who participated in the review of a physician\u2019s clinical privileges. We are mindful, however, of the House Committee\u2019s guidance that the immunity question under the HCQIA may be resolved at \u201can early stage of litigation,\u201d and that court may do so \u201ceven though other issues in the case remain to be resolved.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 12 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>at 6394.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The federal cases display no consistent pattern in the level of discovery afforded to physicians who challenge hospital defendants\u2019 assertions of HCQIA immunity. In some instances, the federal courts have found that the plaintiff physician was entitled to limited discovery of the peer review process. <em>See, e.g., Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., </em>453 F.Supp.2d 942, 948 (S.D.W.Va. 2006) (authorizing limited discovery, in the form of numerically-capped interrogatories, requests for admissions, and time-limited depositions), <em>aff'd, </em>562 F.3d 599 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>558 <em>U.S. </em>1158, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>1140, 175 L.Ed.2d 991 (2010); <em>Teasdale v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Marin Gen. Hosp., </em>138 <em>F.R.D. </em>691, 694 (N.D.Cal.1991) (authorizing the production of peer review documents); <em>see also Sugarbaker, supra, </em>187 F.3d at 857 (noting that the trial court had allowed depositions of persons involved in the hospital\u2019s peer review process, where the reasonableness of that process, including claims of antitrust violations by the defendants, had been plausibly challenged by plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Conversely, in some instances, the HCQIA immunity issues were resolved by the trial court at an early stage by granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See, e.g., Straznicky v. Desert Springs Hosp., </em>642 F.Supp.2d 1238, 1240 (D.Nev.2009) (granting dismissal of plaintiffs damage claims, with prejudice, based solely on the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint and related documents that the plaintiff physician had supplied to the court in connection with his motion for a temporary restraining order); <em>Sobel v. United States, </em>571 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>1222, 1229 (D.Kan.2008) (granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under the HCQIA on the face of the pleadings, finding, among other things, that the plaintiff physician had not asserted sufficient grounds to overcome the statute\u2019s presumption of immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">At the very least, the question of immunity under the HCQIA may be resolved in appropriate cases at the summary judgment stage. As the Ninth Circuit has observed, because the \u201creasonableness\u201d requirements of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11112(a) were \u201cintended to create an objective standard, rather than a subjective standard [of judicial review], this inquiry may be resolved on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ricks, </em>31 F.3d 1478, 1485 (9th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1035, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1400, 131 L.Ed.2d 287 (1995). The question then becomes whether a plaintiff has been afforded a sufficient opportunity to obtain facts that might bear upon that objective assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The sparse case law under the analogous New Jersey immunity statute is not instructive on the discovery question. As with the federal statute, it is logical to conclude that a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>entitlement to immunity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.10 can at times be resolved on a dispositive motion. It is equally sensible to conclude that a plaintiff\u2019s right to discovery on the state-law immunity issues may be reasonably limited by a trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We decline to adopt a per se rule declaring that a plaintiff physician who has lost his clinical privileges is always entitled to depositions or other full-blown discovery in litigating HCQIA immunity issues. Such a blanket right would conflict with the intent of Congress to permit the HCQIA immunity to be adjudicated at an \u201cearly stage of litigation\u201d in appropriate eases. Nor do we construe the New Jersey immunity statute to create such an absolute right.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In some cases, an unfettered right to discovery would needlessly entangle hospitals and review participants in depositions and other litigation activities, thereby diluting the practical benefit of the immunity protection conferred upon them by statute. Although we are mindful that these statutes provide hospital defendants with immunity from damages rather than immunity from suit, we also appreciate that protracted discovery easily can be costly and burdensome for the persons and entities involved. An appropriate balance can, and should, be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We therefore adopt a case-by-case approach that reposes discretion in the trial court to determine to what extent discovery on the immunity issues should be permitted. <em>See, e.g., R. </em>4:46-5 (granting trial judges authority to defer decisions on summary judgment motions where the party opposing the summary judgment motion demonstrates, by affidavit, that additional discovery is needed to respond to the motion). Such a case-specific approach is consistent with the important role that our civil trial judges routinely perform in balancing the needs of litigants to obtain relevant information against the often significant burdens and costs of the discovery process. The exercise of wise judicial discretion in striking a proper balance of those interests is particularly important where, as here, immunity statutes are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>On appeal, we generally will not second-guess a trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in discovery matters unless the appellant demonstrates that such discretion was abused. <em>Pomerantz Paper Corp. v. New Cmty. Corp., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>344, 371, 25 A.3d 221 (2011); <em>Bender v. Adelson, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>411, 428, 901 A.2d 907 (2006). We must review the trial court\u2019s denial of additional discovery to plaintiff here through that prism of deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Here, plaintiff already received at least some amount of paper discovery in the Chancery Division action. Plaintiff and his attorney actively participated in the two hearings before the hospital\u2019s hearing panel. He now demands depositions, on the conjectural supposition that such adversarial questioning of the hospital\u2019s representatives might reveal a proverbial \u201csmoking gun\u201d reflecting malice or some form of unreasonable conduct on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We concur with Judge Crispin that, given the particular context of this case, there is no need to allow such depositions to proceed when defendants\u2019 entitlement to immunity is so clear. Even if depositions proceeded, the individual deponents (or the hospital itself) might assert absolute or qualified privileges from disclosure under potentially-applicable confidentiality laws, and might decline to answer some or all of plaintiffs queries. <em>See, e.g., C.A. v. Bentolila, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>449, 451, 99 A.3d 317 (2014) (involving privileges from disclosure under the New Jersey Patient Safety Act);<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Christy v. Salem, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 541-45, 841 A.2d 937 (App.Div.2004) (recognizing a qualified privilege from disclosure under a hospital\u2019s peer review privilege). As the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>recently underscored in <em>C.A., there </em>are strong public policies recognized by the Legislature in encouraging the free flow of evaluative communications within a hospital made in an effort to improve future patient care. C.A, <em>supra, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>at 473, 99 A.3d 317. We need not and do not resolve the applicability of these confidentiality laws and public policies, but simply acknowledge that they might well limit the scope of any additional discovery if it had been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Other than his vague suppositions that his circumstances were unfairly considered by the hospital and its representatives, plaintiff has not set forth a proffer, in a sworn affidavit pursuant to <em>Rule 4:46-5 or </em>otherwise, that specifies what information he would intend to elicit from the hospital\u2019s representatives at their depositions. If plaintiff wants to ask them why they did what they did, the reasons are self-evident from the written findings of the Investigating Committee, the hearing panel, and the Board of Trustees \u2014 all of which he already has in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In addition, this is not a case in which antitrust violations have been alleged, which has been true in some of the federal cases where more extensive discovery was permitted. <em>See, e.g., Brader v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp. </em>64 <em>F.3d 869, </em>876 (3d Cir.1995) <em>(\u201cBrader I </em>\u201d) (reversing the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint, in part, because \u201cthe adequacy of a physician\u2019s contentions regarding the effect on competition is typically resolved after discovery, either on summary judgment or after trial\u201d); <em>see also Sugarbaker, supra, </em>187 F.3d at 857 (likewise involving discovery completed of a case involving antitrust claims). Where such colorable antitrust claims are present, the factual and legal complexity of the case may be greater and the justification for plenary discovery may be heightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Plaintiffs complaint, which he has amended multiple times, makes several conclusory allegations that defendants acted \u201cmaliciously\u201d and \u201carbitrarily\u201d in taking away his clinical privileges. As Judge Grispin correctly recognized, the mere inclusion of such normative adverbs within a physician\u2019s complaint does not justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>a free-wheeling discovery mission delving into a hospital\u2019s internal review and investigation of that physician\u2019s poor performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The trial court reasonably concluded that plaintiff already had been provided with enough information to attempt to surmount the statutory immunities. Because the court did not abuse its discretion, we sustain its sensible decision to curtail additional discovery and to disallow depositions of the hospital\u2019s representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> Prior to oral argument on the appeal, we invited counsel, sua sponte, to submit correspondence addressing confidentiality and privacy issues bearing upon the disclosure of certain information in the record. After receiving counsel's submissions, we granted defendants' motion to seal a confidential appendix submitted in connection with the appeal, which contains materials that the trial court had likewise sealed at defendants' request. Plaintiff did not oppose the sealing, provided that if the dismissal of his lawsuit were vacated by this court and the case remanded, the appellate sealing order would not foreclose his evidential use of the contents of the confidential appendix in the trial court. Defense counsel agreed with that proviso. Counsel also agreed that this court is not required under the applicable privacy or confidentiality laws to use initials or pseudonyms in this opinion for plaintiff himself or the names of the persons involved in the hospital's internal review process. However, counsel agreed, and we concur, that the names of the patients who are mentioned in the confidential appendix should be initialized and not revealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\"> Counsel agreed that the findings and recommendations contained within the confidential appendix may be freely quoted and referred to in this court's opinion. <em>See, e.g., Wahi v.
