The shoplifting incident involved the taking of over $1700 of merchandise from the Apple Store at Menlo Park Mall on July 26, 2011. Her co-defendant, Chris Perez, removed various items from the accessory wall and placed them into two large Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (A &amp; F) clothing bags that defendant was holding. Defendant and Perez then left the store without paying for the products.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The appeal requires us to address when it is appropriate for a trial court to rule on the admissibility of other-crimes-or-wrongs evidence under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), when offered to rebut a defendant\u2019s proffered mistake, or lack of intent. The State sought an <em>in limine </em>ruling permitting it to introduce evidence of a previous alleged shoplifting incident at a Target store that involved defendant, Perez and a third person. The evidence was a video of that incident, as well as a recorded statement defendant gave shortly thereafter. The State proposed to use the evidence to rebut a proffered defense, set forth in a letter from defense counsel, that Cordero did not intend to shoplift from the Apple Store, and her removal of the items without paying was a mistake, as she was unaware Perez placed items in the bags.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Judge Joseph Paone declined to hold a formal hearing under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104, or issue a definitive ruling in advance of defendant\u2019s testimony. However, to assist defendant in deciding whether to testify, the judge offered his tentative view that the 404(b) evidence was likely admissible. He did so before opening statements. After the State rested and the judge viewed the video, he reiterated his tentative view.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that the court erred in refusing to issue a definitive ruling. She asserts that the tentative ruling was erroneous and infringed upon her right to testify. She also asserts the prosecutor committed misconduct in his summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We conclude that a trial court, in its discretion, may await the close of a defendant\u2019s ease before determining the admissibility of 404(b) evidence that the State seeks to introduce to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim of lack of intent or mistake. We also discern no error in the court\u2019s decision to offer a tentative view of the issue. Finally, defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct lacks sufficient merit to warrant extended discussion. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The State presented its case through the testimony of two of the Apple Store\u2019s loss prevention officers \u2014 Steve G. Yhap and Felix Melendez. The jury also heard briefly from the Edison Township police patrolman who arrested defendant and Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Yhap and Melendez were in plain clothes while they monitored customers in the store. Yhap testified he saw Perez enter the store, look around while talking on his cell phone, then exit. Shortly thereafter, Perez entered again, accompanied by defendant. She was carrying two large A &amp; F shopping bags. They both walked to one side of the store, where he selected a laptop case. He then walked to the other side of the store, and she followed. Yhap stated, \u201cHe would select items, and, then, he would conceal [them] behind the laptop case. She would, like, raise up her bag, and he would put [them] into the defendant\u2019s bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The two then exited the store without paying for the items. Yhap testified he confronted them, and placed Perez in handcuffs. Meanwhile, defendant placed both bags on the floor and began to walk or jog away, when Melendez stopped her. Yhap and Melen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>dez escorted the two to an office in the rear of the store, where they photographed the items in the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Melendez generally confirmed Yhap\u2019s version of events. Melendez did not specifically state that defendant raised the bags while Perez placed the items inside. However, he confirmed that she carried both bags into and out of the store. Melendez testified that when he and Yhap identified themselves, \u201cshe slowly dropped the bags ... [a]nd, then, she slowly tried to, like, make off \u2014 like\u2014 almost like a slow-motion running.\u201d She was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The loss prevention officers also testified that defendant and Perez made self-incriminating statements. Melendez stated that defendant asked \u201cif there\u2019s any way Chris Perez can just take all the charges, and to just let her go.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She explained that she was \u201cconcerned over opening up her own ... used car sales lot\u201d and feared \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t get the license if she got charged____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Yhap testified that Perez told him \u201cthat he was responsible for it, because she\u2019s trying to open up a car dealership and he doesn\u2019t want her to take the rap for it.\u201d Defense counsel confronted Yhap with his report of the incident, which did not include that statement. Instead, it stated, \u201c\u2018During the interview Christopher Perez admitted to stealing the items for his boss. And since he overheard management calling the local PD he said he wasn\u2019t going to give us any information unless we let them walk.\u2019 \u201d None of the alleged statements by defendant and Perez were recorded, nor did the two sign written statements. Also, Yhap explained that because of his inexperience \u2014 he had worked at Apple for only a few months \u2014 he did not preserve video surveillance of the incident before it was over-written.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As noted above, defense counsel advised the State before trial that defendant intended to assert a defense of mistake or lack of intent. Defense counsel\u2019s pre-trial letter apparently notified the State that Perez intended to testify that he stole the items without defendant\u2019s knowledge. Defense counsel represented that Perez would testify that he ran into defendant in the store; she asked that he take her phone number; so, he handed the bags to her while he did so. In response to defense counsel\u2019s letter, the State filed a motion seeking permission under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) to introduce evidence of the prior alleged shoplifting incident involving Perez and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">However, following jury selection, defense counsel announced that she did not intend to call Perez as a witness, although he was present in the courthouse and available. Nonetheless, the State sought a ruling on the admissibility of the 404(b) evidence, because defense counsel stated that defendant might testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Judge Paone ruled that the evidence could not be introduced during the State\u2019s case in chief. As for whether it could be offered in rebuttal, he stated, \u201cI can\u2019t decide whether 404(b) evidence is admissible until the State[\u2019s] case is done; [and] your case is done.\u201d The judge stated that he would give defendant \u201can indication as to ... whether I believe the evidence would be admissible ... if the testimony were consistent with the facts as represented____\u201d He would do so, to \u201cinform [her] ... decision whether to testify.\u201d However, the judge emphasized that he would not make a 404(b) decision \u201cprematurely.\u201d He inquired whether that was \u201call right\u201d with defense counsel, who responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">After the State rested, counsel revisited the 404(b) issue. Defense counsel proffered that defendant would testify that Perez tried to get defendant\u2019s phone number' \u2014 slightly different from the previous proffer that defendant asked Perez to take her phone number \u2014 and when Perez took out his phone, he handed one of the bags to defendant. They walked out of the store together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>According to the proffer, defendant would testify she was unaware the bag contained unpurchased items. Counsel conceded this version was at odds with the two loss prevention officers\u2019 observation that she held both bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The judge reiterated he could not make a final decision on the admissibility of the 404(b) evidence until he heard defendant\u2019s testimony. However, based on the State\u2019s representation of what the video of the prior incident would show, the judge stated his tentative view that the evidence would be admissible. Defense counsel inquired whether the court\u2019s view would remain the same if defendant simply gave a general denial on the stand. The judge stated he was unsure. Defendant was given until the following day to determine whether she intended to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The next morning, the court decided to view the video of the previous incident in open court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s decision to view the recording also enabled defendant to view it for the first time. The video apparently consisted of various clips from the store cameras, some showing the same actions but from different angles. As described on the record, the video apparently depicted defendant, Perez, and the third person \u2014 who was described as a Target employee \u2014 standing in front of a locked case of video games and gaming consoles. Perez opened the case with a key and placed various items in the shopping cart. At one point, defendant herself placed a laptop case in the cart. There was no obvious attempt to conceal the placement of the items in the cart. Defendant later wheeled the cart around the cashiers\u2019 section of the store, toward the exit doors. She was stopped by loss prevention officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Defense counsel asserted at one point that the video depicted defendant handing currency to Perez, which supported defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>claim that she believed that the third person involved had arranged for defendant to purchase the various items at a discount. She allegedly believed that the items in the cart had been paid for. At one point, while Judge Paone viewed the video, defendant interjected that she intended to pay for the items.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Judge Paone reviewed the four prongs of the test for determining the admissibility of other crimes or wrongs evidence, as set forth in <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 338, 605 A.2d 230 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">1. The evidence of the other crime must be admissible as relevant to a material issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">2. It must be similar in land and reasonably close in time to the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">3. The evidence of the other crime must be clear and convincing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">4. The probative value of the evidence must not be outweighed by its apparent prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\"><em>[Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Before viewing the video, Judge Paone stated, \u201cwithout having the benefit of her testimony ... all I can do is indicate to you that there ... would be a likelihood that ... this evidence would be admissible.\u201d He stated that prong one was likely met because the evidence would refute defendant\u2019s proffered defense that she removed the items from the Apple Store by mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Prong two was met because the prior incident occurred within several months of the charged crimes, and involved defendant\u2019s removal of items from a store without paying, in concert with Perez. He was unpersuaded by defense counsel\u2019s argument that the two incidents were dissimilar. Counsel alleged that in the first incident, there was no apparent effort to conceal the placement of the items in the cart, while in the second, there was an apparent effort to conceal the items placed in the A &amp; F bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">As for prong three, once he viewed the video, Judge Paone stated that there appeared to be clear and convincing evidence that defendant participated in a prior shoplifting. However, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>left open the door for defendant to provide \u201can explanation for that conduct\u201d depicted on the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Judge Paone did not expressly address prong four, balancing the prejudice against the 404(b) evidence\u2019s probative value. However, he implicitly found it was satisfied by indicating, tentatively, that the evidence would be admissible. The court was unpersuaded by defense counsel\u2019s argument that there was less prejudicial evidence \u2014 consisting of Yhap\u2019s and Melendez\u2019s testimony \u2014 to rebut defendant\u2019s proffered defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Defendant declined to testify. The jury deliberated for about half an hour before returning its verdict. Defendant maintained her innocence at sentencing. The court imposed a three-year term of probation, subject to conditions regarding employment and community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Defendant raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">1. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INDICATION THAT THE DETAILS OF A PREVIOUS CHARGE OF SHOPLIFTING WOULD BE ADMISSIBLE IN REBUTTAL IP DEFENDANT TESTIFIED VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO TESTIFY ON HER OWN BEHALF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">2. THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S IMPROPER COMMENT DURING HIS SUMMATION CONSTITUTED PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT WHICH DENIED DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Defendant complains that the court declined to issue a definitive decision on the admissibility of the 404(b) evidence, despite the State\u2019s motion, and defendant\u2019s interest in a firm decision. Defendant argues that the court was mistaken in deciding to await defendant\u2019s testimony, given the defendant\u2019s proffer. Furthermore, defendant argues that the court\u2019s tentative opinion was, in effect, a ruling on the issue, which misapplied the <em>Cofield </em>factors and deprived defendant of her right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">We are unpersuaded. We review a trial court\u2019s application of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Marrero, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>148 <em>N.J. </em>469, 483-84, 691 A.2d 293 (1997). The State proposed to use the other-crimes-or-wrongs evidence to prove intent, and the absence of mistake. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) (stating that other-crimes-or-wrongs evidence \u201cmay be admitted ... as proof of ... intent ... or absence of mistake or accident when such matters are relevant to a material issue in dispute.\u201d). We discern no error in Judge Paone\u2019s determination that a ruling on the admissibility of the 404(b) evidence should await defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Our courts generally disfavor <em>in limine </em>rulings on evidence questions. \u201c[A] trial judge generally should not rule on the admissibility of particular evidence until a party offers it at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Cary, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>343, 352, 230 A.2d 384 (1967). \u201c[M]ost evidence problems are best and most expeditiously settled in the atmosphere and context of the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hawthorne, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>130, 143, 228 A.2d 682 (1967). Pre-trial evidentiary rulings are often made \u201cin the abstract and not in the context of facts adduced at trial\u201d; consequently, \u201c[Requests for such rulings should be granted only sparingly.\u201d <em>Bellardini v. Krikorian, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 464, 537 A.2d 700 (App.Div.1988). \u2018Where ... the decision on the <em>in limine </em>motion itself requires an analysis of evidence yet to be presented or credibility determinations, such motions should ordinarily be denied until a sufficient predicate is established.\u201d <em>Berrie v. Berrie, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>635, 641-42, 600 A.2d 512 (App. Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Moreover, \u201c[i]n the event the trial court addresses [evidentiary] issues in a pre-trial proceeding, the trial court must be sensitive to the need to revisit its pre-trial rulings in light of the developing record at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 46, 705 A.2d 373 (App.Div.1998). \u201cThe record developed at trial may differ from the record developed below on the parties\u2019 motions, perhaps substantially.\u201d <em>State v. Crumb, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 321, 649 A.2d 879 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On the other hand, we recognize that, as a general principle, a trial court retains the discretion, in appropriate cases, to rule on the admissibility of evidence pre-trial. <em>See Hawthorne, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>supra, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>at 142, 228 A.2d 682 (\u201cThis is not to say that under no circumstances can pretrial motions to exclude evidence be made, or that in some situations evidence problems cannot be settled at the pretrial conference. Obviously there is an area in which the judge\u2019s discretion may operate.\u201d). <em>See also Berrie, supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 641, 600 A.2d 512 <em>{\u201cIn limine </em>motions have their place where issues can be eliminated as a matter of law prior to trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In particular, our criminal practice rules expressly direct courts to conduct pretrial hearings \u201cto resolve issues relating to the admissibility of statements by defendant, pretrial identifications of defendant, sound recordings, and motions to suppress.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:9-1(d). \u201c[UJnless otherwise ordered by the court\u201d such hearings are \u201cheld prior to the pretrial conference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cUpon a showing of good cause, hearings as to admissibility of other evidence may also be held pretrial.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In particular, a hearing under <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 386 A.2d 378 (1978), to determine the admissibility of prior convictions, may be held pretrial. <em>State v. Whitehead, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>353, 358, 517 A.2d 373 (1986) (\u201cIn practice, the trial court makes its determination at a hearing held before trial or, if at trial, out of the presence of the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Our Court has cautioned that other-crimes-or-wrongs evidence should not be admitted unless it \u201cis material to a fact genuinely in issue.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 302, 558 A.2d 833 (1989). The fact that intent is an element of the offense does not invariably justify admission of 404(b) evidence to prove intent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">That evidence of prior crimes may have some bearing on motive, intent, plan, absence of mistake, knowledge or identity ... does not automatically warrant its admission. If the defense in the instant case had been alibi or a general denial, these prior convictions might properly have been excluded even though they were relevant to intent. While intent would still be a necessary element of the prosecutor\u2019s ease, the question of motive or intent would not have been raised by the evidence and thus the probative value of the prior offenses would likely be outweighed by their prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\"><em>[State v. Atkins, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>454, 462, 396 A.2d 1122 (1979) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>We have previously held that other-crimes-or-wrongs evidence should be allowed \u201conly to meet an issue relating to an element of the offense which is projected by defendant either before or during trial or is necessarily raised by the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Peltack, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>287, 293, 411 A.2d 1156 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 84 N.J. </em>474, 420 A.2d 1298 (1980). On the other hand, the Court has rejected the suggestion that other-crimes-or-wrongs evidence is inadmissible \u201cto prove a material element of a crime not specifically contested by the defendant nor otherwise established by the evidence.\u201d <em>Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 307, 558 A.2d 833. Such evidence may be necessary to prove an essential element of the offense. <em>Ibid. </em>However, we have held that an assertion in an opening statement does not suffice to \u201copen the door\u201d to 404(b) rebuttal evidence. <em>State v. Anastasia, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 543, 813 A.2d 601 (App.Div.2003) (\u201cOpening statements are not evidential and should not be responded to by \u2018rebuttal\u2019 evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We are persuaded that a trial court may, in its discretion, await the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case before deciding the admissibility of 404(b) evidence to prove intent, or lack of mistake.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That view is supported by persuasive authority. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 939 (2d Cir.1980) (\u201c[I]f the evidence is offered to prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge or intent, the offer of similar acts evidence should await the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case and should be aimed at a specifically identified issue.\u201d);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Benedetto, </em>571 F.2d 1246, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>1249 (2d Cir.1978) (same); <em>Moor v. State, </em>709 P.2d 498, 506 (Alaska Ct.App.1985) (\u201c[Wjhere the prosecution wishes to use the evidence to rebut an anticipated defense, the trial court should seriously consider delaying the offer until the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal in order to ensure that the anticipated defense will in fact be raised.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Awaiting the rebuttal case enables the court to confirm that the defense will actually be offered, and to assess the contours of the defense. That information will inform the court\u2019s decision regarding the relevance of the 404(b) evidence, and whether its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. <em>See Figueroa, supra, </em>618 <em>F.</em>2d at 939 (stating that awaiting until defense rests \u201cenables the trial judge to determine whether the issue sought to be proved by the evidence is really in dispute and, if so, to assess the probative worth of the evidence on this issue against its prejudicial effect\u201d); <em>United States v. Adderly, </em>529 F.2d 1178, 1182 (5th Cir.1976) (\u201cIt is only after the defense is presented that the trial judge can know if intent or knowledge or any exception to the exclusion rule is truly a disputed issue in the trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Applying the foregoing principles, we discern no abuse of discretion in Judge Paone\u2019s decision to postpone a ruling on the admissibility of evidence of the prior alleged shoplifting until defendant testified. The precise contours of defendant\u2019s proposed testimony were unclear. More importantly, it was virtually impossible to predict what defendant might say once subjected to cross-examination. Even a general denial on direct examination would have allowed cross-examination on the basis for the denial. Conceivably, admissions by defendant on cross-examination could con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>stitute less prejudicial evidence of her lack of mistake or intent than the video of the alleged shoplifting at Target. <em>See State v. P.S., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>232, 256, 997 A.2d 163 (2010) (\u201c[I]n assessing the fourth prong [of the <em>Cofield </em>test], courts should consider whether the matter can be proved adequately by other evidence.\u201d); <em>Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 303, 558 A.2d 833 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We also conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in deciding to offer his tentative view on the admissibility of the evidence of the prior incident, based on the limited information available. When the judge proposed to do so before opening statements, defense counsel did not object. Defendant has provided no authority \u2014 and we are aware of none \u2014 that precludes a trial judge from reasonably indicating his or her preliminary views on a factual or legal issue, pending the submission of proofs, legal authority, or argument. Such expressions assist counsel in tailoring their proofs and presentations. However, ultimately, it is the court\u2019s decision \u2014 not its tentative expressions \u2014 that provides a basis for appeal. \u201c[A]ppeals are taken from orders and judgments and not from opinions, oral decisions, informal written decisions, or reasons given for the ultimate conclusion.\u201d <em>Do-Wop Corp. v. City of Rahway, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199, 773 A.2d 706 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">A defendant\u2019s right to testify in his or her own defense is an essential element of due process. <em>State v. Savage, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>594, 626, 577 A.2d 455 (1990). However, the decision whether to testify is a \u201cstrategic or tactical decision to be made by a defendant with the advi[c]e of ... counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Bogus, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 423, 538 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>567, 546 A.2d 497 (1988). Defendant must bear the consequences of her decision in this case. The judge did not infringe her rights by sharing his tentative views on the 404(b) issue, while declining to rule until the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s tentative opinion was, in actuality, a ruling on the merits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>judge was scrupulous in stating that he was withholding a final decision until defendant testified. Consistent with the foregoing, we also decline to address defendant\u2019s arguments that the court erred in its expressed view that the evidence of the prior incident was likely admissible. The court did not definitively rule on its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In any event, defendant has failed to provide us with an adequate record to review a decision on the merits. We have not been provided with the 404(b) evidence that the State sought to introduce \u2014 the video of the prior alleged shoplifting at Target. Consequently, we are unable to review a finding that the evidence was clear and convincing that defendant participated in a prior shoplifting. Nor can we fully assess the potential prejudice from the introduction of such evidence. <em>See R. </em>2:6 \u2014 1(a) (stating that the appendix \u201cshall contain ... such other parts of the record ... as are essential to the proper consideration of the issues\u201d); <em>see also Cmty. Hosp. v. Blume Goldfaden, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 127, 885 A.2d 18 (App.Div.2005) (\u201cNor are we obliged to attempt review of an issue when the relevant portions of the record are not included.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">We briefly address defendant\u2019s argument that she is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor discussed the significance of the crime of shoplifting in his summation. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">Now, the reason we\u2019re here ... is the shoplifting. I know some of you\u2014 shoplifting \u2014 and I wish I\u2019d gotten put on a jury for bank robbery or something maybe a little more dramatic. But, the truth is shoplifting is a plague in our society, as well. And ... there are products that are taken and they aren\u2019t paid for. And, now, those companies are losing money and who is paying for that loss? It\u2019s passed on, then, in increased prices to the consumers. So there\u2019s ... a reason that that\u2019s a crime. There\u2019s a reason that we\u2019re here. And the reason that we\u2019re prosecuting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Defense counsel did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">\u201cProsecutors are afforded considerable leeway in closing arguments as long as their comments are reasonably related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>to the scope of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 82, 727 A.2d 1 (1999). Prosecutorial misconduct is grounds for a reversal where the \u201cmisconduct was so egregious that it deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 727 A.2d 1. \u201c[A]n appellate court must consider (1) whether defense counsel made timely and proper objections to the improper remarks; (2) whether the remarks were withdrawn promptly; and (3) whether the court ordered the remarks stricken from the record and ordered the jury to disregard them.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When reviewing the comments in a closing statement, \u201cthe test is whether the incident is \u2018clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. DiPaglia, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>288, 296, 315 A.2d 385 (1974) (quoting <em>R. </em>2:10-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">If no objection is made to the remarks, they will generally not be deemed prejudicial. <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 727 A.2d 1. Failure to object indicates that defense counsel did not consider them improper at the time they were made, and failure to object also deprives the court of the \u201copportunity to take curative action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 727 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cWithin reasonable limitations, the prosecutor should be permitted to observe the serious social consequences of the crime charged.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>45, 48, 319 A.2d 474 (1974). In <em>Perry, </em>a police officer was on trial for attempted extortion. <em>Ibid. </em>The victim of the extortion was a convicted narcotics dealer. <em>Ibid. </em>In his summation, the prosecutor raised the issue of police corruption and the manner in which a certain class of people was disadvantaged by police corruption. <em>Id. </em>at 46-47, 319 A.2d 474. The Court held that the trial court did not err in allowing the prosecutor to comment on the social consequences of police corruption, particularly since defense counsel did not object, and \u201cthe comments comprised an insignificant portion of a summation....\u201d Id. at 54, 319 A.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Applying these principles, we discern no misconduct, let alone misconduct so egregious that it deprived defendant of a fair trial. To counter the possibility that some jurors might feel that a shoplifting case was not serious enough to warrant their time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>effort, the prosecutor briefly, and without emotion, discussed the societal impact of the crime. Defense counsel did not object to the comments. They were a minor part of the State\u2019s closing. Particularly in light of the substantial evidence of guilt, the comments were not capable of producing an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> Perez pleaded guilty several months before defendant's trial, and was sentenced to a three-year prison term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\"> The record before us does not include the video, defendant's statement, or defense counsel\u2019s letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\"> Defense counsel initially objected to the introduction of defendant's statement, asserting that it was not provided in discovery.
