The order enjoined SEP from accepting any material onto the landfill without the Department\u2019s permission, and authorized the Department to immediately seize control of the landfill to abate an alleged imminent threat to the environment arising from continued emissions of hydrogen sulfide. Pursuant to the emergency order, the Department seized control of the landfill that same day and then undertook or oversaw various remedial measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">For the reasons that follow, we vacate the emergency order, without prejudice, and remand to the Law Division for further proceedings. We do so because, as we explain, infra, the Department exceeded its authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4 by seizing control of SEP\u2019s property without first securing judicial approval. The Department also erred in basing the emergency order retroactively on SEP\u2019s past hydrogen sulfide emissions by applying a statutory emissions standard that did not yet exist until the applicable statute was enacted the same morning the order was issued. Finally, the Department has yet to make the requisite showing to justify an emergency order under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">On remand, the Department shall have the opportunity to present expert and other proof to the trial court to support the Commissioner\u2019s finding that the hydrogen sulfide emissions presented an imminent threat to the environment on June 26, 2013. In turn, SEP shall have the opportunity to present contrary evidence and attempt to meet its heavy burden under the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>to stay the Department\u2019s intervention. The trial court will then engage in appropriate fact-finding that will enable appropriate appellate review, should either or both parties thereafter seek it.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Lastly, we specifically reject SEP\u2019s contention that the new statute on which the Department relied in this case constitutes unconstitutional special legislation, and decline to address SEP\u2019s other constitutionally-based challenges to the Department\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The following facts inform our review. The landfill is a 101-acre site. From the early 1950\u2019s to the late 1970\u2019s, approximately sixty acres were used as a solid waste landfill. The landfill ceased operating in 1977, but was never capped or closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In 2010, SEP purchased the property and planned to cap and close the landfill and install and operate a 10-megawatt solar power generating facility using an array of photovoltaic panels. In October 2011, the Department approved a closure and post-closure plan for the landfill, which required SEP to close and maintain the landfill in accordance with the requirements of the Solid Waste Management Act (SWMA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-1 to - 99.47, and included certain conditions and a plethora of other plans, schedules, and documents (the closure plan).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The closure plan permitted SEP to accept approved fill material onto the landfill in order to create the topography and stratigra-phy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> suitable for installation of large solar panels. Regarding odor control, the closure plan provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">The closure activities shall not cause any ah- contaminant to be emitted in violation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:27-5.2(a). Malodorous emissions shall be controlled by the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>daily cover. In the event that this is not satisfactory, a suitable deodorant as approved and permitted by the Department\u2019s Air [Quality] Program shall be used or the Department shall require a change in the type of recyclable materials accepted. Malodorous solid waste shall be covered immediately after excavation, unloading or redeposition with a minimum of six inches of cover material or approved alternative material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The Department and SEP executed an administrative consent order in October 2011, which memorialized the closure plan (the consent order). If SEP violated any condition, the consent order permitted the Department to terminate the closure plan unilaterally upon written notice to SEP and take immediate action or seek injunctive relief to protect the public health, safety, or welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">By 2012, the Department determined that SEP had not complied with certain conditions of the closure plan. On May 14, 2012, the Department terminated the consent order and notified SEP it intended to revoke the closure plan. On May 18, 2012, the Department ordered SEP to immediately cease receiving fill material onto the landfill and warned it would take immediate legal action if SEP failed to comply. In response, on May 21, 2012, SEP filed a verified complaint and order to show cause (OTSC) in the Chancery Division, seeking to enjoin the Department from taking any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Prior to May 2012, SEP accepted approved fill material onto the landfill, including significant amounts of ground gypsum board, such as wallboard. In November 2012, anaerobic decomposition of the ground gypsum board began generating large volumes of hydrogen sulfide, which emanated from the landfill. Hydrogen sulfide is an odorous, noxious, colorless, poisonous, flammable gas that produces a \u201crotten egg\u201d odor. Hydrogen sulfide is not on the list of New Jersey air toxics, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>7:27-21.1, and the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) has determined that hydrogen sulfide has not been shown to cause cancer in humans, and its possible ability to cause cancer in animals has not been studied thoroughly. Similarly, based on available data, the DOH does not believe there would be long-term adverse health effects from the emission of hydrogen sulfide. However, for some individuals, hydrogen sulfide may cause eye, nose, and throat irritations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>headaches, and nausea, as well as aggravate pre-existing respiratory issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In mid-November 2012, the Department began receiving complaints from individuals living near the landfill about the \u201crotten egg\u201d odor and symptoms of irritated nose, throat, eyes, and skin, nausea, asthmatic events, and headaches.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Department investigated and determined that hydrogen sulfide emanating from the landfill was the cause of the odor.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On December 10, 2012, the parties appeared before the Chancery Division judge who was then handling the case. The judge declined to restrain SEP from accepting fill material onto the landfill or permit the Department from taking any action, finding there was no expert evidence of a toxic concentration of hydrogen sulfide emanating from the landfill. Instead, the judge ordered SEP to properly cover the landfill with soil within forty-eight hours and import and store enough extra soil to thereafter cover any exposed areas at the end of each workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The judge also appointed an environmental expert to determine whether the hydrogen sulfide emissions constituted a threat to public health. The court-appointed expert subsequently issued a report, as did the Department. Both reports concluded that the hydrogen sulfide emissions caused the \u201crotten egg\u201d odor. Although the Department determined the hydrogen sulfide emissions were at improper levels, neither the Department nor the court-appointed expert concluded this posed an imminent threat to the environment or public health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The Department later determined that SEP had not complied with the odor-control provision of the closure plan or with the Chancery judge\u2019s order to properly cover the landfill. Beginning on December 28, 2012, the Department issued numerous administrative orders and notices of civil administrative penalty assessment against SEP. The orders stated that SEP repeatedly violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ed the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-1 to -36, and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:27-5.2(a) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by permitting odors to emanate from the landfill into the outdoor atmosphere in quantities causing air pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The record does not reveal there were any further proceedings in the Chancery Division matter. However, on December 31, 2012, two Township residents filed a class action complaint and OTSC against SEP in the Law Division, alleging the maintenance of the landfill and foul odor emanating therefrom constituted a nuisance that should be enjoined. Thereafter, in January 2013, the Department initiated ambient air monitoring near the landfill to obtain hydrogen sulfide readings. Thirty-minute block readings indicated that hydrogen sulfide was emanating from the landfill at levels exceeding the olfactory threshold of 8 parts per billion (ppb).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time the Department took these readings, there were no standards for hydrogen sulfide emissions in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The Department was joined as a third-party defendant in the Law Division matter, and filed an OTSC seeking a judgment permitting it to immediately seize control of the landfill in order to alleviate the hydrogen sulfide emissions, among other things. The Law Division judge set June 28, 2013 as the return date. Before the return date, on June 26, 2013, Governor Christie signed new legislation governing the closure of over six hundred legacy landfills, codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.1 to -125.9 (the Legacy Landfill Law).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The Legacy Landfill Law established 30 ppb averaged over a thirty-minute period as the standard for hydrogen sulfide emissions from a legacy landfill. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a). Upon the Department verifying complaints about hydrogen sulfide odors and determining the odors emanated from a legacy landfill, the Legacy Landfill Law authorizes the Department to require the owner or operator to take certain corrective action. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(b)(l)-(4). If the Department finds a violation of the hydrogen sulfide standard, it may institute an action or proceeding in the Superior Court for injunctive and other relief. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(c). The court may proceed in a summary manner and grant temporary or interlocutory relief. <em>Ibid. </em>If the court finds a violation, it \u201cshall require the owner or operator of the legacy landfill ... to abate the violation immediately and may require that wastes or materials be mixed, rolled, or covered, or that odor shields be installed to abate the violation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court may also enter \u201ca temporary or permanent injunction that requires that the wastes or materials that are the source of the violation be mixed, covered, or removed,\u201d or assess costs or damages against the violator. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(c)(l)-(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Legacy Landfill Law authorizes the Commissioner to issue an emergency order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">If the commissioner determines that any activity or activities occurring at a legacy landfill or closed sanitary landfill facility <em>present an imminent threat to the environment or public health and safety, </em>the provisions of <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-9.5] shall govern the issuance of and any challenge to, any emergency order issued by the commissioner to the owner or operator of a legacy landfill or closed sanitary landfill facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.9 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-9.5 governs a challenge to an emergency order, and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Any action </em>brought by a person <em>seeking a temporary or permanent stay of an emergency order </em>issued pursuant to this section <em>shall be brought in the Superior Court. </em>Any person bringing such an action shall have the burden of demonstrating, <em>by clear and convincing evidence, </em>that the activity or activities specified in the emergency order as presenting an imminent threat to the environment or public health and safety <em>do not present an imminent threat to the environment or public health and safety.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-9.5(c) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">On June 26, 2013, the Commissioner issued an emergency order pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-9.5(c) and -125.9. The Commissioner asserted that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.9 empowered him to abate violations of the hydrogen sulfide standards established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a). The Commissioner noted there were recorded hydrogen sulfide levels near the landfill exceeding the 30 ppb standard the \u201clast several weeks\u201d and thirty-minute average readings exceeding the 30 ppb standard on June 9 and 15, 2013. The Commissioner declared that \u201cthe [l]andfill\u2019s continued and repeated emission of hydrogen sulfide in violation of the environmental standard established by <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4], combined with [SEP\u2019s] repeated failure to abate and mitigate the environmental harm ... pose[d] an imminent threat to the environment.\u201d The Commissioner enjoined SEP from accepting fill material onto the landfill without the Department\u2019s express permission, and authorized the Department to seize control of the landfill \u201cto take immediate action to abate the escape of hydrogen sulfide from the [landfill].\u201d The Department seized control of the landfill on June 26, 2013, within thirty minutes of when Governor Christie signed the new legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">SEP requested a stay of the emergency order, raising procedural, factual, and legal challenges. The Department denied a stay. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">As a threshold matter, we address the jurisdictional issue. The parties do not dispute that this appeal is from a final state agency action. This court has exclusive jurisdiction to review final decisions or actions of a state agency or officer. <em>R. </em>2:2\u20143(a)(2); <em>see also Infinity Broad. Corp. v. N.J. Meadowlands Comm\u2019n, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>212, 223, 901 A.2d 312 (2006) (holding that \u201c \u2018every proceeding to review the action or inaction of a state administrative agency [is] by appeal to the Appellate Division\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Cent.

This court also has exclusive jurisdiction \u201cwhere it appears to have concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction with a trial court.\u201d Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3.2.1 on <em>R. </em>2:2-3 (2015). Accordingly, where a statute provides for review of agency action by the Superior Court, such as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-9.5(c), \u201cthat designation should be construed to refer to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court rather than a trial division.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">However, \u201cthe Appellate Division retains the discretion, in an appropriate ease, to retain jurisdiction in an appeal from the action of a state agency, but to refer the matter to the Law Division or to the agency for such additional fact-finding as it deems necessary to a just outcome.\u201d <em>Infinity Broad. Corp., supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 227, 901 A.2d 312 (citations omitted). We may remand to the trial court for a plenary hearing where there was no mechanism for a hearing in the agency and no agency record on which to conduct a meaningful review. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of the Pub.

Hughey, 222 N.J.Super. </em>441, 446-47, 537 A.2d 692 (App.Div.1987). We conclude this court has jurisdiction to review the emergency order, but remand to the Law Division for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We first conclude the Commissioner lacked authority to issue the emergency order based on a violation of the hydrogen sulfide standard established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a). Upon the Department verifying complaints and determining the landfill was the source of the hydrogen sulfide odor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(b)(l)-(4) only authorized the Department to require SEP to take certain corrective action. Upon determining that SEP violated the hydrogen sulfide standard, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-125.4(c) only authorized the Department to institute an action in the trial court for injunctive and other relief. Only the court had the authority to order immediate abatement, corrective action, or temporary or permanent restraints. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-125.4(c)(l)-(5). No part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4 authorized the Department or Commissioner to enjoin SEP from receiving fill material onto the landfill or seize the landfill without first obtaining judicial approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. Interstate Recycling, Inc., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>574, 577-78, 632 A.2d 526 (App.Div.1993), on which the Department relies, does not change this result, but rather, supports it. In <em>Interstate Recycling, </em>the operator of a solid waste facility ignored the Department\u2019s notices of violation of the SWMA. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 632 A.2d 526. Following a plenary hearing in the Chancery Division, the court found the operator violated the SWMA, and restrained the operator from operating the facility. <em>Ibid. </em>Ultimately, the court held that the Department\u2019s decision to institute an action in the Superior Court for injunctive relief applied \u201cwhere a state agency charged with environmental enforcement seeks to enjoin repeated violations of the police power statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 632 A.2d 526 (citing <em>N.J.SA </em>13:1E-9(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Here, regardless of when the hydrogen sulfide violations were alleged to have occurred, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-125.4 did not authorize the Commissioner to issue an emergency order <em>coram non judice </em>for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a). The Department could only direct SEP to take certain corrective action, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(b)(l)-(4), or initiate an action in the trial court, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>13:1E-125.4(c). Neither the Commissioner nor the Department had authority to issue an emergency order enjoining SEP\u2019s activities on the landfill or seizing control of the landfill without judicial action merely because of a violation of the hydrogen sulfide standard in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Even if the Commissioner had such authority, any action predicated on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a), or the Legacy Landfill Law in general, constituted an unlawful retroactive application. There was no evidence that SEP violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a) when the statute was actually in effect. Accordingly, using violations against SEP that occurred before the statute became effective required unlawful retroactive application. <em>See James v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>552, 559, 83 A.3d 70 (2014) (applying two-part retroactive analysis for a statute passed five months after the issuance of an insurance policy and two months after the accident prompting litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Generally, the law favors prospective, rather than retroactive, application of new legislation unless a recognized exception applies. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 563, 83 A.3d 70. \u201cThe preference for prospective application of new legislation \u2018is based on [the Court\u2019s] long-held notions of fairness and due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 83 A.3d 70 (quoting <em>Cruz v. Cent. Jersey Landscaping, Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>33, 45, 947 A.2d 1228 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Courts must apply a two-part test to determine whether a statute could be applied retroactively: (1) whether the Legislature intended to give the statute retroactive application; and (2) whether retroactive application \u201cwill result in either an unconstitutional interference with vested rights or a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 50, 679 A.2d 634 (1996) (quoting <em>Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 617, 608 A.2d 895 (1992))).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Under the first part of the <em>James </em>two-part test, there are \u201cthree circumstances that will justify giving a statute retroactive effect: (1) when the Legislature expresses its intent that the law apply retroactively, either expressly or implicitly; (2) when an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>amendment is curative; or (3) when the expectations of parties so warrant.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Under the first circumstance, the Legislature may demonstrate its intent to retroactively apply a statute by stating so in the language of the statute or legislative history, or by implication. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 83 A.3d 70 (citing <em>Gibbons v. Gibbons, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>515, 522, 432 A.2d 80 (1981)). If the legislation expressly states it is to be applied retroactively, such intent should be given effect \u201cabsent a compelling reason not to do so.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Implied intent, however, \u201cmay be found from the statute\u2019s operation when retroactive application is necessary to fulfill legislative intent,\u201d or otherwise \u201c \u2018necessary to make the statute workable or to give it the most sensible interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 522, 432 A.2d 80).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Here, the Legislature expressly provided only one instance where the Legacy Landfill Law would apply retroactively. Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.2 provides that an administrative consent order entered into before or after the law\u2019s effective date shall be voidable for any of the enumerated reasons. Other than this provision, the Legacy Landfill Law does not refer to any retroactive application, and the present tense of the language in the statute generally suggests only prospective application. Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.2 allows pre-existing administrative consent orders to be voidable from particular future actions, this provision does not remotely suggest or imply that any and all hydrogen sulfide emissions that have ever occurred are subject to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Under the second circumstance, a statute may be applied retroactively if it is \u201ccurative,\u201d meaning \u201cdesigned to \u2018remedy a perceived imperfection in or misapplication of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>James, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 83 A.3d 70 (quoting <em>Schiavo v.

The Legacy Landfill Law creates an entirely new body of legislation and does more than \u201c \u2018merely clarif[y] the legislative intent\u2019 \u201d behind the SWMA. <em>James, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 83 A.3d 70 (quoting <em>2nd Roc-Jersey </em>Assocs., <em>supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 731 A.2d 1). Accordingly, the \u201ccurative\u201d justification does not apply to the Legacy Landfill Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Lastly, under the third circumstance, absent clear intent for prospective application, the parties\u2019 expectations may warrant retroactive application of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 83 A.3d 70 (citing <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 432 A.2d 80). In this case, while the Department may have expected retroactive application of the Legacy Landfill Law, SEP clearly had no such expectation and was relying on presenting its case to the Law Division judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Even assuming the Legislature clearly intended retroactive application of the Legacy Landfill Law, or the statute is clearly curative, the court must still consider the second part of the <em>James </em>test addressing whether retroactive application will result in either an unconstitutional interference with vested rights or a manifest injustice. <em>Ibid. </em>This part \u201cfocuses on whether the parties relied on prior law to their detriment, such that retroactive application would cause a deleterious and irrevocable result.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Innes v. Innes, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>496, 511, 569 A.2d 770 (1990) (quoting <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 523-24, 432 A.2d 80)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Regardless of whether retroactive application of the Legacy Landfill Law was justified under one of the three aforementioned circumstances, there is certainly a manifest injury to SEP since it relied on presenting its case to the Law Division judge, as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(c) indeed requires. The issuance of the emergency order based on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a) destroyed that opportunity. Accordingly, even if permissible under part one of the <em>James </em>test, retroactive application still fails part two because it \u201cwould cause a deleterious and irrevocable result.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We, therefore, vacate the emergency order because it was partially based on <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-125.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Although we conclude the Commissioner lacked authority to issue an emergency order pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.9 may have granted the Commissioner such authority in this case, but only if he found that SEP\u2019s activities on the landfill presented an imminent threat to the environment or public health and safety. Here, the Commissioner found that SEP\u2019s failure to abate and mitigate the hydrogen sulfide posed an imminent threat to the environment. However, since the Commissioner could not premise this finding on SEP\u2019s violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.4(a), there had to be expert evidence establishing the hydrogen sulfide emissions presented an imminent threat to the environment on June 26, 2013, and an opportunity for SEP to challenge that evidence. Because the Legacy Landfill Law provides no mechanism for a hearing and there is no record on which we can conduct a meaningful review, we vacate the emergency order and remand to the Law Division for discovery, experts\u2019 reports, and a plenary hearing on the limited issue of whether the hydrogen sulfide emissions presented an imminent threat to the environment on June 26, 2013.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Infinity Broad.

If the Commissioner establishes a prima facie ease, SEP must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the hydrogen sulfide emissions did not present an imminent threat to the environment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-9-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Having reached the above conclusions, we need not address SEP\u2019s constitutional arguments that the Department\u2019s seizure of the landfill deprived SEP of due process and constituted an unlawful taking without just compensation. However, we address, and reject, SEP\u2019s contention that the Legacy Landfill Law constitutes unlawful special legislation aimed at the landfill.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">With any statute, courts presume the law is constitutional. <em>State v.

No statute can authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>unconstitutional practices, and when a statute and the constitution conflict, \u201cthe statute must give way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 628 A.2d 288 (citing <em>Twp. of W.

Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 VII. As our Supreme Court has held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">Lfjrom a constitutional standpoint, a law is regarded as special legislation when, by force of an inherent limitation, it arbitrarily separates some persons, places or things from others upon which, but for such limitation, it would operate. The test of a special law is the appropriateness of its provisions to the objects that it excludes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\"><em>[Secaucus, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 628 A.2d 288 (quoting <em>Town of Morristown v. Woman\u2019s Club of Morristown, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>605, 622, 592 A.2d 216 (1991)) (other citations and internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Court established a three-part test for determining whether a statute constitutes special legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">[W]e first discern the purpose and object of the enactment. We then undertake to apply it to the factual situation presented. Finally we decide whether, as so applied, the resulting classification can be said to rest upon any rational or reasonable basis relevant to the purpose and object of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\"><em>[Vreeland v. Byrne, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>292, 300-01, 370 A.2d 825 (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">For the first step, to determine the rational purpose for a statute under a constitutional challenge, the court is not limited to the stated purpose of the legislation and \u201c \u2018should seek any conceivable rational basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Secaucus, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 494-95, 628 A.2d 288 (quoting <em>Mahwah v. Bergen Cnty. Bd. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>268, 283, 486 A.2d 818, <em>cert. denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1136, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2677, 86 L.Ed.2d 696 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">Each provision of the Legacy Landfill Law had an obvious legitimate purpose. The legislation\u2019s ultimate goal was to protect the public and environment from harm and nuisance related to legacy landfills, sanitary landfill facilities, and closed sanitary landfill facilities. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.1. The overarching goal of limiting public contamination from these facilities is consistent with the Department\u2019s purpose of working for \u201cconservation of the natural resources of the State, the promotion of environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>protection!,] and the prevention of pollution of the environment of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1D-9. All the provisions of the Legacy Landfill Law, which govern management of administrative consent orders, site plan approval, hydrogen sulfide emissions, financial assurance for post-closure activities, escrow for post-closure monitoring costs, licensed professional engineer oversight, remedies in the event of a violation, and the issuance of emergency orders for imminent threats, all serve the general legitimate purpose of preserving the environment. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-125.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Under the second <em>Vreeland </em>step, the court must apply the law to the factual context to determine whether exclusions from the statute\u2019s applications can be identified. <em>Secaucus, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 510, 628 A.2d 288 (Stein, J., dissenting). Whether a statute constitutes special legislation generally turns on \u201c *what is excluded and not what is included.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 628 A.2d 288 (Stein, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Newark Superior Officers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 223, 486 A.2d 305). As the Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">the Legislature has wide discretion in determining the perimeters of a classification, distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude, and an adequate factual basis for the legislative judgment is presumed to exist. We must also be mindful of the strong presumption in favor of constitutionality, and the traditional judicial i\u2019eluctance to declare a statute void, a power to be delicately exercised unless the statute is clearly repugnant to the Constitution. <em>[Paul Kimball Hosp., Inc. v. Brick Twp. Hosp., Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>429, 446-47, 432 A.2d 36 (1981) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The Legacy Landfill Law serves the legitimate governmental purposes described under the first <em>Vreeland </em>step without any exclusions worthy of overriding the presumption in favor of constitutionality. The Legacy Landfill Law generally covers all legacy landfills governed by the SWMA, not just the landfill at issue here. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-125.1. The law\u2019s provisions are not so specific to the landfill or SEP that other communities with legacy landfills could not come within its scope. There are over six hundred legacy landfills across the State subject to the Legacy Landfill Law. Considering the breadth of facilities the law governs, SEP\u2019s contention that it only applies to the landfill lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Finally, under the third <em>Vreeland </em>step, the court must determine whether \u201cthe resulting classification can be said to rest upon any rational or reasonable basis relevant to the purpose and object of the act.\u201d <em>Vreeland, supra, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>at 301, 370 A.2d 825. In this case, the broad classification of a legacy landfill fits within the broad scheme of the SWMA for the Department to manage and regulate the State\u2019s management of solid waste. Classifying a particular type of landfill facility, which is common throughout the State, to be subject to a particularized set of statutes and regulations serves the purpose of allowing the Department to \u201cconserv[e] ... the natural resources of the State, ... promot[e] ... environmental protection!,] and ... prevent! ] ... pollution of the environment of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1D-9. The Legacy Landfill Law rationally and effectively meets these goals, and the classification of legacy landfills is rationally related to the purpose and object of the law and the SWMA in general. Accordingly, we conclude that the Legacy Landfill Law does not constitute unlawful special legislation aimed at the landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Because it is possible that, on remand, the parties may resolve this dispute conclusively on non-constitutional grounds, we decline to address at this time other constitutional issues raised by SEP. As a general rule, our courts strive to avoid reaching constitutional issues unless they are \u201c \u2018imperative to the disposition of litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Comm. to Recall Robert Menendez v. Wells, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>79, 96, 7 A.3d 720 (2010) (quoting <em>Randolph Twp. Ctr., L.P. v. Cnty. of Morris, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>78, 80, 891 A.2d 1202 (2006)). The trial court\u2019s forthcoming factual findings concerning the emergency order may also bear on any constitutional analysis that may be required if the case is litigated further. <em>See J.B. v.

For one thing, it is not yet clear which party may be a future appellant, depending on the outcome of the remand. In addition, the trial court may choose in its discretion to consolidate the present litigation with some or all of the other pending related cases involving the landfill. If such consolidation occurs, it is conceivable that additional parties other than the Department and SEP may seek appellate review at the same time. The uncertain future dimensions of both this case and the related cases makes it preferable that fresh appeals be filed, if in fact further appellate review is sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
