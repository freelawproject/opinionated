The prosecutor\u2019s and the court\u2019s decisions were based solely on defendant\u2019s prior conviction for a weapons crime and ostensibly made in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14 (the Drug Court Statute)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Administrative Office of the Courts\u2019 (AOC) \u201cManual for Operation of Adult Drug Courts in New Jersey\u201d (July 2002) (Manual). On appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">I. THIS COURT MUST [] REVERSE TO CORRECT A SERIOUS ANOM[A]LY IN DRUG COURT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS, TO FOSTER MORE CONSISTENT SENTENCING, AND TO SEE THIS DEFENDANT SENTENCED TO DRUG TREATMENT AND NOT PRISON.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">A. Sentencing under the Criminal Code is offense[-]based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">B. Sentencing in Drug Court remediates the harshness of offense-based sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">C. The standards for admitting Track II defendants are now functionally more restrictive than those for Track I defendants, creating an anomaly and unacceptable disparities in sentencing requiring that they be modified to conform to the current law as other requirements have by practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">D. Defendant, who would qualify for Track I admission but for the fact that he is not charged with crimes sufficiently serious for Track I admission, should be admitted for fulfilling the historically more stringent requirements for Track I admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">E. The facts underlying the prior conviction do not implicate the Manual\u2019s exclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">F. Defendant\u2019s participation in the Drug Court would not present danger to the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">In response, the State argues the court properly rejected defendant\u2019s Drug Court application because the court\u2019s decision was \u201cconsistent with current Drug Court sentencing guidelines as outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14 and in the [ ] Manual\u201d as defendant was \u201cnot legally eligible for Drug Court special probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">The parties\u2019 dispute required us to consider their arguments in light of the record, as well as the history of New Jersey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>successful Drug Court program, the application of the Manual\u2019s guidelines, and the Drug Court statute as recently amended. Having done so, we reverse the January 15, 2014 order and remand the matter to the Law Division for further consideration of defendant\u2019s application consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">At the time of his April 2013 Drug Court application, defendant was twenty-five years old, had a history of several controlled dangerous substance (CDS) offenses and was the subject of four pending, separate indictments. In 2012, a Gloucester County Grand Jury returned one indictment, charging defendant with third-degree possession of CDS (oxycodone), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(1); another indictment, charging him with two counts of third-degree possession of CDS, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(1) (oxycodone and heroin); and a third, charging him with third-degree possession of CDS (cocaine), <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-10(a)(1). In 2013, a Burlington County Grand Jury returned an indictment, charging him with two counts of third-degree theft by unlawful taking, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-3(a); one count of fourth-degree hindering apprehension, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-3(b)(4); and one count of third-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2(a)(1). He had also been charged with the disorderly person offense of possession with intent to use a hypodermic syringe, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:36-6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Defendant\u2019s criminal history included crimes related to his drug use. In 2007, he was convicted of possession of CDS (cocaine), sentenced to probation, which he subsequently violated. The reviewing judge found defendant violated probation because he was charged with possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-5(b) and imposed a term of imprisonment. The arrest that led to the charge occurred on December 1, 2008, while police officers were conducting a surveillance of an area in Camden known for its open drug activity. Police observed defendant arrive by car, driven by another, and engage in a suspected drug transaction. When police detained defendant, he stated a gun was in the vehicle, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>it did not belong to him. The police located the gun, determined it had been stolen and charged defendant with possession of the handgun and hollow point bullets, as well as receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">According to police, while defendant and the driver were waiting to be processed, defendant tried to convince the driver to take responsibility for the weapon as defendant was concerned he could get a lengthy prison term because of his prior record, while the driver would not receive as harsh a sentence because he had no prior convictions. Consequently, police charged defendant with witness tampering, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:28-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Defendant pled guilty to a second-degree weapons possession offense and was sentenced, in the third-degree range, to a three-year prison term, subject to a one-year period of parole ineligibility, pursuant to the \u201cGraves Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6, -6.2. The remaining charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Following release from prison, defendant committed three CDS offenses prior to the return of the Gloucester and Burlington County indictments. Each of these offenses was remanded to municipal court for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">While awaiting disposition, defendant was held in the Burlington County jail, where he entered into substance abuse counselling programs, including Narcotics Anonymous. He posted bail on November 8, 2013 and applied for admission to Drug Court in Gloucester County. Defendant asserts his attorney secured a commitment to consolidate the Burlington County charges with the Gloucester County charges, if he were admitted into Drug Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">When defendant\u2019s appeal of the prosecutor\u2019s denial of his request for Drug Court admission in Gloucester County was considered, defendant was not only receiving counselling, but also employed as an outreach counselor for a drug treatment facility in Florida. The Gloucester County prosecutor rejected defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>application, citing his prior weapons offense, and defendant appealed to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On January 15, 2014, the court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and denied defendant\u2019s appeal. In a written decision, the judge reviewed the criteria for admission into Drug Court under the Drug Court Statute and the Manual. He found \u201cdefendant is a Track Two[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] applicant because he [wa]s charged with 3rd degree crimes for which there are no mandatory extended terms of imprisonment.\u201d However, the court also found \u201c[t]his defendant was previously convicted of the crime of possession of a handgun, and is therefore ineligible for the Drug Court program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">This <em>appeal </em>followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u201cDrug Courts are specialized courts within the Superior Court that target drug-involved \u2018offenders who are most likely to benefit from treatment and do not pose a risk to public safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Meyer, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>421, 428-29, 930 A.2d 428 (2007) (quoting <em>Manual, supra, </em>at 3). The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the positive role Drug Courts play in our society. <em>State v. Clarke, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>166, 174, 1 A.3d 607 (2010) (citing <em>Meyer, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 429, 930 A.2d 428).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">[Drug C]ourts address the seemingly intractable social problem presented by the scourge of drugs that has devastated countless families and is the source of so many collateral crimes. What distinguishes Drug Courts from other courts is the oversight and personal involvement of the [D]rug [C]ourt judge in the treatment process. A team approach is a distinctive feature of Drug Court. The judge leads court staff, probation officers, treatment counselors, substance abuse evaluators, and the prosecutor and defense attorney to monitor a participant's recovery. Participants in [D]rug [Cjourt programs are subject to intensive supervision, fi-equent drug testing, and regular court appearances, combined with treatment and recovery services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Drug Courts have achieved notable success. Within three years of finishing a [DJrug [Cjourt program, only fourteen percent of [DJrug [Cjourt graduates were arrested for new indictable crimes. In comparison, a fifteen-state study found that 67.5 percent of offenders released in 1994 had been rearrested within three years of release. Ninety-five percent of drug tests taken by New Jersey program participants produced negative results, and at the time of graduation, ninety-three percent of the participants were employed. Drug [Cjourt programs are credited with helping participants give birth to drug-free babies and regain custody of their children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">Additionally, the State realizes substantial cost-savings through [DJrug [Cjourt programs. The average cost per year to house an inmate in state prison is $34,218 compared to $17,266 to give that same offender the rehabilitative services of Drug Court, including six months of in-patient treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">Those few statistics show the obvious benefits of our [DJrug [Cjourt programs![<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>[Meyer, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 429-30, 930 A.2d 428 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>The </em>executive and legislative branches have also recognized the success and value of the Drug Court program. <em>See </em>Preamble to Executive Order No. 88 dated November 28, 2011, \u201cCreation of the Governor\u2019s Task Force on Recidivism Reduction,\u201d 44 <em>N.J.R. </em>3(a) (January 3, 2012) (\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s Drug Court ... helps to achieve the overriding goal of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice to protect public safety by reducing the incidence of crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>....\u201d) and the legislative history of the 2012 amendments to the Drug Court Statute discussed, <em>infra,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s application of the Drug Court Statute and Manual to a defendant involves a question of law. \u201cOur standard of review on legal issues is de novo and we owe no deference to the trial court\u2019s \u2018interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established faets[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 141, 19 A.3d 479 (App.Div.2011) <em>(quoting Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The Drug Court Statute creates a \u201cspecial probation\u201d as compared to regular probation, which has long been an authorized disposition under the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (Code), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-1 to 2C:104-9. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-2(b)(2); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In general terms, a regular probationary sentence is typically imposed for third- or fourth-degree offenses, which do not contain a specific provision requiring a state prison sentence. For such offenders with no prior criminal record, there is a presumption against incarceration, and for such offenders with a prior record, there is no presumption either for or against a custodial sentence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(e); <em>Meyer, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 433 n. 5, 930 A.2d 428. Where there is no presumption either for or against incarceration, the court must \u201cweigh the aggravating and mitigating factors enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a) and (b)\u201d in making the \u201cin-out\u201d decision, that is, whether to impose a state prison sentence or a probationary sentence. <em>Clarke, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 1 A.3d 607; <em>Meyer, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 433 n. 5, 930 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">As we recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">For crimes of the first or second degree, there is a presumption of imprisonment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(d), which is rarely overcome. <em>State v. Soricelli </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>525, 532-34 [722 A.2d 95] (1999). Thus, for such offenders, a regular\u2019 probationary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sentence is almost never appropriate under the Code\u2019s general sentencing provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">Special probation is another authorized disposition under the Code. It is not contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-2(b)(2), but in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14. The term \u201cspecial probation\u201d first appeared in that section when it was amended in 1999. Meyer; <em>supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 434 [930 A.2d 428] [T]hat amendment, together with subsequent amendments, set special probation apart from regular probation, rendering each a separate and distinct sentencing disposition authorized by the Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Special probation is designed to divert otherwise prison-bound offenders into an intensive and highly specialized form of probation designed to \u201caddress in a new and innovative way the problem of drag-dependent offenders caught in a never-ending cycle of involvement in the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434-35 [930 A.2d 428], Thus, the Legislature created special probation as a disposition aimed specifically at prison-bound offenders, who would not be eligible for regular probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\"><em>[State v. Bishop, </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 539-40, 60 A.3d 806 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>14, 76 A.3d 533 (2013).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The basic objective of the Drug Court Statute \u201cis to allow deserving prison-bound addicted offenders the opportunity for \u2018special probation,\u2019 an opportunity to recover from the throes of their addiction and the cycle of their involvement with the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Meyer, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 428, 930 A.2d 428. It \u201cdoes not suggest that addicted offenders whose crimes do not mandate a prison sentence and who are eligible for probation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-1 should not be accorded the same judicial resources to spur their rehabilitation as those who are facing incarceration.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u201cSurely, if [a] defendant is to receive a probationary term conditioned on in-patient treatment and intensive supervision, it is preferable th[e] defendant be monitored within a specialized court with personnel who have the particularized skills and training to maximize the prospect of the offender\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>For that reason the Court created a second track for admission to \u201cspecial probation\u201d as defined in the Manual for \u201cnon-prison bound offenders.\u201d <em>Manual, supra, </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The procedures for admission to and participation in Drug Court is set forth in the Manual because \u201cDrug Courts are a creature of the judiciary____\u201d <em>Clarke, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 174, 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>A.3d 607 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Requirements for admission to Drug Court are clearly defined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">The [ ] Manual outlines two separate tracks for admission into Drug Court. The applicant must either meet the requirements for special probation pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14, [T]rack [O]ne, or otherwise be eligible under other sections of the Code of Criminal Justice[, T]rack [T]wo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Under the first track, to meet the requirements for special probation, the applicant must have committed a crime that is subject to a presumption of incarceration or a mandatory prison term, and the judge must find that the applicant satisfies nine separate factors. A presumption of imprisonment applies to an applicant who is charged with a first or second-degree offense. If the applicant is successful in meeting the requirements for admission under [T]rack [O]ne, the judge will then impose a five-year period of special probation. Admission under this track is generally obtained with the prosecutor\u2019s consent. If the prosecutor does not consent, the trial judge may only admit the applicant under [T]rack [O]ne if the judge finds a gross and patent abuse of prosecutorial discretion.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The second track permits applicants to be admitted into Drug Court under the general sentencing provisions of the Code of Criminal Justice. An applicant is eligible for Drag Court sentencing under this track if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">a. the person has a drug or alcohol dependence, as determined by a diagnostic assessment and substance abuse treatment and monitoring is likely to benefit the person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">b. the person has not been previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent for, and does not have a pending charge of murder, aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter, robbery, kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault, or a similar crime under the laws of any other state or the United States; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">c. the person did not possess a firearm at the time of the present offense and has no history of possession of a firearm during an offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">d. no danger to the community is likely to result from the person being placed on probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">[Id. at 174-76,1 A.3d 607 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">Based on the quantifiable success of Drag Courts, the Legislature broadened the scope of special probation through amendments to the statute adopted in 2012. <em>L. </em>2012, c. 23. Evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intention to liberalize admission to Drug Court is found in the legislative history for the 2012 amendments. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>example, the Legislature contemporaneously enacted <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14.1 and -14.2, effective July 1, 2013, which permit a court to sentence a qualified offender under the Drug Court Statute even if the defendant does not seek admission, and even if the defendant is a third-degree offender, who had been previously \u201cconvicted of a crime subject to the presumption of imprisonment or that resulted in imposition of a State prison term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Also, as to the Drug Court Statute itself, a Senate committee stated the statute was being amended \u201cin order to permit additional offenders who may benefit from the program to be diverted into the program instead of being sentenced to a term of incarceration ____[by giving] a court ... greater discretion to place the person on special probation, even if one or more of the enumerated discretionary factors was not met by a particular defendant.\u201d <em>Senate Budget and Appropriation Committee, Statement to S. 881 </em>(April 3, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The 2012 amendments directly altered eligibility requirements and procedures <em>for </em>consideration of Track One defendants. For example, prior to the amendments, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14(c) granted the prosecutor the right to object to an otherwise qualified defendant\u2019s entry into Drug Court and, absent a showing of \u201cgross and patent abuse of [the prosecutor\u2019s] discretion,\u201d a court could not override that objection and admit the defendant to Drug Court. Subsection (c) was deleted in the 2012 amendments. Also, the amendments removed the express ban on admission of those defendants who committed either second-degree robbery or burglary offenses. <em>L. </em>2012, c. 23, S.881, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Despite the Legislature\u2019s clear intention to broaden Drug Court access, the Manual has not similarly been modified and remains as originally released in 2002. As a result, its admission criteria for Track Two candidates continues to bar defendants who have a criminal history that include convictions for second-degree robbery involving a firearm, even though under the statute as amended an offender who is at present sentenced for the very same crime may be admitted to Drug Court if otherwise qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Defendant argues \u201c[e]ligibility for admission for defendants charged with less serious crimes is now ... more stringent than for those charged with more serious crimes,\u201d which is \u201cinconsistent with the sentencing philosophy of the Criminal Code and visits an injustice upon this class of defendants.\u201d He claims the court\u2019s categorical denial of his request for Drug Court admission was contrary to the clear language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14, especially in light of the recent amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">As noted, defendant was barred from admission to Drug Court based on the Manual\u2019s requirements for Track Two admission, which prohibits defendants who possessed a firearm \u201cat the time of the present offense [or if they have a] <em>history of possession of a fireman during [the commission] of an offense.\u201d Manual, supra, </em>at 16 (emphasis added). This condition is more restrictive than the similar requirement for Track One offenders who commit a more serious offense. <em>Ibid. </em>Under the statute, a Track One offender is eligible for Drug Court if \u201cthe person did not possess a firearm <em>at the time of the present offense and did not possess a firearm at the time of any pending criminal charge.\u201d Id. </em>at 11 (emphasis added). A more serious offender may, therefore, have a prior conviction for a weapons charge and still be eligible for Drug Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Drug Courts were created by the Supreme Court through a directive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These specialized courts are operated as \u201ccreatures\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>our court system. The question we are therefore confronted with is whether the Legislature\u2019s recent amendments to the statute suggest a need for amendments to the admission criteria for Track Two eligibility. We believe there is such a need.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The decision to alter or otherwise deviate from a directive\u2019s requirements because of a legislative enactment involves a balancing of the powers reserved to each branch of government. The need for striking a balance is clear from our constitution\u2019s recognition: \u201cThe Supreme Court shall make rules governing the administration of all courts in the State and, <em>subject to the law, </em>the practice and procedure in all such courts.\u201d <em>N.J.

VI, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 3 (emphasis added). \u201c \u2018[S]ubject to law' mean[s] substantive law, such as legislation and the common law, as opposed to pleading and practice.\u201d <em>In re P.L. 2001, Chapter 362., </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>368, 380, 895 A.2d 1128 (2006) (citing <em>Winberry v.

However, \u201c[t]here is no question that the three branches of government do not stand in isolation from each other[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 512, 868 A.2d 1034, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>[i]n the twilight area between practice and procedure and substantive law, [the Supreme Court] in the spirit of comity has attempted to accommodate legitimate expressions of legislative authority and has shared responsibility with the Legislature in key areas of joint concern. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 to -22, <em>R. </em>3:28, and <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Leonardis, </em>[73] 73 <em>N.J. </em>[360, 374-76, 375 A.2d 607 (1977) ] (illustrating legislative and judicial cooperation in creation and implementation of pretrial intervention program \u2014 diversionary program for first-time, non-violent offenders). <em>[In re P.L. 2001, Ch. 362, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 380 n. 1, 895 A.2d 1128].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Illustrative of this point is the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Leonardis, supra, </em>about the overlapping nature of the Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI). The late Justice Morris Pashman pointed out that judicial review must always be available to \u201ccheck only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness,\u201d which might occur in the administration and implementation of joint judicial-legislative programs involving the administration of justice, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">[o]ur experiences with admission procedures are limited. We intend to continue our supervisory role over the operation of this program and the legal determinations of reviewing courts and local officials.... By their very nature, the guidelines place primary responsibility for evenhanded administration of the programs in the hands of the prosecutors and the program directors. Judicial review should be available to check only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness. [<em>Leonardis, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 383-84, 375 <em>A.</em>2d 607 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The authority to alter existing substantive law, court rules and directives rests firmly with the Legislature and the Supreme Court. <em>In re State in Interest of A C., </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 84, 278 A.2d 225 (App.Div.1971). \u201cAs an intermediate appellate tribunal, we adhere to the decision of our Supreme Court in those cases. Any departure should be undertaken \u2018by the court of last resort, and not by the Appellate Division.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Casale v. Hous. Auth., City of Newark, </em>42 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 62, 125 A.2d 895 (App.Div.1956)). Although the Supreme Court has unfettered authority to issue and modify its directives, we discern unfairness in this case, especially in light of the legislature\u2019s obvious intention to liberalize admission to Drug Court based on the success of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Modification of the Manual\u2019s guidelines is especially appropriate in a case such as the one before us that involves a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>disparate treatment in sentencing. \u201c \u2018Th[e] Court often has taken affirmative steps to ensure that sentencing and disposition procedures, whether authorized by statute or court rule, will not produce widely disparate results for similarly situated defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Palma, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>584, 593, 99 A.3d 806 (2014) (quoting <em>State v. Moran, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>311, 326-27, 997 A.2d 210 (2010)). The disparity in this case is highlighted by the fact that now offenders convicted of second-degree robbery armed with a non-deadly weapon are permitted to enter Drug Court while Track Two offenders like defendant, who recently committed a third-degree drug offense and years earlier had been convicted of a weapons charge are barred entry. It is simply not fair that defendant\u2019s record would disqualify him under one track but not the other. There is no valid policy consideration to support that result and the distinction subverts, rather than supports, the policy to admit drug-addicted offenders into the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Our opinion is supported by the Legislature\u2019s decision to remove the prosecutor\u2019s ability to object to a defendant\u2019s admission to Drug Court subject only to proof that his or her decision was a patent or gross abuse of discretion. By its action, the Legislature clearly evinced an intention to rely on a judge\u2019s discretion and ability to better determine admission without continuing the prosecutor\u2019s right to veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Our decision does not, however, result in defendant\u2019s automatic admission to Drug Court; it only allows his application to be considered despite his earlier weapons offense. On remand, the court must now consider relevant factors specific to defendant, guiding Drug Court admission, including his dangerousness to the community while on probation, <em>Manual, supra, </em>at 16 (A person is eligible if \u201cno danger to the community is likely to result from the person being placed on probation.\u201d); whether he is in fact drug dependent; and defendant\u2019s entire criminal history, including his weapons conviction, along with any other factor impacting this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Reversed and remanded.
