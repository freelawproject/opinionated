Mickens, Jr., was injured on January 8, 2010, when his automobile was struck by a pick-up truck owned by defendant City of Elizabeth and operated by defendant Timothy Misdom. The parties stipulated defendants\u2019 liability and, at the trial\u2019s conclusion, the jury found a permanent injury, as necessitated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d), and awarded plaintiff $2,400,000 in damages for his disability, impairment, loss of enjoyment of life, and pain and suffering. The trial judge later denied defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial or remittitur, and defendants now appeal, arguing, among other things, the award was so grossly excessive as to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice. In deferring to the jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence and the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>case,\u201d we affirm the judge\u2019s determination that, although high, the verdict was not shocking to \u201cthe judicial conscience,\u201d let alone the judge\u2019s own conscience derived from his experiences as a trial judge and practicing attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In examining the issues presented, we first briefly consider the evidence regarding the nature of the accident, plaintiffs injuries, and their impact on his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The jury heard that plaintiff was forty years of age when the accident occurred. Plaintiff was sitting in his parked vehicle when, as he \u201cleaned over as though to retrieve something from the floor of the front passenger seat,\u201d he felt an impact caused by defendants\u2019 pick-up truck, which had backed into and moved plaintiffs vehicle ten to fifteen feet from its former stopped position. The trial judge noted in his thorough written decision, which memorialized the denial of defendants\u2019 new trial motion, that photographs admitted in evidence did not reveal \u201csevere damage\u201d to either plaintiffs vehicle or defendants\u2019 truck, although the photographs depicted \u201cvisible damage to [plaintiffs] vehiclef\u2019s] rear end.\u201d When the police arrived, plaintiff declined medical attention but later went to an emergency room because of lower back pain. He was released the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Plaintiff consulted with a chiropractor a few days later. Treatment provided no relief, and the chiropractor ordered an MRI study, which was conducted on March 1, 2010, and which revealed a herniated disc at <em>L4-5. </em>Plaintiff consulted a physician for pain management, and a neurosurgeon soon recommended disc-removal surgery, which was performed on August 5, 2010. According to the trial judge\u2019s written decision, plaintiff testified \u201cthat the surgery helped somewhat,\u201d but \u201che lives with persistent back pain and discomfort[.]\u201d Plaintiff also testified that: he is employed as \u201ca warehouse worker which [ ] involve[s] lifting and moving boxes around\u201d; he missed four weeks of work, but returned to work because he could not afford to miss any additional time; at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>end of each work day \u201chis back bothers him significantly, and he cannot do the things he used to do around the house or the things he did recreationally\u201d; and he \u201ccan do very little except rest on evenings and weekends so he can try to keep working to support\u201d his wife and child. By the time of trial, three years had elapsed from the date of the surgery with no change in plaintiffs daily pain, discomfort and limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Plaintiffs wife, chiropractor and neurosurgeon also testified, the latter opining that accidents causing even \u201cminor physical damage,\u201d as suggested by the photographs of plaintiffs vehicle, are not necessarily indicative of the extent of an occupant\u2019s injuries; he concluded that plaintiff sustained a permanent injury as a result of the collision. As described by the trial judge, the neurosurgeon testified that \u201cimmediately following the impact the herniated disc may not have been full blown at that time, but [ ] the impact caused the physical injury that evolved to the complete herniation depicted on the MRI less than 60 days post impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Defendants called a biomechanical engineer who testified that the herniated disc did not result from the collision, which he viewed as minor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The engineer was not a physician and lacked the expertise to make a medical diagnosis. Moreover, as the trial judge noted, the engineer \u201cconceded on cross-examination that studies he relied upon to support his opinion [about the impact] did not involve individuals who were stretched over to the side as [plaintiff] was in this collision,\u201d and the engineer conceded \u201cdifferent body types will respond differently to trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In addition, defendants elicited testimony from an orthopedic surgeon, who recognized plaintiff had a herniated disc and sustained a permanent injury. This expert also testified that the surgery was necessary and plaintiff will have problems with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>he will have to live. Although the expert testified it was \u201cunlikely\u201d the herniated disc resulted <em>from </em>the collision in question, he could not otherwise account for how it occurred and acknowledged plaintiff had no history of prior back injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In appealing the $2,400,000 judgment entered in plaintiffs favor and the order denying their motion for a new trial or remittitur, defendants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">I. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY ON THE AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITION CONSTITUTED REVERSIBLE ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">II. THE JURY VERDICT AWARDING [PLAINTIFF] $2.4 MILLION DOLLARS IS SO GROSSLY EXCESSIVE AS TO DEMONSTRATE PREJUDICE^] PARTIALITY OR PASSION AND CONSTITUTES A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">III. THE JURY\u2019S DETERMINATION THAT [PLAINTIFF] SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL PERMANENT INJURY WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">We find insufficient merit in Points I and III to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also reject Point II for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"A8H\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">The legal principles that guide consideration of the quantum of a jury award were recently thoroughly examined by our Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Court. Although these principles are easily restated, their application \u2014 as the Court observed in <em>He v. Miller, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>230, 235, 24 A.3d 251 (2011) \u2014 presents \u201cprofound difficulties that our trial courts and appellate tribunals continue to encounter as they seek to understand and apply the concepts surrounding remittitur.\u201d The matter at hand presents an interesting counterpoint to the result ultimately<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reached in <em>He v. Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We first turn to the legal principles outlined in <em>He v. Miller:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">The power of remittitur is not to be exercised lightly ... because we repose enormous faith in the ability of juries to equate damages with dollars to \u201cmake the plaintiff whole, so far as money can do.\u201d We rely on juries to perform that task while recognizing that \u2018lajssigning a monetary value to pain-and-suffering compensation is difficult because that kind of harm is \u2018not gauged by any established graduated scale.\u2019 \u201d But a jury\u2019s authority is not unbounded and we have explained that \u201c[o]ur role in assessing a jury verdict for excessiveness is to assure that compensatory damages awarded to a plaintiff \u2018encompass no more than the amount that will make the plaintiff wholef]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">[207 <em>N.J. </em>at 248-49, 24 A.3d 251 (citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">In light of these important policies, the Court reiterated the familiar test that a trial judge should not disturb a jury award unless \u201c \u2018so disproportionate to the injury and resulting disability as to shock the conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 24 A.3d 251 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 604, 379 A.2d 225 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">These principles continue to guide our courts but they represent only a starting point in answering the difficult question about when a verdict is \u201cso disproportionate\u201d or \u201cshock[ing] [of] the conscience\u201d as to warrant a trial judge\u2019s intervention because no two plaintiffs and no two juries are the same. A trial judge must begin \u201cwith the presumption that [the] verdict is correct\u201d and \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff in evaluating whether remittitur is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 24 A.3d 251; <em>see also Johnson v. Scaccetti, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>256, 281, 927 A.2d 1269 (2007); <em>Baxter, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 379 A.2d 225. In addition, the trial judge must be mindful that the task \u201cis not to bring a generous, but manifestly supportable, verdict down into a range more to [the judge\u2019s] liking,\u201d but only \u201cto reduce a verdict that is \u2018shocking\u2019 and award in its place \u2018the highest figure that could be supported by the evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>He v. Miller, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 250, 24 A.3d 251 (quoting <em>Fertile v. St. Michael\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>481, 500, 779 A.2d 1078 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">When concluding a verdict is excessive, a trial judge must explain how that conclusion and the remitted amount were derived from the record. <em>Ibid.; Fertile, supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 501, 779 A.2d 1078. In this regard, the Supreme Court has endorsed a trial judge\u2019s consideration of \u201cother verdicts\u201d while cautioning \u201cthat in doing so \u2018[the trial judge] must give a factual analysis of how the award is different or similar to others to which it is compared.\u2019 \u201d <em>He v. Miller, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 24 A.3d 251 (quoting <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 927 A.2d 1269).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The Court in <em>He v. Miller </em>also expounded on the role played by appellate courts in reviewing a remittitur order. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court emphasized that \u201cthe jury is the bedrock of our system of justice,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>but that the trial judge has the limited power to intervene when comparable verdicts and the judge\u2019s own \u201cfeel of the case\u201d\u2014 because \u201ctrial judges see much that juries do not\u201d \u2014 move \u201c[t]he court\u2019s own informed conscience\u201d to the belief that the verdict is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>disproportionate and shocking. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 24 A.3d 251. Consequently, the Court emphasized that appellate panels \u201cmust ... recognize that their mere disagreement\u201d with the judge\u2019s evaluation \u201cwill not suffice,\u201d and they \u201cmust\u201d instead \u201cpay deference to the trial court\u2019s \u2018feel of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 24 A.3d 251 (quoting <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 282, 927 A.2d 1269).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Interesting is the difference of opinion as to the application of the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case\u201d and the judge\u2019s subjective, personal experiences found in the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>He v. Miller. </em>Justice Albin, whose dissenting opinion was joined by the Chief Justice, observed that the majority had \u201cexalt[ed] the trial judge\u2019s \u2018feel of the case\u2019 above the jury\u2019s duty to decide for itself the quantum of damages ... [and] undermines\u201d the obligation of appellate courts \u201cto review remittitur motions ... on the objective evidence of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 24 A.3d 251 (dissenting opinion). And, with respect to the use of \u201csubjective, personal experiences,\u201d the Court\u2019s dissenting members referred to Chief Justice Hughes\u2019s opinion in <em>Baxter </em>in observing that \u201chowever much trial and appellate judges are affected by their subjective prejudices and predispositions and life experiences, those \u2018individualized propensities of mind\u2019 must somehow be merged into \u2018an amalgam of common judicial experience related to the doing of justice,\u2019 \u201d and they must \u201c \u2018resist the natural temptation to substitute their judgment for that of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 24 A.3d 251 (quoting <em>Baxter, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 596-97, 379 A.2d 225). In a nutshell, it is not the trial judge\u2019s conscience but a collective \u201cjudicial conscience\u201d that guides a trial judge\u2019s examination of a jury\u2019s damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">This, however, was a minority view, and the majority opinion makes clear that the trial judge\u2019s experience \u2014 in <em>He v. Miller, </em>the trial judge had been on the bench \u201cfor only a few months\u201d but was an experienced practitioner of twenty-two year's, <em>id. </em>at 256, 24 A.3d 251 (majority opinion) \u2014 outweighed the many more decades of collective experience of the appellate judges who objectively reviewed the remittitur order. That is, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>determined that the trial judge\u2019s subjective view that he \u201chad never encountered a like\u201d verdict for such a case \u2014 which included the judge\u2019s identification of two other trials over which he had presided since being appointed to the bench within the year \u2014 was entitled to \u201csignificant\u201d weight, <em>ibid., </em>and apparently the greater experience of three appellate judges entitled to little or no weight. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s decision in <em>He v. Miller </em>\u2014 that the case was more akin to \u201ca spectrum of jury awards ... ranging] between $40,000.00 and $200,000.00,\u201d 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 243, 24 A.3d 251 \u2014 was dispositive<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> apparently because he presided over the trial, even though the judge\u2019s past experiences cannot possibly be what our courts have long referred to as a trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The utilization of the trial judge\u2019s past personal experiences and subjective views is quite problematic, not only because judges differ,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and not only because no two similar experiences are quite the same,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but also because the process of using these personal experiences defies greatly valued attributes of our judicial system, namely, a party\u2019s right to discovery and the right to confront and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>cross-examine information used to adjudicate the dispute. Because of <em>He v. Miller, </em>a judge may simply rely on past experiences without permitting the parties the right to inquire further or test the sufficiency or accuracy of those experiences. In that way, the process was transformed from an objective to a subjective examination. This interesting problem essentially boils down to Justice Albin\u2019s criticism in his dissent when, in referring to <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 927 A.2d 1269, he emphasized that \u201c[i]t is not the [trial] judge\u2019s personal conscience but <em>the judicial conscience </em>that controls.\u201d <em>He v. Miller, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, 24 A.3d 251 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In any event, the <em>He v. Miller </em>majority opinion is that which guides our disposition of this appeal, and we view that decision as commanding deference to the trial judge\u2019s \u201csubjective, personal experiences.\u201d With this as the framework to which we are bound, we turn to the trial judge\u2019s decision, although we first examine what traditionally constituted the judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case\u201d before considering his subjective view and personal past experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In describing his \u201cfeel of [this] case,\u201d the judge described the considerable educational background of the jury, his view that the jurors were not \u201crustic[s] in the style of Norman Rockwell,\u201d citing <em>DeHanes v. Rothman, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>90, 99, 727 A.2d 8 (1999), and that there were no \u201cslackers\u201d on the jury. He also referred to plaintiff as the personification of the \u201cperfect\u201d or \u201cideal\u201d plaintiff in that he \u201cdressed respectfully,\u201d was \u201calways prompt and quietly courteous,\u201d was \u201cin obvious discomfort, but he made efforts not to display that discomfort,\u201d and \u201ctestified with dignity, humility and modesty.\u201d The judge found plaintiffs testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>be \u201cunderstated and straightforward\u201d; \u201c[i]n terms of his credibility and general appeal,\u201d the judge \u201ccategorize[d] him in the 99th percentile.\u201d The judge also noted that plaintiff did not appear to be \u201cin any way exaggerating the impact this injury has had on his life,\u201d and he \u201cresponded to excellent cross-examination forthrightly and honestly,\u201d concluding it was \u201cnot at all a surprise that the jury accepted the testimony of this extraordinarily credible witness.\u201d Accordingly, the judge determined \u201cthere was a potential for a very sizable plaintiffs verdict\u201d once the jury determined \u2014 as it obviously did \u2014 that the so-called \u201clow-impact\u201d collision caused the herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">These observations certainly fall into the \u201cfeel of the case\u201d rubric to which our appellate courts have always deferred. Based on these observations, and others set forth in the judge\u2019s thorough opinion, he recognized the verdict was \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cperhaps at the far end of the bell[-]shaped curve used in statistical analysis\u201d but \u201cnot shock[ing] [to] the judicial conscience.\u201d If the analysis were to stop here, we would merely state our agreement that the verdict is very high and near the point of being disproportionately high, but we cannot conclude \u2014 in light of our requirement to defer to both the jury\u2019s view of the evidence and the judge\u2019s feel of the case \u2014 that it is shocking to the judicial conscience. Indeed, this analysis alone is sufficient to compel our affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Even though the above discussion compels our conclusion, we add the following comments regarding the judge\u2019s disclosure of his \u201csubjective, personal experiences\u201d that also supported his denial of the new trial motion. Considering the license provided by the majority opinion in <em>He v. Miller, </em>the trial judge provided the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">I have been sitting as a civil trial judge for the last year, during which I have presided over [forty-one] trials. [Twelve] of those cases settled after jury selection. [Nineteen] were defense verdicts, and only [eight] verdicts awarded damages to a plaintiff. Some of the plaintiff verdicts involved extremely modest damage awards. There were also two mistrials____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Before serving as a civil trial judge, I was a judge in the family division for three years. Before that I was engaged for [ twenty-nine] years as a trial attorney, and for my last [twenty] years as a lawyer I did almost exclusively plaintiffs injury eases. I did try two cases in defense of injury claims, but I believe I had more than 100 civil injury trials as plaintiffs counsel where a jury was selected. I have been asked to do continuing legal education lectures more than [forty] times by various organizations. I have been asked several times by the New Jersey Defense Association to speak at their annual daylong trial seminar. I was Mortified by the Supreme Court as a Civil Trial Attorney. I serve on the Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence and am just now completing my third two-year term on that Committee. 1 wrote two books for New Jersey lawyers in the injury field. One of [the] books is updated and reissued annually. Researching and writing the annual revision has kept me current with the law and with verdict trends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The judge also described a case over which he presided that he found had some similarities; that case settled for $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of the jury\u2019s deliberations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge recognized the many differences \u2014 including that plaintiff suffered a fractured ankle which, after surgery, caused her \u201csubstantial residual pain labeled as complex regional pain syndrome.\u201d We have no ability to examine further this purported \u201ccomparable\u201d because all we know of it is what is stated in the judge\u2019s written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Although a slim majority of the Supreme Court has held that this information is relevant, we conclude that, to the extent it has any bearing, the trial judge\u2019s subjective personal experiences\u2014 while different from or obviously at odds with those of the original trial judge in <em>He v. Miller</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 support his determination that the verdict was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">With or without the trial judge\u2019s personal experiences and subjective view, we would affirm the order denying a new trial or remittitur because of our obligation to honor the jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence and our deference to the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case.\u201d In objectively reviewing the evidence and the judge\u2019s description of what he observed throughout the trial, we conclude that although very high, this verdict cannot be said to be shocking to the judicial conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-9\"> The engineei relied in part on his belief that plaintiff's vehicle was in neutral at the time of impact \u2014 a fact in dispute, since plaintiff testified the vehicle was in gear when the collision occurred. Because the jury undoubtedly found plaintiff credible, as did the trial judge, we will assume the jury also decided this factual question in plaintiff's favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-13\"> We agree with the trial judge\u2019s comments in denying the post-trial motion as to Point I. The pre-existing-condition jury instruction was necessary because defense counsel had argued the possibilijy that plaintiff had a pre-existing condition in his opening statement and then cross-examined plaintiff about his days of playing cornerback for Rahway High School as well as his employment history, which included lifting heavy items in a warehouse. We affirm on this point substantially for the reasons set forth by the trial judge in his written opinion. We also reject defendant's Point III not only because the argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence was not urged in the post-trial motion and thus not cognizable on appeal, see <em>R. </em>2:10-1, but also because there was more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found the collision caused a substantial permanent injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\"> Of course, there has yet to be an \"ultimate\u201d conclusion in <em>He v. Miller. </em>A jury previously returned a verdict of $1,000,000 for the plaintiff's pain and suffering, but the trial judge determined that any award beyond $200,000 would be excessive and ordered a remittitur to that amount which, if rejected by the plaintiff and her husband, whose per quod claim was also reduced, would result in a new trial. We reversed and reinstated the jury verdict, 411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 983 A.2d 1164 (App.Div.2009), but a closely-divided Supreme Court reversed, concluding we \"misapplied] ... settled precedents.\u201d 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 24 A.3d 251. Thereafter, the plaintiffs rejected the remittitur, and the matter was again tried. This time the jury awarded $500,000 in pain and suffering \u2014 far above what the earlier trial judge had found to be the outermost limit \u2014 and a different trial judge with more than thirty years' experience on the bench rejected the argument that this verdict was excessive, stating, \"I wasn't the least bit shocked by the verdict, not in the least\"; we affirmed. <em>He v. Miller, </em>No. A-1599-12, 2014 <em>WL </em>4290041 (App.Div. Sept. 2, 2014) (slip op. at 5, 10). A petition for certification is pending in the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\"> Although endorsed by the majority in <em>He v. Miller, </em>the trial judge there \u2014 after advising the jury that there was no \"yardstick\u201d by which to assess pain and suffering \u2014 then used a $200,000 yardstick to measure the jury verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\"> \"Feel of the case\" comes from what the judge perceived had occurred in the courtroom during the trial, even at times when the jury was not present. <em>See He v. Miller, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 254-55, 24 A.3d 251 (recognizing that trial judges \"see plaintiffs entering and leaving the courtroom each day, observe them when the jury\u2019s attention is on another witness or exhibit, and are privy to their interactions and behaviors when the jury is absent from the courtroom during colloquy, conferences, and breaks during proceedings\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> The <em>He v. Miller </em>majority acknowledged this, stating \u201call judges come to the bench with different backgrounds, experiences, perceptions, and views,\" and recognizing that \"judges who have gained experience on the bench in similar trials will have a different, and perhaps better, basis on which to determine whether a particular award is beyond the acceptable to such a degree that it calls for remittitur.\u201d 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 24 A.3d 251.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> The <em>He v. Miller </em>majority also recognized this. <em>See </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 24 A.3d 251 (observing that \"no two plaintiffs are identical and no two cases are identical\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\"> Indeed, as noted earlier, the first <em>He </em>v. <em>Miller </em>trial judge, who had been on the bench less than a year, found anything over $200,000 shockingly disproportionate, while the second <em>He v. Miller </em>trial judge, who has been a judge for more than thirty years, found nothing remotely shocking about a $500,000 pain and suffering award in the same case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> The trial judge also noted that neither plaintiff nor defendants cited comparable verdicts until defendants submitted their reply brief. Finding a lack of authentication, the judge refused to consider defendants' \"anecdotal information.\u201d The record on appeal does not disclose the authentication problem. We would note, however, that we are troubled by the use of reports of jury verdicts in the <em>New Jersey Law Journal </em>or other similar publications, or citations to our unpublished opinions, as evidence of comparable jury verdicts. The former are based on hearsay or multiple levels of hearsay. And, in many instances, reports contained in the <em>New Jersey Law Journal's </em>weekly \"Verdict Search\u201d section, are one-sided. <em>See, e.g., </em>218 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>1099 (Dec. 22, 2014) (advising that the report o\u00ed the verdict and the underlying circumstances was \"based on information provided by plaintiff's counsel\u201d and \"[d]efense counsel declined to contribute\u201d); 218 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>31 (Oct. 6, 2014) (same); 216 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>843 (June 23, 2014) (same); 216 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>275 (Apr. 28, 2014) (same). The use of unpublished opinions, by <em>Rule </em>1:36-3, are not precedential and \"shall [not] be cited by any court\u201d; we assume that the prohibition on citation also limits a court\u2019s use of unpublished opinions as a source of comparable verdicts. In any event, defendants have not argued in this appeal that the judge\u2019s refusal to consider whatever information was provided to him (this information is not in the record on appeal) was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> We cannot help but observe that the version of \"the judicial conscience\u201d applied by the first trial judge in <em>He v. Miller </em>would undoubtedly have led to the issuance of a remittitur here, and the version applied by the trial judge here would undoubtedly have led to a rejection of a remittitur in <em>He v. Miller. </em>The one difference, however, is that we do not view the trial judge here as having allowed his prior experiences to dominate his view of this verdict as we believe occurred in <em>He </em>v. <em>Miller. </em>Instead, before even discussing his own past experiences and background, the judge described the injuries, the plaintiffs great jury appeal, and his own \"feel of the case\u201d as warranting a denial of defendants' post-verdict motion before providing his experiences as further support for his order. As we have said, those observations are sufficient, and they convincingly demonstrate the verdict should be upheld.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
