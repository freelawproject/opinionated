Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">{\u00b6 1} In September 2001, appellee Hamilton County Municipal Judge Ralph E. Winkler conducted a bench trial in which the defendant was acquitted of all charges. On September 27, 2001, the day after the trial\u2019s conclusion, the defendant filed a motion to seal the official record of his case pursuant to R.C. 2953.52. On November 5, 2001 (almost six weeks after the trial), Judge Winkler held a hearing on the motion and later granted it. On December 6, 2001, the Cincinnati Enquirer, appellant, delivered to Judge Winkler a written request to inspect all records produced in the criminal case. Judge Winkler refused the paper\u2019s request because the court records had already been sealed. Thereafter, appellant filed this mandamus action in the First District Court of Appeals against both Judge Ralph E. Winkler and Clerk of Courts James C. Cissell, appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">{\u00b6 2} Initially, the court of appeals ordered Judge Winkler to weigh the individual\u2019s privacy interests against the public\u2019s legitimate interest in accessing the records, as required by R.C. 2953.52. 149 Ohio App.3d 350, 2002-Ohio-4803, 777 N.E.2d 320. In response, Judge Winkler determined that the defendant\u2019s privacy interests outweighed the public\u2019s right of access. Thereafter, the court of appeals, in a two-to-one decision, accepted Judge Winkler\u2019s findings and declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>to issue the requested writ. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant presents three arguments in this appeal. First, appellant argues that it is entitled to the release of the court records, as they are public records as defined in the Public Records Act. Second, appellant asserts that R.C. 2953.52 is unconstitutional, since it is overbroad and, therefore, it cannot be used as an exception to the Public Records Act. Third, appellant contends that in applying the balancing test, the court should have found in favor of releasing the records. Appellees, however, assert that R.C. 2953.52 is constitutional and that records sealed pursuant to this statute lose their status as public records. Appellees also contend that the case was improperly brought in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 4} Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to seek compliance with the Public Records Act under R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Bond, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 146, 2002-Ohio-7117, 781 N.E.2d 180, \u00b6 50. We have also held that mandamus may be used when a right of access to public records is predicated on a constitutional challenge. Id. Therefore, we find that appellant correctly sought mandamus relief. We turn now to the merits of the case and consider whether the records that appellant seeks are public records and whether R.C. 2953.52 is constitutional on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 5} We begin with the purpose of Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, which is to expose government activity to public scrutiny. <em>State ex rel. WHIOTV-7 v. Lowe </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 350, 355, 673 N.E.2d 1360. Moreover, we have consistently construed the Public Records Act to provide the broadest access to government records. <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 79, 83, 526 N.E.2d 786. Therefore, in keeping with policy, it is apparent that court records fall -within the broad definition of a \u201cpublic record\u201d in R.C. 149.43(A)(1): \u201cPublic record\u201d means records kept by any public office, including, but not limited to, state, county, city, village, township, and school district units * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 6} However, there are exceptions to the general rule of openness. One exception, found in R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v), is for \u201c[r]ecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d Sealed court records fall within this exception, since R.C. 2953.55(B) makes it a fourth-degree misdemeanor to release sealed records. Thus, once the court records were sealed under R.C. 2953.52, they ceased to be public records. Since the sealed records lost their status as public records, Judge Winkler was justified in refusing appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant next argues that R.C. 2953.52 is unconstitutional on the ground that it violates the public\u2019s right of access. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 8} The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a qualified right of access to criminal proceedings. <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superi- </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>or Court of California, Riverside Cty. </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 1, 7-8, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1. Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution guarantees the public\u2019s right to open courts. This right of access found in both the federal and state Constitutions includes records and transcripts that document the proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 19, 21, 652 N.E.2d 179; <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California, Riverside Cty. </em>(1984), 464 U.S. 501, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 9} The right of public access, as examined in the context of a criminal proceeding, serves several lofty goals. First, a crime is a public wrong, and the interest of the community to observe the administration of justice in such an instance is compelling. Harrison, How Open Is Open? The Development of the Public Access Doctrine under State Open Courts Provisions (1992), 60 U.Cin. L.Rev. 1307, 1322. Also, the general right of public access promotes respect for and an understanding of the legal system and thus enables the public to engage in an informed discussion of the governmental process. Bechamps, Sealed Out-of-Court Settlements: When Does the Public Have a Right to Know? (1990), 66 Notre Dame L.Rev. 117,127. The right, however, is not absolute. \u201cNo one has a right to any particular degree of openness or secrecy, except as provided by law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Waters (1993), 67 Ohio </em>St.3d 321, 324, 617 N.E.2d 1110. We have further held that it is a proper role of the General Assembly to balance competing private and public rights. <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Univ. of Toledo Found. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 258, 266, 602 N. E.2d 1159. The General Assembly has done so in R.C. 2953.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2953.52 makes another exception to the general rule of openness. R.C. 2953.52(A)(1) allows a defendant found not guilty of an offense to apply to the court to have his or her record sealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute further requires that following a hearing, the court must \u201c[w]eigh the interests of the person in having the official records pertaining to the case sealed against the legitimate needs, if any, of the government to maintain those records.\u201d R.C. 2953.52(B)(2)(d). Thus, the court\u2019s discretion to seal records is, not unfettered. Instead, the statute balances the public\u2019s right of access and the acquitted defendant\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. See <em>Pepper Pike v. Doe </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 374, 377, 20 O.O.3d 334, 421 N.E.2d 1303 (balancing and sealing within inherent power of court, without statute). The defendant\u2019s right to privacy takes into account the public policy of providing a second chance to criminal defendants who have been found not guilty. <em>State v. D.H.W. </em>(Fla.1996), 686 So.2d 1331, 1336.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey, L.L.P., John C. Greiner and John A. Flanagan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6py\">Michael K. Allen, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and David T. Stevenson, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 11} The only function of this statute is to allow a court, after balancing the public and private interests, to limit the life of a particular record. The public\u2019s ability to attend a criminal trial is not hindered. The media\u2019s right to report on the court proceedings is not diminished. The statute does not restrict the media\u2019s right to publish truthful information relating to the criminal proceedings that have been sealed. In addition, the public had a right of access to any court record before, during, and for a period of time after the criminal trial. In fact, the public\u2019s access to the records is unrestricted until a decision is made to seal records. The statute ensures fairness by balancing the competing concerns of the public\u2019s right to know and the defendant\u2019s right to keep certain information private. Therefore, on its face, R.C. 2953.52 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 12} Nor is R.C. 2953.52 unconstitutional as applied. In this case, there was a full public trial with widespread media attention. Appellant\u2019s reporters presumably attended the trial in its entirety. The court record remained open for more than five weeks after the trial had concluded. Thus, appellant had ample opportunity to report on and to access and copy the trial record for a substantial period of time before its sealing. Once a case is sealed, however, the basis for public access to the official records does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 13} We therefore conclude that R.C. 2953.52 does not violate the public\u2019s constitutional right of access to public records and that the trial court complied with its dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">{\u00b6 14} The court of appeals\u2019 judgment denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b615-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-9\">. The statute also permits a court to seal records following a dismissal of the charges or a grand jury\u2019s no bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
