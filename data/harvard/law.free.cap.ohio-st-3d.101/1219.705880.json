Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, seeking to disqualify Judge Burt W. Griffin from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>continuing to supervise the Monday/Wednesday \u201cB\u201d Side of the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury, May Term, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">{\u00b6 2} On April 30, 2003, Judge Griffin, in his role as its supervising judge, empaneled the subject grand jury. Judge Griffin read and distributed a ten-page grand jury charge, a copy of which was attached to affiant\u2019s initial affidavit. It is Judge Griffin\u2019s charge to the grand jury that is the basis for this affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 3} The pleadings in this case were extensive. Affiant filed a 24-page \u201cLaw in Support of Affidavit of Disqualification\u201d accompanied by a 14-page affidavit with exhibits. In response, Judge Griffin filed a seven-page affidavit and his counsel filed a 13-page memorandum. These were followed by affiant\u2019s Reply Brief and Affidavit, Judge Griffin\u2019s Surreply Memorandum, and an amicus curiae memorandum opposing disqualification filed by the Cuyahoga County Bar Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 4} The gravamen of the affidavit is the prosecutor\u2019s belief that Judge Griffin \u201ctainted the grand jury by inaccurately advising jurors of the law applicable to the administration of their duties.\u201d (Law in Support of Affidavit of Disqualification, at 1.) The prosecutor cited numerous examples that related to, among other things (a) the burden of proof required for the grand jury to return an indictment; (b) the role of the grand jury foreperson in advising the jury on the law; (c) a putative defendant\u2019s right to testily before the grand jury; (d) a prosecutor\u2019s duty to present to the grand jury any evidence that would negate the guilt of an individual; and (e) an alleged \u201cdifferential prosecution\u201d of certain types of drug cases that leads some members of the community to believe that the county\u2019s criminal justice system is racially biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 5} On May 2, 2003, affiant filed and submitted to Judge Richard McMonagle, Presiding and Administrative Judge of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, a \u201cState\u2019s Objection to Grand Jury Instructions and Motion to Discharge/Terminate Grand Jury.\u201d Judge McMonagle set a hearing on this motion for May 8. On May 7, Judge Griffin scheduled a hearing for May 9 in response to the affiant\u2019s objections and to request from the grand jury itself that the issue be resolved. Later on May 7, affiant served Judge Griffin with a copy of the affidavit of disqualification, and therefore the hearings that had been scheduled by Judge McMonagle and Judge Griffin were held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 6} In his response to the affidavit of disqualification, Judge Griffin acknowledged that the charge he gave to the grand jury \u201cdiffers in some respects from instructions given by me on prior occasions in order to address certain concerns about grand jury operations\u201d and \u201cto ameliorate some of those problems.\u201d (Griffin Affidavit, \u00b6 5, 10.) He also acknowledged some errors in his charge, acknowledged the need for curative measures, and \u201crecognizes that some portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>of the charge are subject to question and deserve more intense research and analysis.\u201d (Griffin Affidavit, \u00b6 20.) Judge Griffin stated that he is prepared to modify his charge to the grand jury, or even discharge the grand jury and empanel a new one, and \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to hear from the prosecutor on all of the issues of legal errors that he has raised in his affidavit of bias and prejudice.\u201d (Griffin Affidavit, \u00b6 33.) He denies any bias and prejudice against the affiant or any members of the prosecutor\u2019s staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2701.03(A) provides that a party or counsel may seek a judge\u2019s disqualification if that judge \u201callegedly is interested in a proceeding pending before the court, allegedly is related to or has a bias or prejudice for or against a party to a proceeding pending before the court or a party\u2019s counsel, or allegedly otherwise is disqualified to preside in a proceeding pending before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 8} An affidavit of disqualification is not the mechanism for determining whether a judge has complied with the law or, specifically in this case, determining whether Judge Griffin\u2019s charge to the grand jury was legally correct. It also is not an appropriate vehicle for determining whether, as the affiant alleges, Judge Griffin has engaged in \u201cviolations of both the Canons governing Judicial Conduct and the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\u201d (Law in Support of Affidavit of Disqualification, at 23.) Rather, the issue before the Chief Justice in a disqualification proceedings is a narrow one:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe constitutional and statutory responsibility of the Chief Justice in ruling on an affidavit of disqualification is limited to determining whether a judge in a pending case has a bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying interest that mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification from that case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Kate </em>(1999), 88 Ohio St.3d 1208, 1209, 723 N.E.2d 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 10} Having thoroughly examined the facts, arguments of the parties, and the applicable law, I conclude that the record before me does not support a finding of bias, prejudice, or interest on the part of Judge Griffin as is required by R.C. 2701.03 to disqualify him. For this reason, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. Judge Griffin may continue in his role with this grand jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
