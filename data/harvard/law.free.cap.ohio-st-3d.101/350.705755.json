Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 1} In this appeal, defendant-appellant, Scott A. Mink, appeals from his convictions and death sentence for the aggravated murders of his parents, William and Sheila Mink.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The evidence at trial revealed that in September 2000, Scott A. Mink, then 36 years old, resided with his parents, 79-year-old William and 72-year-old Sheila Mink, in their second-floor duplex apartment in Union, Ohio. Mink used illegal drugs while living with his parents. As his drug use increased, his parents set curfew limits and restrictions on the use of his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">{\u00b6 3} In early to mid-September 2000, Mink\u2019s parents informed Mink that he would not be allowed to join them in their move to a smaller apartment. On September 18, William G. Mink, Mink\u2019s brother, asked Mink about his moving plans, and he replied, \u201ckind of nasty like, * * * don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">{\u00b6 4} Around 9:00 p.m. on September 19, 2000, Mink and Bryan Werling were drinking and smoking crack cocaine at Werling\u2019s apartment in West Milton. Around 9:30 p.m., Mink\u2019s parents called Mink at Werling\u2019s apartment and told Mink to return home. Mink then departed and told Werling that \u201che had to get home or he wasn\u2019t going to have a place to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">{\u00b6 5} At approximately 10:00 p.m., Mink arrived home. After his parents went to bed, Mink looked for his truck keys so that he could leave the apartment and get more drugs. Mink was unable to find the keys, and after realizing that his parents had hidden them, he had a \u201cfit of uncontrollable rage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">{\u00b6 6} According to his subsequent confession, Mink went into his parents\u2019 bedroom sometime after 11:20 p.m. They were sleeping on adjacent twin beds, and he repeatedly hit them with a ball-peen hammer. The hammer broke while he was striking them. Mink left his parents\u2019 bedroom and returned with two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>kitchen knives and an extension cord. Mink then stabbed each of them several times. One knife broke during the attack, and Mink left the other knife in his mother\u2019s chest. Mink also strangled his mother with the extension cord. Finally, Mink repeatedly struck both parents with two cutting boards that he had taken from the kitchen. After one cutting board broke, Mink reassembled it and put it back on the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 7} Following the attack, Mink washed up and put on fresh clothes. Mink then took $7 and a British Petroleum (\u201cBP\u201d) credit card from his father\u2019s wallet and took his mother\u2019s Bank One card. After finding his truck keys, Mink left the apartment, went to a Bank One automatic teller machine (\u201cATM\u201d), and withdrew $10 from his parents\u2019 account. Mink then purchased what he thought was crack for $20. Around 1:30 or 2:30 a.m. on September 20, Mink returned home and discovered that the crack was not real. Mink then took five or six of his mother\u2019s tranquilizers and went to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 8} Mink woke up in the late afternoon of September 20. Mink then moved his father\u2019s body off his bed and laid him on top of his mother\u2019s body, which was lying between the twin beds. He covered the bodies with blankets to keep them out of view. Later that evening, Mink traded his father\u2019s Ford Escort to a drug dealer for $50 to $100 worth of rock cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 9} Around 5:00 a.m. on September 21, Mink phoned James Ornduff to ask whether he knew anyone interested in buying a television. Mink said that his \u201cparents [were] out of town and he was trying to get * * * some money up for groceries.\u201d Mink then drove to East Dayton, where he exchanged his parents\u2019 television for $30 worth of crack. Mink also used his father\u2019s BP credit card to purchase cigarettes, beer, and a gallon of milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 10} Later on the same morning, Mink called Ornduff again and requested his help in selling a recliner, a microwave, a couple of pictures, a clock, and a watch. Mink said that his parents were on vacation and that they wanted him to clean out the garage. Mink loaded the property in his truck and transported it to Ornduff. Mink returned home around noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 11} Mink\u2019s three sisters and his brother lived in the Dayton area and frequently visited and talked with their parents on the phone. The sisters became concerned about their parents after they were unable to contact them on September 20. Around noon on September 21, the sisters drove to their parents\u2019 apartment to check on their well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 12} When the sisters pulled into the driveway, they saw Mink entering their parents\u2019 apartment. The sisters then pounded on the front door and shouted for Mink to come out. When Mink answered the door, he would not let his sisters inside the apartment and said that he did not know the whereabouts of their parents. The sisters left to notify the police. As they arrived at the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>department, which was a short distance behind their parents\u2019 apartment, the sisters saw Mink walking to his truck. The sisters confronted Mink in the parking lot and asked for the keys to the apartment. One of them asked, \u201cScott, did you hurt Mom and Dad? And he said no.\u201d Mink then gave them the keys and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">{\u00b6 13} The sisters entered the front door of the apartment, which opened into their parents\u2019 darkened bedroom. They did not recognize that their parents\u2019 bodies were under blankets between the beds. However, the sisters knew that something was wrong because their father\u2019s glasses and billfold were on the dresser even though the car was gone. The sisters left the apartment and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 14} At 12:41 p.m. on September 21, Officer Darrin Goudy, a Union police officer, was dispatched to the Mink apartment to check on the welfare of the residents. After talking to the three sisters outside, Officer Goudy entered the apartment and found the bodies of William and Sheila lying between the beds. Police secured the crime scene, obtained a search warrant, and began collecting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 15} William\u2019s body was found lying on top of Sheila\u2019s body, and their clothing and the surrounding floor were covered in blood. A kitchen knife was sticking out of Sheila\u2019s chest, and a cord was wrapped around her neck. The head of a broken hammer, a knife blade, and a wooden cutting board were on the floor near the bodies. The hammer handle and the knife handle were under the blankets and sheets on a bed. Blood spatters were found on a roll of carpet padding underneath the bed, suggesting that the victims were also attacked while on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 16} Police found a bloody wood-cutting board on the kitchen counter that had been broken into three pieces and reassembled. An empty microwave stand in the kitchen and an open space near a loose TV cable in the living room suggested that property had been taken from the apartment. The police also found a pair of bloody sneakers and a bloody tee-shirt in Mink\u2019s separate bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 17} On September 22, police contacted Ornduff after phone records showed that Mink had talked with him a number of times after the murders. Police then seized the television, recliner, microwave, two pictures, and a wall clock that Mink had transferred to Ornduff. Additionally, police learned that Mink had used or attempted to use his father\u2019s BP card seven or eight times after the murders. The police also located and seized William Mink\u2019s Ford Escort, which Mink had exchanged for drugs. Subsequent laboratory testing confirmed the presence of blood on the driver\u2019s-side seat belt and the driver\u2019s-side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>{\u00b6 18} After leaving his sisters at the apartment on September 21, Mink stayed on a farm near Tipp City. Around 8:00 p.m. on September 24, Mink turned himself in at the Tipp City Police Department. Mink stated that he had \u201cdone something awful and had woke up in a field somewhere west of Tipp City.\u201d Mink was then arrested and taken into police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 19} Around 11:00 p.m. on September 24, Detective Rick Bergman and Detective Thomas Peed interviewed Mink about William\u2019s and Sheila\u2019s murders. Mink was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he waived. Mink provided detailed oral and written accounts of the murders that reflect the facts already described. Mink also gave a videotaped interview admitting his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b620} Dr. Kent Harshbarger, Deputy Coroner for Montgomery County, performed autopsies on both victims. William was stabbed 13 times, suffered at least 13 blunt-force impacts to the head, and endured four blunt-force impacts on the rest of his body. Other injuries on William\u2019s hand, wrist, and lower leg were defensive injuries and showed that William had been alive and defended against the attacks. William died from \u201cmultiple trauma, which consisted of blunt force trauma and multiple stab wounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 21} Sheila suffered nine blunt-force impacts to the head, four stab wounds to her chest and back, and 33 superficial stab wounds. The knife protruding into her chest extended four to four-and-one-half inches into her right lung. Sheila\u2019s blunt-force injuries were consistent with blows caused by the cutting board and hammer found at the scene. Sheila also suffered fractured bones in her neck due to strangulation and \u201cwas alive when all those injuries were inflicted.\u201d Dr. Harshbarger concluded that Sheila died from \u201cmultiple traumatic injuries, which include blunt force injuries, stab wounds and strangulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 22} Mink was subsequently indicted on four counts of aggravated murder for the deaths of his parents. Count 3 charged Mink with the aggravated murder of William with prior calculation and design, and Count 4 charged Mink with the aggravated murder of William during commission of a robbery. Count 5 charged Mink with the aggravated murder of Sheila with prior calculation and design, and Count 6 charged Mink with the aggravated murder of Sheila during commission of a robbery. Additionally, Mink was charged with aggravated robbery of William in Count 1 and aggravated robbery of Sheila in Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b623} The four counts of aggravated murder each contained three identical death penalty specifications: murder to escape detection or apprehension, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and murder as a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d involving killing two or more people, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">{\u00b6 24} At trial, Mink waived counsel and pled guilty. After reviewing court-ordered competency evaluations and questioning Mink about his decisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>court ruled that Mink was competent to stand trial, competent to waive counsel and represent himself, and competent to waive a jury trial. His counsel were ordered to remain as his legal advisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 25} Before the three-judge panel, Mink entered pleas of guilty, and the state presented evidence of his guilt. The panel found Mink guilty of Counts 1 through 6 and Specifications 2 and 3 of Counts 3 through 6. The panel found Mink not guilty of Specification 1 of Counts 3 through 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 26} During the penalty phase, Mink waived the presentation of mitigating evidence and requested the death penalty. After finding that Mink was competent to waive mitigation, the court sentenced Mink to death for the murders and to prison terms for the remaining offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 27} Mink now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 28} Mink raises 18 propositions of law for our consideration, which we have considered fully. In addition, we have considered the death penalty for appropriateness and proportionality, and we have independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Mink\u2019s convictions and uphold the sentence of death imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 29} <em>Competency evaluations. </em>In propositions of law I, II, III, and V, Mink challenges the sufficiency of his competency evaluations. However, Mink did not object to any aspect of his competency evaluations at trial and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 30} In proposition of law I, Mink claims that the two psychologists who examined him were not qualified to evaluate his competency because he was receiving 150 milligrams of Effexor, an antidepressant, at the time of his evaluation. Mink argues that only a psychiatrist licensed to prescribe medication was qualified to render an opinion on his competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">{\u00b6 31} Near the beginning of trial, Mink informed the court that he wished to plead guilty, waive counsel, and request the death penalty. The trial court then appointed Dr. Thomas Martin and Dr. Kim Stookey, two clinical psychologists, to conduct separate competency evaluations to ensure that Mink\u2019s decision was \u201cvoluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made.\u201d The trial court ordered these evaluations even though the defense counsel disclosed that an independent psychologist had examined Mink and had found that he was competent. The trial court offered the defense the opportunity to \u201cnominate\u201d a psychiatrist or psychologist to conduct the evaluation, but the defense declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">{\u00b6 32} During May 2001, Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey conducted their competency evaluations of Mink. Both Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey completed written reports finding that Mink was competent. At a hearing, Mink stipulated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cqualifications of the psychologists and also their findings in the reports.\u201d The trial court found that \u201cboth the examiners are qualified to evaluate the defendant and draw the conclusions and opinions that they draw.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court found that Mink was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 2945.371(A) provides that a competency examination shall be conducted by an \u201cexaminer,\u201d defined by R.C. 2945.37(A)(2) as either a \u201cpsychiatrist or a licensed clinical psychologist.\u201d The appointment of Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey, licensed clinical psychologists, to conduct Mink\u2019s competency evaluations met that criterion. Moreover, Mink\u2019s stipulation to each psychologist\u2019s qualifications and findings now forecloses Mink\u2019s argument that their findings were flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 34} There was also no plain error. Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey were fully qualified to determine whether Mink\u2019s prescription medication would have affected his competency. See, generally, Annotation, Qualification of Nonmedical Psychologist to Testify as to Mental Condition or Competency (1999), 72 A.L.R.5th 529. Moreover, review of the competency evaluations reveals that Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey were aware that Mink was taking or had taken antidepressant medication and considered its effect before reaching the conclusion that Mink was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 35} Dr. Martin\u2019s evaluation mentions that Mink was taking 150 mg of Effexor-XR each morning. Dr. Martin reported that while Mink was depressed, Mink indicated that \u201cwithout the medication (i.e., Effexor-XR), [he\u2019d] be moody and reclusive, but with it [he\u2019s] okay.\u201d Dr. Martin evaluated Mink\u2019s state of depression by administering the Beck Depression Inventory (\u201cBDI\u201d). Mink obtained a \u201craw score of 9 on the <em>BDI, </em>which failed to indicate the presence of a depressive disorder.\u201d Thus, Dr. Martin was aware that Mink was taking Effexor-XR, discussed the effects of the drug with Mink, and conducted further testing that showed that Mink was not suffering from a depressive disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 36} Dr. Stookey\u2019s evaluation did not mention that Mink was taking EffexorXR or other antidepressant medications at the time of the competency evaluation. However, Dr. Stookey reported that Mink was treated for depression in early 1999 and was prescribed antidepressant medications. She also mentioned that Mink started heavily to use alcohol and crack cocaine during the fall of 1999. Dr. Stookey concluded that Mink\u2019s history of depression was related to his \u201cchemical dependency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 37} After receiving Dr. Martin\u2019s and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations, the trial court questioned Mink about taking prescription medications before accepting his request to waive counsel and represent himself at trial. The- trial court asked Mink, \u201cAre you under the influence of any drugs, alcohol, or any other medication that in any way would affect your ability to understand what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>we\u2019re doing here today or what I\u2019m saying to you and to which you are responding?\u201d Mink replied that he was not. Similarly, prior to accepting Mink\u2019s guilty plea, the trial court asked Mink whether he was under the influence of any \u201cmedication that in any way would affect your ability to understand what we are doing here today?\u201d Again, Mink testified that he was not. Thus, the trial court not only relied upon the written competency evaluations but received Mink\u2019s own assurances that his ability to understand the proceedings was not adversely affected by any prescription medication that he was taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, Mink\u2019s taking of antidepressant medications would not have affected the trial court\u2019s findings on Mink\u2019s competency. R.C. 2945.37(F) provides that a \u201ccourt shall not find a defendant incompetent to stand trial solely because the defendant is * * * receiving or has received psychotropic drugs or other medication.\u201d See, also, <em>United States v. Grimes </em>(C.A.7, 1999), 173 F.3d 634, 635-636 (evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s competence not required after defense counsel asserted no more than that defendant was seeing a psychiatrist and taking antidepressant medication, was \u201cparanoid\u201d about his lawyers, and had trouble concentrating); <em>Hunter v. Bowersox </em>(C.A.8, 1999), 172 F.3d 1016, 1022 (findings of competency upheld despite contention that the defendant suffered from clinical depression and cocaine withdrawal); <em>State v. Borchers </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 157, 160, 655 N.E.2d 225 (defendant cannot be found incompetent solely because he is receiving medication to treat depression). Indeed, a defendant may be emotionally disturbed or even mentally ill and yet competent to stand trial. <em>State v. Bock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 28 OBR 207, 502 N.E.2d 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 40} In proposition of law II, Mink contends that the trial court\u2019s findings that he was competent were flawed because the two psychologists failed to examine Mink\u2019s medical and mental health treatment records prior to concluding that he was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 41} Dr. Martin requested, but did not receive, Mink\u2019s medical and mental health records prior to completing his competency evaluation. These records included Mink\u2019s visit to the Crisis Care Facility in 2000, his three-day hospitalization at Miami Valley Hospital in April or May 2000, and his 28-day residential drug and later outpatient treatment program at Dayton\u2019s Center for Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Services (\u201cCADAS\u201d) facilities in 1999. Similarly, Dr. Stookey reported that Mink\u2019s psychiatric treatment records were requested but not received prior to her evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 42} After Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey submitted their reports, Mink did not object that the examiners had failed to review his medical and psychiatric records. Rather, Mink stipulated to the \u201cqualifications of the psychologists and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>also their findings in the reports.\u201d Therefore, Mink\u2019s stipulation and failure to object forecloses his argument that his competency evaluation was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 43} Moreover, there was no plain error. R.C. 2945.371(G) requires the examiner to file a written report with the court that shall include (1) the examiner\u2019s findings; (2) the facts in reasonable detail on which the findings are based; and (3) the findings or recommendations applicable to the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations met these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 44} Dr. Martin\u2019s and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations were thorough and complete. Dr. Martin clinically interviewed Mink for five hours over a three-day period. Through these interviews, Mink provided Dr. Martin with detailed information about Mink\u2019s family background, his education and work record, and the history of his medical and psychological problems. Dr. Martin learned that Mink was treated for depression in January 1999, attended a 28-day drug treatment program during July and August 1999, was hospitalized for alcohol and drug treatment for three days in April or May 2000, and received psychiatric treatment after an overdose of Alka-Seltzer Nite-Time medication in July or August 2000. Further, Dr. Martin learned that just a few days before the murders, Mink\u2019s family brought him to the Good Samaritan Hospital\u2019s Crisis Care facility. Mink also disclosed that he \u201cnever followed through with any treatment recommendations\u201d from the hospital or crisis care center. Thus, Dr. Martin had a wealth of information about Mink\u2019s medical and psychiatric history. Additionally, Dr. Martin reviewed police reports, witness statements, and lab reports from the murder investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 45} Dr. Martin also conducted psychological testing of Mink before rendering his opinion on Mink\u2019s competency. Testing included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3d Edition (\u201cWAIS-III\u201d), the BDI, and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (\u201cMMPI-2\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 46} Dr. Martin\u2019s behavioral observations and mental-status examination of Mink resulted in detailed findings. Dr. Martin\u2019s exam revealed that Mink \u201cwas oriented to person, place, and time, and manifested no lapses in his level of consciousness.\u201d Mink reported that he did not experience phobias, panic attacks, bouts of unmanageable anxiety, or tactile hallucinations. However, Mink disclosed a history of alcohol and marijuana abuse and mentioned that he had smoked crack \u201cat least 3 times a week for 5 or 6 years\u201d and had spent $150 to $250 a week to support his \u201ccrack habit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 47} Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluation was similarly complete. Dr. Stookey interviewed Mink for four hours over a two-day period. During these interviews, Dr. Stookey received a detailed history about Mink\u2019s family background, his education, and his employment. Dr. Stookey learned about Mink\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>long history of alcohol and drug abuse. Mink explained that he had entered a substance abuse treatment program and had done \u201cfine.\u201d In June 1999, Mink was treated for depression and continued on his medications and counseling. However, in the fall of 1999, Mink started \u201cheavy use\u201d of alcohol and crack cocaine. Additionally, Dr. Stookey reviewed police reports, witness statements, and Mink\u2019s videotaped statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">{\u00b6 48} Dr. Stookey administered the MMPI-2 and the Georgia Court Competency Test. Based on her testing, interviews, and behavioral observations of Mink, Dr. Stookey concluded that \u201cthere are no symptoms of disordered thinking, other forms of psychosis, or mental retardation which would interfere with his ability to participate in all decisions relevant to the charges * * *, his ability to understand the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and ability to assist in his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 49} Admittedly, review of Mink\u2019s medical and mental health records would have resulted in an even more complete evaluation. However, Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey both conducted thorough and complete examinations of Mink before concluding that Mink was competent. Moreover, Mink does not contend that the results of his competency evaluations would have been different if the psychologists had reviewed his medical and mental health records before reaching their conclusion. Thus, any error is purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 50} Further, the record shows that Mink acted sensibly throughout the trial, answered the trial court\u2019s questions in a straightforward fashion, and exhibited no irrational behavior. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Mink competent, since \u201creliable, credible evidence\u201d supported such findings. See <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 33. Moreover, deference on these issues should be given to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298. Therefore, we find that proposition II lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 51} In proposition of law III, Mink argues that the trial court\u2019s findings of competency were flawed because his history of depression, his suicide attempts, and his hospitalization were not adequately addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 52} Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey provided the trial court with expert advice on Mink\u2019s depression before concluding that Mink was competent. Dr. Martin reported that Mink suffered from depression and was being treated with the antidepressant medication, Effexor-XR. Moreover, Dr. Martin informed the court that \u201cBDI [testing] failed to indicate the presence of a disabling depressive disorder.\u201d Although Dr. Stookey reported that Mink suffered from depression, she concluded that his history of depression appeared to be related to \u201cchemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>dependency.\u201d Nevertheless, despite Mink\u2019s history of depression, Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey concluded that Mink was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 53} Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey also addressed Mink\u2019s history of suicide attempts. Dr. Martin reported that Mink had contemplated suicide during the Christmas of 1997, but Mink did not actually attempt to kill himself. Dr. Martin also reported that Mink \u201cclaimed that he had not been preoccupied with thoughts of killing himself during his confinement in the Montgomery County Jail, adding that he had not made any overt suicidal threats or gestures while in the Jail.\u201d Moreover, Dr. Martin stated that BDI test results showed that Mink \u201cwas not preoccupied with suicidal thoughts.\u201d Dr. Stookey stated that \u201cMink expressed no spontaneous suicidal or homicide ideation and he denied the presence of such when asked directly. Mr. Mink reported he believes suicide is a sin and it is the one sin that cannot be forgiven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 54} As discussed in proposition II, the psychologists\u2019 evaluations included references to Mink\u2019s earlier hospitalizations relayed by Mink himself. Thus, the trial court was also aware of this information before concluding that Mink was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 55} There was no plain error. The defense stipulated to the \u201cqualifications of the psychologists and also their findings in the reports\u201d that Mink was competent and did not object to any aspect of either competency evaluation. Nor does Mink claim that his medical or mental health records, which were not reviewed, included information that would have changed his competency determination. Thus, any claims that Mink\u2019s competency evaluation was flawed because it did not include additional information about his depression, suicide attempts, or prior hospitalizations are purely speculative. Accordingly, we reject proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 56} In proposition of law V, Mink argues that greater scrutiny was required in determining his competency because he waived counsel and actively sought the death penalty. However, Mink has failed to identify the level of scrutiny he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">{\u00b6 57} In <em>Dusky v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824, the Supreme Court explained the test for competency: a trial court must determine whether the defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d (Internal quotations omitted.) The competency standard for standing trial is the same as the standard for pleading guilty or waiving the right to counsel. See <em>Godinez v. Moran </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 389, 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321. In relation to Mink\u2019s arguments, <em>Godinez </em>holds that \u201cwhile States are free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the <em>Dusky </em>formulation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Due Process Clause does not impose * * * additional requirements.\u201d Id. at 402, 113 S.Ct. 2680,125 L.Ed.2d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 58} R.C. 2945.37 and R.C. 2945.371 provide procedures for a trial court to follow in conducting competency evaluations and determinations. We set forth the test to determine whether a defendant is mentally competent to forgo the presentation of mitigating evidence in a capital case in <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231. <em>Ashworth </em>provides that a \u201cdefendant is mentally competent to forgo the presentation of mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital case if he has the mental capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to pursue the presentation of evidence.\u201d Id., paragraph two of the syllabus. Moreover, <em>Ashworth </em>requires a trial court to conduct an inquiry of the defendant on the record to determine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary before deciding \u201cwhether the defendant is competent and whether the defendant understands his or her rights both in the plea process and in the sentencing proceedings.\u201d Id. at 62, 706 N.E.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 59} The trial court went to great lengths before finding Mink competent. On its own motion, the trial court ordered that Mink undergo two competency evaluations. The trial court ordered these evaluations even though defense counsel disclosed that an independent psychologist had already found Mink competent. Thereafter, Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey evaluated Mink, and Mink stipulated to their findings that he was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 60} The trial court also conducted a comprehensive inquiry of Mink before finding that he was competent to waive counsel and represent himself and competent to waive his right to a jury trial. Moreover, prior to the penalty phase, the three-judge panel thoroughly questioned Mink before finding that he was competent to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 61} We find that the trial court fully protected Mink\u2019s constitutional fights in determining his competency. Greater scrutiny was not required. Thus, we find that proposition V lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 62} <em>Guilty plea. </em>In proposition of law IV, Mink argues that he did not enter a knowing and voluntary plea of guilty. However, these claims have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">{\u00b6 63} First, Mink contends that the trial court failed to inquire about any medication that he was taking at the time of the plea or determine whether the medication had any effect on his willingness to plead guilty. Mink\u2019s assertions are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">{\u00b6 64} Before accepting Mink\u2019s pleas, the three-judge panel reviewed Dr. Martin\u2019s and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations. Dr. Martin\u2019s report stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>that Mink \u201cwas receiving a prescription for an antidepressant agent, Effexor-XR (150 mg, each morning).\u201d Further, Dr. Martin had reported Mink\u2019s statement that \u201cwithout the medication, [he\u2019d] be moody and reclusive, but with it [he\u2019s] okay.\u201d Moreover, prior to accepting Mink\u2019s pleas, the court asked him, \u201cAre you under the influence of any drug, alcohol or other medication that in any way would affect your ability to understand what we\u2019re doing here today?\u201d Mink replied, \u201cNo, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">{\u00b6 65} Crim.R. 11(C)(2) provides that a trial court \u201cshall not accept a plea of guilty * * * without first addressing the defendant personally and * * * (a) Determining that the defendant is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWY\">{\u00b6 66} Additional inquiry is necessary into a defendant\u2019s mental state once a defendant seeking to enter a guilty plea has stated that he is under the influence of drugs or medication. See <em>United States v. Damon </em>(C.A.4, 1999), 191 F.3d 561, 565; <em>United States v. Cole </em>(C.A.3, 1987), 813 F.2d 43, 47; <em>United States v. Parra-Ibanez </em>(C.A.1, 1991), 936 F.2d 588, 595; cf. <em>United States v. Dalman </em>(C.A.8, 1993), 994 F.2d 537, 539 (concluding that district court had no duty to make further inquiries about the nature of defendant\u2019s medication and its effects when he was questioned adequately about his medications and nothing in the record suggested that defendant was not \u201cfully in possession of his faculties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 67} During the guilty-plea inquiry in <em>Damon, </em>the defendant informed the trial court that, following a suicide attempt, he was taking an antidepressant medication. <em>Damon, </em>191 F.3d at 563. However, the court did not ask any followup questions about whether the medication had any actual effect on Damon\u2019s ability to enter a competent and voluntary plea, and it ultimately accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas. <em>Damon </em>found that the trial court erred when \u201cit failed to inquire about what effect, if any, Damon\u2019s medication had on his ability to make a voluntary plea and to understand the consequences.\u201d Id. at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 68} Unlike in <em>Damon, </em>before the trial court accepted Mink\u2019s pleas, it was aware that Mink was taking an antidepressant medication but had been found competent. Here, the trial court could reasonably assume that Effexor-XR did not affect Mink\u2019s competency, or Dr. Martin and Dr. Stookey would have said so in their evaluations. Moreover, the trial court obtained assurance from Mink, who was then acting as his own attorney, that the medication had no effect on his ability to understand the court\u2019s proceedings. Under these circumstances, the trial court could properly find that Mink entered a voluntary plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 69} Second, Mink claims that his plea of guilty was not knowing and voluntary because the trial court misadvised him about the legal concept of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b6 70} During the trial court\u2019s guilty plea inquiry, the trial court advised Mink of its sentencing responsibilities, and the following questioning ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cJudge Sunderland: Now, in the event that in any of these aggravated murder charges you are found guilty of the primary offense and you are found guilty of any one of the specifications to that particular charge, * * * the Court, the three-judge panel in this particular case, would then deliberate and decide * * * what penalty should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been over this with you before, but we\u2019ll go over it again, that the burden is on the State of Ohio to show ultimately * * * in the penalty phase that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. And if they do that, then the death penalty will be imposed. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cThe Defendant: I understand, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cJudge Sunderland: Do you understand what mitigating factors or what mitigation is?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe Defendant. Yeah, I do, Your Honor. It\u2019s items brought up in my defense to possibly offset any aggravating circumstances of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cJudge Sunderland: I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite in your defense, but it\u2019s as an excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cThe Defendant: Right, it\u2019s an excuse, exactly.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cJudge Sunderland: The defense would be brought up in the trial phase, and the excuse would be brought in the mitigation phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cJudge Sunderland: Let me read you a definition here: \u2018Mitigating factors are factors that, while they do not justify or excuse the crime, nevertheless in fairness and mercy, may be considered ... as they call for a penalty less than death, or lessen the appropriateness of a sentence of death.\u2019 Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cThe Defendant: I understand that, sir.\u201d (Ellipsis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">{\u00b6 82} In <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 527 N.E.2d 831, paragraph one of the syllabus, we stated that \u201c[m]itigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B) are not necessarily related to a defendant\u2019s culpability but, rather, are those factors that are relevant to the issue of whether an offender convicted under R.C. 2903.01 should be sentenced to death.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s shorthand definition of mitigation as an excuse for the crime strayed from the proper definition of mitigating evidence. See <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866. However, when reviewed in its entirety, the trial court\u2019s inquiry adequately advised Mink about mitigating evidence and did not mislead him.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 83} Further, questioning Mink about mitigating evidence was unnecessary during the Crim.R. 11(C) guilty-plea inquiry. Those questions were properly addressed later during the penalty phase of the trial. Before finding that Mink was competent to waive mitigation and allowing him to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, the trial court fully questioned Mink about mitigation during the <em>Ashworth </em>hearing. See <em>Ashworth, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d at 61, 67, 706 N.E.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 84} Finally, Mink argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to question him about the existence of possible mitigating factors, a failure that led Mink to conclude that he did not have much mitigation, resulted in a defective guilty plea. This claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 85} Crim.R. 11(C) does not require a trial court to question a defendant about the underlying facts of his mitigation before accepting his guilty plea. The <em>Ashworth </em>hearing was the appropriate forum to address defense mitigation, and the trial court questioned Mink about the strength of his mitigation during that hearing. Moreover, Mink does not challenge the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s inquiry during the <em>Ashworth </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 86} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 87} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In proposition of law VII, Mink recasts objections to his competency evaluations as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">{\u00b6 88} Reversal of convictions for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">{\u00b6 89} First, Mink complains that his counsel were deficient by failing to object to the appointment of clinical psychologists to perform his competency evaluation, since he was under a physician\u2019s care and was being treated with antidepressant medication. However, this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">{\u00b6 90} Nothing in the record suggests that either Dr. Martin or Dr. Stookey was incapable of fully evaluating the effects of antidepressants on Mink\u2019s competency. Moreover, an independent expert also examined Mink and informed defense counsel that Mink was competent. Thus, trial counsel were not deficient by relying on their expert\u2019s opinion that Mink was competent, particularly since the defense would have shouldered the burden of proving that Mink was incompetent. See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 164-165, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 12, 564 N.E.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 91} Second, Mink argues that his counsel were deficient by not objecting to his competency evaluation because the two psychologists had failed to examine Mink\u2019s medical and mental health records before concluding that he was competent. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 92} As discussed in proposition II, review of Dr. Martin\u2019s and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations confirms that they were thorough and complete. Both examiners conducted lengthy clinical interviews, obtained Mink\u2019s social and medical history, and administered a battery of psychological tests. Contrary to Mink\u2019s assertions, Dr. Martin addressed Mink\u2019s suicidal behavior and conducted further testing that showed that Mink was not preoccupied with suicidal thoughts. Dr. Stookey also interviewed Mink about suicide, but Mink denied the presence of spontaneous suicidal ideation. Dr. Martin also reported that Mink was taking 150 mg. of Effexor-XR. Although Dr. Martin did not specifically testify as to any possible effects of Effexor-XR on Mink\u2019s competency, defense counsel could reasonably presume that Dr. Martin would have discussed the effects of antidepressant medication on Mink\u2019s competency if they were a concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 93} Defense counsel also had the benefit of another independent psychologist\u2019s examination that found that Mink was competent. Under these circumstances, defense counsel were not deficient in failing to object to the adequacy of Dr. Martin\u2019s and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 94} Moreover, there was no prejudice. Mink has failed to make any claim that his medical or mental health records included any information that would have changed the results of his competency evaluations. Thus, it is purely speculative whether the psychologists\u2019 review of Mink\u2019s medical or mental health records would have made any difference in the outcome of his competency evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 95} Finally, Mink argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to assert his rights under international law. As discussed in proposition IX, Mink\u2019s rights under international law were not violated by imposition of the death penalty. Thus, his counsel were not deficient by failing to assert these rights at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 96} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 97} <em>Weighing and determination of the death penalty. </em>In proposition of law VI, Mink argues that the death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. We will address this argument during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>{\u00b6 98} <em>Sentencing opinion. </em>In proposition of law VIII, Mink argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion failed to consider his psychological problems as a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), the catchall factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">{\u00b6 99} The trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion evaluated Mink\u2019s history of ongoing depression as a mental disease or defect under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). The three-judge panel mentioned that Mink had been treated in psychiatric units of local hospitals on two occasions, completed a 28-day residential drug treatment program, and was taking antidepressant medication. However, it concluded that neither Mink\u2019s depression nor his substance abuse established that Mink lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 100} The panel\u2019s sentencing opinion attributed \u201csome weight\u201d to Mink\u2019s \u201congoing substance abuse\u201d as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) factor. However, the trial court failed to mention whether Mink\u2019s psychological problems had any mitigating weight as a possible (B)(7) factor. This was error. <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 345, 715 N.E.2d 136. However, during our independent review, we will correct this error. <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 124, 559 N.E.2d 710. Thus, proposition VIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 101} In propositions of law IX through XVIII, Mink raises various constitutional and treaty-related challenges against Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes. However, Mink failed to raise these claims at trial and thereby waived them. See <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, syllabus. Also, as discussed below, these challenges lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 102} In proposition of law IX, Mink claims that his execution will violate international law and treaties to which the United States is a party. However, these arguments lack merit. <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 69, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 103} In proposition of law X, Mink argues that Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutory scheme violates the United States and Ohio constitutional prohibitions against arbitrary and unequal punishment. These claims are without merit. First, prosecutors have indictment discretion. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 169, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. Second, Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme is not racially discriminatory. <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 124-125, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383. Moreover, Mink asserts nothing to show that he has been racially discriminated against. Finally, we have previously rejected claims that the death penalty is unconstitutional because it is neither the least restrictive punishment nor an effective deterrent. <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 168, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 104} In proposition of law XI, Mink claims that Ohio\u2019s death penalty-statutes are unconstitutional because of unreliable sentencing procedures. However, we have rejected these arguments on many previous occasions. See <em>State v. Esparza </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 8, 12-13, 529 N.E.2d 192; <em>State v. </em>Stumpf (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 104, 512 N.E.2d 598; and <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 172-173, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">{\u00b6 105} In proposition of law XII, Mink argues that Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes unconstitutionally fail to provide individualized sentencing because they require proof of aggravating circumstances in the guilt phase. This argument also lacks merit. See <em>Lowenfield v. Phelps </em>(1988), 484 U.S. 231, 108 S.Ct. 546, 98 L.Ed.2d 568; <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 28-29, 528 N.E.2d 1237; <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 178, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 106} In proposition of law XIII, Mink asserts that Ohio\u2019s death penalty scheme imposes an impermissible risk of the death penalty when a defendant exercises a right to a jury trial. We also find that this claim has no merit. See <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 138, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795, citing <em>State v. Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 195, 8 O.O.3d 181, 375 N.E.2d 784, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 107} In proposition of law XIV, Mink challenges Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes because R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) requires submission of defense-requested presentence investigations (\u201cPSI\u201d) and mental evaluations to the judge or jury. However, Mink declined a PSI and a mental-health evaluation prior to sentencing. Moreover, we have previously rejected these arguments. See <em>Buell, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 138, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 108} In proposition of law XV, Mink disputes the constitutionality of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), the felony-murder aggravating circumstance, because it repeats the definition of felony murder set forth in R.C. 2903.01(B). However, we rejected similar arguments in <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 178, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; see, also, <em>Henderson, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 28-29, 528 N.E.2d 1237; <em>Coe v. Bell </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 161 F.3d 320, 349-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 109} In proposition of law XVI, Mink argues that language in R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) is unconstitutionally vague because it gives the sentencer unfettered discretion to weigh a statutory mitigating factor (see R.C. 2929.04[B]: \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d) as an aggravator. We have also previously overruled this claim. See <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 453, 700 N.E.2d 596, citing <em>Tuilaepa v. California </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 967, 973-980, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 129 L.Ed.2d 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 110} We summarily reject Mink\u2019s challenge in proposition of law XVII to Ohio\u2019s death penalty proportionality review. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 111} In proposition of law XVIII, Mink challenges his death sentence because the trial court did not consider all of the evidence of mitigation in his case. However, Mink was found competent to waive mitigation, and thus <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 63, 706 N.E.2d 1231, applies. Also, the trial court, sua sponte, searched the record for mitigating evidence and considered such mitigation before imposing the death sentence. Thus, we also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 112} Having considered Mink\u2019s propositions of law as required by R.C. 2929.05(A), we now independently review Mink\u2019s death sentences for appropriateness and proportionality. The evidence established that Mink was properly convicted of the death penalty specifications for aggravated murder, namely murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) and a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d in killing two or more people under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 113} We now weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Mink made an unsworn statement but presented no other mitigating evidence during the penalty phase. However, the trial court reviewed Dr. Martin\u2019s and Dr. Stookey\u2019s competency evaluations and scoured the record for mitigating evidence before sentencing Mink to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 114} In his unsworn statement, Mink told the court, \u201c[i]t has been my intention all along * * * to enter guilty pleas on all counts.\u201d Mink expressed his appreciation to the court for accepting his guilty pleas and said, \u201cI do ask for the death penalty, to be handed a sentence of death. And that would be all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">{\u00b6 115} Other evidence that the court considered for mitigation showed that Mink was raised in the Dayton area and was the youngest of five children. Mink told Dr. Stookey that his mother was a \u201cvery forthright person\u201d who \u201cwore the pants in the family.\u201d She was reportedly a \u201cstrict disciplinarian\u201d who was, \u201cat the same time, fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">{\u00b6 116} Mink attended Dayton area public schools and graduated from Colonel White High School in 1982. He also completed one year of coursework at Sinclair Community College. Mink never married and lived at home with his parents \u201cmost of [his] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">{\u00b6 117} Mink was steadily employed with jobs at Kroger\u2019s for six years and Dayton newspapers for six years. He also worked for a gas company for four years until the summer of 2000. Mink claimed that he quit work because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cusing alcohol and drugs pretty heavily.\u201d ' Mink also mentioned that he had been arrested for driving under the influence in 1997 and for public intoxication about eight months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">{\u00b6 118} Mink started using marijuana at the age of 15 and started drinking alcohol and using cocaine when he was 25. Mink said his \u201caddiction built over time\u201d until he was using crack cocaine and alcohol on a daily basis. Mink also suffered from ongoing depression, which appeared to be related to his chemical dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 119} Mink was treated for depression in early 1999 at Good Samaritan Hospital\u2019s Crisis Care facility and was prescribed the antidepressant, EffexorXR. During the summer of 1999, Mink completed a 28-day residential drug treatment program. In April or May 2000, Mink was admitted for three days to the psychiatric treatment unit of Miami Valley Hospital because of his alcohol and drug use. He was briefly hospitalized in July or August 2000 because of an overdose of Alka-Seltzer Nite-Time medication and a couple of Ativans.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 120} Psychological testing showed that Mink was in the average to high average range of intelligence. Mink\u2019s verbal IQ was 98 on the Weehsler Adult Intelligence Seale-3d Edition (\u201cWAIS-III\u201d). Moreover, Mink did not exhibit symptoms usually associated with either mental illness or mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 121} We find that the statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable here, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(4) (youth of the offender; Mink was 37 at the time of the offenses); and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 122} We give some weight to the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) factor, since Mink has no \u201csignificant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications.\u201d However, Mink acknowledged that he had been arrested for driving under the influence in 1997 and public intoxication about eight months later. See <em>State v. D'Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 145, 652 N.E.2d 710 (lack of significant prior criminal record entitled to some weight despite two previous DUIs); cf. <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 306, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (lack of significant criminal background entitled to little weight, since defendant had five previous DUIs).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 123} Mink\u2019s history of depression does not qualify as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor because there was no evidence that Mink\u2019s condition caused him to lack \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct.\u201d See <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 508, 709 N.E.2d 484 (defendant\u2019s long-term depression did not establish the [B][3] mitigating factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">{\u00b6 124} However, under the catchall provision, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), we give weight to Mink\u2019s history of ongoing depression, his alcohol and crack cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>dependency, his attempts to address his drag and alcohol abuse problems through psychiatric and drug treatment programs. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 447, 721 N.E.2d 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 125} We also give some weight under (B)(7) to Mink\u2019s cooperation with the police and his guilty pleas. His \u201cwillingness to step forward and take responsibility for his actions, without any offer of leniency by the state, indicates a person who is remorseful for the crimes he has committed.\u201d <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 72, 706 N.E.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 126} However, Mink did not express any remorse for killing his parents during his unsworn statement. Moreover, Dr. Martin reported, \u201cMink informed me * * * that he was not preoccupied with any feelings of guilt or remorse about his actions at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d Mink argues that his actions speak much louder than his words in demonstrating remorse. However, Mink\u2019s actions fail to demonstrate remorse. After killing his parents, Mink stole money from them and sold his parents\u2019 personal belongings to purchase more crack cocaine and to support himself until he surrendered to the police. Nonetheless, Mink appears to recognize that he committed unspeakable crimes by pleading guilty, waiving mitigation, and requesting that he receive the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 127} We find that Mink\u2019s history, character, and background provide modest mitigating value. Mink graduated from high school, attended community college for about a year, and was gainfully employed for most of his adult life. Otherwise, his character offers no redeeming features.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 128} Furthermore, we find nothing in the nature and circumstances of these murders to mitigate Mink\u2019s offenses. In order to obtain funds to buy crack cocaine, Mink murdered both of his parents while they were asleep by repeatedly hitting them with a hammer, stabbing them, and strangling his mother with an electric cord. Mink then stole $7 from his father\u2019s wallet and used his mother\u2019s ATM card to obtain $10 to purchase crack cocaine. Over the next couple of days, Mink sold his parents\u2019 furniture and other personal belongings to obtain more drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 129} Upon weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors, we find that the aggravating circumstances as to each aggravated murder outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Mink\u2019s course of conduct and the robbery-murder of his elderly parents are grave circumstances. Moreover, the mitigating evidence pales in comparison to the aggravating circumstances of these murders. Mink\u2019s history and background and his lack of a significant criminal record, as well as the other mitigation, are easily outweighed by these serious aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">{\u00b6 130} We find that the death penalty imposed in this case is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with other \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d murders. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 145; <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 162; and <em>State v. Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 146, 174, 749 N.E.2d 226. It is also appropriate and proportionate when compared with the sentence in other robbery-murder cases. See <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 173; <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 124; and <em>State v.
