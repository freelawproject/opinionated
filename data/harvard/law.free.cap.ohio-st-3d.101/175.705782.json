Facts and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 1} The facts as alleged in the complaint are as follows. Bank One Trust Company N.A. (\u201cBank One\u201d) employed James L. Coryell from 1992 until the company terminated his employment in 2001. Coryell, who was 49 years of age at that time, was replaced by 42-year-old John Kozak.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 2} Coryell sued Bank One for wrongful termination under R.C. Chapter 4112. He claimed that by replacing him with someone substantially younger than himself, Bank One illegally discriminated on the basis of age.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted Bank One\u2019s Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings, reasoning that Coryell failed to set forth a prima facie case of age discrimination. Although Coryell was replaced by a younger employee, the trial court held that under <em>Barker v. Scovill, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 146, 6 OBR 202, 451 N.E.2d 807, a prima facie case can be established only if the plaintiff was replaced by an employee outside the class of individuals protected by R.C. 4112.14(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 3} Coryell appealed to the Franklin County Court of Appeals. He argued that regardless of class membership, a prima facie case of age discrimination may exist if the favored employee is \u201csubstantially younger\u201d than the protected employee, that he pled direct evidence of age discrimination, and that the trial court incorrectly applied a heightened standard by requiring him to plead detailed facts that evidenced his employer\u2019s discrimination rather than \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim\u201d showing his entitlement to relief. See Civ.R. 8(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">{\u00b6 4} Relying on our holdings in <em>Barker </em>and its progeny, the appellate court affirmed based upon Coryell\u2019s failure to plead a prima facie case via direct or indirect evidence. The court reasoned that the complaint fell short of a prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>facie case because Coryell did not plead that he had been replaced by an employee who was outside R.C. 4112.14(A)\u2019s protected class. The appellate court considered the issue of a heightened pleading standard moot because insufficient evidence of age discrimination had been pled under either standard. This case is now before us as a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">II. Statutory and Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 4112.02 sets forth unlawful discriminatory practices. It reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(A) For any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 4112.14(A) prohibits age discrimination in employment, and sets forth a protected class as follows: \u201cNo employer shall discriminate in any job opening against any applicant or discharge without just cause any employee aged forty or older who is physically able to perform the duties and otherwise meets the established requirements of the job and laws pertaining to the relationship between employer and employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 9} This court had held that absent direct evidence, to establish a prima facie violation of R.C. 4112.14(A) a plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate (1) that he or she was a member of the statutorily protected class, (2) that he or she was discharged, (3) that he or she was qualified for the position, and (4) that he or she was replaced by, or that the discharge permitted the retention of, a person not belonging to the protected class.\u201d <em>Kohmescker v. Kroger Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 501, 575 N.E.2d 439, syllabus (explaining and modifying paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Barker, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 146, 6 OBR 202, 451 N.E.2d 807). This test is a descendant of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, in which the United States Supreme Court promulgated an analytical framework for claims of race discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 10} Federal courts also have adapted the <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>framework to claims brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, Section 621 et seq., Title 29, U.S.Code. The ADEA, like R.C. 4112.14(A), protects persons aged 40 and older from age-based discrimination in employment. Section 631(a), Title 29, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>{\u00b6 11} In <em>O\u2019Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1995), 56 F.3d 542, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a 56-year-old plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because he had been replaced by someone who was also within the protected class. On appeal, a unanimous Supreme Court held, \u201cThe fact that one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in the protected class is * * * irrelevant, so long as he has lost out <em>because of his age.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>O\u2019Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp. </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 308, 312, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433. Further, in the age-discrimination context, an inference that an employment decision was based on an illegal discriminatory criterion \u201ccannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger. Because the AJDEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not class membership, the fact that a replacement is <em>substantially younger </em>than the plaintiff is a far more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 517 U.S. at 313, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 12} Primarily, Coryell argues that we should adopt <em>O\u2019Connor\u2019s </em>holding and determine that, regardless of class membership, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by demonstrating that the favored employee was substantially younger than he. Further, Coryell asks us to address what allegations are necessary to plead a prima facie case of age-based employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 13} Bank One counters that we have already twice rejected <em>O\u2019Comior </em>in <em>Mauzy v. Kelly Services, Inc. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 578, 664 N.E.2d 1272, and <em>Byrnes v. LCI Communication Holdings Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 125, 672 N.E.2d 145, and that class membership remains a necessary component of a prima facie claim. Alternatively, Bank One argues that an employee is not \u201csubstantially younger\u201d than another employee absent at least a ten-year difference in their ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">A. <em>Barker\u2019s </em>viability in light of <em>O\u2019Connor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 14} Preliminarily, Bank One errs by asserting that we have already rejected <em>O\u2019Connor. </em>While both <em>Mauzy </em>and <em>Byrnes </em>concerned age discrimination, the viability of <em>Barker\u2019s </em>fourth prong was not at issue in either case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>this case presents our first opportunity to consider whether O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201csubstantially younger\u201d test accurately reflects Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">{\u00b6 15} Although we are not bound to apply federal court interpretation of federal statutes to analogous Ohio statutes, we have looked to federal case law when considering claims of employment discrimination brought under the Ohio Revised Code. See, e.g., <em>Little Forest Med. Ctr. of Akron v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 607, 610, 575 N.E.2d 1164 (stating, \u201c[T]he requisite burdens of proof regarding particular evidentiary issues established by the federal courts are relevant in determining whether there exists reliable, probative and substantial evidence of discrimination in violation of R.C. Chapter 4112\u201d). Accordingly, we remain mindful of <em>O\u2019Connor </em>as we address Coryell\u2019s first proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 16} Coryell asserts that <em>Barker\u2019s </em>fourth prong unduly limits the protections afforded by R.C. 4112.14(A) by arbitrarily making class membership a more relevant concern than age-based animus. Coryell concedes that he cannot satisfy <em>Barker\u2019s </em>prima facie case requirements; however, he argues that this court should adopt <em>O\u2019Connor\u2019s </em>reasoning and hold that a prima facie case of age discrimination in violation of R.C. 4112.14(A) may exist if the protected employee is replaced by a substantially younger employee, regardless of class membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 17} Prima facie tests are mechanisms by which courts may readily dispose of cases that cannot sustain a particular cause of action. \u201c \u2018To say that a plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>case is simply to say that he has produced sufficient evidence to present his case to the jury, <em>i.e., </em>he has avoided a directed verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kohmescher, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 505, 575 N.E.2d 439, quoting <em>Rose v. Natl. Cash Register Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1983), 703 F.2d 225, 227. Further, \u201cthere must be at least a logical connection between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it establishes a \u2018legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>517 U.S. 308 at 311-312, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433, quoting <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, fn. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 18} A prima facie case standard requiring evidence that an employee\u2019s replacement is outside the protected class is logically disconnected from the employment discrimination that R.C. 4112.14(A) seeks to prevent. Essentially, R.C. 4112.14(A) prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of age. <em>Bark</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>er, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 147, 6 OBR 202, 451 N.E.2d 807. Thus, \u201cthe ultimate inquiry * * * [is] whether evidence of age discrimination is present in the case.\u201d <em>Kohmescher, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 504, 575 N.E.2d 439. Under <em>Barker, </em>a prima facie case could be established if the protected employee was age 40 and the favored employee was age 39. Coryell reasonably urges that <em>Barker </em>be modified, as age-based animus is no more likely under those facts than here, where the protected employee is age 49 and the favored employee is age 42.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the <em>Barker </em>test would permit a claim by the 40-year-old and yet preclude a claim by the 49-year-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 19} To acknowledge that R.C. 4112.14(A) is designed to prohibit age-based discrimination and then to hold that a claim must fail because although discrimination may have occurred, it occurred in favor of a class member thwarts the statute and tacitly condones the offensive conduct that it was intended to prevent. This inconsistency is remedied by replacing <em>Barker'</em>s fourth prong with a requirement that the favored employee be substantially younger than the protected employee. A \u201csubstantially younger\u201d test serves R.C. 4112.14(A)\u2019s purpose because it is logically connected to the discrimination that R.C. 4112.14(A) seeks to prevent. See <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>517 U.S. at 312-313, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, we hold that absent direct evidence of age discrimination, in order to establish a prima facie case of a violation of R.C. 4112.14(A) in an employment discharge action, a plaintiff-employee must demonstrate that he or she (1) was a member of the statutorily protected class, (2) was discharged, (3) was qualified for the position, and (4) was replaced by, or the discharge permitted the retention of, a person of substantially younger age.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">B. The \u201cSubstantially Younger\u201d Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 21} After <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>federal courts have held that various age differences are either substantial or insubstantial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most federal circuits, however, have not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>articulated an age difference that is presumptively substantial, but rather are deciding the issue on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The variety of these holdings underscores the elusiveness of an absolute definition of \u201csubstantially younger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 22} Like the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>court, we do not define \u201csubstantially younger.\u201d We do, however, impart the following caveat. When considering whether a favored employee is substantially younger than a protected employee, courts must keep in mind that the purpose of R.C. 4112.14(A) is to prevent employment discrimination on the basis of age, and that whether an employee is substantially younger is but a single factor in a broader analysis. The prima facie case method \u201cinvolv[es] the process of elimination, whereby the plaintiff may create an inference that an employment decision was more likely than not based on illegal discriminatory criteria.\u201d <em>Mauzy, 75 </em>Ohio St.3d at 584, 664 N.E.2d 1272. Courts must not \u201coverlook the ultimate inquiry in age discrimination cases, <em>ie., </em>whether [a] plaintiff was discharged on account of age.\u201d <em>Kohmescher, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 505, 575 N.E.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 23} While an objective standard would arguably lend greater predictability and consistency to age discrimination claims, it would fall to the same logic that defeats <em>Barker\u2019s </em>class distinction requirement. In other words, an arbitrary distinction between protected and favored employees\u2019 ages goes no further toward effectuating R.C. 4112.14(A) than class membership. The term \u201csubstantially younger\u201d as applied to age discrimination in employment cases defies an absolute definition and is best determined after considering the particular circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 24} While the \u201csubstantially younger\u201d factor vests significant discretion in the trial court, it is not uncommon for trial courts to exercise such discretion when confronted with a discrimination claim. The third <em>Barker </em>prong is subjective in that it requires a plaintiff to show that he was qualified for the position. Even whether discharge happened is not quite absolute, as the parties may dispute whether the protected employee left of his own volition or was forced to leave. See <em>Mauzy, 75 </em>Ohio St.3d 578, 664 N.E.2d 1272, paragraph four of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>syllabus (\u201cThe test for determining whether an employee was constructively discharged is whether the employer\u2019s actions made working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person under the circumstances would have felt compelled to resign\u201d). Further, if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the court must exercise discretion in determining whether the employer articulated a nondiscriminatory ground for the discharge. If so, the court wields yet more discretion in determining whether the purpose was a pretext for discrimination. Each of these links in the procedural chain vests significant discretion in the trial court to make largely subjective decisions. Trial courts make such decisions by applying the relevant factors in light of statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">C. Pleading Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 25} As to the requisite pleading standard to establish an age discrimination case, we adopt the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A. </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1. In <em>Swierkiewicz, </em>the Supreme Court held that because <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>set forth an evidentiary standard rather than a pleading standard, a prima facie case of age discrimination may be established by pleading \u201c \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 8(a)(2). Ohio\u2019s Civ.R. 8(A)(1) mirrors the federal rules virtually verbatim. Accordingly, we hold that a plaintiff may plead a prima facie case of age discrimination by pleading \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the party is entitled to relief.\u201d Civ.R. 8(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 26} In conclusion, a plaintiff may plead a prima facie case of age-based employment discrimination in violation of R.C. 4112.14(A) by pleading a short and plain statement of the claim, which includes an allegation that he was replaced by a person substantially younger than himself. Trial courts are vested with the discretion to determine, based on the circumstances of the case, whether an employee is substantially younger than a protected employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 27} The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b412-11\">F.E.

Coryell also alleged age discrimination in that his termination permitted the retention of a 36-year-old employee. The trial court, however, determined that although the retained employee was outside the protected class, he was not \u201csimilarly situated in all respects,\u201d and thus, Coryell failed to establish all elements necessary to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. Coryell did not challenge this aspect of the trial court\u2019s ruling on appeal.

Because the General Assembly has not felt the need to legislatively overrule what this court has historically held, I believe that the law as established in <em>Barker </em>and its progeny is a clear indication of Ohio\u2019s public policy. \u201c[Legislative inaction in the face of longstanding judicial interpretations of [a statute] evidences legislative intent to retain existing law.\u201d <em>State v.
