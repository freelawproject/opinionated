Because none of Scott\u2019s ten propositions of law are well taken, we overrule them and affirm his convictions; further, after independently weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and comparing his sentence to those imposed in similar cases, as required by R.C. 2929.05(A), we also affirm the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 2} The circumstances that gave rise to these convictions began during the early morning hours of August 24, 1999, as Scott, then 22 years of age, and his friends, Michael Wilson and Ryan Allen, walked from the Canton Centre Mall toward the apartment of Amber Harsh, one of Scott\u2019s girlfriends. Dallas Green, who did not know Scott or his friends, drove past them, and Scott shouted, \u201cHey,\u201d prompting Green to stop his vehicle. Green exited his vehicle and waited for the three to join him.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 3} The four men began talking. Green told them \u201cabout the party he was going to at his girl friend\u2019s, stuff like that.\u201d As their conversation continued, Green started talking as if the others \u201cwere his girlfriends.\u201d He pointed at Scott, Allen, and Wilson, telling each, \u201c[Y]ou are my bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 4} After talking for about a half hour, Green returned to his vehicle and got inside. Scott approached Green and asked for a ride. Green responded that \u201che couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Scott then asked Green for the time. When Green turned his head to look at the clock on the dashboard, Scott pointed a .22 caliber handgun at him, said, \u201c[N]ow who the bitch mother fucker,\u201d and then shot Green twice in the back and once in the left cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 5} Green drove off, but after traveling a few blocks, collided with a parked vehicle near the Old-Timer\u2019s Club on Tenth and Ross Streets. He later died at Mercy Medical Center from the gunshot wounds inflicted by Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 6} After shooting Green, Scott fled the scene with Wilson and Allen and went to Harsh\u2019s apartment. There, Scott emptied the shell casings from the handgun and threatened Wilson and Allen that he would shoot them if they told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>anybody about the shooting. Allen and Wilson later explained that they had failed to report the crime because they feared for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">{\u00b6 7} Thereafter, Scott asked his friend, Todd Jewell, whether he had ever heard of Dallas Green, and Jewell said that he had not. Jewell asked Scott whether Green had been killed, and Scott said, \u201cYeah.\u201d On a later occasion, as Jewell and Scott drove near the Old-Timer\u2019s Club, Scott pointed and stated, \u201c[T]his is where I killed Dallas at.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 8} In early September, Scott mentioned to Jewell that he wanted to test-drive a vehicle and kill the owner. Despite Jewell\u2019s protest that Scott did not have to kill anyone in order to steal a car, Scott reiterated his idea during a later conversation with Jewell and another friend, Dustin Hennings. Hennings also told Scott that he could steal the car without killing anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 9} After these conversations, on Friday, September 10, 1999, Scott, one of his girlfriends, Kerry Vadasz, and Jewell saw a Ford Probe with a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign in the -window parked in the front yard of Ryan Stoffer\u2019s grandmother on Dryden Avenue in Canton, Ohio. Scott wrote down the telephone number and told Jewell that he wanted to call the owner, take the car for a test drive, have Vadasz drive, and shoot the owner from the back seat. Scott then called the number and arranged to test-drive the vehicle the next day. As Jewell drove Scott to test-drive the vehicle, Scott again mentioned that he wanted to follow through with his plan to kill the owner and steal the car. Scott asked Jewell to drive the Probe, but Jewell declined, stating that he did not know how to operate a standard transmission vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, Scott and Jewell met Stoffer, who took them for a test drive that afternoon. Scott then told Stoffer that he wanted his girlfriend to look at the car and that he would call him on Sunday to make arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 11} The following Sunday afternoon, Vadasz called Stoffer from the home of Scott\u2019s brother, Anthony Scott, and arranged to meet Stoffer at Stoffer\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house in Canton, Ohio. Jewell then drove Scott and Vadasz to Canton but did not accompany them on the test drive. Brenda Stoffer, Ryan Stoffer\u2019s mother, watched her son, Scott, and Vadasz get into the car, thinking that they would return after a short test drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 12} Vadasz drove the Probe, Stoffer sat in the front passenger seat, and Scott rode in the back seat. She drove the car for the next hour and a half. As time passed, Stoffer provided directions on how to return to his grandmother\u2019s house, but ostensibly because Vadasz had little experience with driving a standard transmission, Scott told her to keep driving until she got used to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 13} Scott eventually removed a .22 caliber handgun from his pants pocket and placed it on the seat. According to his confession to the police, \u201c[a]fter about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ten minutes, [he] just lifted [the gun] up and sat it back behind the head rest of [Stoffer\u2019s] chair. And just left it sittin\u2019 there for like two more minutes.\u201d Scott then fired six shots into the back of Stoffer\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">{\u00b6 14} Afterward, Scott and Vadasz dumped Stoffer\u2019s body in a secluded, wooded area and then drove to a friend\u2019s home to clean up. They placed plastic trash bags on the front passenger seat so that Vadasz would not get blood on her, and then Scott drove to her home in Akron, where they parked Stoffer\u2019s car in her garage. Later that evening, Scott telephoned Jewell and reported killing Stoffer and dumping his body in the woods. According to Jewell, Scott said that \u201che shot him once, and afterwards he kind of freaked out and he put the other five bullets in the gun into his head.\u201d Scott then asked Jewell to \u201chelp him bury the body,\u201d but Jewell refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 15} Later that evening, Scott and Vadasz returned to Canton in Stoffer\u2019s Probe. While there, Scott talked about the shooting with Jewell and Hennings. Hennings remembered Scott\u2019s saying that \u201che just put the gun behind the boy\u2019s head and pulled the trigger once, and he said then he emptied the whole clip in the same hole in the back of his head through the padding of the seat.\u201d Scott also mentioned that he had left the gun at Vadasz\u2019s home in Akron. Scott and Vadasz eventually returned to Akron, and on Monday morning, Scott drove the Probe to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 16} When Stoffer did not return from the test drive Sunday evening, his mother called the police. Her husband had informed her that the people who took the test drive had called and said that \u201cthey don\u2019t want the car; they don\u2019t have the money.\u201d The Stoffer family heard nothing further about Stoffer until the following Wednesday when the sheriffs department informed them that his body had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 17} On Monday, the day after Stoffer\u2019s murder, Jewell telephoned Scott and advised him that he had seen a news report about Stoffer\u2019s disappearance on television. In response, Scott stated, \u201cI am going to get rid of this thing, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d Scott and Vadasz then cut the bloody seatbelt out of the Probe and threw it into a sewer across the street from Vadasz\u2019s apartment. They also put on latex gloves and tried to \u201cwipe everything off\u2019 the Probe.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 18} Scott then drove the Probe toward Hartville and \u201cditched the car\u201d near a vacant building. Before leaving, he squirted lighter fluid on the front seat, back seat, and dashboard but could not set the car ablaze, as neither he nor Vadasz had matches. The two then walked back to Akron.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 19} On Tuesday, September 14, the police obtained Stoffer\u2019s telephone records showing that on the day of the test drive, a telephone call had been made to the Stoffer home from Anthony Scott\u2019s residence. When the police contacted him, Anthony reported that Scott and Vadasz had used his phone on that date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Anthony later told Scott what he had told the police, and Scott replied that \u201che was thinking about killing [Anthony] and [his] girlfriend and [his] kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 20} On the same day, the police received an anonymous telephone call linking Scott to Green\u2019s murder. Until they received that call, Scott had not been a suspect in that murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 21} The next day, a representative from the Stark County Sheriffs Office and the Canton Police Department arrested Scott. Yadasz cooperated with law enforcement by leading them to Stoffer\u2019s body and his car and by consenting to a search of her home. During that search, police recovered a .22-caliber Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson revolver, a box of .22-caliber ammunition, and bloodstained clothing belonging to Scott. They also recovered the seatbelt from the Probe that had been thrown into the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 22} Police Lieutenant Michael Firth interviewed Scott about Stoffer\u2019s murder. Scott provided a detailed confession consistent with the facts outlined herein. Detectives then asked him about Green\u2019s murder. He initially denied any involvement but then blurted out, \u201c[0]kay, I did it,\u201d and provided a detailed account of Green\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 23} The Stark County Grand Jury subsequently returned a seven-count indictment against him, charging him with the murder of Dallas Green, the aggravated murder of Stoffer with prior calculation and design, the aggravated murder of Stoffer while committing kidnapping and/or aggravated robbery, the aggravated robbery of Stoffer, the kidnapping of Stoffer, and two counts of possession of a firearm while under a disability. The first five counts also included firearm specifications. Additionally, the two counts of aggravated murder each contained the following three death penalty specifications: murder while committing or attempting to commit an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and murder as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Prior to trial, Scott pled guilty to the two counts of possession of a firearm while under a disability; the court then conducted a jury trial on the remaining counts and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b6 24} At trial, the state presented Scott\u2019s confession, the eyewitness testimony of Allen and Wilson, and other corroborating evidence, including forensic evidence linking Scott to the murders of Green and Stoffer. The defense presented no evidence during the guilt phase of trial. After closing arguments, the court instructed the jury, and, following its deliberations, the jury returned verdicts finding Scott guilty of all counts and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">{\u00b6 25} During the penalty phase of the aggravated murder conviction, Scott called 13 witnesses and offered additional documentary evidence of his chemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>dependency, of the child abuse he had suffered until age four, and other mitigating circumstances. In rebuttal, the state called a probation officer who testified that Scott had not missed any of 23 scheduled appointments and had only once tested positive for marijuana between March 15 and September 15, 1999. Following its penalty-phase deliberations, the jury recommended that Scott be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Stoffer. The court followed the recommendation and imposed the death penalty upon Scott. It also sentenced him to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 15 years to life for the murder of Green, three years on each of two firearm specifications, ten years for the aggravated robbery conviction, ten years for the kidnapping conviction, and one year on each of the two counts of having a weapon while under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 26} From that judgment, Scott appeals as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 27} Scott separately challenges the sufficiency and the manifest weight of the evidence with respect to each death-penalty specification: murder while committing kidnapping, murder while committing aggravated robbery, and murder as part of a course of conduct involving the killing of two or more persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 28} Regarding the kidnapping specification, Scott contends that the record contains insufficient evidence of animus for the kidnapping separate from the animus for the aggravated murder. He further urges us to find that his conviction on that specification is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Scott makes the same arguments with regard to the aggravated robbery specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b629} Regarding the course-of-conduct specification, Scott argues that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence of a nexus between the Green and Stoffer murders, in that they occurred 19 days apart and involved different sets of circumstances, i.e., he spontaneously killed Green without robbing him, but he planned to kill Stoffer and take his vehicle. He uses this same rationale in arguing that this conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 30} Although both are raised by Scott in one proposition of law, a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence is different from a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">{\u00b6 31} A claim of insufficient evidence invokes a due process concern and raises the question of whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541; <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. In reviewing such a challenge, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 32} A claim that a jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, on the other hand, involves a separate and distinct test that is much broader. \u201c \u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 33} Here, the record refutes Scott\u2019s sufficiency challenges. In addition to Scott\u2019s confession, in which he admitted driving around Canton with Stoffer for an hour and a half, while Stoffer kept directing Vadasz to drive toward his grandmother\u2019s house, killing him, and taking his vehicle, the state presented corroborating evidence of the kidnapping and the robbery. The state\u2019s evidence included the bloodstained seatbelt, Stoffer\u2019s body, the murder weapon, ammunition, the stolen vehicle, and testimony by Stoffer\u2019s mother that Stoffer anticipated that the test drive, transaction, and drive home from his grandmother\u2019s house would take less than an hour, all of which support the conclusion that, after construing that evidence most strongly in favor of the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found Scott guilty of the kidnapping and aggravated robbery specifications. See <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 349, 595 N.E.2d 902 (prolonged restraint was not incidental to murder and clearly constituted a separate and distinct act).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe \u2018course of conduct\u2019 specification applies to multiple murders that an offender commits as part of a continuing course of criminal conduct, even if the offender does not necessarily commit them as part of the same transaction.\u201d <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 71; see, also, <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 304-305, 533 N.E.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 35} Here, after killing Green, Scott threatened to kill Wilson and Allen if they told anyone about the murder; both testified that they had failed to report that killing because they had feared for their safety. Scott later bragged to Jewell that he had killed Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 36} On several occasions after the Green killing, Scott told his friends that he planned to test drive a vehicle, kill the owner, and take the car. He then induced one of his girlfriends to help him carry out his plan; he killed Stoffer and, thereafter, told Jewell that he had done so. And, he also threatened to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>his own brother, Anthony, and Anthony\u2019s girlfriend and children after Anthony provided incriminating evidence to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">{\u00b6 37} While Scott argues that killing Green was separate and distinct from killing Stoffer, the pattern of conduct he exhibited in the spontaneous execution of Green for no apparent reason, his bragging about that killing, and the threats he made to those who could report it, combined with his forecast of the Stoffer murder, the cold-blooded manner in which he carried it out, the threats he made surrounding that killing, and his bragging to Jewell about it, all suggest a deliberate effort by Scott to earn a reputation as an indiscriminate killer bent on enhancing his influence in the community by causing others to fear him. Accordingly, construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the state, a rational trier of fact could have found Scott guilty of the course-of-conduct specification, and therefore, the trial court did not err in overruling Scott\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 38} Regarding Scott\u2019s manifest-weight challenges to the three death-penalty specifications, Scott did not present any evidence during the guilt phase of trial; consequently, no evidence contradicts his confession establishing these specifications or the evidence corroborating them. Accordingly, after carefully reviewing the record, weighing the evidence, and considering the credibility of the witnesses, we cannot say that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in finding the three death-penalty specifications proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the foregoing, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 40} Scott argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to testimony about his having had sexual intercourse with Amber Harsh after killing Green denied him effective assistance of counsel. He contends that the testimony not only prejudiced him during the guilt phase of trial but also incited the jury to recommend the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 41} To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Scott must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance fell below the objective standard of reasonable competence and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for such deficiency, the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 42} Here, the record reflects that after shooting Green, Scott went with Allen and Wilson to Harsh\u2019s apartment. Wilson testified that he thought Scott and Harsh had had sex in her bedroom that night. Allen then corroborated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Wilson\u2019s testimony. Scott\u2019s counsel did not object to the testimony. Although an objection might have been sustained, counsel\u2019s failure to object does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel under the <em>Strickland </em>test. Other evidence presented by the state, including Scott\u2019s confession to the police and to his Mends, established his guilt of the charges. Given this evidence, Scott has not met his burden under <em>Strickland </em>to demonstrate that the outcome of the trial would have been different if his counsel had objected to the testimony about his sexual relations on the night he killed Green. Further, Scott\u2019s claim that this testimony incited the jury to recommend the death penalty is merely conjecture. Accordingly, Scott\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not well taken, and we therefore overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>Sympathetic Outbursts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 43} Scott claims that the trial court erred in overruling his motions for mistrial regarding crying by Stoffer\u2019s family members during trial, which, he argues, enhanced jury sympathy for Stoffer and his family, thereby depriving him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 44} A capital trial generates strong emotion and \u201ccannot be squeezed dry of all feeling.\u201d <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 408-409, 613 N.E.2d 203; <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 440, 709 N.E.2d 140. Accordingly, a trial court must determine, as a question of fact, whether an emotional outburst in a murder trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial by improperly influencing the jury. <em>State v. Benge </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 144, 661 N.E.2d 1019; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 255, 513 N.E.2d 267; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 38, 32 O.O.2d 21, 209 N.E.2d 215, syllabus. \u201cIn the absence of clear, affirmative evidence to the contrary, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 255, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 45} Here, prior to the state\u2019s presenting any witnesses, the defense objected to Brenda Stoffer\u2019s remaining in the courtroom after she testified. Brenda was the mother of one of the victims, and the defense argued that the introduction of photographs, the victim\u2019s clothing, and graphic testimony would inevitably cause her to cry in the jury\u2019s presence and thereby prejudicially affect Scott\u2019s ability to be fairly tried. The trial court overruled the objection and permitted her to remain in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 46} During Jewell\u2019s testimony, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, asserting that Mrs. Stoffer had been crying and that some of the jurors had also cried. The prosecutor agreed that at least one of the jurors had cried. The court overruled the motion, stating, \u201c[F]rom my vantage point I neither heard nor observed Mrs. Stoffer becoming emotional at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 47} Thereafter, when Harry Campbell, an investigator from the coroner\u2019s office, testified, defense counsel again informed the court that Stoffer\u2019s family members were crying and that the jurors were watching them. Based on this conduct, the defense again moved for a mistrial, which the court denied because it did not \u201cnotice[e] any disruption whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 48} Thus, any emotion exhibited by Stoffer\u2019s family members did not create a disruption observable by the trial court judge. Moreover, the court cautioned jurors to focus on the evidence and to disregard extrinsic matters in their decisionmaking. Accordingly, the court did not err in overruling Scott\u2019s motions for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">SETTLED ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"ALt\">\n<em>Reasonable Doubt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 49} Scott challenges the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction and the definition of reasonable doubt contained in R.C. 2901.05. This court, however, has previously rejected this challenge. <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 232, 594 N.E.2d 604; <em>State v. Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 195, 8 O.O.3d 181, 375 N.E.2d 784, paragraph two of the syllabus. Consequently, this proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\n<em>Consecutive Sentences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">{\u00b6 50} Scott asserts that the trial court lacked the authority to impose prison sentences consecutive to his death sentence. We rejected this argument in <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 142. See, also, <em>State v. Moore </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 38, 689 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 52, 630 N.E.2d 339. As noted in these cases, the prison sentence is rendered moot by the execution of the defendant\u2019s death sentence. Thus, this proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">{\u00b6 51} We next address Scott\u2019s contention that Ohio\u2019s proportionality review is unconstitutional. Specifically, he urges that a meaningful proportionality review should include cases resulting in life imprisonment after a capital-sentencing hearing, as well as those resulting in the imposition of the death penalty. We have consistently held that the proportionality review required by R.C. 2929.05(A) is satisfied by a review of cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 118, 684 N.E.2d 668; <em>State v. Steffen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus. Consequently, these propositions of law are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 52} Additionally, Scott argues that R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), which allows the jury to consider \u201c[a]ny other factors\u201d as potential mitigating factors, is unconstitutional because it \u201cpermit[s] the sentencer to convert the defendant\u2019s (B)(7), or \u2018catchall,\u2019 mitigation into reasons for <em>imposing </em>the death penalty.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) And he alleges that the court\u2019s jury charge, which followed the statutory language, exacerbated these flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 53} We have previously considered and overruled these arguments. See <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 298, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 129-131. Further, the trial court did not lead the jurors to believe, through its instructions or otherwise, that other mitigating factors could be used to justify the death penalty. Accordingly, we overrule this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 54} Separately, Scott challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes, and we summarily reject these challenges. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 606-608, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AAA\">\n<em>Concession of Guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">{\u00b6 55} Although Scott did not raise the issue, we note that during opening statement, defense counsel conceded Scott\u2019s guilt to all of the offenses and death-penalty specifications, except the course-of-conduct specification, giving rise to the question of whether Scott received effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">{\u00b6 56} As previously discussed, in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance fell below the objective standard of reasonable competence and that there exists a reasonable probability that, but for such deficiency, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus. Furthermore, a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that, under the circumstances, the decision might be considered sound trial strategy. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c \u2018Concessions of guilt, in any form, are among the most troublesome actions a defense counsel can [t]ake * * *.\u2019 <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>St.3d 331, 336, 703 N.E.2d 1251, 1258. Nevertheless, such concessions are not <em>per se </em>ineffective but must be analyzed under <em>Strickland </em>for deficiency and prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 337, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 58} Here, prior to trial, defense counsel moved to have the Green and Stoffer murders tried separately, but the court denied the motion. Having lost that position, defense counsel stated during his opening statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cWe would tell you that there is no question in this case that the evidence will support findings of guilty to the charges in the indictment. We do not intend to contest that evidence. Mr. Scott confessed to these matters almost immediately upon being contacted by police. The evidence of guilt is quite clear. We don\u2019t intend to take issue with the elements of the offenses except for one of the specifications, and that is the course of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 60} With these concessions, counsel focused the jury\u2019s attention on Scott\u2019s most plausible defense: the state\u2019s inability to prove the course-of-conduct specification. Had Scott succeeded in obtaining an acquittal on that specification, he would have strengthened his appellate challenge to the court\u2019s denial of his request to have the Green and Stoffer cases tried separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">{\u00b6 61} Additionally, by conceding Scott\u2019s guilt to those charges for which the state had overwhelming evidence of guilt, including Scott\u2019s confession, counsel enhanced his credibility with the jury to plead for Scott\u2019s life. See, generally, <em>Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 337, 703 N.E.2d 1251. Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that defense counsel\u2019s decision to concede guilt to all but the course-of-conduct specification was not a rational trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">{\u00b6 62} Furthermore, given the overwhelming evidence of Scott\u2019s guilt, even if counsel\u2019s performance did fall below the objective standard of reasonable competence in that regard, there is not a reasonable probability that, but for the deficient performance, the outcome of the trial would have been different. Accordingly, Scott cannot demonstrate a denial of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\n<em>Erroneous Advice on Making an Unsworn Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">{\u00b6 63} Defense counsel misadvised Scott regarding the consequences of making an unsworn statement during the penalty phase of trial, telling him: \u201cIf you make that unsworn, oral statement, the prosecutors are permitted to comment on the fact that you, quote, didn\u2019t have the courage to get on the witness stand, wouldn\u2019t subject yourself to cross-examination, and make other argument to the jury indicating, you know, their disdain for your unsworn, oral statement.\u201d After being so advised, Scott declined to make an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cA defendant\u2019s unsworn statement is often a critical part of defense mitigation.\u201d <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 110. A prosecutor\u2019s right to comment on a defendant\u2019s unsworn statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>however, is limited. See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 120, 666 N.E.2d 1099. \u201c[T]he prosecution may comment that the defendant\u2019s statement has not been made under oath or affirmation, but such comment must be limited to reminding the jury that the defendant\u2019s statement was not made under oath, in contrast to the testimony of all other witnesses.\u201d <em>DePew </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 65} Here, defense counsel misadvised Scott that the prosecutor could express disdain for his unsworn statement and unfavorably comment upon Scott\u2019s lack of courage to testify under oath and subject himself to cross-examination. See <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 40, 565 N.E.2d 549. Counsel\u2019s actions, however, do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel under the <em>Strickland test. </em>Cf. <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 524-525, 584 N.E.2d 715 (defense counsel\u2019s misadvice on parole eligibility during plea bargaining constituted deficient performance, but not prejudicial error).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>Exclusion of mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 66} Although Scott has not challenged the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude information regarding the minimum and maximum sentences he could receive for his noncapital offenses and its refusal to permit him to refer to these potential sentences during the penalty-phase closing argument, we review this issue sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cIn Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, mitigating factors are facts about the defendant\u2019s character, background, or record, or the circumstances of the offense, that may call for a penalty less than death.\u201d <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 448, 709 N.E.2d 140. However, \u201c[t]he length of incarceration to be served by the defendant before parole eligibility is not a fact about the defendant\u2019s character or background, or about the circumstances of the offense.\u201d Id.; see, also, <em>O'Dell v. Netherland </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 151, 162-168, 117 S.Ct. 1969, 138 L.Ed.2d 351. Accordingly, information about sentences for noncapital offenses is not a mitigating factor with regard to the Eighth Amendment. <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">{\u00b6 68} Furthermore, the term of imprisonment for noncapital offenses is not a mitigating factor pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) that requires the sentencer to consider and weigh against the aggravating circumstances \u201c[a]ny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d If such penalties were considered to be mitigating factors, then the more noncapital offenses a defendant committed, the greater would be the mitigation. This is an illogical conclusion, which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>{\u00b6 69} Accordingly, in the present case, the trial court did not err by excluding information and argument about the minimum and maximum sentences Scott could receive for his noncapital offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 70} The evidence established that Scott was properly convicted of three death penalty specifications for aggravated murder: murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); and murder as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>Mitigation Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 71} During the penalty phase of trial, Scott called 13 witnesses and introduced documentary evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 72} Kathleen Thompson, a social service worker for the Stark County Department of Human Services, testified that the department had arranged for Scott\u2019s placement in the Canton, Ohio, foster home of Katherine Wilson in 1981 because his mother had abused him. His mother had beaten him with a belt and punched him with her fists, causing hearing loss and damage to a kidney. Human Services placed Jason and Anthony, Scott\u2019s two brothers, into a separate foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">{\u00b6 73} Scott adjusted to living with Wilson but continued to live separately from his brothers. Approximately four years after being placed in foster care, Scott exhibited behavioral problems, such as destroying other children\u2019s toys. He also had hearing problems, requiring tubes to be surgically inserted into his ears. Later that year, Scott\u2019s behavioral problems worsened, and he injured another boy with a screwdriver. When Scott was eight and a half years old, he \u201curinat[ed] on the wall * * *, pull[ed] his pants down, [and] act[ed] out\u201d at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">{\u00b6 74} The following year, although Wilson loved Scott and had bonded with him, Human Services removed him from Wilson\u2019s home because of \u201chis acting out behavior and because of Mrs. Wilson\u2019s declining health and inability to handle [Scott].\u201d At that time, Human Services placed him with the Scott family, and they later adopted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">{\u00b6 75} Lisa Ann Hall, a foster child at the Wilson home when Scott lived there, testified that Wilson and Scott had had a very close relationship, \u201cjust like a regular mother and son.\u201d She explained that, because of the abuse that Scott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>had suffered, Wilson \u201cjust kind of took him under her wing more so than the other kids. He was shown a lot of attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">{\u00b6 76} Jerry Schweitzer, a chemical-dependency counselor, provided Scott\u2019s mother, Julia, counseling after she was admitted into the Interval Brotherhood Home, a long-term, inpatient drug and alcohol treatment center in Akron. Julia indicated that she began using drugs and alcohol at 18 years of age. According to Julia, her drug and alcohol abuse became problematic at the age of 21 because \u201cshe was staying out on the streets and not taking care of her baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 77} Patrice Turner, Julia\u2019s neighbor in 1979, witnessed Julia\u2019s treatment of Scott and babysat for him when he was about three years old. Turner testified that Julia had called Scott a \u201clittle bastard\u201d and had told him that \u201cshe didn\u2019t want him.\u201d Turner also had observed marks on Scott\u2019s body where Julia had \u201chit him with the belt\u201d and stated that most of the time, it looked as if he had been beaten with the buckle end. According to Turner, as a result of the physical abuse, Scott had \u201cbruises on his legs, his hands and things like that.\u201d She also noted that Scott\u2019s face had sometimes been \u201cbruised up\u201d and that he had had cigarette burns on his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 78} Turner testified that when Julia used drugs or alcohol, she would scream at her children and become violent. For example, Julia \u201cwould hit them, blame them for something that maybe a man had did to her or somebody else.\u201d Additionally, because Julia would run out of food near the end of the month, Turner often fed Scott and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 79} Larry Perretta, a retired psychologist for Canton City Schools, testified that he evaluated Scott in 1985 because Scott had exhibited academic difficulties and behavioral problems. At that time, Scott, a second-grade student, had been held back in school for one year. Testing showed that Scott had an IQ of 86 on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, which placed him in the low-average range. Scott further scored 85 for reading and spelling and 94 for arithmetic on other aptitude tests for which scoring is similar to that of the IQ test. Results of the Woodcock Johnson Psycho-educational Battery Test showed Scott to be \u201cslightly below his ability level in the reading, spelling, written language areas and right in line with or slightly above his ability level in math.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 80} Scott had not qualified for special education services because there had not been a sufficient discrepancy between his ability and achievement levels. Perretta, however, noted that Scott had appeared to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) because he had difficulty sitting still and maintaining concentration in class and would often pester other students. Thus, Perretta had recommended that Scott continue to receive counseling and that he have a medical evaluation to determine whether he had ADHD.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>{\u00b6 81} In March 1987, a psychologist reevaluated Scott, then nine years old, due to his \u201congoing behavioral problems.\u201d Teachers had reported that Scott \u201cexperienced problems in the lunch room, on the playground, [and] coming to and from school where he was occasionally physically aggressive toward other students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 82} At that time, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children showed Scott to have an IQ of 92, similar to his earlier results. Scott\u2019s human-figure drawing test showed normal cognitive functioning and some indications of aggression. On the \u201chands test,\u201d a test that involves showing a child a series of pictures of hands in various positions and asking the child to describe what the hands are doing, Scott gave a high number of \u201cacting-out type responses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 83} As a result of the evaluation, professionals recommended that he be placed in a more structured classroom environment because of his difficulty with self-control. Additionally, Perretta testified that it had again been recommended that Scott receive a medical evaluation, and he was placed on medication and assigned to a class for the learning disabled the following year. An addendum to the 1987 report indicated that Scott\u2019s behavior had improved when he took his medication, and he had eventually returned to a normal classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 84} Timothy Shaughnessy, a licensed independent social worker and a mitigation specialist, testified that the Stark County Department of Human Services had acted incompetently by failing to provide adequate supervision of Julia and failing to ensure Scott\u2019s and his brothers\u2019 safety at home. According to Shaughnessy, social-service workers failed to act on numerous complaints about Julia\u2019s abuse and neglect of Scott, despite having previously removed Scott\u2019s older brother, Kelly, from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 85} During the time that Scott lived with Julia, social workers found her home littered and dirty and noticed a lack of food in the house. They also received complaints that Julia beat her children and frequently left them home alone. On one occasion, social workers visiting her home saw marijuana cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 86} In June 1981, when questioned by social workers about belt marks on Scott\u2019s body, Julia maintained that \u201c[s]he was going to continue using the belt because it worked, [and] that was the only way to make him listen.\u201d During the next three months, social workers received additional reports that Julia physically abused Scott and his brothers and, in September, observed bruises and scabs on Scott\u2019s arm and back and a lump on his back near his kidney. Julia admitted that she had hit Scott with the belt because he had refused to go to bed. The following month, after Julia admitted hitting him again, Human Services placed Scott, then four years old, into foster care with Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>{\u00b6 87} In Shaughnessy\u2019s opinion, Wilson provided Scott with a loving home; however, Wilson\u2019s age, chronic illness, and responsibility for a large number of other children living with her limited the amount of attention Wilson could devote to Scott. According to Shaughnessy, Scott also lacked a male role model.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">{\u00b6 88} When Scott was ten years old, the Scott family took him into their home, reunited him with his brothers, and adopted him. The Scotts lived in a nice neighborhood and provided him with a stable and loving home environment. Scott also attended church with his family, who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 89} The Scotts were strict parents and set high standards for Scott. When Scott was a teenager, tensions developed between him and his parents over their rules. Scott began experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Further, church elders denied his request to be baptized because they felt that he did not behave properly. Soon after his 18th birthday, Scott left his parents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 90} Shaughnessy testified that in his opinion, Scott then became dependent upon alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Moreover, Scott had a genetic predisposition for chemical dependency because several close relatives, including his mother, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, suffered from drug and alcohol addictions. According to Shaughnessy, Scott used drugs and alcohol as \u201ca way to cope with his pain, with his abusive childhood, his despair of * * * being yanked around from home to home, person to person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 91} Shaughnessy further testified that, according to Scott, by late 1997, he had been consuming a fifth of whiskey on a daily basis up until two days before his arrest on murder charges. Despite these facts, Scott claimed to have been sober on the day of the crimes against Stoffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 92} Bruce Sampsel, a clinical psychologist, evaluated Scott in 1986 after he had been referred for treatment by the Canton City Schools. According to Sampsel, Scott displayed a lack of control and disrespect for authority. He also developed a \u201cneediness\u201d relating to the absence of a father figure and his mother\u2019s abandoning him. After meeting with Scott on 37 occasions, Sampsel concluded that Scott had moderate to severe problems controlling his behavior and following rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 93} Frederick Scott and his wife adopted Scott\u2019s two younger brothers and later adopted Scott, then 11 years of age. Scott adapted well to the family; however, Mr. Scott noticed a change in his behavior when he turned 17 years of age. Then, a couple of days after his 18th birthday, Scott dropped out of high school and moved out of his parents\u2019 home. At trial, Mr. Scott maintained that despite the current situation, he would not abandon his son because \u201cthere was an attachment made there that goes beyond life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>{\u00b6 94} Tanise Michelle Scott, Scott\u2019s sister, was 12 or 13 years old when Scott moved into the family home. She had had a good relationship with him, which she attributed to their closeness in age. She related that, at 18 years of age, Scott began having problems with their parents because \u201che wanted to do what he wanted to do\u201d and made a poor choice of friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 95} Bettie J. Scott explained that she and her husband had adopted Scott and his brothers because they loved them. The Scotts developed a good relationship with Scott until he was approximately 17 years old. At that point, Scott began making bad decisions, including his choice of friends. Despite her opposition, he left home to be with some of his friends. The Scotts did not know where he lived after leaving their home and had scant contact with him thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 96} Jason Scott considers his brother Scott to be his best friend and continues to maintain as much contact with him as possible. Jason declared the day Scott left home to be the \u201c[w]orst day of [his] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 97} Dr. Robert Smith, a court-appointed psychologist, evaluated Scott and concluded that he was sane and competent to stand trial. He diagnosed Scott as suffering from \u201c[attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder; dysthymia, which is a form of depression; and borderline personality disorder.\u201d Dr. Smith indicated that Scott had suffered from these disorders at the time he committed the offenses. Additionally, Dr. Smith diagnosed him as alcohol and cannabis dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">{\u00b6 98} Julia Mae Williams testified that on July 23, 1977, she gave birth to Scott, who was premature and weighed only two pounds, two ounces. Julia related that Scott\u2019s natural father, Michael Dean Turner, had gone to the penitentiary when Scott was two years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">{\u00b6 99} Julia admitted abusing Scott, including striking him with a switch, and smoking marijuana about every other day. She attended programs to combat her drug and alcohol problems and claimed to have never missed a meeting. These addictions, however, led her to neglect her children and eventually caused her to lose custody. She supported her drug and alcohol use by stealing, engaging in prostitution, and selling food stamps. She has a felony conviction for receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">{\u00b6 100} Scott neither testified nor made an unsworn statement during the penalty phase of trial. In allocution, however, Scott acknowledged that he failed to \u201cever really think about the consequences\u201d of his actions and that he \u201ctook responsibility for what [he] did, and to [him] that\u2019s the main key.\u201d He also apologized to the Stoffer and the Green families.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\n<em>Rebuttal Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 101} David Kollar, a Stark County law enforcement officer, contacted Scott weekly between March 15 and September 15, 1999. During that period, Scott tested positive for marijuana on only one of eight occasions. Further, the day after Green\u2019s murder, he tested negative for drugs. Kollar also testified that Scott had not missed any of his 23 scheduled appointments and that he had never exhibited any signs of drug or alcohol use during these meetings. Further, Scott worked sporadically for a temporary-employment service.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 102} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the aggravated murder of Stoffer to be mitigating. Scott killed Green, threatened to kill Allen and Wilson if they told anyone about the murder, and then bragged to Jewell about the killing. He subsequently informed his friends of his plan to steal a car and kill the owner. Scott then carried out the plan and shot Stoffer six times in the back of the head and took his vehicle. These facts establish a premeditated murder committed during aggravated robbery and kidnapping and as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two persons. The murder lacks any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">{\u00b6 103} Scott\u2019s history, background, and character, however, provide some mitigation. His birth mother, a habitual drug user, abused him and paid little attention to his welfare. These experiences traumatized Scott; however, at four years of age, Scott began living with a loving and caring foster mother. For the next six years, she took care of most of his needs. Later, the Scott family reunited him with his two brothers and eventually adopted him. The Scotts loved him and provided a stable home environment. Despite living with these caring families for the majority of his childhood, Scott left home at 18 years of age, dropped out of high school, and became a drug and alcohol abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">{\u00b6 104} After carefully reviewing the record, we find that the following statutory mitigating factors are inapplicable: R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (inducement by victim); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(3) (mental disease or defect); (B)(5) (lack of a criminal record); and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">{\u00b6 105} Because Scott was 22 years old at the time of the offenses, the R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) (youth of the offender) mitigating factor is entitled to some weight. See <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 452, 751 N.E.2d 946; <em>State v. White, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 454, 709 N.E.2d 140; but, cf., <em>State v. Ballew </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 257, 667 N.E.2d 369 (\u201cR.C. 2929.04[B][4] [youth] [is] entitled to little weight, since Ballew was twenty-two at the time of the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">{\u00b6 106} Moreover, although Scott\u2019s mental disorders do not qualify as mental diseases or defects within the meaning of R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), his ADHD, dysthy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>mia, borderline personality disorder, and chemical dependency are entitled to some weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), as they undoubtedly played a role in his crimes. See <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 610, 734 N.E.2d 345 (antisocial and borderline personality disorder entitled to \u201csome weight\u201d under [B][7]); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 123, 723 N.E.2d 1054 (defendant\u2019s personality disorder and drug dependence entitled to very little weight in mitigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">{\u00b6 107} Significantly, the record indicates that Scott does not suffer from mental retardation. Two separate intelligence tests determined his IQ to be 86 or 92. Accordingly, his execution is not barred by <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335; see, also, <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 108} In conclusion, Scott\u2019s youth, his early childhood, his mental disorders, and his history of drug and alcohol abuse are entitled to weight in mitigation. These factors, however, are outweighed by the aggravating circumstances of aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and course of conduct in killing Green and Stoffer. Accordingly, after thoroughly reviewing the record and upon an independent weighing, we hold that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 109} Finally, we find that imposing the death penalty in this case is proportionate to death sentences approved in similar cases: for course-of-conduct murders, see <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439; <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 715 N.E.2d 1144; for kidnapping-murders, see <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 274, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Ballew, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 244, 667 N.E.2d 369; <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 653 N.E.2d 285; and for aggravated-robbery-murder cases, see <em>State v. Jackson, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 436, 751 N.E.2d 946; <em>State v. Stallings, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 280, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 709 N.E.2d 128. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the death sentence in the present case is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 110} Accordingly, we affirm Scott\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b280-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b280-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A98\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">{\u00b6 111} As I have stated before, \u201cthe constitutional purpose of statutory aggravating circumstances is to narrow the class of murderers to those deserving society\u2019s ultimate punishment, the death penalty.\u201d <em>State v. O'Neal </em>(2000), 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Ohio St.3d 402, 421, 721 N.E.2d 73 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting), citing <em>Zant v. Stephens </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 862, 877, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 77 L.Ed.2d 235. This court\u2019s broad interpretation of the course-of-conduct death specification in this case calls into question whether under that interpretation that death specification fulfills its constitutional purpose of narrowing the class of murderers deserving the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s decision to permit the jury to consider the course-of-conduct death specification in this case is inextricably related to its decision to allow the two murder counts to be tried together. Though it is impossible to show that being presented with evidence of both murders influenced the jury\u2019s decisions, it is equally impossible to show that it did not. I believe that holding a dual trial, however economical of judicial resources, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 113} This court\u2019s continued reluctance to establish a clear standard for determining whether two murders occurred as part of a course of conduct will only result in more course-of-conduct cases like this one. The two murders were unrelated, occurred 19 days apart, and involved two people that had no relation to each other. The two murders were not committed in a similar way, were not committed in the same transaction, and were not committed for a common reason. In short, the only thing the two murders had in common was the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 114} The majority\u2019s conclusion that the two murders were part of a course of conduct because Scott was making a \u201cdeliberate effort * * * to earn a reputation as an indiscriminate killer\u201d is cursory. I do not blame the prosecutor for bringing the course-of-conduct charge. I blame this court for not setting an appropriate standard for determining what constitutes a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 115} I have been in the majority in several decisions upholding a sentence of death based, at least in part, on a course-of-conduct death specification when the facts supported the specification. See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 749 N.E.2d 226 (defendant committed two murders in the same house, at approximately the same time, and in a similar manner); <em>State v. Awkal </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 667 N.E.2d 960 (defendant killed two people at the same time with the same weapon); and <em>State v. Dunlap </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 308, 652 N.E.2d 988 (defendant committed second murder ten days after the first murder, while committing a robbery to facilitate his flight from the law). The two murders in this case were not committed as part of a course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">{\u00b6 116} Furthermore, there was ample evidence to support other death-penalty specifications, rendering the course-of-conduct specification unnecessary. I would reverse the course-of-conduct death specification. I dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ai\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>John D.
