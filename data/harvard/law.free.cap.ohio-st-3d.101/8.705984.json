On November 1, 2002, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness of the Supreme Court held a hearing on the application. Applicant testified in his own behalf and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>questioned by the panel. No other witnesses appeared. The hearing record and exhibits before us disclose the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 2} Applicant was born and educated in India. After earning a law degree there, applicant was admitted to practice law in the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana in 1986. Applicant practiced law in India until coming to the United States in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 3} On February 9, 1998, applicant filed an application to register as a candidate for admission to the practice of law in Ohio. As part of his application, applicant completed the character questionnaire prescribed by the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness pursuant to Gov.Bar R. I(2)(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 4} On January 12, 1999, applicant was interviewed by two members of the Admissions Committee of relator, the Toledo Bar Association. The interviewers concluded that they could not approve applicant without further information concerning applicant\u2019s education and employment history and what they believed to be a misdemeanor charge against him. The interviewers also questioned whether applicant\u2019s command of the English language was adequate, inasmuch as applicant did not appear to fully understand questions put to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 5} On March 29, 1999, applicant filed an application to take the July 1999 bar examination, along with the supplemental character questionnaire required by Gov.Bar R. I(3)(B)(4). Because applicant\u2019s character and fitness were not approved in time, applicant was denied permission to take the July 1999 examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 6} On August 22, 2001, applicant filed an application to take the February 2002 bar examination. On October 23, 2001, applicant was interviewed by two different members of relator\u2019s Admissions Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 7} Both interviewers recommended against accepting applicant for admission to the practice of law. Neither questioned applicant\u2019s character or moral qualifications. However, both questioned whether applicant\u2019s English was good enough to enable him to practice law competently in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 8} Despite the unfavorable recommendations of the interviewers, relator\u2019s Admissions Committee approved applicant. The committee chairman explained that the interviewers had expressed no concerns about applicant\u2019s honesty or character. In the chairman\u2019s opinion, the concerns that the interviewers had raised about applicant\u2019s English skills were \u201cnot relevant to the mandate of the committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">{\u00b6 9} Subsequently, the board invoked sua sponte its investigative authority to conduct a hearing into applicant\u2019s character, fitness, and moral qualifications to practice law. See Gov.Bar R. I(10)(B)(2)(e). Applicant was denied permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>take the February 2002 examination because the investigation was not completed in time. As noted above, the hearing was held on November 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 10} At the hearing, the panel was particularly concerned with applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that he had once applied for a license to practice law in California and his failure to disclose details of a lawsuit against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The 1992 California Bar Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 11} In July 1992, applicant took the California bar examination. He failed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 12} Question 12(b) on the character questionnaire asks: \u201cHave you ever held or applied for a license or certificate, including but not limited to any license or certificate to practice law in any jurisdiction, the procurement of which required proof of good character?\u201d In his 1998 application to register, applicant checked \u201cYes.\u201d Question 12(b) further asks the applicant to provide details \u201cas to <em>each </em>license or certif\u00edcate,\u201d including \u201cwhether the license or certificate has been <em>refused </em>or revoked.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In responding to this part of the question, applicant mentioned only his 1986 license to practice law in Punjab. He did not disclose that he had been refused a license to practice law in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">{\u00b6 13} Question 7(a) on the supplemental character questionnaire asks: \u201cSince registering as a candidate for admission to the practice of law, have you held or applied for a license or certificate, including but not limited to any license or certificate to practice law in any jurisdiction, the procurement of which required proof of good character?\u201d Questions 7(b)(i)-(vi) again ask for details \u201cas to each license or certificate.\u201d On his 1999 application for examination, applicant answered Question 7(a) \u2018Tes.\u201d On Question 7(b), he again mentioned his attorney\u2019s license in Punjab \u2014 and again failed to disclose that he had applied for a California license.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 14} On his 2001 application, applicant finally disclosed that he had applied for a California license. However, he responded inaccurately to Question 7(b)(iii) on the questionnaire by giving July 1992 as the date on which he had been <em>granted </em>a California license.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">{\u00b6 15} At the hearing, applicant admitted that he was not a member of the California bar and that he had failed the July 1992 California bar examination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Applicant blamed his inaccurate response to Question 7(b)(iii) on a legal secretary who had typed the application for him. However, he conceded that he had failed to review that page of the application before signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 16} Applicant also responded inaccurately to Question 7(b)(v) on his 2001 application by stating that a California license had not been \u201crefused or revoked.\u201d At the hearing, applicant explained that he had not interpreted the words \u201crefused or revoked\u201d in Question 7(b)(v) as encompassing denial of an application for failure to pass the bar examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The Wisconsin Traffic Accident Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 17} In 1991, applicant was involved in a two-car accident in Wisconsin. The occupants of the other vehicle sued applicant in the Wisconsin courts and obtained a judgment against him in the amount of $14,463. According to applicant, he never received notice of the lawsuit against him. When applicant learned that a judgment had been entered against him, he consulted an attorney, who advised him to file a bankruptcy petition. Applicant ultimately received a discharge in bankruptcy. However, he took no steps to vacate the judgment against him for lack of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 18} Question 13(a)(1) on the character questionnaire asks an applicant to \u201c[sjtate whether you have ever been, or presently are, a party to or otherwise involved (except as a witness) in * * * any civil or administrative action or legal proceeding.\u201d On his 1998 application, applicant answered this question \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 19} On Question 14(a) of his 1998 application, applicant disclosed that he had filed a bankruptcy petition. He added the following note: \u201cIn the amount of $14,000.00 due to car accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 20} An applicant who answers \u201cyes\u201d to any part of Question 14 is instructed to \u201cexplain the facts in detail\u201d on a separate sheet, including specific information about any court proceedings. Applicant did not follow this instruction. However, in response to a subsequent query from the National Conference of Bar Examiners (\u201cNCBE\u201d), applicant submitted a letter and documents regarding the bankruptcy and automobile accident. Applicant\u2019s letter mentioned the existence of a judgment against him, although he did not provide the specific information called for on the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 21} At the hearing, applicant appeared to have trouble understanding the difference between having the judgment against him vacated and having the judgment debt discharged in bankruptcy:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cMR. MICHELSON [panel member]: * * * [0]nce you understood there was a judgment, did you take any steps to go back and vacate that judgment because you did not have notice?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes, I did. When I found there was a judgement [sic] decided against me then I went to attorney and then I told him this thing was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThen he told me we have one way, to file bankruptcy and to show these documents to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b626} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: So your attorney\u2019s advice was not to try and vacate the judgement [sic], but to just file bankruptcy?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: And you did that?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: Was it at the bankruptcy hearing that the bankruptcy judge discharged the debts and that was the end of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: Nobody ever vacated the judgment, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cMR. DOLAN [panel chairman]: Do you know what he means when he says, vacate the judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cMR. SINGH: Actually, dismissed the judgment that you need not to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: That sounds like a discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-20\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: Is that what you understand to have happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cMR. SINGH: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-23\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b242-24\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: But do you know what I mean when I say, vacate judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-25\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cMR. SINGH: What do you mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-26\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: It means vitiate judgement, eliminate it, make it no judgment. In other words, make the judgement as if it never happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-27\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cMR. SINGH: He said only you need not pay any debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-28\">{\u00b647} \u201cMR. MICHELSON: So you never took any steps to vacate the judgment, just discharge the debts?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>{\u00b6 48} \u201cMR. SINGH: No, I did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 49} Applicant also seemed to think that by granting him a discharge, the bankruptcy judge had ruled on the merits of the state-court lawsuit:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThey [the plaintiffs] asked to pay this judgment for medical. They put fake medical, there were only two people traveling in the car and they put medical, four people medical in the accident. So I show the police that I brought in to the Judge when I filed the bankruptcy, this thing is going on and it\u2019s totally bogus medical, so he decided on white paper that it\u2019s okay to not pay people because they totally making up.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c* * * [H]e decided on my favor that this medical is totally fake * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c* * * I think, I don\u2019t know, I believe the judgement [sic] and bankruptcy that Judge decides in my favor that this is totally bogus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 53} In his letter to the NCBE, applicant stated that he was a student at the time of the traffic accident. However, his questionnaires did not reflect that he was enrolled in any school in 1991. In fact, they did not indicate how applicant was occupied between 1989, when he arrived in the United States, and 1995, when he became a schoolteacher in Milwaukee. At the hearing, applicant stated that his parents had supported him during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 54} The panel concluded that applicant had failed to prove his fitness to practice law. \u201cIn particular, the Panel found that the Applicant did not have the ability to communicate clearly with clients, attorneys, courts and others.\u201d This conclusion was based on applicant\u2019s difficulty understanding the questions on the application and the questions put to him at the hearing. In addition, the panel found, applicant\u2019s answers at the hearing \u201cwere often vague and not responsive,\u201d and he appeared to lack clear understanding of the purpose of the hearing, the issues, and his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 55} Although the panel found that the applicant failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating his fitness to practice law, the panel believed that applicant might be able to satisfy the fitness standard in the future. The panel therefore recommended that applicant be allowed to reapply to take the bar examination after 18 months, provided that he \u201cfulfills the requirements of the application from the beginning.\u201d The full board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendations, including the requirement that applicant wait for 18 months before reapplying to take the bar examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">{\u00b6 56} We adopt the findings and conclusions of the board. Applicant was required to prove his fitness, as well as his character, by clear and convincing evidence. In our judgment, he has not met that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">{\u00b6 57} The board was correct to distinguish the concept of fitness from that of character. Our precedents teach that the concept of fitness to practice law is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>limited to the applicant\u2019s moral fitness. Compare <em>In re Application of Mort </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 260, 560 N.E.2d 204 (applicant\u2019s mental health considered as affecting fitness to practice law); <em>In re Application of Bower </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 429, 605 N.E.2d 6 (same).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ak\">Satnam Singh, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Al\">Spiros Cocoves, for Toledo Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 58} In light of this applicant\u2019s deficiencies in speaking and writing English and in comprehending the speech and writing of others, we share the board\u2019s doubts about his fitness to practice law. Communication skills are central to the practice of law. The questionnaires submitted by applicant show that he had difficulty understanding and following instructions written in English. The hearing transcript shows that he had equal difficulty understanding questions put to him orally in that language. Applicant\u2019s confusion regarding the bankruptcy proceedings illustrates how his imperfect command of English could handicap him in practicing law, to the possible detriment of his clients. Moreover, his problems with understanding what he reads and hears are matched by his problems in communicating his own thoughts to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 59} Accordingly, we deny applicant permission to take the Ohio bar examination at the present time. In time, however, applicant\u2019s education and intelligence may enable him to overcome the language barrier that now stands in his way. Therefore, applicant may file a new application to take the bar examination; however, he may not file his application until 18 months have elapsed from the date of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\">. The panel and board also expressed concern about applicant\u2019s failure to disclose an arrest. On Question 13(a)(2) of the character questionnaire, an applicant is asked to disclose \u201cwhether you have ever been, or presently are, a party to or otherwise involved (except as a witness) in * * * any criminal or quasi-criminal <em>action or legal proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although applicant was once arrested, applicant stated to the panel that no charge was filed against him. There is nothing in the record to contradict applicant\u2019s assertion. Hence, no \u201ccriminal or quasi-criminal <em>action or legal proceeding\u201d </em>resulted from applicant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
