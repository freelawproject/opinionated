Rademacher suffered a work-related injury on July 1, 1996, and a workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed. Claimant had surgery for one of the allowed conditions in November 1996. On December 18, 1996, appellee-employer Marriott International, Inc. wrote a letter to claimant\u2019s doctor. In it, Marriott addressed the possibility of claimant returning to work:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">{\u00b6 2} \u201c* * * By the time of her appointment next week, Ms. Rademacher will be six weeks post-op for her knee and we would like to address the issue of her possibly returning to a transitional duty position.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cMarriott is very proactive in returning their associates to work after a work related accident. We are able to modify an injured associate\u2019s present job duties, or to create a new job that will be within a doctor\u2019s approved restrictions. We have been very successful with this approach and ask for your opinion on whether Ms. Rademacher can return to work in a light duty capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c* * * [W]e will willing[ly] accommodate any restrictions that are placed on Ms. Rademacher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">{\u00b6 6} It is unclear whether claimant\u2019s attending physician, Dr. Edward J. Berghausen, answered this letter. It does appear that he notified Marriott that claimant needed surgery for another allowed condition, but that it was being postponed due to her pregnancy. Marriott wrote to Dr. Berghausen again on January 22, 1997, repeating its request for information regarding claimant\u2019s work restrictions and the possibility of her performing light-duty work.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">{\u00b6 7} A C-84 Physician\u2019s Report indicates that Dr. Berghausen examined claimant on February 10, 1997. On that date, he released claimant to light-duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>work with the limitation that she not lift objects over 20 pounds and limit her kneeling, bending, and climbing to one hour per day. Claimant does not deny that she was told of her release and restrictions at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 8} The following day, February 11, 1997, claimant called Chuck Butler, operations director for Marriott. She told him that she had moved out of state because of a new employment opportunity for her husband and that she was, therefore, resigning effective immediately. Marriott received Dr. Berghausen\u2019s completed work-release form a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 9} In 1998, claimant moved for temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d) for three periods: (1) May 4, 1997, through July 6, 1997, (2) October 17, 1997, through November 29, 1997, and (3) December 30, 1997, through August 1, 1998. Appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio denied her request for compensation after finding that claimant had voluntarily abandoned her position of employment at Marriott on February 11, 1997. Claimant did not appeal that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 10} In August 2000, this court released its decision in <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 376, 732 N.E.2d 355. <em>Baker </em>dramatically changed workers\u2019 compensation law by declaring that a claimant who voluntarily left his or her position of employment for a new position was no longer foreclosed from TTC if the claimant subsequently reaggravated the injury while working at his or her new job. Presumably, this decision prompted claimant to again move for TTC, this time covering the period August 2, 1998, through August 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 11} TTC was again refused. The commission reiterated that claimant had voluntarily abandoned her position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">{\u00b6 12} Claimant filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in denying TTC. The court of appeals disagreed, concurring in the commission\u2019s characterization of claimant\u2019s departure from Marriott as a voluntary abandonment of her position of employment. Moreover, the court held that because claimant had not worked after leaving Marriott, <em>Baker </em>did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 13} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">{\u00b6 14} Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, the issue before us is not the characterization of claimant\u2019s separation from Marriott as voluntary or involuntary. That issue is res judicata, having been resolved by the commission when claimant filed for TTC in 1998. Instead, the only matter before us is whether <em>Baker </em>applies. We find that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Baker </em>preserves TTC eligibility following a voluntary departure from a position of employment only when the claimant left the position to accept a new job and then reaggravates the injury while working at his or her new job. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>case, claimant was not employed during the period for which she moved for TTC. <em>Baker </em>does not, therefore, apply, eliminating any TTC entitlement for the requested period.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMWM\">Weisser &amp; Wolfe and Lisa M.
