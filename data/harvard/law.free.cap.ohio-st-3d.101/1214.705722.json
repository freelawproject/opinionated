City of Painesville et al. <em>v. </em>City of Mentor.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b672-6\">[Cite as <em>In re Disqualification of Mitrovich, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-7358.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b672-9\">(No. 03-AP-010</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4H\">Decided March 10, 2003.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b672-11\">Moyer, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">{\u00b6 1} This affidavit of disqualification was filed by Eli Manos, counsel for defendant city of Mentor, seeking the disqualification of Judge Paul H. Mitrovich from further proceedings in the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">{\u00b6 2} As grounds for Judge Mitrovich\u2019s disqualification, affiant refers to an unrelated 1997 case, <em>Richard M. Osborne et al. v. City of Mentor. </em>There, Judge Mitrovich voluntarily recused himself because he and his brother, or a company in which they had an interest, had purchased land from Richard Osborne. However, that transaction occurred more than five years ago and there has not been any further business relationship between Judge Mitrovich or his brother and members of the Osborne family. Further, it is unrefuted that in the case now before Judge Mitrovich, Richard Osborne does not have an interest in any of the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">{\u00b6 3} Affiant\u2019s second argument for disqualification concerns a 1998 case, <em>Deborah M. Lane v. City of Mentor, </em>where affiant again represented the city of Mentor. Affiant claims that in his opinion granting an injunction against the city of Mentor, Judge Mitrovich used \u201cintemperate language\u201d concerning the city of Mentor, and that the court of appeals disapproved of that language in a decision reversing Judge Mitrovich. Although affiant attached the judge\u2019s opinion and the court of appeals\u2019 decision, affiant did not specify the alleged \u201cintemperate\u201d language, nor did he indicate what he considered to be the appellate court\u2019s disapproval of the language. My own review of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion reveals no such reference to \u201cintemperate language\u201d in the opinion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">{\u00b6 4} An affidavit must describe with specificity and particularity those facts alleged to support the claim of bias or prejudice. It is not this court\u2019s duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>speculate as to what language the affiant considers \u201cintemperate\u201d or where the appellate court \u201cdisapproved\u201d of the trial judge\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 5} For the foregoing reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The cause shall continue before Judge Mitrovich.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
