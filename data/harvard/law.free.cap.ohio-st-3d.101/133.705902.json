Cammon claimed that he was entitled to the writ because of (1) defective jury verdict forms, (2) a judgment entry of conviction that had an unsigned second page, (3) improper jury instructions, (4) a racially discriminatory jury-selection process, (5) the erroneous admission of \u201cother acts\u201d evidence, and (6) a double-jeopardy violation based on the imposition of multiple sentences for the same conduct. Brigano moved to dismiss Cammon\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">{\u00b6 3} On August 6, 2003, the court of appeals granted Brigano\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Cammon\u2019s claims are not cognizable in habeas corpus. See <em>Smith v. Mitchell </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 624, 625, 687 N.E.2d 749 (jury instructions and verdict forms); <em>In re Coleman, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 284, 2002-Ohio-1804, 767 N.E.2d 677, \u00b6 3-4 (discrimination in jury selection); <em>Davie v. Edwards </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 170, 170-171, 685 N.E.2d 228 (admissibility of evidence); <em>Thomas v. Huffman </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 266, 267, 703 N.E.2d 315 (double jeopardy); <em>Howard v. Randle, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 281, 2002-Ohio-2122, 767 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 6 (sentencing errors).
