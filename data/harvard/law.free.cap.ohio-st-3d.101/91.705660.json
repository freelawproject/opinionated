Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 355, 175 N.E. 586. The only error claimed in the notice of appeal that is properly before this court would result in an opinion that the commission erred in finding that the renewed motion to alter access recovery charges filed by Verizon in the commission proceedings amounted to an untimely request for rehearing. Such an opinion would be of little consequence to the parties in this appeal. Moreover, there are a number of rate-review proceedings available to Verizon in which it can pursue its rate complaints that were improperly raised in this appeal. See, e.g., R.C. 4909.18. Hence, we dismiss Verizon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-6\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.
