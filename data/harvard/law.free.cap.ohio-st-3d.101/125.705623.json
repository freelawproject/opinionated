He later sought additional allowance of two other shoulder conditions. That request eventually resulted in a lawsuit in the Lucas County Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 2} While that litigation was pending, respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio considered claimant\u2019s application for determination of percentage of permanent partial disability (\u201cPPD\u201d). All three medical reports before the commission evaluated claimant\u2019s as yet nonallowed conditions and his allowed injury but did not attribute a separate disability percentage to claimant\u2019s allowed injury. Claimant\u2019s application was denied:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c[T]he conditions of right shoulder impingement and aggravation of preexisting osteoarthritis right shoulder are pending allowance in Common Pleas Court. Therefore, pursuant to Industrial Commission Policy Memo E.7 no permanent partial impairment percentage may be currently awarded for those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer further finds insufficient break-down of the medical impairments to ascertain what percentage of impairment is related to the right shoulder/arm strain/sprain.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTherefore, no percentage is awarded at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 6} Claimant\u2019s petition in mandamus is now before this court, asking us to find that Memo E7 is invalid and to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate the above order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 4121.31 requires the commission to adopt rules concerning procedures for decision making:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) The administrator of workers\u2019 compensation and the industrial commission jointly shall adopt rules covering the following general topics with respect to this chapter and Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(1) Rules that set forth any general policy and the principal operating procedures of the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation or commission, including but not limited to:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c* * * \u2018(b) Procedures for decision-making[.]\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>{\u00b6 11} R.C. 4121.32 requires the commission to supplement its rules with an operating manual:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) The rules covering operating procedure and criteria for decision-making that the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation and the industrial commission are required to adopt pursuant to section 4121.31 of the Revised Code shall be supplemented with operating manuals setting forth the procedural steps in detail for performing each of the assigned tasks of each section of the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation and commission. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(C) The bureau and commission jointly shall develop, adopt, and use a policy manual setting forth the guidelines and bases for decision-making for any decision which is the responsibility of the bureau, district hearing officers, staff hearing officers, or the commission. Guidelines shall be set forth in the policy manual by the bureau and commission to the extent of their respective jurisdictions for deciding at least the following specific matters:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(8) Determining the percentage of permanent partial disability * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 17} Consistent with these directives, the commission developed a Hearing-Officer Manual. It included Memo E7, the subject of this litigation, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Industrial Commission shall not process a C-92 Application [for determination of percentage of PPD] during the pendency of the original allowance in Court under O.R.C. 4123.512. If a question of an additional allowance is in Court, there is jurisdiction to hear a C-92 as it relates to the original conditions allowed in the claim that are not being contested in Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">{\u00b6 19} Memo E7 is based on two things. First is the established case law that nonallowed conditions can never factor into a compensation award. <em>State ex rel Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018. Second is R.C. 4123.512, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(H) An appeal from an order issued under division (E) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code or any action filed in court in a case in which an award of compensation has been made shall not stay the payment of compensation under the award or payment of compensation for subsequent periods of <em>total </em>disability during the pendency of the appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">{\u00b6 21} Because the word \u201cdisability\u201d is modified by the word \u201ctotal,\u201d we read the statute as authorizing the commission to stay the payment of <em>partial </em>disability compensation during pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">{\u00b622} The claimant at bar seeks PPD compensation. The three medical reports before the commission evaluated claimant\u2019s as yet nonallowed conditions together with his allowed injury, and did not designate the percentage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>disability related to claimant\u2019s allowed injury alone. This, in and of itself, supported the commission\u2019s denial of compensation under <em>Waddle. </em>The staff hearing officer\u2019s order, however, also relied on Memo E7 and, in so doing, generated this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 23} Claimant attacks Memo E7, asserting that it was not promulgated in accordance with R.C. Chapter 119 and is therefore invalid. The commission and respondent employer, Johnson Controls, Inc., argue that Memo E7 falls outside R.C. Chapter 119\u2019s purview. We agree with respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. Chapter 119 establishes the procedure for the adoption, amendment, or rescission of rules. The procedure is intended to permit \u201ca full and fair analysis of the impact and validity of a proposed rule,\u201d <em>Condee v. Lindley </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 90, 93, 12 OBR 79, 465 N.E.2d 450, by \u201c \u2018providing] an opportunity for opponents of a proposed regulation to express their views as to the wisdom of the proposal and to present evidence with respect to its illegality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. v. Shank </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 16, 24, 567 N.E.2d 993, quoting <em>Ohio Grape Growers, Vintners &amp; Bottlers Assn. v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1961), 115 Ohio App. 243, 245, 20 O.O.2d 320, 184 N.E.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. Chapter 119 governs \u201crules,\u201d which are statutorily defined as \u201cany rule, regulation, or standard, having a general and uniform operation, adopted, promulgated, and enforced by any agency under the authority of the laws governing such agency, and includes any appendix to a rule.\u201d R.C. 119.01(C). It does not, however, include \u201cany internal management rule of an agency unless the internal management rule affects private rights.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 26} Over the years, we have reiterated that what an agency labels a document is not conclusive. \u201cIt is the effect of the [document], not how the [agency] chooses to characterize it, that is important.\u201d <em>Ohio Nurses Assn., Inc. v. Ohio State Bd. of Nursing Edn. &amp; Nurse Registration </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 73, 76, 540 N.E.2d 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 27} The pivotal issue in determining the effect of a document is whether it enlarges the scope of the rule or statute from which it derives rather than simply interprets it. <em>Ohio Nurses; OPUS III-VII Corp. v. Ohio Bd. of Pharmacy </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 102, 113, 671 N.E.2d 1087. If the former, it must be promulgated pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119. If the latter, it is exempt from those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Ohio Nurses, </em>for example, the State Nursing Board issued a \u201cposition paper\u201d that greatly expanded the authority of licensed practical nurses (\u201cLPNs\u201d) to administer intravenous fluids or \u201cIYs.\u201d Concerned that LPNs would encroach upon duties previously reserved for registered nurses, the Ohio Nurses Association, Inc., sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>{\u00b6 29} We found that the position paper was a rule subject to the provisions of R.C. Chapter 119 because it expanded the scope of LPN practice and regulated those LPNs qualified to start IVs by requiring additional course work. We wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cIt is the effect of the position paper, not how the board chooses to characterize it, that is important. Regardless of whether the board characterizes its position paper as merely advisory, a clear reading thereof reveals that the paper does not purport merely to interpret an extant statute or rule, but rather to establish a new rule, standard or regulation regarding LPN practice.\u201d Id. at 76, 540 N.E.2d 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 31} We concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cBy failing to rule-file the instant position paper, the board has effectively denied members of the nursing profession, as well as other interested members of the public, a full and fair analysis of the impact and validity of the <em>new </em>standards of LPN practice set forth therein and its effects on the public health and safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 33} Documents that explain rather than expand, fall outside R.C. Chapter 119. In <em>Princeton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Ohio State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 558, 645 N.E.2d 773, controversy arose around the Educational Management Information System (\u201cEMIS\u201d), a legislatively created computer network for public schools. R.C. 3301.0714. EMIS collected information about student participation, performance, enrollment, and demographics. The statute directed the State Board of Education to develop rules for EMIS <em>and </em>to develop \u201cguidelines\u201d for the establishment and maintenance of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 34} Several local school districts sued, arguing that the General Assembly could not allow an administrative body to create guidelines without following the rulemaking process outlined in R.C. Chapter 119. The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County disagreed. After analyzing the substance of the guidelines, the court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe guidelines * * * are a kind of instruction manual showing methods and alternatives to identify, compile, collect and report the data. * * * Because these guidelines merely control the procedure by which the duties in the statute and rule must be performed, they are distinct from the rules in cases such as <em>Condee v. Lindley </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 90, 91, 12 OBR 79, 80-81, 465 N.E.2d 450, 452; <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 106, 113, 24 O.O.3d 187, 191-192, 435 N.E.2d 414, 419; <em>Ohio Nurses Assn., Inc. v. State Bd. of Nursing Edn. &amp; Nurse Registration </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 73, 76, 540 N.E.2d 1354, 1356-1357; [and] <em>Ohio Dental Hygienists Assn. v. State Dental Bd. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 21, 25, 21 OBR 282, 285-286, 487 N.E.2d 301, 304.\u201d Id. at 563-564, 645 N.E.2d 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>{\u00b6 36} R.C. Chapter 119 was also found to be inapplicable by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County in <em>OPUS III-VII Corp., </em>supra, 109 Ohio App.3d 102, 671 N.E.2d 1087. Underlying the controversy in that case was Ohio Adm.Code 4729-9-04, which governs the return of \u201cunopened\u201d medication and its redispensing by pharmacies. The code did not define \u201cunopened,\u201d but OPUS III-VII Corporation\u2019s packaging made it impossible to ascertain whether the container had been opened. Consequently, the pharmacy board concluded that medication dispensed in OPUS containers could not be returned and redispensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 37} OPUS objected, arguing that the board had implicitly added the requirement that packaging be \u201ctamper-evident,\u201d and, in so doing, created a new rule without complying with R.C. Chapter 119. The trial court disagreed, as did the court of appeals. The latter cited <em>Ohio Nurses, </em>supra, and observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[T]he board may advise those affected of the meaning that it attaches to one of its rules. However, in so doing, an administrative agency may not expand the scope of the rule without complying with the rulemaking provisions of R.C. Chapter 119.\u201d Id., 109 Ohio App.3d at 112, 671 N.E.2d 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 39} It then distinguished the case before it from <em>Ohio Nurses:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cIn contrast, the [pharmacy] board\u2019s determination in the instant case merely interpreted the language used in an existing rule, but did not establish a new rule, standard or regulation. OPUS argues that the board\u2019s determination somehow defines the rule in a manner inconsistent with the express language of the rule. As noted previously, the board is entitled to due deference from the court in its interpretation of the technical requirements of the pharmacy profession. We cannot say that the board\u2019s interpretation of the term \u2018unopened\u2019 to mean that a pharmacist must be able to look at a container and see whether it had been opened is inconsistent with the express language of the rule.\u201d Id. at 113, 671 N.E.2d 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 41} The court of appeals elaborated on the tenet that agencies should be given deference, citing two cases from this court. First, relying on <em>State ex rel. McLean v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 90, 25 OBR 141, 495 N.E.2d 370, it stated that courts \u201cmust give due deference to an administrative interpretation formulated by an agency that has accumulated substantial expertise in the particular subject area and to which the General Assembly has delegated the responsibility of implementing the legislative command.\u201d <em>OPUS III-VII Corp., </em>109 Ohio App.3d at 112-113, 671 N.E.2d 1087. Equally important, \u201csuch deference is afforded to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules and regulations if such an interpretation is consistent with statutory law and the plain language of the rule itself.\u201d Id. at 113, 671 N.E.2d 1087, citing <em>Jones Metal Products Co. v. Walker </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 173, 181, 58 O.O.2d 393, 281 N.E.2d 1.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Michael D. Dorf, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AtZ\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and William J. McDonald, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AM0\">Bugbee &amp; Conkle, L.L.P., Gregory B. Denny and Mark S. Barnes, for respondent Johnson Controls, Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">{\u00b6 42} Applying all of these principles in this case, we find that Memo E7 is an interpretation exempt from R.C. Chapter 119 and not a rule falling thereunder. Unlike the position paper at issue in <em>Ohio Nurses, </em>Memo E7 does not expand upon the statute and case law that it is based on. It instead follows R.C. 4123.512 and <em>Waddle </em>by (1) directing hearing officers not to include nonallowed conditions in a PPD assessment and (2) to, if possible, assess the percentage of PPD for the allowed claims. It is important to remember that it was <em>not </em>Memo E7 that prevented claimant\u2019s PPD award but claimant\u2019s failure to submit medical evidence that attributed a percentage of disability exclusively to claimant\u2019s allowed injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 43} For these reasons, we find Memo E7 to be exempt from R.C. Chapter 119\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 44} A writ of mandamus is accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
