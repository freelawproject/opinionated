Harden, a special agent supervisor of the Major Crimes Unit in the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d), received a notice from the Attorney General informing him that because of his failure to exercise supervisory responsibilities over an agent under his control, he would be disciplined in accordance with R.C. 124.34. That notice, dated April 24,1999, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c[Yjour vacation leave balance will be reduced by eight (8) hours. If your current vacation leave balance is insufficient, such reduction will take place as you accrue vacation leave. The hours will be deducted from your vacation leave balance from the pay period beginning April 25, 1999, until sufficient vacation leave has been deducted to equal a total of eight (8) hours as a result of this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">{\u00b6 4} Harden filed a notice of appeal with the State Personnel Board of Review (\u201cSPBR\u201d), and after a hearing, an administrative law judge issued a report and recommendation affirming the deduction of Harden\u2019s vacation-leave balance. Harden objected to that report and appealed to the SPBR, questioning whether R.C. 124.34 permitted the Attorney General to deduct accrued vacation leave as a means of discipline. The SPBR, after review, adopted the administrative law judge\u2019s report and recommendation and affirmed the deduction of Harden\u2019s vacation time. Harden then appealed that decision to the Franklin County Common Pleas Court, which affirmed the board\u2019s decision. On appeal to the Tenth District Court of Appeals, he claimed that the trial court erred in affirming the SPBR\u2019s decision to deduct his vested vacation leave. The court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment in part, concluding that the Attorney General could not deduct any vested vacation time Harden had earned prior to the date of the disciplinary order, but could deduct time from his vacation leave accrued after that date. Harden then filed a motion in the court of appeals for reconsideration, arguing that <em>no </em>vacation time can be stripped for an R.C. 124.34 discipline and claiming that \u201call vacation time is necessarily vested.\u201d The court of appeals denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is now before our court upon allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his proposition of law, Harden claims that a state employee\u2019s vacation leave \u201cbecomes a vested right as it incrementally accrues pursuant to R.C. 124.134\u201d and therefore regardless of whether such leave is earned prospectively or retrospectively to a disciplinary action, such leave may never be stripped. As an initial matter, we note that Harden arguably waived any issue regarding vacation time earned subsequent to a disciplinary order, because in his appeal to the court of appeals, he raised a claim regarding only the vacation time he had already earned. We, however, will review his claim regarding future vacation leave because the court of appeals broadened the issue presented for review and held that although vacation time already earned could not be reduced pursuant to R.C. 124.34, subsequent accrual of vacation time could be reduced. Furthermore, because the Attorney General did not challenge the appellate court\u2019s decision disallowing deduction of accrued vacation time, the narrow issue before us concerns only whether R.C. 124.34 authorizes a deduction of vacation time that accrues after a disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 7} Initially, we address Harden\u2019s claim that all vacation leave is necessarily vested, the issue he raised in his motion for reconsideration. He argues that \u201cvacation leave simultaneously accrues and becomes a vested right of each full-time permanent state employee at specific incremental rates throughout the work year.\u201d In support of this proposition, he cites the following portion of R.C. 124.134, which grants vacation leave to a certain class of public employees:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) Each full-time permanent state employee * * *, after service of one year, shall have earned and will be due upon the attainment of the first year of employment, and annually thereafter, eighty hours of vacation leave with full pay. * * * A full-time permanent state employee with twenty-five or more years of service shall have earned and is entitled to two hundred forty hours of vacation leave \"with full pay. Such vacation leave shall accrue to the employee at the rate of * * * nine and two-tenths hours each biweekly period for those entitled to two hundred forty hours per year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 9} Contrary to Harden\u2019s belief, this language does not support his claim. As defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, \u201caccrue\u201d means \u201c[t]o come into existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>as an enforceable claim or right,\u201d and \u201caccrued compensation\u201d means \u201cRemuneration that has been earned but not yet paid.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 21 and 277. Furthermore, as defined, a right is \u201cvested\u201d when it \u201cso completely and definitely belongs to a person that it cannot be impaired or taken away without the person\u2019s consent.\u201d Id. at 1324. In accordance with these well-defined terms, vacation leave as granted by R.C. 124.134 accrues at specified periodic rates and becomes vested after an employee has worked the requisite number of hours to earn it. Therefore, prospective deduction of vacation leave before it accrues does not affect an employee\u2019s vested right. Harden\u2019s contention that all vacation leave is necessarily vested precluding any reduction is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 10} Having determined that prospective deduction of vacation leave does not affect the vested right of a state employee, we next consider whether deducting an employee\u2019s vacation time constitutes a \u201creduction in <em>pay\u201d </em>(emphasis added) authorized by R.C. 124.34 as a means of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 124.34 provides: \u201c(A) The tenure of every officer or employee in the classified service of the state * * * shall be during good behavior and efficient service. No such officer or employee shall be <em>reduced in pay </em>or position, fined, suspended, or removed, except * * * for * * * neglect of duty * * * [or] any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">{\u00b6 12} Neither this statute nor R.C. 124.134, which grants vacation leave, addresses whether vacation leave constitutes \u201cpay\u201d or whether a \u201creduction in pay\u201d for disciplinary purposes could consist of deducting vacation-leave credits. We, however, have construed the term \u201creduction in pay\u201d in the context of R.C. 124.03.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>State ex rel. Bassman v. Earhart </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 182, 18 OBR 250, 480 N.E.2d 761, where a county welfare department discontinued free parking for employees for budgetary reasons, we considered whether the termination of free parking constituted a \u201creduction in pay\u201d for purposes of R.C. 124.03(A), entitling the employees to a review by SPBR. Characterizing free parking as a gratuity, we contrasted it with statutorily granted sick leave, and concluded that the termination of a gratuity did not rise to the level of a reduction in pay entitling the employees to invoke the jurisdiction of the SPBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Similar to sick-leave credits, vacation leave is a statutory entitlement, not a gratuity. Applying our analysis in <em>Bassman, </em>therefore, a deduction of vacation-leave credit would constitute a reduction in pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 14} The definitions of the terms \u201cpay\u201d and \u201creduction in pay\u201d provided in the Ohio Administrative Code support our resolution of this issue. Ohio Adm. Code 124-1-02(Y) defines \u201creduction in pay\u201d as \u201can action which diminishes an employee\u2019s pay.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 124-1-02(Q), in turn, defines \u201cpay\u201d as: \u201cThe annual, non-overtime compensation <em>due an employee </em>including, when applicable, the cost of the appointing authority\u2019s insurance or other contributions, longevity pay, supplemental pay and hazard pay * * (Emphasis added.) Because vacation leave, as provided for in R.C. 124.134(A), is \u201cdue\u201d a public employee at certain periodic rates, \u201cpay,\u201d defined as compensation \u201cdue\u201d an employee, encompasses vacation leave. Deducting an employee\u2019s vacation leave therefore constitutes by definition \u201creduction in pay\u201d authorized by R.C. 124.34 as one of the means of disciplining an employee for neglect of duty or nonfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 15} On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that a public employer may discipline an employee in an R.C. 124.34 action by deducting vacation leave that accrues after a disciplinary order. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.

It is leave, a break. What makes it especially attractive is that it comes <em>with </em>pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">{\u00b6 17} Moreover, the legislature has specifically set forth the number of vacation hours that accrue to employees like Harden. Had they meant to allow those hours to be reduced by employers, they could have specifically set that forth in legislation. They did not.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., James E. Philips and Rodney A.
