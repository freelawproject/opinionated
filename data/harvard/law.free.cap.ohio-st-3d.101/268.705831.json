In November 2000, he filed an application to retake the February 2001 Ohio bar examination. Members of the admissions committee of relator, the Erie County Bar Association, conducted an extensive bar admissions interview, and in February 2001, relator recommended approval of the application for admission to the bar filed by the applicant but with qualifications. In March 2001, applicant appealed from relator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 2} On June 4, 2001, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness held a hearing on the bar examination application. The applicant and another witness testified, and the panel also considered various documentary exhibits. The hearing record and exhibits before us disclose the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 3} Applicant was born in 1949 and grew up in Sandusky, Ohio. After college, from 1979 to 1985, applicant served as the president and sales staff of business enterprises engaged in the development of computer software in Nevada and California. In July 1987, he received a discharge in bankruptcy. From 1991 to 1998, applicant worked in Ohio, California, and Hawaii for different business enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">{\u00b6 4} From 1995 until 1998, applicant attended the University of Toledo Law School, graduating in December 1998. While attending law school, applicant continued to work developing software.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">{\u00b6 5} In 2000, applicant filed again for bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings, applicant testified that he had no income in 1998 requiring him to file a tax return, and he was living off student loans and loans made to him by a friend and business partner, Gordon Kraft. In his 2000 petition for bankruptcy, applicant had neglected to list his student loans of $73,465, as well as loans by Kraft amounting to over $222,000. Applicant later amended his petition to cover these loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">{\u00b6 6} In its initial report filed in February 2002, the panel expressed concerns with the applicant\u2019s financial situation. The applicant had extensive financial obligations with no offsetting assets. But the applicant repeatedly stated that \u201che would repay the obligations owed to Gordon Kraft in the amount of $222,775.41\u201d and would pay his student loans at the rate of $1,256 each month \u201cuntil such time as [he could] pay down the loan balance.\u201d Further, applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>stated that \u201chis current income was steady, between $8,000 and $16,000 per month.\u201d However, applicant had \u201cprovided no evidence of income nor did he provide any evidence of his ability to meet his financial obligations.\u201d Moreover, \u201cwhen questioned about his financial affairs, Mr. Harris answered the questions with irrelevant information and was very evasive.\u201d The panel also expressed concern that \u201cthe actions of Mr. Harris give rise to an inference of neglect of financial affairs\u201d and \u201cmisuse of the legal process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">{\u00b6 7} Further, the panel noted concern with the nature of applicant\u2019s financial involvement in numerous enterprises. In his 1998 application to register as a candidate for the bar, applicant listed ten different business enterprises, many financed by Kraft. Relator had asked applicant for documentation on the Kraft loans differentiating between personal loans to the applicant and loans to the companies. In response, relator received only very general information from the applicant. The panel asked applicant for specific information, and applicant promised to send this but did not do so. The panel also asked applicant for information regarding a limited partnership, but applicant never provided this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 8} The panel concluded that applicant \u201chas neglected his financial responsibilities and has failed to provide the panel with the information not only requested, but promised.\u201d Thus, the panel concluded that the applicant had failed to establish that he has the present character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the bar and recommended that his application not be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 9} In June 2002, at the board\u2019s request, the panel requested that the applicant, within 30 days, furnish financial information in ten categories before the panel would act further on his application. Information requested included, inter alia, a current list of creditors; a timetable to meet financial obligations; certified copies of documents applicant filed with the bankruptcy court; a current credit report; various business records of associated corporations or enterprises, including articles of incorporation, shareholder lists, corporate minutes, and partnership documents; copies of loans, agreements, or business correspondence with Gordon Kraft or his former wife; a list of suits filed against or by applicant; a statement of earnings for the past year; and copies of applicant\u2019s federal tax returns for the last three years. In its June 2002 request, the panel advised that if applicant did not supply the information requested, the panel would consider that he failed to cooperate and recommend accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 10} In July 2003, the panel filed a further report noting that applicant had not responded in writing to its June 2002 request for documents relating to his financial situation. Based on the facts and applicant\u2019s failure to respond to the panel\u2019s June 2002 request, the panel concluded in its July 2003 report that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>applicant \u201chas failed to cooperate with this Board and has failed to prove that he has the character, fitness and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law in the State of Ohio.\u201d The panel also found that applicant \u201chas neglected his financial responsibilities.\u201d The panel recommended that the applicant not be permitted to sit for the bar examination and that he reinitiate the entire application process for admission to the bar if he wishes to reapply in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 11} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and recommended that the application be disapproved. The board further recommended that the applicant be permitted to reapply by filing a new application to register as a candidate for admission as well as an application to take the bar examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 12} We adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the board. Under Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(1), \u201c[t]he applicant has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant possesses the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law.\u201d Moreover, under Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(1) and I(12)(C)(6), an applicant\u2019s failure to provide requested information or otherwise cooperate in proceedings either before the admissions committee or before the board \u201cmay be grounds for a recommendation of disapproval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 13} The importance of an applicant\u2019s cooperation in the hearing process cannot be overstated. In <em>Application of Davis </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 273, 274-275, 67 O.O.2d 344, 313 N.E.2d 363, we noted that \u201c[t]he paramount concern in proceedings before the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness is whether the applicant possesses those moral traits of honesty and integrity which will enable him to fully and faithfully discharge the duties of our demanding profession. * * * A hearing to determine character and fitness should be more of a mutual inquiry for the purpose of acquainting this court with the applicant\u2019s innermost feelings and personal views on those aspects of morality, attention to duty, forthrightness and self-restraint which are usually associated with * * * \u2018good moral character.\u2019 Such a view <em>commands the utmost in cooperation between the applicant and the board.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, the applicant has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he has the necessary character and moral qualifications to be admitted to the practice of law. As the panel noted in its February 2002 report, \u201cwhen questioned about his financial affairs, Mr. Harris answered the questions with irrelevant information and was very evasive.\u201d Because of his complex financial dealings, the relator and the panel requested financial records to support the applicant\u2019s assertions. Despite several requests, the applicant never furnished the information requested. Nor did the applicant respond in writing to the panel\u2019s specific demand in June 2002 for financial documents.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A04\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Donald Harris, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9d\">Joseph Zannieri, for Erie County Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">{\u00b6 15} Based upon the applicant\u2019s neglect of his financial affairs and his repeated failures to furnish requested financial information, we disapprove his application to register as a candidate for admission to the practice of law. Applicant may, however, reapply for admission to the practice of law by filing an entirely new application to register as a candidate and undergoing a new character and fitness evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
