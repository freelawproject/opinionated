This cause is pending before the court as an appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County. Whereas the court finds that supplemental briefing is necessary,</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, sua sponte, that the parties brief the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">1. What criteria should a trial court consider in deciding a motion to add additional parties filed pursuant to either Civ.R. 15 or Civ.R. 21? Specifically, should an Ohio trial court consider the merits of a substantive defense in determining a motion to add additional parties? Or should resolution of the merits of a substantive defense be deferred for consideration of a subsequent Civ.R. 12(B)(6) or other motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">2. What standard of review should an appellate court employ in reviewing the denial of a motion to add party-defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">3. Assuming, arguendo, that the doctrine of federal preemption bars plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claims in the ease at bar, is the denial of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion to add party-defendants otherwise supportable?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-20\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court that appellant\u2019s supplemental brief shall be filed within 20 days of the date of this entry; appellees\u2019 supplemental briefs shall be filed within 10 days of the filing of appellant\u2019s supplemental brief; and appellant may file a reply brief within 5 days of the filing of appellees\u2019 supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-21\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no extensions of time shall be permitted for the filing of supplemental briefs, and the parties shall otherwise comply with S.CtPrae.R. VI.</p>\n<judges id=\"b758-22\">Frederick N. Young, J., of the Second Appellate District, sitting for O\u2019Donnell, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
