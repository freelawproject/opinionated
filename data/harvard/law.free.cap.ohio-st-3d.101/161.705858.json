Lozier, for trafficking in drugs in violation of 2925.03(A). All five counts against appellee contained a specification that appellee sold drugs within the vicinity of a school, which enhances the penalty under R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b). Count 4 was eventually dismissed. Appellee withdrew his initial plea of not guilty and entered pleas of no contest to the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">{\u00b6 2} The sales at issue occurred at appellee\u2019s former home, which is located approximately 745 feet from the Holmes County Job and Family Services building. That building housed, on its third floor, a remedial education program known as \u201cProject Stay.\u201d The state stipulated that it had no evidence that appellee knew of the existence of Project Stay and that there was nothing to mark it or to identify it as a school to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court ruled that Project Stay was, in fact, a school. The court also ruled that whether appellee knew that he was selling drugs in the vicinity of the school was irrelevant, since the specification for trafficking within the vicinity of a school is written in terms of strict liability. Appellee was convicted on four counts of trafficking with the sentence-enhancement specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Appellee appealed from his convictions to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court had erred in finding that R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) imposes strict liability. The appellate court agreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the culpable mental state associated with R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) is \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 5} Upon the state\u2019s motion, the court of appeals certified a conflict between its holding and the holding of the Ninth District in <em>State v. Rogers </em>(Apr. 14, 1999), Summit App. No. 19176, 1999 WL 239100. In its motion to certify a conflict in the court of appeals, the state argued that \u201cthe issue proposed for certification is whether [R.C.] 2925.03(C)(5)(b) is a strict liability statute.\u201d Despite its holding that \u201cknowingly\u201d is the culpable mental state for R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b), the court of appeals phrased the certified question in terms of recklessness: \u201cWhether the culpable mental state of recklessness applies to R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b)?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 6} Recognizing a conflict between appellate districts, this court granted jurisdiction and ordered briefing on that issue. 96 Ohio St.3d 1446, 2002-Ohio-3512, 771 N.E.2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 7} The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b), which elevates trafficking in LSD to a fourth-degree felony if the offense is committed \u201cin the vicinity of a school,\u201d imposes strict criminal liability on a defendant. We make our determination against the backdrop of R.C. 2901.04(A), which states that \u201c[sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 8} The case against appellee begins with his violation of R.C. 2925.03(A), which itself requires a mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cNo person shall knowingly do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(1) Sell or offer to sell a controlled substance;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(2) Prepare for shipment, ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute a controlled substance, when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance is intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) is in play because appellee was selling LSD, and because he was selling that substance in the vicinity of a school. The relevant statutory language is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(C) Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c(5) If the drug involved in the violation is L.S.D. or a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance containing L.S.D., whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of trafficking in L.S.D. The penalty for the offense shall be determined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(b) * * * [I]f the offense was committed in the vicinity of a school or in the vicinity of a juvenile, trafficking in L.S.D. is a felony of the fourth degree, and division (C) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code applies in determining whether to impose a prison term on the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 18} The mental state of the offender is a part of every criminal offense in Ohio except for those plainly imposing strict liability. R.C. 2901.21(A)(2) requires that, in order to be found guilty of a criminal offense, a person must have \u201cthe requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2901.21(B) addresses strict liability statutes and those statutes that do not address a culpable mental state. That statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWhen the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">{\u00b6 21} Thus, recklessness is the catchall culpable mental state for criminal statutes that fail to mention any degree of culpability, except for strict liability statutes, where the accused\u2019s mental state is irrelevant. However, for strict liability to be the mental standard, the statute must plainly indicate a purpose to impose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, the majority decided that the language of R.C. 2907.321(A)(6) plainly indicated a purpose to impose strict liability. That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(A) No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(6) Bring or cause to be brought into this state any obscene material that has a minor as one of its participants or portrayed observers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">{\u00b6 26} <em>Maxwell </em>involved a defendant who had downloaded onto his computer obscene images; although he knew that the images were obscene, he argued that he did not know that he was downloading them from a computer system in another state, thereby importing the images into Ohio. The majority in <em>Maxwell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>found that, as to importing images, the statute imposed strict liability. The <em>Maxwell </em>majority relied on <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 86, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428, in holding that where the General Assembly indicates a mental state in one part of a statute, and does not indicate any mental state in another part of that statute, that indicates an intent to impose strict liability in that other part. <em>Maxwell </em>at \u00b6 27-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Maxwell, </em>the court found that the knowledge element of R.C. 2907.321(A) was separated out in order to apply only to \u201cthe character of the material or performance involved,\u201d noting that \u201cknowledge is a requirement only for the discrete clause within which it resides.\u201d Id., 95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 29. The court held that the knowledge element did not apply to the \u201c[n]o person * * * shall do any of the following\u201d portion of the statute. Since knowledge was required in one part of the statute and not in the other, the <em>Maxwell </em>majority determined that the General Assembly therefore intended to impose strict liability in the subsection of the statute without the knowledge requirement. Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 28} The statute in the present case is structurally more similar to the statute analyzed in <em>Wac. </em>In <em>Wac, </em>this court considered the mental element in R.C. 2915.02(A)(1). That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(A) No person shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(1) Engage in bookmaking, or knowingly engage in conduct that facilitates bookmaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 31} This court found that the inclusion of the element of \u201cknowingly\u201d for \u201cconduct that facilitates bookmaking\u201d but not in regard to \u201cbookmaking\u201d operated to \u201c \u2018plainly indicate[ ] a purpose to impose strict liability\u2019 \u201d on bookmaking per se. <em>Wac, </em>68 Ohio St.2d at 86, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428. The court in <em>Wac </em>\u201crecognized that the clause \u2018or knowingly engage in conduct that facilitates bookmaking\u2019 was a discrete clause and that the knowledge required by that clause could not be inserted into the previous clause, \u2018engage in bookmaking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b628.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 32} Here, we are dealing with another pair of discrete clauses separated by \u201cor.\u201d The phrase at issue in R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[I]f the offense was committed <em>in the vicinity of a school </em>or <em>in the vicinity of a juvenile, </em>trafficking in L.S.D. is a felony of the fourth degree, and division (C) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code applies in determining whether to impose a prison term on the offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">{\u00b6 34} Standing alone, \u201cin the vicinity of a school or in the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d does not indicate any required degree of mental culpability. However, each clause, \u201cin the vicinity of a school\u201d and \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile,\u201d is separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>defined in the chapter\u2019s definitional section. \u201cIn the vicinity of a juvenile,\u201d as defined in R.C. 2925.01(BB), employs strict liability terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(BB) An offense is \u2018committed in the vicinity of a juvenile\u2019 if the offender commits the offense within one hundred feet of a juvenile or within the view of a juvenile, regardless of whether the offender knows the age of the juvenile, whether the offender knows the offense is being committed within one hundred feet of or within view of the juvenile, or whether the juvenile actually views the commission of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 2925.01(BB) makes it abundantly clear that the offender\u2019s mental state is irrelevant in determining whether the offender has committed an offense \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile.\u201d An offender is liable whether or not he knows the age of the juvenile, or whether he realizes that a juvenile is in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 37} By contrast, the definition of \u201cin the vicinity of a school,\u201d contained in R.C. 2925.01(P), lacks the express strict liability language of R.C. 2925.01(BB). That definition reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(P) An offense is \u2018committed in the vicinity of a school\u2019 if the offender commits the offense on school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of the boundaries of any school premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 39} The General Assembly, in imposing the strict liability requirement for drug sales \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile,\u201d perfectly illustrates what R.C. 2901.21(B) calls a \u201cpurpose to impose strict liability.\u201d Additionally, the stark contrast between the definition of \u201ccommitted in the vicinity of a school\u201d and the definition of \u201ccommitted within the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to impose strict liability for selling LSD in the \u201cvicinity of a school\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 40} Applying the reasoning of <em>Wac, </em>if one part of a clause explicitly sets forth a mental state, that mental state does not apply to another discrete clause within that subsection. In fact, it is an indication that the General Assembly is attaching differing mental states as to the two distinct clauses. As the majority wrote in <em>Maxwell, </em>\u201c[t]he decision in <em>Wac </em>demonstrates that a crime may have different degrees of mental culpability for different elements.\u201d <em>Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 30. We find that the language employed by the General Assembly in the R.C. 2925.01(P) and (BB) definitions establishes differing levels of culpability for offenses committed \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d and \u201cin the vicinity of a school,\u201d plainly indicating that the General Assembly\u2019s purpose was to impose strict liability for acts committed \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d but not for acts committed \u201cin the vicinity of a school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>{\u00b6 41} Moreover, we find that the differing degrees of mental culpability for offenses committed near a school as opposed to near a juvenile are consistent with a coherent legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 42} The distance requirement for an act to be committed within \u201cthe vicinity of a juvenile\u201d is only 100 feet or \u201cwithin view of the juvenile.\u201d- Drug trafficking is a dangerous activity. Beyond the psychic danger of seeing drugs being sold, there is a very real physical danger surrounding a drug transaction, even for nonparticipants. Thus, a child, whether in view or not, could become a part of the collateral damage of a failed transaction. The threat to a child is real and imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 43} On the other hand, to be \u201cin the vicinity of a school,\u201d an offender could, by definition, be 1,000 feet away from a school. A child may not necessarily be nearby, or even in the school. The transaction could occur in the late evening hours, or in summer, or during any other period of the year that the school is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 44} The difference between the potential peril of a transaction that occurs \u201cin the vicinity of a school\u201d and \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d is significant. \u201cIn the vicinity of a school\u201d addresses danger that can be theoretical; \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d addresses a real, present danger. Because the \u201cvicinity of a juvenile\u201d offense is so much more dangerous, the General Assembly has determined that the offender\u2019s knowledge that a juvenile is nearby is irrelevant. Also, since \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d includes being in view of a juvenile, its parameters can expand well beyond 100 feet. Thus, if an offense occurs within 1,000 feet of a school, the offender still can be subject to strict criminal liability if there is a juvenile within view. As the danger to children becomes more real, the culpable mental state gets stricter.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 45} Having determined that the General Assembly\u2019s purpose was to impose differing culpable mental states for acts committed \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile\u201d and \u201cin the vicinity of a school,\u201d we must determine what culpable mental state applies to offenses that occur \u201cin the vicinity of a school.\u201d Since the definition of \u201cin the vicinity of a school\u201d includes no culpable mental state, we employ R.C. 2901.21(B) to provide the requisite culpability for the offense in question. We therefore hold that the culpable mental state of recklessness applies to the offense of trafficking in LSD \u201cin the vicinity of a school\u201d under R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 46} Although the court of appeals found that the requisite mental state is \u201cknowingly,\u201d and we conclude that recklessness is the appropriate standard, we nevertheless affirm. A reviewing court is not authorized to reverse a correct judgment merely because it was reached for the wrong reason. <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>McGinty v.

I disagree, however, as to the applicability of R.C. 2901.21(B) and the relevance of the statutory language analyzed by the majority. Further, by applying <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428, and <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, I determine that R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) imposes strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">{\u00b6 50} R.C. 2901.21(B) states: \u2018When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required * * *. When the section [defining an offense] neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient * *</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">{\u00b6 51} In <em>Maxwell, </em>we determined that R.C. 2907.321(A)(6) imposes strict liability for bringing obscene material into the state. In reaching this conclusion, we noted the irrelevance of R.C. 2901.21(B) when a statutory section identifies a standard of culpability. In part because R.C. 2907.321(A) specifies \u201cknowledge\u201d as the mens rea for the offense, we reasoned that R.C. 2901.21(B) cannot \u201coperate to supply the mental element of recklessness to R.C. 2907.321(A)(6).\u201d <em>Maxwell </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">{\u00b6 52} In light of <em>Maxwell, </em>R.C. 2901.21(B) cannot operate to supply the mental element of recklessness to R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) because R.C. 2925.03 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>includes a mental element in defining Lozier\u2019s offense. R.C. 2925.03(A) requires the mens rea of <em>knowingly </em>selling or offering to sell a controlled substance. R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) then provides a sentencing enhancement \u201cif the offense [of knowingly selling or offering to sell LSD] was committed in the vicinity of a school * * *.\u201d Although the statute\u2019s enhancement provision does not specify a degree of culpability, the section defining Lozier\u2019s offense does. Thus, R.C. 2925.03(A)\u2019s knowledge requirement precludes imputing recklessness to R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) via R.C. 2901.21(B). See <em>Maxwell </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 53} Having resolved that R.C. 2901.21(B) is inapplicable here, we still must determine the degree of culpability required for a sentencing enhancement under R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b). In <em>Wac, </em>the statute in question stated that no person shall \u201c[e]ngage in bookmaking, or knowingly engage in conduct that facilitates bookmaking.\u201d R.C. 2915.02(A)(1). The defendant in <em>Wac </em>had wanted the knowledge requirement for engaging in conduct that facilitates bookmaking imputed to the discrete prohibition against engaging in bookmaking. We reasoned that the exclusion of a mental element from the proscription against bookmaking juxtaposed with the inclusion of a mental element pertaining to facilitating bookmaking indicates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to impose strict liability for the offense of bookmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 54} In <em>Maxwell, </em>we applied <em>Wac </em>in determining that R.C. 2907.321(A)(6) imposes strict liability for bringing \u201cinto this state any obscene material that has a minor as one of its participants * * R.C. 2907.321(A) states that to be convicted of pandering obscenity involving a minor, the offender must have known the material to be obscene. We held that the knowledge requirement applied to the offender\u2019s understanding of the nature of the material but not to the act of bringing such material into the state because subsections (A) and (A)(6) are discrete from each other. Following <em>Wac, </em>we decided that in light of subsection (A)\u2019s knowledge requirement, the omission of a mental element from subsection (A)(6) subjects conduct under that provision to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 55} Both <em>Wac </em>and <em>Maxwell </em>stand for the propositions that a mental element cannot be imputed from one discrete clause to another and that the exclusion of a mental element from a discrete clause indicates the applicability of strict liability where the section defining the offense includes a mental element. I would follow <em>Wac </em>and <em>Maxwell </em>and hold that the knowledge requirement of R.C. 2925.03(A) cannot be imputed to R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b), and that the exclusion of a mental element from R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b), in light of R.C. 2925.03(A)\u2019s knowledge requirement, subjects the described conduct to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 56} Rather than following <em>Wac </em>and <em>Maxwell, </em>today\u2019s majority errs by analyzing a definitional section that does not bear on the issue before us. In <em>Wac </em>and <em>Maxwell, </em>we confined our analysis to the section that defines the offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>whereas today\u2019s majority departs to a wholly other section. The discrete language at issue here is found in R.C. 2925.03, the section that defines Lozier\u2019s offense, not in the definitional section.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVn\">Robert D. Rinfret, Holmes County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jeffrey A. Mullen, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aq0\">J. Dean Carro, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 57} After choosing discrete provisions in an irrelevant section, the majority posits that the General Assembly has defined those provisions in a manner that imposes divergent degrees of culpability. This position is wholly unfounded because, for the reason provided below, the recklessness standard of R.C. 2901.21(B) cannot apply to a definitional section such as R.C. 2925.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 58} By its own terms, R.C. 2901.21(B) applies only to sections that define offenses. R.C. 2925.01, the section to which the majority applies R.C. 2901.21(B), does not define an offense; it simply defines terms used in R.C. Chapter 2925. As a corollary, R.C. 2901.21(B) cannot apply to R.C. 2925.01, and the linchpin that supposedly connects recklessness to R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(B) is dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 59} I find further support for my position that R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b) describes a strict liability offense in <em>United States v. Falu </em>(C.A.2, 1985), 776 F.2d 46, which resolved the same issue presented herein within the context of former Section 845(a), Title 21, U.S.Code, a federal statute that was analogous to R.C. 2925.03.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Falu, </em>the district court resolved that Section 845(a) imposed strict liability. Although I would not subjugate my independent judicial analysis to that of my learned colleagues on the federal bench, I recognize that the universal purpose of enhancing penalties for trafficking in drugs in the vicinity of schools is to protect children from the pariahs that are drug dealers. Thus, the <em>Falu </em>court found, \u201c[A] requirement that the dealer know that a sale is geographically within the prohibited area would undercut this unambiguous legislative design.\u201d <em>Falu </em>at 50. I wholeheartedly agree, and I believe that the same rationale applies to requiring recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 60} For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Jim Petro, Attorney General, Douglas R.
