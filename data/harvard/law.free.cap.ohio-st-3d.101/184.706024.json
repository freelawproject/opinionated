We answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee, Christopher Maggiore, owns the commercial property at 2535 Fulton Road N.W. in Canton, Ohio. Maggiore leased the property to defendant-appellant, Charles Kovach, d.b.a. All Tune &amp; Lube (\u201cKovach\u201d). After Kovach allegedly failed to pay rent from October 2001 through January 2002, Maggiore hand-delivered to Kovach a letter, dated January 23, 2002, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cBy this letter, I am hereby terminating your tenancy at 2535 Fulton Road, Canton, Ohio, effective February 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cPlease make arrangements to move out of the building on or before that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">{\u00b6 5} Kovach failed to vacate the premises on or before February 28, 2002. As a result, Maggiore filed an eviction action against Kovach in the Canton Municipal Court, seeking restitution of the property at 2535 Fulton Road. Kovach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>answered and moved to dismiss the eviction action on the basis that Maggiore had failed to comply with R.C. 1923.04. The magistrate denied the motion to dismiss and recommended the issuance of a writ of restitution. In his objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, Kovach argued that Maggiore had failed to serve him with a three-day notice to vacate the premises as required by R.C. 1923.04 and that the three-day notice cannot be served until the 30-day notice period under R.C. 5321.17(B) had expired. The trial court disagreed and adopted the magistrate\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">{\u00b6 6} Kovach appealed to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The Fifth District held that the 30-day notice requirement under R.C. 5321.17 did not apply to commercial leases and, therefore, that the letter dated January 23, 2002, satisfied the requisite three-day notice to vacate under R.C. 1923.04. The Fifth District determined that its judgment conflicted with the decision of the Sixth District Court of Appeals in <em>Sterling Health Care Group, Inc. v. Laughlin </em>(May 28, 1993), Wood App. No. 92-WD-051, 1993 WL 179509, and certified the following issue for our review: \u201cDoes R.C. 5321.17 apply to commercial leases such that a landlord must give a 30-day notice to a commercial month-to-month tenant in addition to a three-day notice as provided by R.C. 1923.04[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">(\u00b6 7} The cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists in case No. 2003-0020 and pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal in case No. 2003-0002.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 8} Neither party disputes that R.C. 1923.04 requires a landlord to give a commercial tenant at least three days\u2019 notice to vacate the premises; rather, the parties dispute whether R.C. 5321.17(B) applies to commercial leases and thus required Maggiore to provide Kovach an additional 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy. Our analysis, therefore, begins with a review of R.C. 5321.17(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 9} The General Assembly codified the provision governing the termination of periodic tenancies in R.C. 5321.17. That section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(A) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, the landlord or the tenant may terminate or fail to renew a week-to-week tenancy by notice given the other at least seven days prior to the termination date specified in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, the landlord or the tenant may terminate or fail to renew a month-to-month tenancy by notice given the other at least thirty days prior to the periodic rental date.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(D) This section does not apply to a termination based on the breach of a condition of a rental agreement or the breach of a duty and obligation imposed by law, except that it does apply to a breach of the obligation imposed upon a tenant by division (A)(9) of section 5321.05 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 5321.17 thus establishes that, notwithstanding the exceptions in subsection (C) and (D),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a landlord or tenant must terminate a periodic tenancy by giving notice equivalent to the period of the tenancy. Relying on this provision, Kovach argues that Maggiore, as a landlord of a month-to-month tenancy, was required to serve him 30 days\u2019 notice to terminate the tenancy notwithstanding the fact that Maggiore was a landlord of a commercial, rather than a residential, lease. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 15} Although R.C. 5321.17(B) does not distinguish between residential and commercial leases by its own terms, Kovach\u2019s argument is directly contradicted by R.C. 5321.01, which defines the terms \u201clandlord\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(A) \u2018Tenant\u2019 means a person entitled under a rental agreement to the use and occupancy of <em>residential premises </em>to the exclusion of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(B) \u2018Landlord\u2019 means the owner, lessor, or sublessor of <em>residential premises, </em>the agent of the owner, lessor, or sublessor, or any person authorized by the owner, lessor, or sublessor to manage the premises or to receive rent from a tenant under a rental agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 18} In limiting the definitions of \u201ctenant\u201d and \u201clandlord\u201d in R.C. Chapter 5321 to encompass only tenants and landlords of <em>residential </em>property, the General Assembly excluded from such definitions tenants and landlords of <em>commercial </em>property. Indeed, we have long recognized the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius \u2014 \u201cthe expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another.\u201d <em>Newbury Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Lomak Petroleum, Inc. </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 387, 393, 583 N.E.2d 302. Construing R.C. 5321.01(A) and (B) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>accord with this principle, we hold that the expression of the word \u201cresidential\u201d implies the exclusion of the word \u201ccommercial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">{\u00b6 19} Contrary to this clear and unambiguous legislative pronouncement, Kovach asserts that all landlords should be subject to R.C. 5321.17(B) because \u201cthis procedure makes good common sense and provides for an orderly and logical process by which to initiate eviction.\u201d He does so, however, without any reference to the language in R.C. Chapter 5321, relying instead \u2014 and, indeed, exclusively \u2014 on <em>Sterling Health Care Group, Inc. v. Laughlin </em>(May 28, 1993), Wood App. No. 92-WD-051, 1993 WL 179509, in which the Sixth District Court of Appeals concluded that commercial landlords must provide notice to terminate a tenancy under R.C. 5321.17. We find no statutory basis for that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 20} Given that the terms \u201ctenant\u201d and \u201clandlord\u201d as used in R.C. 5321.17(B) do not apply to commercial leases, landlords are not required to provide tenants with at least 30 days\u2019 notice to terminate a commercial tenancy. We therefore answer the certified question in the negative. Having concluded that R.C. 5321.17(B) did not require Maggiore to provide a 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy, we consider whether Maggiore provided Kovach sufficient notice to vacate the property pursuant to R.C. 1923.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. Chapter 1923 governs actions in forcible entry and detainer. The notice and service provisions of that chapter, codified in R.C. 1923.04, provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, <em>a party desiring to commence an action under this chapter shall notify the adverse party to leave the premises, </em>for the possession of which the action is about to be brought, <em>three or more days before beginning the action, </em>by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by handing a written copy of the notice to the defendant in person, or by leaving it at his usual place of abode or at the premises from which the defendant is sought to be evicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cEvery notice given under this section by a landlord to recover residential premises shall contain the following language printed or written in a conspicuous manner: You are being asked to leave the premises. If you do not leave, an eviction action may be initiated against you. If you are in doubt regarding your legal rights and obligations as a tenant, it is recommended that you seek legal assistance.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(B) The service of notice pursuant to section 5313.06 of the Revised Code constitutes compliance with the notice requirement of division (A) of this section. The service of the notice required by division (C) of section 5321.17 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the Revised Code constitutes compliance with the notice requirement of division (A) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 25} Neither party disputes that R.C. 1923.04(A) requires landlords of residential and commercial leases to provide a tenant with at least a three-day notice to vacate the premises. Nor do the parties dispute that Maggiore delivered a letter to Kovach that instructed him to \u201cmake arrangements to move out of the building\u201d and that the delivery was \u201cthree or more days before\u201d Maggiore filed the action in forcible entry and detainer as required by R.C. 1923.04(A). The parties instead dispute whether the letter that Maggiore delivered to Kovach was a \u201cnotice to vacate\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 1923.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 26} In support of his position, Kovach contends that the letter dated January 23, 2002, did not clearly instruct him to vacate the premises because it did not include the words \u201cleave the premises\u201d as set forth in R.C. 1923.04(A). See R.C. 1923.04(A) (\u201c[A] party desiring to commence an action under this chapter shall notify the adverse party to <em>leave the premises </em>* * *\u201d) (emphasis added). Although the words \u201cleave the premises\u201d appear in R.C. 1923.04(A), the General Assembly has not indicated that these are the <em>only </em>words that a commercial landlord can use to instruct the tenant to vacate the property; rather, R.C. 1923.04(A) merely requires that a landlord \u201cnotify the adverse party to leave the premises * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 27} Further, the second paragraph of R.C. 1923.04(A), which applies to only residential leases, provides that such notice \u201cshall contain the following language\u201d and sets forth the required language in quotation marks. The first paragraph of R.C. 1923.04(A), by contrast, contains no similar indicia that landlords must include specific language in a notice to vacate the premises. This distinction indicates that the General Assembly knows how to require landlords to include specific language in such notices but decided not to do so in the context of commercial leases. We therefore conclude that R.C. 1923.04(A) does not require a landlord to include the specific language \u201cleave the premises\u201d in a notice to a commercial tenant to vacate the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 28} We farther conclude that the language in the letter that Maggiore delivered to Kovach \u2014 i.e., \u201c[b]y this letter, I am hereby terminating your tenancy at 2535 Fulton Road * * * [and] [p]lease make arrangements to move out of the building on or before [February 28, 2002]\u201d \u2014 clearly and unambiguously \u201cnotified] the adverse party to leave the premises.\u201d R.C. 1923.04(A). Given that Maggiore delivered the letter to Kovach on January 23, 2002 \u2014 40 days before Maggiore filed the action in forcible entry and detainer \u2014 Maggiore satisfied the minimum three-day notice to vacate the premises required by R.C. 1923.04(A). According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that Maggiore provided Kovach with sufficient notice to vacate the property.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AsF\">Roderick Linton, L.L.P., Duard D. Bradshaw and Tamara A. O\u2019Brien, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AqMy\">John B. Wirtz, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-6\">Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\">. Maggiore does not rely on Division (D) in support of his argument that R.C. 5321.17 does not require him to provide a 30-day notice to terminate the month-to-month tenancy. R.C. 5321.17(D) provides that \u201c[t]his section does not apply to a termination based on the breach of a condition of a rental agreement.\u201d The failure to pay rent in the instant case would likely constitute a \u201cbreach of a condition of a rental agreement.\u201d Maggiore, however, failed to raise such an argument; therefore, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
