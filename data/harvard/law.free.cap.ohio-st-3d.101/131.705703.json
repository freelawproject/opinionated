On appeal, the court of appeals rejected Washington\u2019s claim that his right to a speedy trial had been violated and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>State v. Washington, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80418, 2002-Ohio-5834, 2002 WL 31401558, at \u00b6 26-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 2} In June 2003, Washington filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Lorain County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellee, Lorain Correctional Institution\u2019s then-Warden Tracy Tyson-Parker, to release him from prison. Washington claimed that the trial court had denied him his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 3} On July 9, 2003, the court of appeals sua sponte dismissed Washington\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. \u201cA claimed violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Travis v. Bagley </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 322, 323, 750 N.E.2d 166. Because Washington had raised his speedy-trial claims in his direct appeal, res judicata also barred these claims. <em>Russell v.
