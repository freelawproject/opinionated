A workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed, and temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d) was started. In late 1999, claimant was diagnosed with cancer. Surgery for that disease was performed in January 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>After her operation, claimant began a Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation rehabilitation program, including a work-hardening program. After she began chemotherapy, she and the bureau agreed to suspend further rehabilitative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>efforts because of the ill effects of the therapy. Claimant\u2019s rehabilitation plan was accordingly closed on July 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 3} On August 23, 2000, claimant was examined by Dr. Akram Sadaka. He opined that claimant\u2019s allowed conditions were at maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d). This prompted the bureau to move to terminate TTC, and the Industrial Commission of Ohio granted that request on November 7, 2000. The claimant did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 4} By February 2001, claimant had recovered from her chemotherapy and was cleared by her oncologist, Dr. Lynne A. Eaton, to begin an exercise program. Claimant\u2019s attending physician, Dr. William R. Adrion, followed up that release by asking the bureau to authorize a new work-hardening and exercise program with the goals of decreasing claimant\u2019s pain and \u201cincreasing general function and physical capacities.\u201d That request was approved on September 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 5} Shortly thereafter, claimant moved the bureau for reinstatement of TTC. The matter was eventually referred to the commission. Among the evidence before the commission was a February 6, 2001 C-84 physician\u2019s report from Dr. Adrion, which indicated that claimant had not achieved MMI. There were also, however, his office notes dated February 6, 2001, March 7, 2001, and March 23, 2001, which stated that when viewed against her previous history, claimant\u2019s back condition had remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 6} A district hearing officer\u2019s award of TTC was reversed on appeal. In reversing, the staff hearing officer wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer does not find new and changed circumstances exist which would support a new period of temporary total compensation beginning 02/01/2001. The Staff Hearing Officer relies on the following. The allowances of this claim were found to have reached maximum medical improvement per an 11/07/2000 District Hearing Officer order * * * [based on] Dr. Sadaka\u2019s 08/23/2000 narrative report. The claimant had treatment in 2000 for cancer (specifically chemotherapy). Dr. Adrion certifies the claimant as being totally disabled as of 02/01/2001 per a C-84 dated 02/06/2001. * * * There are no new and changed findings or circumstances set forth on the C-84 dated 02/06/2001. * * * [A] 02/06/2001 office note of Dr. Adrion indicates \u2018no changes,\u2019 [and that] the claimant is having a lot of back pain, feels weak if she tries to do anything and wants to try physical therapy again to strengthen her back muscles again. * * * The claimant argues that the fact that her cancer treatments ended and she was released to an exercise program on 02/20/2001 (by Dr. Eaton) amounts to new and changed circumstances. The Staff Hearing Officer does not find further conservative treatment of a 1999 lumbar sprain adequately supports a finding of new and changed circumstances. The Staff Hearing Officer finds additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>conservative treatments of 1999 soft tissue injuries do not support a new period of temporary total compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 8} Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 9} The claimant petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in denying TTC. The court of appeals agreed, finding that claimant\u2019s recovery from chemotherapy was a new and changed circumstance that warranted a resumption of TTC while claimant participated in the rehabilitation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 10} The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 11} MMI is \u201ca treatment plateau (static or well-stabilized) at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected within reasonable medical probability in spite of continuing medical or rehabilitative procedures. A claimant may need supportive treatment to maintain this level of function.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 12} The parties contest neither the initial MMI declaration nor the principle that TTC can be reinstated notwithstanding that declaration, should new and changed circumstances demand. See <em>State ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177. They instead debate the sufficiency of the changed circumstance in this case to compel renewed TTC. For the reasons to follow, we find that the new and changed circumstance is insufficient to compel further TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 13} Unquestionably, claimant\u2019s situation changed after MMI was assessed: she recovered from chemotherapy. But as the employer argues, not every new occurrence merits reinstatement of TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 14} For example, in <em>Bing, </em>the claimant\u2019s condition temporarily worsened after MMI had been declared. We renewed TTC, reasoning that during the flare-up, claimant was not at MMI, and until she regained that level, she should be compensated with TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 15} We reached the same result in <em>State ex rel. Conrad v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 413, 727 N.E.2d 872, and <em>State ex rel. Value City Dept. Stores v. Indus. Comm., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 187, 2002-Ohio-5810, 777 N.E.2d 249. <em>Conrad </em>described <em>Bing </em>as \u201crecognizing] that claimants who had previously been declared as MMI could experience temporary exacerbation of their condition that justified further treatment or even temporary total disability compensation, as the claimant struggled to recover his or her previous level of well-being.\u201d 88 Ohio St.3d at 415-416, 727 N.E.2d 872. Similarly, the claimant in <em>Value City </em>experienced a medical deterioration when the leads on her injury-related nerve stimulator failed. This worsening, combined with the favorable prognosis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>improvement once those leads were replaced, was enough to resume TTC despite an earlier declaration of MMI.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2t\">Kennedy &amp; Colasurd Co., L.P.A., and Michael D. Colasurd, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"As2\">Kegler, Brown, Hill <em>&amp; </em>Ritter, L.L.P., Timothy T. Tull\u00eds and David M. McCarty, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 16} These cases establish that, to date, the only new and changed circumstance sufficient to re-entitle a worker to TTC is the worsening of the claimant\u2019s allowed conditions accompanied by a prognosis that the worsening is only temporary. The commission in this case ruled that the claimant\u2019s allowed condition had not worsened after MMI was declared. There was some evidence to support this conclusion, and claimant does not seriously contest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 17} Claimant instead asks us to expand what constitutes new and changed circumstances sufficient to reinstate TTC. We decline to do so here. We recognize that there are many legitimate reasons for interrupting medical treatment. It is questionable, however, whether the court of appeals\u2019 rationale would have the same appeal if the reason for interruption of claimant\u2019s treatment had been, for example, the need to recover from cosmetic surgery or childbirth or relocation to a new home. In each case, both the cessation and resumption of treatment would be unrelated to any change in the allowed conditions. Unless there is a worsening of an allowed condition, a mere prospect of improvement beyond the level previously declared MMI will not justify a new recognition of temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 18} We, therefore, hold that claimant\u2019s change in situation is insufficient to warrant renewed TTC. Absent a worsening of claimant\u2019s allowed condition, she is in effect saying no more than that the earlier declaration of MMI was premature. That, however, is a matter that \u2014 when given the opportunity \u2014 claimant chose not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 19} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the commission\u2019s order is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b428-11\">Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., dissent and would affirm the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
