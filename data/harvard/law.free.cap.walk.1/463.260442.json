BUFFALO VALLEY RAILROAD CO.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b471-9\">An engineer\u2019s estimate of the amount due a contractor is final and conclusive unless gross mistake is shown.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-10\">Error to Common Pleas of Somerset County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-11\">This was an action of assumpsit to recover for work on defendants railroad in pursuance of a written contract, one clause of which was as follows: \u201cAnd it is expressly covenanted and agreed between the parties aforesaid that the monthly and final estimates of the engineer shall be conclusive between the parties to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u2022contract; the former for the time being, and the latter for all time without further recourse or appeal; the monthl}\u2019- estimates of the \u25a0engineer being, however, subject to correction by him in any subsequent monthly, or in his final estimate, for the reason that the monthly or current estimates being merely made out as a basis for payment on account will necessarily be only approximately correct; pains being taken, however, to make them as accurate as possible. And if the chief engineer deem proper at any time to revise and alter in such a manner and to such extent as he shall see fit, the monthly \u2022or final estimate of said engineer shall be submitted to all intents and purposes in place of the estimate of said engineer ; it being, however, wholly optional with the said chief engineer, to exercise such power of revision or not. And it is further covenanted and \u2022agreed that all <em>extra work </em>required, and not embraced under the items and prices above set out shall be done by the contractor at the estimate of the engineer, and said engineer shall embody in \u25a0each monthly estimate a bill for the same made out as correctly ns possible for the preceding; these bills shall be <em>final </em>for such months, and the acceptance of the estimate by the said contractor shall be deemed and taken as waiving any - further claim for or on account of extra work done up to that time.\u201d Plaintiffs nought to recover on the estimate of the engineer and also for extra work. They offered to prove that they complained that injustice had been done them because the line was chauged from its original location. That the chief engineer was willing to revise his estimate; but that company discharged the engineer, so that he could not make a revised estimate. This offer was rejected \u2022and forms the basis of the specification of error. The engineer testified that he had made the final estimate, and also that from \u2022\u201c6th to 8th January, I had no desire to make another estimate.\u201d He was discharged on January 8th.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-4\"><em>W.

Smith 489. The fraud or mistake of the umpire is not sufficient to relieve a party from the necessity of resorting to him; Reynolds vs. Caldwell 1 P. F. S. 298.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The decision of the lower Court was affirmed on May 18, 1874, in the following opinion :</p>\n<author id=\"b473-7\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">We think the offer of evidence was insufficient to take the case out of the rule stated in Reynolds vs. Caldwell, 1 P. F. Smith 298, and other cases. The experience of the State, and of canal and railroad companies, in building canals and railroads, has shown a necessity to guard well contracts for constructions, in order to protect against frauds, and false claims. The estimate for work done made by the engineer are therefore made final and conclusive by the terms of the contract. In order to overcome this wise provision the existence of gross mistakes should be clear. This offer contains no averment of such a mistake. Great injustice is not the equivalent of gross mistake, that may arise from other causes than a mistake of measurement. A revision of the measurement of the work is made by the contract to depend upon the judgment and determination of the engineer. There was no offer to show that the engineer himself deemed it proper to revise his final estimate because of mistake. His mere willingness to revise the estimate is not a substitute for his judgment and belief of the necessity of revision. In order to set aside the covenant of finality, the company were entitled to his judgment founded on a belief that a mistake had been committed. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
