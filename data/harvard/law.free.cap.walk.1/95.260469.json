Cake as endorser of a note. Cake, in his affidavit of defence swore that he \u201creceived no notice of the non-payment of said note, excepting a certificate of its protest purporting to have been given by C. E. Shindel, a Notary Public, but said certificate was not given by the said notary public, as this deponent is informed, but the protest and certificate was made by a party not legally authorized to do the same. All of which deponent expects to be able to establish on the trial of the cause.\u201d The court below entered judgment against Cake for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. Cake then took a writ of error assigning as error the entry of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Lin </em>Bartholomew, <em>Esq., </em>for Cake contended that,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-4\">1.

Indeed, this is impliedly admitted, the qaulifieation being that the defendant is informed that the protest and certifiate were not actually made by the notary himself. This information is not averred to be believed by him, and might have been given by one who himself had no sufficient information. All that is stated might be true, and yet the defendant might have actual notice of the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
