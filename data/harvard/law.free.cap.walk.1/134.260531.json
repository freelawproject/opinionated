THE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-6\">Where an engineer knows aj switch is not attended to properly, or is defec* tively constructed, and does not complain to the company; he cannot recover for injuries suffered in an accident, caused by the switch being misplaced.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b142-7\">Error to Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Allegheny County. No. 260 October and November Term, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The facts of the case are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\">Jacob Orrison, the plaintiff, was employed as engineer upon a through passenger train on the Pittsburg &amp; Erie Railway, operated by the Pennsylvania Company. On the 4th day of November, 1873, he was running a train from Erie to Pittsburg, and in passing Sharpsville the train was thrown from the track. The engine was overturned and fell upon the plaintiff, by which he was seriously injured in the head, disabled for more than a year, and to some extent permanently injured. Sharpsville, where the accident occurred, is a shifting station, and the junction of the Sharpsville &amp; Oakland Coal R. R., at which point there are eight or ten tracks and a large number of switches, six of which are on the main track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">The accident was caused by a misplaced switch; how it became displaced the evidence did not disclose. It appeared in evidence that the switches at this point were not provided with locks, and that no person was employed to-attend them. The target of the one misplaced was broken and partially concealed by a telegraph pole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">Several accidents had occurred at the same place and in the same manner prior to this one, of which the proper officers of the company had been notified. The plaintiff\u2019s business was to run from Erie to Pittsburg and Sharpsville station, the station for his train was a half mile or more above, the switches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">He had never been at that'point except in passing, and his only knowledge of the construction of the tracks and switches in the yard, was from running through it. After one of the previous\u2019 accidents which happened to a train upon which he was employed, he was informed that the switches had been provided with locks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">He never knew that there was no one whose duty it was to see that they were properly placed. At the time of the accident the plaintiff\u2019s attention was attracted by some cattle on the track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">During the trial the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys proposed to ask a witness on the stand whether in his opinion the track was properly constructed and attended, which upon objection, was refused. He was permitted, however, to show that other companies either locked the switches or had persons -employed to attend them, and generally both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Upon the closing of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendant moved for a compulsory non-suit, for the following reason: \u201cThe plaintiff, being a servant in the employ of the defendant, assumed all risk of such employment which the defendant cannot control, including those arising from the negligence of his fellow-servants and as the accident did not occur through any fault or negligence, on part of the defendant; he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-3\">The non-suit was ordered, and upon motion to the Court in banc to set aside, said motion was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\">Plaintiff then took this writ of error complaining of the entry of the non-suit and the rejection of.testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-5\"><em>Messrs.
