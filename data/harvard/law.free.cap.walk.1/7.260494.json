Bright from Common Pleas of Schuylkill county, No. 280 January Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-12\">On August 19th, 1867, James C. Oliver acquired a coal lease. On Dec. 23, 1868, J. C. .Oliver assigned j- of said lease to David Oliver and formed.a partnership. On February 13th, 1871, J. C. Oliver assigned j- of said leasehold to O. E. Moore, who became a partner. On February 13, 1871, J. C. Oliver made a mortgage upon an undivided J- of said leasehold to Edward Silliman and T. Garrettson for $5,000. On same date Moore made a similar mortgage to same parties for $10,000. On June 20, 1871, David Oliver made a similar mortgage to Edward Silliman for $2,000 The mortgages were duly recorded, and judgment bonds accompanied the mortgages. On Dec. 17, 18.74, these bonds were entered in the Common Pl.eas, and on the same day <em>fi. fids </em>issued. A judgment of Joseph C. Bright vs. James C. Oliver &amp; Co. for $2,876.78 was entered January 18, 1875, to No. 338 March Term, 1875, and <em>afi-fa. </em>issued January 21, 1875. This judgment was afterwards set aside as to O. E. Moore. The Sheriff levied on the individual interests in the leasehold and the movable chattels un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>der the first three executions, and also levied upon the leasehold interests and chattels of the firm on Bright\u2019s <em>ji. fa. </em>On February 6, the Sheriff sold under the first three writs the leasehold estate for $4,100. February 20,1875, the Sheriff sold the loose personal property under the first three writs and a landlord\u2019s warrant for $1,894.50. Bright\u2019s <em>ft.fa. </em>was stayed i'\u00f1'the Sheriff\u2019s hands February 20,1875, before the sale. The claims for wages of miners, mechanics a,nd laborers amounting to $9,477.61 were assigned to Edward Silliman and Theodore G-arrettson. The auditor awarded to Silliman and Garrettson the amounts produced by the sale of the leasehold estate, after deducting costs, and also awarded them the balance of the fund as assignees of the miners, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-4\">Bright excepted, but the Court confirmed the report of the auditors in the following opinion by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b16-5\">Pershing, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">The auditor has appropriated the moneys arising from the sale of the leasehold of the several defendants to the payment of the mortgages of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\">This we think is correct. The mortgages were given in 1871, and the act of 1872, for the protection of the wages of labor contains an express provision that it shall not impair contracts existing or liens of record vested prior to its passage, and (seePurd. Big., 485 and notes,) from the sale of other property the sum of $1,894:50 was realized, which was appropriated to the payment of labor claims. The only exceptant is Joseph C. Bright, who to No. 175 March T., 1875, had issued a writ of <em>Fi. Fa. </em>against the firm of James C. Oliver &amp; Co., founded on a judgment which was set aside by the Court, so far as it related*to Oscar F. Moore, one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-8\">The writ of Bright, upon which a levy was made by the sheriff, was subsequent in time to writs issued by the plaintiffs above named. The first exception is \u201cthat the auditor erred in awarding the money to the claims of miners and laborers in preference to the execution of Joseph C. Bright.\u201d It is sufficient as an answer to this exception to state the fact that the only money applied to the claims of miners and laborers was the proceeds of a sale made <em>after </em>the writ of Mr. Bright had been stayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-9\">\"We do not think the auditor was called upon to decide any question as to the legal rights of the firm as distinguished from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the individual creditors of the defendants. No sale of any part of the property, leasehold or otherwise, was made on the execution of Bright, against' the partnership. In a contest between the creditors of a firm and the execution creditors of an individual partner, the question of partnership can be determined by an auditor only where there are sales on partnership and individual writs, and the levies are contradictory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-4\">The sheriff\u2019s return to a writ ot <em>Fi. Fa. </em>is conclusive upon the plaintiff therein. Boguis Ap. 3 W. Notes 256, and authorities there cited. This disposes of the other exceptions. We think the auditor eommitced no error in refusing to appropriate any part of the fund to the writ Joseph O. Bright, against the firm of James C. Oliver &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">And now, September 24th, 1877, the exceptions are everruled and the report of the auditor confirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-6\">Bright appealed to the Supreme Court, and <em>F. </em>W. <em>Hughes </em>and <em>G.

Wages due by a firm are not payable out of the proceeds of the sale of the individual interest of the partners; King vs. King, 2 W. N.

Kaercher </em>for Silliman and Garrettson,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE\">argued that coal lease mortgages of the individual interests are authorized by Act of April 5, 1853, P. Laws 295, P. Dig. 600, Pl. 161. As to purchasers of the title and creditors having liens, the lease was not partnership property, even though the owners were partners, because it was bought individually. Ebbert\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith, 81; Hall vs. Henie, 2 Watts 143; McDermott vs. Lawrence, 7 S. &amp; R. 438; Ridgway\u2019s Appeal, 3 Harris 177; Kramer vs. Arthurs, 7 Barr 170; Lancaster Bank vs. Myley, 1 H. 544; Cumming\u2019s Appeal, 1 Casey 268; Erwin\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 535. Even if it was partnership property, the sale discharged all liens and equities under Doner vs. Stauffer, 1 P. &amp; W. 198, and the claim for wages became the first lien, Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>April 9, 1872; P. Laws 47, P. Dig. 1699, Pl. 4; and therefore, if it was partnership property, appellees as assignees of the wages claims were entitled to the whole fund. King vs. King, 2 <em>W. </em>N. C. 200 does not conflict with'this position'.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AL\">The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower Court on March 31, 1879, in the following opinion:</p>\n<author id=\"b18-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">We affirm this d\u00e9cre\u00e9 upon the opinion of the learned President of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the Appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
