This was an action on a note brought by J. J. Herman in trust for the Workingman\u2019s Saving Bank af Allegheny City, against John Huckestein on a note for $1,600 made by John P. Wacker and endorsed by Huckestein as an accommodation endorser and \u201cprotest waived.\u201d After the maturity of this note it appeared from the books of the bank that there was a balance of $448 due to Wacker. Huckestein claimed that the words protest waived meant only a waiver of protest and not a waiver of demand and presentment. He also claimed that the $448 should be applied to this note. The bank claimed that there were other liabilities of Wacker to which the $448 could be applied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\">The charge of the court was delivered by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Collier, JY</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">Gentlemen oe the Jury : \u2014 This is an action brought by Mr. Herman, as trustee of the Workingman\u2019s Savings Bank, against John Huckestein, as the endorser on a note of John P. Wacker, already given in evidence to you. [Upon the note, as you will observe when you look at it, Mr. Huckestein waived the protest (which is not denied), but the point is raised, that in addition to that demand must be made upon the drawer. That, gentlemen, has not been the law up to this time. When the protest is waived you need go no further; the endorser is fixed as the law now stands. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to your verdict, unless the defendant has set up some defence thatisvalid.] The defence he makes is this: \u2014 That after the note became due, the plaintiff bank had some $500 in their hands belonging to Mr. Wacker, which should have been set off against this note. The learned counsel for Mr. Huckenstein has produced a bank book here showing a balance of some $500,1 believe, due to John Wacker, which, <em>prima facie </em>sustains their defence. The bank reply that that was a mistake, he getting a note renewed and they crediting up the proceeds, less the discount, without making a <em>contra </em>charge of the face of the note. Of course if that is true, that the balance is wrong, and whether it was a mistake or not is a question of fact for you. If it was not a mistake, the balance would, of course, be coming to Wacker, and the defendant would be entitled to have it set off against the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">The next position taken by the defendant is, admitting this to have been a mistake, that afterwards, Mr. Gipperich, the endorser, was sued, judgment obtained, and a mortgage given by him in payment, and that ought to be applied and considered the same as if it had not been paid ; as if this $500 had not been paid out and was still in the hands of these parties. That raises a question, gentlemen, and I think the law is this : That if the bank hold a balance in favor of the endorser, they are not bound to set it off, but they may do it. They have that privilege, but I don\u2019t think they are bound to do it. [But there is another matter of some importance for you to consider in connection with this point, and that is, that the bank, at this very time, had three or four notes of Wacker\u2019s and if this was not a mistake on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>part, and they actually had a balance of this amount of money, these notes being older, they had a right to apply the balance to them. If you should come to the conclusion that these three notes were not paid, the bank would have a right to apply the balance to the payment of them, and Mr. Huckestein could not complain.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">You take the notes, and if you find there were funds in the hands of this bank which could be applied to the payment of this note, under the instructions I have given you, you make that deduction of four hundred and some dollars, and give a verdict for the plaintiff for the balance; but if you should think that these notes are not paid, and were prior to this one, the bank would have a right to appropriate the balance to their payment; and I think that the judgment against Gipperich is not an election that would bind the bank, or any holder of the paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">January 27, 1876, verdict for plaintiff for $1720.

This, we think, is the general understanding of a waiver of protest among business men. The very purpose of the waiver is to supersede the ordinary steps and avoid both trouble and expense. To waive the mere act of the notary, and yet to suffer the duty of making demand and giving notice of its result to remain, would scarcely be thought of by business men.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The demand for the application of the deposit of $448 to this note is without equity. It was not a set off nor a counter claim of any sort while former overdue notes had an equal equity to demand application of the same to them. It constituted no defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
