Allen in pursuance of an agreement with McKinney put his cow to pasture in a field. The cow escaped through the fence and was killed. Allen brought suit for $200 damages, but on the trial swore the cow was worth $75. McKinney claimed the Court had no jurisdiction, the proviso in Section 1st of Act of April 8, 1833, P. Laws 305, being as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Provided that the said Court shall have no jurisdiction, either originally or on appeal, except when the sum in controversy shall exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d Verdict for plaintiff. McKinney took out a writ of error and in his behalf</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-7\"><em>Messrs. T. Marshall </em>and <em>Patterson </em>argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">That as the cow was not worth more than $75, the plaintiff could not give the Court jurisdiction merely by declaring for a larger sum. Kline vs. Wood, 9 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 294; Coxe vs. Tilghman, 1 Wharton 282; Willard\u2019s Appeal, 15 Sm. 265.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-9\"><em>C. B. M. Smith, Esq., contra, </em>argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-10\">That the sum declared for determined the jurisdiction. Ancora vs. Burns, 5 Binney 522; Hancock vs. Barton, 1 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 269; Burr vs. Bayne, 10 Watts 299; Forrester vs. Alexander, 2 P. A. Browne 38; Byrne vs. Gordon, 2 P. A. Browne 271.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\">The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court below on October 19, 1874, in the following opinion :</p>\n<author id=\"b297-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">This was an action <em>ex delicto </em>founded upon negligence, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim sounded in damages. In such case the sum laid in the declaration is the criterion of jurisdiction; Burr vs. Bayne, 10 Watts 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">It is not denied that there are cases to be found where the action for negligence is founded in contract which will confer jurisdiction upon justices of the peace. Such were, McCahan vs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Hirst, 7 Watts 175; Todd vs. Figley, 7 Watts 542; where the cause of action was founded upon a <em>bailment </em>though the action was for negligence. But in such cases the reason of the rule is, that it depends on a <em>contract, </em>express or implied, under the Act of March 20th, 1810, 5 Sm. 161. But in this case jurisdiction is not made to depend on the nature of the claim, .but on the sum in controversy. Of this the Court can judge, upon a plea to the jurisdiction, only by referring to plaintiff\u2019s demand where damages for the injury are the matter claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
