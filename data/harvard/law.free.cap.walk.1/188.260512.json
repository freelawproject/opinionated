No. 31 January Term 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-7\">The suit was brought to recover from the defendant the sum of $3,000, with interest from November 23, 1873, the said sum of money having been received from them by the defendant (who was then a director of the company plaintiffs), upon the day named, upon a check signed by two members of the Finance Committee of the company, plaintiffs averring that for the said sum of money the defendent had given no consideration. The evidence for plaintiffs showed that the consideration was to have been the conveyance to the company of an interest, by deed or mortgage, in lands in Schuylkill County, the title to which was controlled by defendant, but the contention on his behalf being that it was not in him, and that he acted as the agent of the vendors, and not as principal, in making the sale to the company. The treasurer testified that he thought the defendant. was not grantor in the deed tendered. Upon the day of the date of the check, November 23, 1873, a messenger from defendant brought to the office of the plaintiffs, \u201ca conveyance, a mortgage and bonds accompanying,\u201d which he tendered to their treasurer, who thereupon gave to the messenger the check in suit, but declined to receive the papers, on the ground that they were not accompanied with the opinion of a certain solicitor, for which, however, the said treasurer testified that he had not previously stipulated. The solicitor\u2019s opinion was not furnished by defendant, and the plaintiff\u2019s brought suit to recover the amount of the check. The case was tried upon March 17, 1876, when, in the absence of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>fendant, his witnesses and papers, the jury, under binding instructions of the court, rendered a verdict for plaintiffs, for the whole claim, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkX\">The following is the charge of the Court :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlL\">Gentlemen o\u00ed the jury: \u2014 This is an action brought to recover $3,000, which, it is alleged, this insurance company paid Mr. Huntzinger, under the circumstances which have been detailed to you by the witness. I am prepared to instruct you, gentlemen, that, under all the evidence in the case, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for this sum of money, with the interest. The relation which Mr. Huntzinger sustained to this company was that of a director of the company, with full, knowledge of (or he was bound to know) the power of the persons with whom he was dealing, and who knew exactly what he was doing. He was not a stranger. He was not dealing at arm\u2019s length, but bound to protect this company, as a director of the company, and bound to know that the parties with whom he was dealing had authority to deal with him, occupying this position. The evidence simply shows that, conferring with some of the officers of the company, with two members of the Finance Committee, and with that knowledge, he, in some way or other, got this check from them. Therefore, I instruct you, gentlemen, under the evidence in this case, (and it is not contradicted), that your verdict should be for the plaintiffs, for the amount of this claim, with its interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9m\">The tract was known as the Kline, Huntzinger and Gumpert tract in Foster township, Sceuylkill county, also known as the Eliza Young tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-19\">March 17 1876 verdict for plaintiff for $3,410.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3n\">During the trial, counsel for plaintiff' offered copy of charter and supplement in the pamphlet laws, which were admitted under objection.
