No. 43 .January Term, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-10\">The Philadelphia and Reading R. R. Co. were about to construct a track, raised 30 inches above the street, to connect with a bridge so as to obtain access to the rolling mill o\u00ed Seyfert, McManus &amp; Co. across Canal street in front of Getz\u2019s property, and took a small dwelling house on his lot. Getz filed a bill in equity to restrain them, but the Court dissolved the injunction on the railroad company\u2019s filing a bond for the damages of Getz. The bond was approved by the Court and Getz then took certiorari, complaining of the action of the Court in entertaining jurisdiction of the application to approve of the bond, and in approving of the bond.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-13\"><em>A.

The charter of the West Reading Railroad, Act March 20, 1860, P. L. 471, does not give it the power to build branches. The power of the P. &amp; R. R. R.

The approval of the bond is not a subject of review in this court. The question whether the Railroad Company had authority to enter upon the land of Hiram L. Getz &amp; Co., to make the branch cannot be decided on this certiorari. If the company had the right; the bond was an essential prerequisite to the exercise of it. The approval of the bond settled nothing as to the right. It decided merely the question of the sufficiency of the sureties and the amount of the bond. These other matters are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Writ of certiorari quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
