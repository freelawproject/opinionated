D., 1866, between John Doll of Dover Borough in the County of York and State of Pennsylvania, of the one part, and Sarah Breneman, single woman of the Borough of York, in said county, of the other part, witnesseth ; That the said John Doll in consideration of a marriage to be had and solemnized between him and the said Sarah Breneman does for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators covenant, grant and agree to and with the said Sarah Breneman, her heirs and assigns, that she, the said Sarah shall have and enjoy the use and benefit of her separate estate as fully and to all intents and purposes as she enjoyed the same prior to said intended marriage, hereby giving and granting to her the exclusive right and privilege of disposing of the same by will or otherwise, and of receiving the rents, issues and profits thereof, and alter his marriage to the said Sarah Breneman, and after his decease, the \"said John Doll hereby covenants for his heirs, executors and administrators, that she, the said Sarah, shall receive the sum of five hundred dollars out of his estate, as also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the further sum of three hundred dollars allowed to the widows of intestates by the laws of Pennsylvania, out of such part of his estate as she may elect to retain, in lieu and satisfaction of her whole dower in his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\">And the said Sarah Breneman in consideration of the premises as well as one dollar paid to her by the said John Doll, does for herself, her heirs, executors and administrators covenant and agree to and with the said John Doll, that the foregoing amount so assigned and set apart out of his estate for her shall be in full satisfaction of her dower in his estate, and shall bar her from claiming the same if she shall survive after said marriage, in case he shall not give her any other part of his estate by his will, or some other act done by him after the execution hereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">In witness whereof the said John Doll and Sarah Breneman have hereunto set their hands and seals the day and year first within mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">Signed and sealed and delivered in presence of George M.

[Seal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">The day after the execution of the above indenture, the parties thereto were married. John Doll had several children living, ny a prior marriage, and Sarah Breneman, one. But they had no children during their marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">Sarah died in 1875, while John survived her about three years. He left a will by which he directed \u201cthat the net <em>produce </em>of all his real and personal estate should be divided among his children equally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\">Before the Auditor (E. D. Bentzel, Esq.,) appointed to distribute the balance on the Executors\u2019 account, the Administrator of Sarah Doll claimed the sum of eight hundred dollars, given to her by the above indenture, which claim was contested by the legatees under said will. The Auditor, after stating the facts, and giving the points presented by counsel, reported as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\">The question here to be decided, is, is. the said. Ambrose H. Seiffert, Administrator as aforesaid, entitled to receive the five hundred and the three hundred dollars or either of the said sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>mentioned in said Indenture ? There are two covenants in said Indenture, in the first the said decedent covenanted for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, that said Sarah Breneman shall have and enjoy the use and benefit of her s\u00e9parate estate as fully and to all intents and purposes as she enjoyed the same prior to said intended marriage, all of which consideration seems to have been performed by the said decedent, at least there is no evidence before your Auditor to show that it has not. The second covenant seems to rest upon a certain contingency, and that contingency appears to your Auditor to be the survival of the said Sarah Breneman. Now the tacts are that she died about three years before her husband, John Doll.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\">\u201cHow marriage articles are to be construed is clearly explained in Tabb vs. Archer, 3 Am. Dec. 657-69, in which case the Court decided that \u201cthe intention of the parties in marriage articles should be collected from the nature of the agreement, the language and context, the usage in such cases, and the legal rights of the parties, as they existed before, and would have existed after the marriage if no agreement had been made.\u201d In the same case it is also ruled \u201cthat marriage articles are entered into between the parties upon a valuable \u25a0 consideration, and being in their nature executory, ought to be construed and moulded in equity, according to the intention of the parties.\u201d In 1st Addison on Contracts, page 480, sec. 327, it was held that \u201cwhere a man upon the marriage of his daughter, covenanted with her intended husband to give and bequeath, by deed or will, an equal share with his other children of the property he should die possessed of, and the daughter died in the 1 fetime of the covenanter, it was held that the liability upon this contract was discharged by the death of the daughter, as performance had become impossible by the act of God;\u201d Jones vs. Horn, 9 Common Bench Reports 19.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">\u201cJohn Doll, the decedent, agreed that the said Sarah shall receive the sums of money, which were to be in lieu and satisfaction of her whole dower in her estate, to which she the said Sarah agreed. The said indenture in the. opinion of your Auditor contemplated the survival of the said Sarah for the reason that the said moneys were to be in lieu of her whole dower. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>is very plain that under the laws of this Commonwealth there was no dower due the said Sarah, being she died before her said husband, and since that is so, can the intention of the said covenantor, have been to give to her the said Sarah, or her legal representatives as a consideration of the said marriage absolutely the said several or any of the said sums of money, when it was directed to be in lieu of dower ? It does not seem reasonable to your Auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">\u201cYour Auditor is therefore of opinion that the said Ambrose H. Seifiert, Administrator of the said'Sarah Doll, deceased, is not entitled under the said indenture to either the three hundred dollars or the five hundred dollars mentioned therein, because they are in lieu ahd satisfaction of dower, and in this case under the circumstances there could not have been any dower. That the said indenture is of no effect, and without an intention to bind the party, after the reasons and motives for executing it have passed away and that the party is again <em>Sui Juris.\u201d </em>Evans rs. Russell; Legal Gazette, 6 vol., page 130.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">\u201cYour Auditor therefore disallows the said claims of the said Ambrose H. Seiffert, Administrator as aforesaid of the said Sarah Doll, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">Exceptions were filed to this report by Counsel for the Administrator. The Court, after argument, dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">This appeal was then taken, the errors assigned being</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">1.

It is not conditional upon her surviving him. The consideration is the marriage. This was a valuable consideration; Cord on the Rights of Married Women, page 6 \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>And in the absence of fraud it will prevail against creditors: Cord on the Rights of Married Women, page 12 \u00a7 26; Frank\u2019s Appeal, 9 P.

F. Smith 269.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court on May 17, 1880, in the following opinion per</p>\n<author id=\"b290-11\">Mercur, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Two thoughts are clearly indicated in the marriage settlements we are called upon to construe. The one that the wife should be permitted to have and enjoy the use and benefit of her separate estate and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof during coverture as fully as she enjoyed the same prior to said int\u00e9nded marriage, and might \u201cdispose of the same by will or otherwise.\u201d The other, that after his death, in lieu and satisfaction of her whole dower to his estate, she should receive the sum of five hundred dollars, and also the sum of three hundred dollars allowed to a widow. She died while her husband, was living. She never reached that widowhood, on the happening of which either sum was to become payable. She was never in a condition to elect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>retain the $300,00, nor had she such a fixed and certain right of dower that she could call for the $500.00, \u201cin lieu and satisfaction\u201d thereof. It is very manifest it was never intended, in case her husband survived her, that alter his death, her heirs or personal representatives could claim either of the sums out of his estate. They were all she could claim, in case she survived her husband. Dying before him, she could neither enjoy nor transmit either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
