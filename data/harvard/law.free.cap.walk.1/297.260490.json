No. 214 January Term, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-11\">The facts of the case appear in the charge of the Court which was delivered on January 28, 1881, by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Pershing, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-4\">Gentlemen of the Jury: \u2014 This is an action brought by the Citizens\u2019 Safe Deposit Bank of Mahanoy City, against Ephraim Barlow,, based upon an alleged subscription which he made to the capital stock of this corporation, of which it is claimed there remains unpaid $500, to which sum interest is to be added from the tim,e the call was made by the board of directors for its payment till this time. The rule is that stock subscriptions, notes given in payment of stock subscription constitute a primary fund for the payment of the debts of the corporation, and [the evidence as relates to this defendant is that he subscribed for ten shares of the capital stock of this company, amounting to $1,000. The original subscription was produced here, and Mr. Barlow himself has testified as to his subscription and the amount. You have, also, the undisputed evidence that he has paid instalments at different times to the amount of $500 upon this stock].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">The defendant claims that he is not bound to the balance, first upon the ground that a resolution was adopted that but fifty per cent, should be paid by subscribers to the stock on their subscriptions, and that their certificates of stock should issue; and next upon the ground that he subscribed to what was intended to be a banking corporation, whereas the charter procured was not that of a banking, but that of an insurance company, which subsequently had its name changed by the action of the Court to the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Safe Deposit Bank of Mahanoy City,\u201d as 1 understand that was the name given by the subscribers before the charter was obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">We say to you, that so far as the resolution of Mr. Breisch is concerned, namely : that they should only pay fifty per cent, on their stock, its terms carried with it the admission that that was but half the amount of the subscription; and that in a contest be-' tween this corporation and its creditors or those who sue on behalf of its creditors, this resolution would not be a defense to Mr. Barlow or any other stockholder who should set it up as a defense. We take it that director's after subscriptions have been made by parties to the bank, could not, as against the creditors of.the bank, say that when fifty per cent, was paid in no more should be paid; (they might as well have made it five or ten per cent.,) and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>this action on the part of the directors was not in the way of - the subsequent action of the directors when they determined that the unpaid balance should be paid in,- as they did in 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\">So far as the charter is concerned it appears it was a charter for the Enterprise Insurance Campany. When this charter was obtained and they undertook to organize under it, as it appears they did on the 22nd of November, 1871,1 think Mr. Barlow could very properly have refused to go on under it. He might have alleged that this was not the kind of a charter which was in contemplation at the time this company was organized or the time the subscriptions were made in view of the subsequent organization of a banking company. But [it appears that subsequent to this organization on the 22nd of November, 1871, he paid into this corporation at least four instalments of $100 each ; that he drew out at least five dividends ranging from 8 per cent, to 6 and 5 per cent.; that he voted at the election held by this corporation; that at no time when receiving dividends, according to the testimony in the case, did he aver that he was not a member of the corporation; that he opened an account with this bank, had discounts made and dealt with it as a bank, and had knowledge that the directors had. taken action to call in the unpaid instalments].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">After giving this matter the best study I could while the case was going on, and referring to the case cited by counsel, [1 think that Mr. Barlow is now precluded by his own acts from setting up the allegation, that this was a fraudulent charter, as to him] at the time this charter was procured. I think he had a right to have said \u201cI will have nothing more to do with it; I will not be bound by it.\u201d But [his voting at elections, receiving its dividends, which he still retains; opening up an account with this bank and receiving discounts, these facts, reviewed in the light of the cases submitted to the Court, lead me to the conclusion that he is nowestopped from making the defence that this was a fraudulent charter].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">I have a case before me where the provision was that when 600 shares were subscribed the company should go into active operation. It appears that they were unable to obtain that amount of genuine subscriptions and that after obtaining the subscription of 300 genuine shares they added to it 300 which were fictitious or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>fraudulent, and organized under that state of facts. \u201cIt is perfectly cleai',\u201d the Court say, \u201cthat it was a fraud ; that such an organization under such a fraudulent subscription of one-half of the whole capital stock of the institution would be a fraud upon any real subscriber by which he has sustained or might sustain injury. No action can be maintained against him by the corporation for the amount of his subscription, but where such subscriber has accepted the charter and by his own acts put it in operation he cannot avail himself as a defense of the fact that part of the stock was fictitious, that the charter was fraudulent.\u201d The Court say that although he may be ignorant of this fact, yet it was his duty to inform himself and his ignorance would not relieve him. This defendant has accepted the charter acted upon it as one of the seven in the charter, (as appears was the fact in this case,) advertised the election of managers and voted by proxy. I do not think he ought to be heard against the payment of his subscription.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-4\">Justice Duncan says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">\u201cIt does not lie in his mouth to object; nor do I think ignorance of the fact of the subscription being partly fictitious should now be heard from him if it were possible to doubt of his knowledge, because he by his own public acts, has put the charter into motion. He has put his name to the fraud, if fraud it be, he has been an actor in the scene of fraudulent deception of wtiich he now seeks to avail himself to the injury of the innocent; and he who assisted in putting the charter into action cannot be permitted to say to those who have innocently advanced their mone}' that the charter under which they acted was obtained by fraud upon the subscribers and on the State. He should have informed himself of the fraud and declined to act. His ignorance of that which it was his duty to know shall not protect him, particularly when in its consequences it is injurious to others. He voluntarily became a member of the corporation, accepted the charter, acted upon it, put the whole matter into motion encouraged the work; in this, so far as respected the claims against him he acted at his peril.\u201d The Supreme Court, reversing the Court below, held that-he was bound for his subscription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">[It appears-that Mr. Barlow subscribed for $1,000 of this stock. The whole capital was to be-a certain amount of money, of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>so much was to be paid in as guaranteed stock and it seems to me that the amount he subscribed for. whether it was divided into ten or twenty shares, provided there was no attempt to increase the amount he agreed to pay is not a material question.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\">The defendant has asked us to charge you :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">1st. \u201cIt is the uncontradicted evidence in this case that the defendant subscribed for ten shares of stock of par value of $100 each, to an unincorporated association that then contemplated to become a chartered banking company, with all the rights and privileges of a chartered banking company, and it is not therefore competent for the plaintiff to require the payment of more than $50 on each share if it afterwards adopted a charter that reduced the par value of its shares to $50 each.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">2nd. \u201cThe subscription offered by the plaintiff in evidence and the stock account with defendant, kept in the stock ledger in evidence, show that the defendant was credited as being the owner of but ten shares and which were paid in full, and such account does not claim that the defendant paid on twenty shares and the plaintiff cannot recover any thing but fifty per cent, in this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">3rd. \u201cThe defendant subscribed for ten shares as aforesaid, in a banking company, as stated in the first point, and never then sub- ' sequently agreed to pay anything into a corporation that was merely an insurance and trust company ; that the corporation plaintiff is merely an insurance and trust company and is prohibited from exercising banking privileges and cannot recover in this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">4th. \u201cThat the evidence being uncontradicted that it was agreed by the defendant with the association in which he subscribed for said ten shares of stock; that all he was called upon to pay on said stock was $500, and the defendant having paid $500 as called for the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-9\">5th. \u201cThat under all the evidence the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-10\">6th. \u201cThat if the jury believe that the payments made by the defendant on his subscription after the alleged incorporation of the company, for stock were made and dividends received on the rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>resentation of the plaintiff; that they were a banking corporation with all banking privileges, then and in such case defendant is not estopped from denying his liability to pay for all balance alleged to be upon said subscription, if the said corporation was not a banking company and had not banking privileges.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\">These points of the defendant we negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-5\">The plaintiffs have asked us to charge you :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">\u201cThat the plaintiffs under the undisputed evidence in the case are entitled to recover the amount of Barlow\u2019s subscription remaining unpaid, namely $500 with interest from time the same became due after the call for its payment by the board of directors, and the verdict of the jury should be for the plaintiff for that amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\">We affirm this point and instruct you that the plaintiffs have a right to recover. If we \u00e1re in error, we can be corrected by the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">January 28, 1881, verdict for plaintiff for $670.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\">Barlow then took out a writ of error complaining of the portions of the charge contained in brackets and the answers to points..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqM\"><em>Messrs.

This was settled more than half a century since in the courts of the State of New York, and has recently been affirmed in this Court. Duchess Collar Manufacturing Co. vs. Davis, 14 Johns (N. Y.) 237; Sanger vs. Upton, 91 U. S. 56; Upton vs. Tribilcock, Id. 45; Buffalo <em>&amp; </em>Allegheny Railroad Co. vs. Cary, 26 N.

Co., 10 Watts 363; Edinboro Academy vs. Robinson, 1 Wright 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">Where a stockholder of a corporation is called upon to respond to a liability as such, and where a party has contracted with a corporation, and is sued upon the contract, neither is permitted to deny the existence or the legal validity of such corporation. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>hold, otherwise, would be contrary to the plainest principle of reason and of good faith, and involve a mockery of justice. Parties must take the consequences of the position they assume. They are estopped to deny the reality of the state of things which they have made to appear to exist, and upon which others have been led to rely. Sound ethics require that the apparent, in its effects and consequence, should be as if it were real, and the law properly so regards it.
