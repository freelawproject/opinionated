No. 13 October and November T\u00e9rm, 1874. Defendants in error having filed a mechanics\u2019 lien against Berger ; issued a sci, <em>fa. </em>in which they were non-suited. A. second <em>sci. fa. </em>was issued and Berger claimed that the non-suit destroyed the mechanics\u2019 lien and was a bar to the second <em>sci. fa. </em>The Court below entered judgment for Long and Stewart and this was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-12\"><em>S.

The <em>sci. fa. </em>is but process to enforce the claim, and there is no good reason why the mere failure to pursue it to judgment-should have a different effect than failure to prosecute has in other cases. It is a mere loss of the particular process but not a bar to new process. The claim filed being unaffected by the loss oithe first process, there is clearly no necessity to file a new claim. To hold this would olten defeat the lien by the expiration of the time of filing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
