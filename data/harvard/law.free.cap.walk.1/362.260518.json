Both policies contained a stipulation that permission to use kerosene must be endorsed on the policy in writing. The evidence showed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tbe agent who effected the insurance for both companies agreed that kerosene might be used, and that he endorsed it on the Home policy, but accidentally omitted it on the North American. The judge charged the jury <em>inier alia </em>as follows : \u201cIf on the other hand the jury find, under all the evidence, the books, bills of purchase, inventories and papers of the plaintiff were burned, and that the bills of particulars, itemized statements of stock and values furnished to the company were honestly, truthfully and in good faith made up from the best sources of information and accuracy within his power; that [there was no intent to defraud, and no intended misrepresentation, false statement or concealment in his proofs of loss; a discrepancyjbetween the plaintiffs statement of quantity and values of his stock, thus made in good faith and to the best of his judgment, and the amounts and values as shown by the evidence upon the trial will not defeat his right to recover. If the jury find under the evidence that the plaintiff in good faith furnished to the company all the evidences of loss within his power; that his representations, statements and estimates were honest, fair and correct to the best of his judgment, with do attempt to defraud, he may recover the actual loss sustained, even although his stock on hand when the fire occurred was less than the amount insured].\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\">The sworn statement showed a loss o\u00ed $12,454.

Fire Ins. Co., 5 Rawle 342. The permission ought to have been endorsed, and it will be considered as done; Spring Garden Ins. Co. vs. Scott, <em>ante </em>181. An insurance company will not be allowed to take advantage of the mistakes of its agents; Beal vs. Park Ins. Co., 16 Wis. 241. A reasonable estimate of the loss is all that is required; Mason vs. Harvey, 8 Exchequer 819; McLaughlin vs. Washington Ins. Co., 23 Wendell 525; Franklin Ins. Co. vs. Updegraff, 7 Wr. 350. No inference of false swearing can be drawn from the verdict of a jury. And the fact that the jury gives a verdict for less than the claim does not sustain a charge of false swearing; Moore vs. Protection Ins. Co., 29 Maine 97; Franklin Ins. Co. vs. Culver, 6 Ind. 137; Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. vs. Munday, 5 Caldwell (Tennessee) 547; Gerhauser vs. North British Ins. Co., 6 Nevada 15. A false statement of loss to avoid a policy must be wilfully false in a material matter with intent to deceive the insurer; Marion vs. Great Republic Ins. Co., 35 Missouri. The burden of proving the falsity of the statement is on the company; Insurance Co. vs. Weides, 14 Wall. 375. Whether the discrepancy is so gross as to avoid the policy is a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The decision of the lower Court was affirmed by the Supreme Court, on March 16, 1874, in the following opinion:</p>\n<author id=\"b372-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The interpretation of the testimony of Fuller, the witness, if disputed was for the jury. We may say we understand he said he gave permission to use petroleum and oil under both the policies, and endorsed it on the Home \u00bfpolicy, but omitted endorsing it on the other unintentionally, and can account for the omission only through his forgetfulness. This, we think, is the meaning of the note taken of what he said. It was therefore competent to show, that the want of the endorsement was an accidental omission to enter, what was actually agreed upon. It was the mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of the agent of the company and ought not to prejudice the plaintiff. This renders the second assignment of error unavailing. The language of the charge is not literally that of the testimony but we cannot say there was a substantial variance between the statement of the judge and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">We discover nothing to correct in the other errors assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
