On the trial, his contention was that there was no tract, piece or parcel of land, situate, lying and being in Belfast township, Fulton county, Pennsylvania, surveyed to McHorton Moore, for part of the purchase money for which said bond was given ; and that therefore, as the consideration of the same had failed, the bond could not be recovered on in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">It appeared that on June 9th, 1856, William Cooper, Treasurer of Fulton county, conveyed to the County Commissioners property which was sold for taxes, and which was described as a \u201ctract of unseated land containing 310 acres, situate in Belfast township, Fulton county, surveyed to MeHorton Moore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">On July 17th, 1864, a deed was made by the Commissioners to J. L. Caven for said tract of land, who in turn made a deed therefor to George F. Spicer, May 25, 1865, by whom it was conveyed to David Hamaker, and the bond and warrant sued on given to said Spicer, by whom it was assigned to William B. Whitecar, who brought this suit as assignee of George F. Spicer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">Delendants gave testimony showing that there was no tract of land in Belfast township, Fulton county, Pennsylvania, surveyed to MeHorton Moore, and offered in evidence a certificate from the Department of .Internal Affairs that no warrant had ever issued in the name of MeHorton Moore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">Plaintiff read in evidence (under objection by defendant, on the ground of irrelevancy, which objection was overruled and exception granted to defendant) the deposition of A. J. Fore, a surveyor of Fulton county, as follows: \u201cI was county surveyor of this county ; I have been county surveyor for three successive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>terms, commencing in 1851. I know of no tract of land warranted in the name of McHorton Moore ; there is no tract of that kind in this county, to my knowledge, of that name. I know of a tract warranted in the name of Moore Wharton ; it is situated in Todd township, Fulton county, originally Belfast township, Bed-ford county. I have surveyed the Moore Wharton tract, I think, in 1841, by official copy of survey, and have surveyed it at different times since; it contains 310 acres and 31 perches. [Here draft shown to witness.] I made this draft; I made this draft from the fj,eld notes of a survey made from an official copy; this is a correct diagram of the Moore Wharton Survey. There is a tract of land on the unseated land books taxed in the name of McHorton Moore in this county. I believe the McHorton Moore tract and the Moore Wharton tract are one and the same tracts. Something over 200 acres of the Moore Wharton tract is unseated, and this portion never was seated.\u201d And the deposition of R. A. McDonald, Prothonotary of Fulton county and clerk of County Commissioners, as follows : \u201cI have dealt extensively in unseated lands in this county for quite a number of years. I have grown somewhat familiar with the unseated lands of this county; I know of a tract of land warranted in the name of Moore Wharton, partly seated and partly unseated, as stated by Mr. Fore. There is a tract of land in the unseated land book in the name of McHorton Moore in this county on the Belfast township list, which I think is identical with the Moore Wharton tract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\">The Court below in charging the jury said, <em>inter aha : </em>\u201c The mere fact that the defendant has shown to you that no warrant was ever issued to the person named in his deed \u2014 McHorton Moore \u2014 does not establish this (i. <em>e. </em>that no title\u2019 passed to the conveyance in consideration of which the bond sued on was given). The plaintiff has shown to you all the elements of a good tax title, and although not bound to do so, has shown that there was land in Fulton county which passed by the said. Both parties knew that it was a tax title.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">October 16, 1877, Yerdict for plaintiff for $1,140. Hamaker then took a writ of error complaining of the admission of the deposition of Andrew J. Fore and Robert A. McDonald, and the portion of the Judge\u2019s charge above quoted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>John R.

Farrar vs. Warfield, 8 Mart. N. S. 695; 1 Greenleaf Evidence, Sect. 440. The names are not similar in sound. \u201cDaniel Kladder\u201d was held to be different from \u201cDaniel Kritler.\u201d Brotherline vs. Hammond, 19 P. F. S. 131. Where there were two tracts of 40 acres each assessed to J. Coleman and one was sold, the purchaser could not recover ; there being no evidence to identify which one was sold. Hess vs. Herrington, 23 P. F. S. 438. There must be something to identify the tract sold. City vs. Miller, 13 Wright 440; Lyman vs City, 6 P. F. S. 488. Defendant below had a right to set up failure of title. Youngman vs. Linn, 2 P. F. S. 416; White vs. Lowry, 3 Casey 254; Murphy vs. Richardson, 4 Casey 292. Part of the land was seated according to depositions of Fore and McDonald and consequently no title to that passed by a sale of it as <em>unseated.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-4\">\n<em>John Dolman, Esq., contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah\">The point that part of the land was seated was not made below and cannot be raised in the Supreme Court. Dorman vs. Turnpike Co., 3 W. 126; Wright vs. Wood, 23 Pa. Stat. 120. A general objection to a deposition which is evidence for any purpose is not available. Bickham vs. Smith, 12 P. F. S. 45; Garsed vs. Turner, 21 P. F. S., 56. Defendant must show the title was positively bad. Ludwick vs. Huntzinger, 5 W. &amp; S. 51. When unseated land is sold the title of the real owner passes whether it be assessed in the owners name or not. Strauch vs. Shoemaker, 1 W. &amp; S. 166; Russell vs. Werntz, 12 Harris 337. If there be uncertainty in the description, evidence <em>aliunde </em>may he offered to designate the land.

No objection was made, save for irrelevancy. Had objection been made specially to the portions wherein the witnesses expressed their belief as to the identity of the McHorton Moore tract and Moore Wharton tract, doubtless it would have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The main question is, was there sufficient evidence of the invalidity of the tax title ? Although the burden was upon the defendant to show failure of consideration, he was entitled to all testimony in the cause bearing on the question. It is conceded that both parties knew, at the time of conveyance and giving the bond and mortgage, the nature of the vendor\u2019s title to the land. The defendant gave testimony tending to show that no land answering to the description in the deed could be found. Fore and McDonald, on plaintiff\u2019s side, proved there is a tract of land on the unseated land books taxed in the name of McHorton Moore ; that no tract warranted in his name can be found; that a tract is warranted in the name of Moore Wharton, partly seated and partly unseated, containing 310 acres, the unseated part containing something over 200 acres. Not a particle of evidence tends to show an actual division of the Moore Wharton tract; and if any part was seated at the time of the assessment the whole was, and consequently no title passed by virtue of the Treasurer\u2019s sale. Green vs. Watson, 10 Casey 332; Ellis vs. Hall, 7 Har. 292; Kennedy vs. Daily, 6 Watts 269; Fish vs. Brown, 5 Watts 441; Sheafer vs. McKabe, 2 Watts 421. We could hardly have supposed a matter so fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s case related to the assessment which was the foundation of the sale, were it not for the point in his argument, that if there was failure of title to the seated portion the equities between the parties could have been adjusted in the Court below had this question been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The Treasurer\u2019s deed was \u201cfor a tract of unseated land containing 310 acres, situate in Belfast township, Fulton county, surveyed to McHorton Moore.\u201d All the witnesses agree that no land can be found which was surveyed or warranted in that name. None testifies that McHorton Moore was ever known, or reputed, as the owner, tenant or claimant of the Moore Wharton tract. A sale for taxes without description, circumstance or name, having any known relation to the land, is bad. Lyman vs. City of Philadelphia, 6 P. F. S. 488. An assessment of a certain number of acres of land, without any other description or means of identity, in name of a person unknown in connection with any title or possession of the land, will not support a sale for. taxes. The City of Philadelphia vs. Miller, 13 Wright 440. After reference to those cases, it is enough to say, that \u201cMcHorton Moore tract\u201d is not descriptive of the Moore Wharton tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>So, far from the plaintiff having shown a good tax title he showed a worthless one. The jury should have been instructed that, believing the witnesses of both parties, no land passed by the sale for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
