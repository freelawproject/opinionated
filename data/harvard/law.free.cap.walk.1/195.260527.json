In Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">The Township of Concord filed a bill in equity against the Philadelphia and \"Baltimore Central Railroad Company to restrain the defendant from permitting the approaches to the' railroad crossing, on a public road in said township to remain out of repair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">The following extract from the report of <em>H. G. Howard, Esq., </em>Master, .sets forth the facts in the case as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">\u201cAbout, the year 1855, the defendant, under a charter from the Commonwealth, and under the provisions' of the General Railroad Law of 1849, constructed its road through the Township of Concord, the plaintiff, and, in doing so, crossed over a public road in said township known as \u2018Marshal\u2019 road, which had been laid out and opened long anterior to the construction of the railroad. The bed of the railroad at this point being higher than that of the public road, the latter was filled in by the defendant on each side of the railroad, thus changing the grade of the road, and making approaches by which it crosses the railroad at grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">\u201cThe draft marked \u2018A\u2019 shows the present grade of the public road, and that attached to the defendant\u2019s answer shows the change in the bed-line. It appears to have been filled in some seven or eight feet, and the grade thus changed from a descending one of about three degrees to an ascending one of about five or six degrees on the northeasterly side of the railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">\u201cThe approach on the northeast is now out of repair, and the defendant, being notified to make the necessary repair, refuses to do so, on the ground that it is the duty of the supervisors to keep this part of the road in order as much as' any other portion, and that there is no legal obligation on the company, defendant, to maintain the approach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff asks to have the defendant enjoined from permitting such approaches to remain longer out of repair, and to pay the plaintiff all expenses to which it has been, or may be, subjected, by reason of the necessity imposed on it to put said approaches in good order, and in a safe condition for public travel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">\u201cThe defendant insists, first, that the plaintiff has mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>his remedy, and that it is not entitled to any relief in a court of equity, because it has a full and adequate remedy at law ; and second, that there is no legal liability on the defendant to maintain repairs on these approaches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-4\">\u201cUpon a careful consideration, the master is very clearly of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for, and that its bill should be dismissed. It hence becomes unnecessary to examine the merits of the controversy, or to determine the legal obligations of the defendant with respect to the matter in dispute. Equity does not interfere where there is a remedy at law; Pusey vs. Wright, <em>7 </em>Cas., 387; Gallagher vs. Eayette County, 2 Wright, 102.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">\u201cIt is not attempted to be shown that the plaintiff has suffer\u00e9d or is about to suffer, any irreparable injury. Damages will fully compensate any injury which it can possibly suffer, and it must therefore- resort to the proper tribunal to ascertain what they are ; Richards\u2019 Appeal, 7 S., 105 ; Grey vs. Railroad, 1 G., 412.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">\u201cThe supervisors, representing their plaintiff $ have as undoubted control over this portion of the public road as any other. It is their duty to see that it is kept in repair, and if there is an obligation resting upon the railroad company to keep the approaches in proper order, which it fails to fulfill, the supervisors can certainly put on the necessary repairs, and recover the cost thereof from the defendant in a suit at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">\u201cWhenever a person or corporation, bound to repair a public highway, refuses to do so, when necessary, on notice from the proper officers, they may make the necessary repairs and recover the expense thereof in an action of assumpsit; P. R. R. Co. vs. Duquesne Borough, 10 Wr., 228 ; Woodring vs. Forks Township, 4 C., <em>355.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">\u201cThe defendant declines to waive this defence to the plaintiff\u2019s bill, and the master therefore reports that it should be dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">November 4th, 1878, the Court confirmed the master\u2019s report and dismissed the bill. The Township of Concord then appealed, complaining of the action of the Court in confirming the report and dismissing the bill.
