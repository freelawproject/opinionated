THE ALLEGHENY INSURANCE CO.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b344-7\">Where the oharter of an insuranoe company requires the insurance contracts to be in writing, a verbal contract is not binding on the company.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b344-8\">Error to Common Pleas of Allegheny County, No. 180 October and November Term, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">This was an action on the case to recover for the loss of the steamboat \u201cCarrie,\u201d on a verbal contract of insurance. Hazlett called at the office of the insurance company and desired to get an insurance on the freight list, if the same had not already been insured by another part owner in St. Louis. Plaintiff testified that he agreed to notify the company if other insurance had been effected. The insurance company\u2019s officers testified that the risk was not to attach until notified that the other insurance was not effected. No premium had been paid. Hazlett proceeded to St. Louis and found that the steamboat had been lost and had not been previously insured. He then, after the loss notified the company, and subsequently brought suit. The charge of the Court was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-10\">Gentlemen of the Jury: There is no doubt in my mind that a contract of insurance with contingencies connected with it, such as is claimed by the plaintiff, would be valid at common law, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>there is some law prohibiting its taking effect, without being reduced to writing. For the present we charge you it is valid without being reduced to writing. The plaintiff claims this insurance was effected the second time he went to the office, previous to going to St. Louis, the understanding and agreement being that it was to take place immediately, and whether it was to continue depended upon what action had been taken by Mr. Kountz, who was managing .the affairs of the boat at St. Louis; if he had insured the interests of the party, then there was to be no contract, and o\u00ed that fact the plaintiff was to notify defendant if he received information while here, and if not, when he reached St. Louis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-4\">The allegation of the defendant is, this was not the agreement; that all these things took place with regard to the general matters, that th\u00e9 parties were there, talked' about the rate of insurance, fixed upon the rate of premium, etc., and they generally concurred, but they say their understanding of the agreement was that this insurance was not to take effect immediately, but when they received notice as to how the matter stood with Mr. Kountz, and then, and not till then, was the risk to attach. In this case, although it may seem a very small matter, the difference is very radical, because if the theory of the defence is correct, the loss having occurred before any notice was given, and before the policy was to take effect, of course the plaintiff cannot recover. But if the contract was the other way, and the policy was to take effect immediately, provided Mr. Kountz had not insured, which it appears he had not, this policy would be outstanding at the time of the loss, and treating this notice as sufficient, which we shall do at present, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">The points and the answers were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2O\">plaintiff\u2019s points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">The Court is requested to charge to the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">1. That if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff on or about the 3rd day of April, 1868, applied to the Insurance Company, defendants, to insure one-fourth of the freight list of the steamer \u201cCarrie,\u201d then on a trip from St. Louis to Fort Benton on the Missouri river; that it was there and then agreed that the said company would take said risk, at the same, rate of premium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that was charged by the Western Insurance Company for a similar insurance on'the same freight list in favor of Andrew Ackley; and that the said risk should take effect if Captain Kountz had not insured said freight list at St. Louis: that said Kountz had not so\u2018insured the said freight list, and that the said steamer was sunk on the said trip, and her freight whollj' lost; then they should find for the plaintiff, and their verdict should be for the amount of the insurance, less the premium shown by the evidence to have been paid by Andrew Ackley in the Western Insurance Company, together with the interest from the date of loss till date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\">Affirmed <em>pro forma </em>and question reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">2 That in deciding whether to accept the story of the plaintiff or the defendants, the jury have a right to compare the <em>probability </em>of the two stories, and to consider whether it was likely that Captain Hazlett would have been satisfied with an arrangement that would have left him without insurance until he would get to hear from\u2019St. Louis and send word back to Pittsburgh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">3. That the law does not require, a contract of insurance to be in writing, nor does it require the payment of the premium .before the loss ; and that if the jury believe that Captain Hazlett insured his interest in the steamer\u2019s freight list, on the same terms and conditions that subsisted between Andrew Ackley and tbi\u00a9 Western Insurance Company, they should find for the plaintiff the amount of the insurance testified by plaintiff\u2019s witness, less the amount of the premium, together with interest thereon till date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">Affirmed <em>proforma </em>and question reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">dependant\u2019s points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-10\">1. That the alleged contract of insurance upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover, not being in writing or print, but being wholly verbal, was null and void, and there can be no recovery on-the cause. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-12\">Eefused <em>proforma, </em>and question' reserved, see plaintiff\u2019s 3rd point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-13\">2. That under the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence he was bound to give the defendant Company notice whether or not Captain Kountz had effected insurance at St. Louis, and this notice he was to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>either before he left Pittsburgh or when he reached St. Louis; and having by his own testimony shown that he did not give such notice, he is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-4\">Refused <em>pro </em>forma, and question reserved, see plaintiff\u2019s 1st point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">3. That the order which the plaintiff states he gave Capt. Kountz upon the defendant Company, and which said Kountz testifies he presented to said Company upon his return to Pittsburgh, was not such notice as the plaintiff was bound to give the defendant, according to his own version of the alleged contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-6\">Refused <em>pro forma, </em>and question reserved, see plaintiff\u2019s 1st point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">May 19, 1873, verdict for plaintiff for $3,050.40, subject to opinion of the court on the question of law reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-8\">On September 19, 1873, the court entered judgment in favor of defendant on the reserved point in the following opinion per</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b347-9\">Stowe, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-10\">The questions of law reserved in this case are raised by the plaintiff\u2019s first and third points and by the defendant\u2019s first, second and third points, and are :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">1st. Whether a <em>verbal </em>contract of insurance, such as specified in plaintiff\u2019s first point, is binding upon defendant, and entitles plaintiff to recover in this action; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-12\">2d. Whether plaintiff having agreed, at the time the said contract was entered into, to notify the defendant either before he left Pittsburgh or upon his arrival at St. Louis, whether an insurance had been effected by Captain Kountz, the boat having been lost before plaintiff arrived at St. Louis, a draft or order on the defendant for the amount of the insurance money and a demand for it is a sufficient compliance with such agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-13\">Upon the first question, I think the law under the charter of defendant is clearly with defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-14\">Upon the second question, I am by no means free from doubt, but that the matter may come squarely before the Supreme Court, in case I should err upon the first question, I have concluded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>rule it also in favor of defendant, and hold that a demand for the amount of policy, less premium, such as stated by plaintiff, was not sufficient notice as to whether Captain Kountz had insured at St. Louis, which plaintiff had agreed to give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-4\">Judgment is therefore directed to be entered for defendant upon both the reserved questions of law <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>upon payment of verdict fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">Hazlett then took a writ of error complaining of the judgment of the court below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-6\"><em>George Shiras, Esq., </em>for plaintiff in error</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai0g\">argued that a verbal contract of insurance is binding; Hamilton vs. Lycoming Insurance Co., 5 Barr 339; Trustees vs. Brooklyn Insurance Co., 18 Barb 69; Carpenter vs. Safety Ins.

The question reserved was, whether a .verbal contract of insurance such as specified in the plaintiffs first point, is binding on the defendant, and entitles the plaintiff to recover in this action. Contracts of insurance are expressly required by the defendants\u2019 charter to be in writing, under the seal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of the corporation and signature of the President or Vice President. The point referred to in the reservation does not raise a question of estoppel. It is not averred that the premium was paid and that the plaintiff had no knowledge of the charter requirement, nor is notice to the defendant of non-insurance in St. Louis averred in the point, though it is set forth as part of the transaction that the insurance should take effect if Capt. Kountz had not so insured the freight in St. Louis. This implies it was not to take effect if he had insured there. Notice of non-insurance was therefore essential to fix the defendants finally for payment. There being no sufficient ground of estoppel alleged the case fell back according to the terms of the reservation upon the mere binding effect of a verbal contract for insurance, and this the charter answers in the negative. The second question does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">Judgment affimed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
