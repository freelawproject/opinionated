No. 135 May Term, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">This was an action of assumpsit brought by Wm. J. Robinson to use of J. R. Clark against the County of Cameron for 1786.42 redemption money. On June 14th, 1864, Robinson purchased two tracts of land to which he claimed title at Treasurer\u2019s sale ; so as to perfect the title. J. F. Clark also claimed title, and on June 12, 1866, redeemed these two tracts of land. On August 12, 1874, these disputes as to the title were settled, Clark conveying to Robinson his interest in the land and Robinson assigned to J. F. Clark his right to the redemption money, who reassigned it soon after to J. R. Clark. On February 5, 1875, Clark made a demand upon the County Commissioners for the money which they refused to pay, and suit was brought on April 12, 1875. The charge of the Court was as follows, per</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b313-7\">Wilson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">In June, 1864, warrant No. 4962 and warrant No. 4963, each containing 990 acres, situate in Shippen Township, in Cameron County, were sold at Treasurer\u2019s sale for taxes which had previously been assessed against them as unseated lands, and were purchased by Wm. Robinson, the plaintiff, one on the 14th day of June and the other on the 16th day of June, 1864, for taxes and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-9\">J. F. Clark claimed title to said warrants, and on the 12th day of June, 1866, went to the Treasurer\u2019s office and paid to the Tr easurer of Cameron County $546.14, the amount necessary to redeem said warrants. The Treasurer gave J. F. Clark a receipt of that date in full for the redemption of those warrants, and also mark ed them redeemed on the book. Robinson paid the taxes on the lands the two years intervening between the time of his purchase and the time of redemption by J. F. Clark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\">On the 12th day of August, 1874, Wm. Robinson and J. F. Clark compromised their adverse claims of title by J. F. Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>conveying his interest in the lands to Wm. Robinson, and tbe latter assigning tbe redemption money to J. F. Clark, which was soon after reassigned by him to J. R. Clark, the present use plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-4\">A few days prior to the 12th day of April, 1875, the plaintiff called upon the Commissioners of Cameron County and demanded payment to him of the redemption money. The Commissioners refused payment, wherefore on the 12th day of April, 1875, this action of assumpsit was commenced to recover the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">The defendant alleges that the county is not liable for the redemption money paid to the Treasurer, and maintains that the liability is upon the Treasurer, and that the action, if maintained at all, must be brought against the Treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">This position we negative, and instruct the jury that the County is liable for monies paid tbe Treasurer of the County to redeem lands sold for taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">The Act of 1840 requiring the Treasurer to pay redemption money to his successor, and making it the duty of the County Auditors to charge the Treasurer in the same manner that other money received by him is charged, and the same to be paid to the purchaser or their legal representatives when called for, by orders drawn by the Commissioners of the County upon the Treasurer, as in other cases, determines this position against the defendant, whatever doubts may have been entertained prior to the enactment of this statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">As a further defence in this case the defendant has pleaded the statute of limitation. The undisputed evidence is that the re. demption money claimed was paid to the Treasurer on the 12th day of June, 1866, and this suit was not commenced until the 12th day of April, 1875, eight years and ten months after the plaintiff had a right to demand and receive the money claimed in this action.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">The plaintiff answers and says that the evidence is unchallenged that no demand was ever made in this case until two or three days before this action was commenced, and hence no' cause of action accrued or could have been sustained by plaintiff until after demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The facts as alleged on both sides are undisputed, and it is not easy to gainsay either legal conclusion demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">Ordinary diligence would have informed Mr. Robinson that the redemption money was.paid on or before the expiration of the two years from the time of his purchase. J. F. Clark, his assignee, had knowledge absolute, he having paid the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">From the position we are driven to determine that the defendant must remain indefinately liable to demand an action at the will or even caprice of the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff be reasonably diligent in demand as well as action, and that both the right of demand and right of action must take the same fate and die on the same perch. We think the latter the better policy, nearer just and more in accord with recent decisions and warranted by the principles determined in Campbell vs, Boggs, 12 Wright, 524, and 9 Barr, 410, Laforge vs. Jayne.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">We therefore instruct the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and the verdict must be in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">Clark thereupon took this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-8\"><em>R.

Potter Co. vs. Oswego Township, 11 Wright, 162.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court below in the following opinion delivered October 1st, 1877:</p>\n<author id=\"b316-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">We think the Court below decided this case correctly upon the statute of limitations. The action of assumpsit is an action upon the case and falls within the statute. The subject of the action is money merely paid into the Treasury. It is not a voluntary deposit, or other cause of action which arises on demand merely. True a demand is necessary to inform the County of the person who claims title to the money, but it is not a demand arising out of a contract or other ground of liability which makes the demand essential to the cause of action. The moment the money was paid into the Treasury the purchaser\u2019s right to it accrued and a cause of action arose. When the two years from the day of the sale expired, his title to the land became absolute, and not before. At the end of that time, at least, a duty lay upon him to inquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>whether a redemption had taken place, otherwise he must remain ignorant of the state of his title. In this case he lay by for over eight years before making a demand. Clearly this delay was at his own risk and we discover no reason why the statute should not apply to the case. It is quite as important that the county should have the benefit of the statute as a private individual. This case evidences the necessity of such a protection; for the County Commissioners were necessarily ignorant of the fact that the money had come into the Treasury, no account of it having appeared in the settlement before the Auditoi\u2019s. The principles of Campbell vs. Boggs, 12 Wr. 524, and Rhine\u2019s Administrators vs. Evans, 16 Smith, 192, are.properly applicable to this case, rather than those which govern technical trusts and stand on a different footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Note. \u2014 As between trustee and <em>cestui que trust </em>in express trusts the statute of limitations has no application and no length of time is a bar:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Zacharias vs. Zacharias, 11 Harris, 452; Lyon vs. Marclay, 1 Watts, 275; Finney vs. Cochran, 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>S., 118; Johnson vs. Humphrey, 14 S. &amp; R., 394; Martin vs. Jackson, 3 Casey, 506; Walker vs. Walker, 16 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 379; Fleming vs. Culbert, 10 Wright, 496; Kutz Appeal, 4 Wright, 90; Sterling\u2019s Estate, 15 Pitts.
