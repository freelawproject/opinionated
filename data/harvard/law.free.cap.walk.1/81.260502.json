No. 228 October and November Term, 1871. August 5th, 1871, Bill filed at <em>Nisi Prius </em>by Philadelphia and Erie R. R. Co. vs. Catawissa R. R. Co. to restrain defendants crossing plaintiffs railroad. Injunction issued restraining defendants from crossing plaintiff\u2019s railroad, except two construction trains once each way a day at 7 A. M. and 7 P. M., under the Act of June 19th, 1871, P. Laws, 1361. Sept. 29th, 1871. Catawissa R. R. Co. appealed. On November 26th, 1870, the Cata-wissa Railroad Co. filed bills in Northumberland and Lycoming Counties to restrain the Philadelphia and Erie R. R. from delaying, obstructing or preventing the Catawissa R. R. from locating the same crossings. An injunction against the Philadelphia and Erie was awarded March 19th, 1871, which was affirmed on appeal on May 7th, 1871. The Catawissa then proceeded in the construction of their railroad, and between June 19th, 1871, and Aug. 5th, 1871, expended $182,000 in construction o\u00b1 the railroad.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-7\"><em>F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">It is a rule of very general application in this Court that Mandatory matter is not to be part or portion of a decree for prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>nary injunction. The object of such injunction is usually to preserve the statu quo of the parties until final hearing, but the Act of 19th of June, 1871, P. Laws 1361, entitled \u201cAn Act relating to legal proceedings by or against corporations,\u201d seems to require a different practice. For the present, at least, we must regard that Act as valid and binding, and it requires that \u201cin all proceedings in Courts of Law or Equity of this Commonwealth, when they relate to crossings of railroads it shall be their duty to ascertain and define by their decree the mode of such crossing which will inflict the least practicable injury upon the rights of the Company owning the road which is intended to be crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">And if in the judgment of such Courts it is reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing they shall by their process prevent a crossing at grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We cannot practically put in use the Act in this ease, supposing for the present that its provisions extend to the Catawissa road, which we do not definitely settle, without doing as did our brother Sharswood at <em>Nisi Prius </em>prescribe the manner of its use-at the crossings of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. This explanation seems necessary in order to preclude, what might be thought a divergence by this Court from its ordinary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">And now, to wit: Nov. 9th, 1871, in view of the circumstance that the appellants have finished their road, and it is now in running order for the carriage of freight and passengers, as well as construction materials, we have on consideration of the facts and arguments of counsel considered it expedient to modify the decree at <em>Nisi Prius </em>as follows, namely :</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">That the defendants, the Catawissa Railroad Company shall be permitted to cross the complainants road at the several crossings now put in, or constructed with all their trains of cars, on agreeing to maintain a watchman at each of said crossings, at all time s, when the trains on their road are passing, and that each, and every train shall come to a full stop before crossing the complainants road, and then pass over at a rate of speed not exceeding four miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>' This order to supply the conditions of crossing prescribed in the decree in this case entered at <em>Nisi Prius, </em>Aug. 10th, 1871, and no more; and to remain until further order. And so much of said decree as relates to the reference to engineers, to remain unaffected by this modification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
