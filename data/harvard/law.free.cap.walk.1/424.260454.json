No. 175\u00bd January Term, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">This case arose from a proceeding to assess damages caused by the opening of a State road, called Conshohocken Avenue, in Philadelphia. Amos and Wm. George originally owned the land on which this State road is located, and during their ownership the \u201cOld Columbia Railroad\u201d was constructed through their land, occupying the same land as that occupied by said Conshohocken Avenue subsequently. This land was taken by the State by virtue of the Acts of Assembly of February 26, 1826, April 9, 1827, and March 24, 1828. On December 20, 1861, the representatives of the Commonwealth, conveyed the entire bed of said railroad to the Philadelphia and Reading R. R. Co., who by deed of November 25, 1852, conveyed ail the right therein to Algernon and Percival Roberts, who now claim damages for taking the same. The use of the land for railroad purposes was discontinued some time in 1851. On July 20,1852, Charles E. DTnvilliers acquired the interest of the Georges by a deed which described the property by metes'and bounds, and included the bed of said railroad. The estate of said Charles DTnvilliers claimed damages tor the land, acquired as aforesaid, and also by virtue of the following transfer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">Philadelphia, October 22, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">We hereby sell, transfer and assign to Charles E.

The jury awarded to the DTnvilliers\u2019 estate the sum of $10,000, which was reduced to $6,000 aferwards, but awarded nothing to Roberts. Roberts then filed exceptions, which the Court overruled, and confirmed the report of the jury on January 10, 1876. Roberts then appeal to the Supreme Court, complaining of the action of the Court below in overruling his exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-7\"><em>Charles H. </em>Jones, <em>Esq., </em>for appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-8\">The fee was vested in the Commonwealth: Act or March 24, 1828, 10 Sm. Laws, 113, 118; Act of February 25, 1826, section 8, 9 Sm. Laws, 45.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-9\">The acts are in <em>pari </em>materia: Commonwealth vs. Fisher, 1 Penrose &amp; Watts, 462; Commonwealth vs. McAllister, 2 Watts, 190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">This fee passed to her grantees : Haldeman vs. Pennsylvania R.

S. 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-11\">The Georges were under the'mistake of supposing that the title to this land reverted back to them, and this mistake in the law is shared by the counsel of the DTnvilliers\u2019 estate, who claimed before the jury that Roberts never had the fee. Roberts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>DTnvilliers were laboring under this mutual mistake, when the paper before mentioned was executed, and neither had any idea that any title to land passed by it. The consideration $50 for three acres, shows there was a mistake, for George sold part of the same land two weeks afterwards for $400 per acre. So also the instrument itself shows that the parties had no intention of selling land. It has no commencement or conclusion; no premises, habendum or tenendum. .It contains no words of inheritance, and is not under seal. Equity will relieve where there bas been mutual mistake, and the price is so inadequate as to show that there is a mistake: Coughenour vs. Stautt, 27 P. F. S. 191; Gross vs. Leber, 11 Wright, 520; Heacock vs. Fly, 2 Harris, 540; Rankin vs. Mortimere, 7 Watts, 374; Tenbrooke vs. Jahke, 27 P. F.
