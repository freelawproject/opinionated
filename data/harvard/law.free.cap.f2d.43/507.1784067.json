Wainwright against Charles Carr on two notes for $8,889 each. On one of the notes, however, there was indorsed a credit of $1,667. It ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>pears that the two notes in suit, with another for $8,889 (all of which were made payable to the order of the plaintiff), were made November 2,1925, by the corporation of Charles Carr, Inc., of which the defendant was president, and were given in part payment for land which the corporation had purchased from Wainwright, who tried to negotiate the notes, but had not been able to do so. He thought that, if the defendant would indorse them and make himself personally liable for their payment, he could negotiate them. Wainwright agreed to pay Carr $1,667 for his indorsement by crediting that amount on one of the notes as having been received by him. Carr indorsed them on February 20, 1926. It does not appear, however, that he ever actually received $1,667 or any other sum for the indorsement. Wainwright was apparently unable to sell the notes and brought this suit against Carr on two of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">. The facts as stated above are, in substance, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which differs somewhat from the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Carr defended on the ground that he was an accommodation indorser, and, under the facts and the law, the plaintiff,'the accommodated party, could not maintain the suit against him. The question, therefore, on which the case depends, is whether or not the facts as stated constitute Carr an accommodation indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s ease, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, but the trial judge denied this. When all the testimony was in, he moved for a directed .verdict, but this motion was likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Section 29 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law in effect in both New Jersey (3 Comp. St. N. J. 1910, p. 3738/ \u00a7 29); where the defendant resides, and Florida (Laws Fla. 1897, c. 4524, \u00a7 29), where the plaintiff resides, provides that; \u201cLiability of Accommodation Party. An accommodation party is one who has signed the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name to some other person. Such a person is liable on the instrument to' a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the time of taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The question depends upon what the antecedent of the word \u201ctherefor\u201d in the phrase, \u201cwithout receiving value therefor,\u201d is. The plaintiff contends that it refers to the in-dorsement of the accommodation party, while the defendant says it refers to the word \u201cinstrument.\u201d If the plaintiff\u2019s contention is correct, the case should have been submitted to the jury and the judgment entered upon its verdict should stand. If, on the contrary, \u201ctherefor\u201d refers to \u201cinstrument,\u201d a verdict should have been directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">If this section means that a person who loans his name to another and receives any consideration, however slight, for doing so, loses, as to that person, the right of an accommodation party, the language is unhappily chosen and is subject to just criticism. 14 Harvard Law Review,. 248. Mr. Justice Swayze, speaking for the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in the case of Morris. County Brick Co. v. Austin, 79 N. J. Law, 273, 275, 75 A. 550, 551, said: \u201cA careful reading of the section shows that this construction [that the words, \u2018value therefor,\u2019 refer to the loan of one\u2019s name on a negotiable instrument] is not necessary. The words are not \u2018without receiving value,\u2019 but \u2018without receiving value therefor.\u2019 The structure of the sentence is such that the last word can only refer to the negotiable instrument itself, not to the loan of the name by way of accommodation. This view was suggested by Mr. MeKeehan in 41 American Law Register, 499, 561. * * * If Austin loaned his name to the plaintiff corporation, it acquired no right of action against him. Messmore v. Meyer, 56 N. J. Law (27 Vroom) 31, 27 A. 938.\u201d Chief Justice Wheeler, speaking for the Supreme Court of Connecticut (Gruber v. Klein, 102 Conn. 34, 127 A. 907, 908), where section 29\u2019 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments-Law is in force, said: \u201c \u2018Without receiving value,\u2019 as used in- this section, means without receiving value for the note and not without receiving any consideration for lending his name. Morris County Brick Co. v. Austin, 79 N. J. Law, 273, 275, 75 A. 550; McGhee Inv. Co. v. Kirsher, 71 Colo. 137, 204 P. 891; Brannan\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law, p. 37.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">The word \u201cinstrument\u201d is the natural antecedent of the word \u201ctherefor.\u201d It either refers to instrument or \u201cone who has signed \u2014as maker, drawer, acceptor or endorser.\u201d If the words, \u201cwithout receiving value therefor\u201d do not refer to the \u201cinstrument,\u201d they refer to indorsement, but the word \u201cindorsement\u201d is not used in this section, and the words \u201cfor the loan of his name\u201d are not \u25a0used antecedently to the word \u201ctherefor.\u201d If \u201cinstrument\u201d is not the antecedent of \u201ctherefor,\u201d there is no single word that is, and, in order to make out an antecedent, words must be supplied, in stating exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>what the antecedent is. It therefore seems that both reason and authority justify the conclusion that the words \u201cwithout receiving value therefor\u201d mean without receiving value for the instrument, and not for the endorsement. \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The defendant owned 30 per cent, of the stock of Charles Carr, Inc., the maker of the notes. But that fact has no bearing on the ease, for a corporation is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its stockholders, directors, and officers. If they lend their individual credit to the corporation of which they are members, by indorsing negotiable paper, they are entitled to the same rights and immunities as are third parties who indorse but who are not connected with the corporation. McDonald v. Luckenbach, 170 F. 434 (C. C. A. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">This is a suit by the plaintiff, the accommodated party, against the defendant, the accommodating party. It is well settled that the accommodated party cannot maintain a suit against his accommodation indorser. Messmore v. Meyer, 56 N. J. Law, 31, 27 A. 938; First National Bank of Roselle v. Dorvall, 89 N. J. Law, 298, 98 A. 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The notes were made payable to the order of the plaintiff and so could not be negotiated without his indorsement. Accordingly, he was the first indorser, and the defendant, second indorser, in the absence of express agreement, is not liable to the first endorser. Morris County Brick Co. v. Austin, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Under the evidence and the law in this case, the jury could not find that the defendant received value for the notes. He was, therefore, an accommodation indorser, and the plaintiff, the accommodated party, could not maintain the suit against him. There was nothing to submit to the jury. A verdict should have been directed. Therefore the judgment is reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
