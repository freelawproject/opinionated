(C. C. A.) 43 F.(2d) 355. The motion is based on the ground that appellee was prevented meantime from paying the judgment. If the record sustained the position taken, the relief would be properly granted. Bates v. Dresser, 251 U. S. 524, 40 S. Ct. 247, 64 L. Ed. 388. But it appears from the judgment entry that the tender of $7,500 was abandoned, when appellee sought to withdraw its answer and file an amended answer \u201cdenying any liability whatsoever to the plaintiff,\u201d and moved for judgment to that effect. Appellee\u2019s contest of the entire demand precludes allowance of the motion. It is therefore overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
