Douglas seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing as successive his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). As Douglas notes, the present motion is not successive because his prior \u00a7 2255 motion was dismissed without prejudice. <em>See In re Goddard, </em>170 F.3d 435, 438 (4th Cir.1999). However, because the claims in Douglas\u2019 second \u00a7 2255 motion are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65 (4th Cir.2005), Douglas has not made the requisite showing under \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
