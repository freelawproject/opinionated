We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-19\">Guzman first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for Guzman\u2019s role as a manager or organizer. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Creech, </em>408 F.3d 264, 270 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(Oct. 11, 2005) (No. 05-7201). In its written statement of reasons, the district court adopted the findings of the Presentence Report (PSR), which set forth facts showing that Guzman coordinated transportation of the load of cocaine at issue, took control of the operation after Manuel Zuniga became ill, and instructed the driver of the load regarding its delivery. Given these facts, the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>conclusion that the enhancement was appropriate was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 725 (5th Cir.2003) (\u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement was appropriate where defendant directed activities of another in sending and accepting packages regarding marijuana and paid him for those services); <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995) (a PSR generally bears sufficient indica of reliability to support a district court\u2019s factual findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Guzman next contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of the enhancement based on facts neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated his Sixth Amendment rights pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reject Guzman\u2019s argument that his objection to sufficiency of the evidence supporting the enhancement preserved this issue for appeal, as his objection did not sufficiently alert the district court that Guzman was raising a Sixth Amendment challenge. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pennell, </em>409 F.3d 240, 244-45 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Guzman has not shown that any Sixth Amendment error affected his substantial rights, because there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory rather than a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>For the same reason, we reject Guzman\u2019s additional unpreserved challenges to the district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity and its application of the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005) (No. 05-6242).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
