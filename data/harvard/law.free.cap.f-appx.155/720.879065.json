Owens contends on appeal that her evidence was sufficient to support her applications for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-24\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for asylum, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>sonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Owens fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Nor can Owens show that she was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-17\"> Owens\u2019s brief contains only a short reference to the CAT, obviously taken from the facts of another case and included by error. Therefore, we find that any claim as to the denial of CAT protection is waived. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
