Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The district court calculated the applicable guideline sentencing range as 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 a calculation the correctness of which Rodriguez-Torres does not challenge on appeal \u2014 and imposed a sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court\u2019s imposition of Rodriguez-Torres\u2019s sentence pursuant to the mandatory Sentence Guidelines systern was error. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 768-69 (2005). We assume that this error was properly preserved below. The district court, however, clearly stated at sentencing that if the Guidelines were held unconstitutional, it would impose the same sentence. Therefore, the Government has established that the sentencing error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005); see <em>also United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>United States v. Sealed Appellant 1, </em>140 Fed. Appx. 571, 572 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-18\">Rodriguez-Torres\u2019s second and last contention on appeal is that \u201cthe \u2018felony\u2019 and \u2018aggravated felony* provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) are unconstitutional.\u201d He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve this argument for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 346 (5th Cir.2004). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201c \u2018unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Therefore, we reject Rodriguez-Torres\u2019s contentions in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
