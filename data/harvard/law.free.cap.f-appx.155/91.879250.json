At sentencing, the district court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that Avant conspired to possess two kilograms of cocaine. Avant objected to the amount of drugs attributed to him based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In response to Avant\u2019s objections, the Government agreed that Avant could relitigate the drug quantity if there was a reversal by the Supreme Court on the <em>Blakely </em>issue. The district court thereafter sentenced Avant to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, based upon the two kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-23\">On appeal, Avant contends that the district court committed reversible error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it made a factual finding in determining his base offense level. Because Avant preserved this issue by objecting to the presentence report based on <em>Blakely, </em>we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-26\">The Government concedes error and that Avant should be resentenced under <em>Booker </em>based upon an agreement that the drug quantity could be relitigated if the Supreme Court applied <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines. We therefore vacate Avant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-27\"><em>We </em>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-28\">\n<em>VACATED-AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-19\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Avant\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
