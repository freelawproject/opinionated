We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">At the merits hearing, the immigration judge sustained the Government\u2019s objection and refused to accept certain documents Mirshokraei and his wife submitted in support of their applications for relief because the translations were not in compliance with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.33 (2005). The Board upheld this ruling and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">There is no support for the argument that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service had a pattern and practice of accepting documents at an immigration hearing that were not translated pursuant to \u00a7 1003.33. We further find the Government did not waive this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
