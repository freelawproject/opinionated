Jiang also petitions for review of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the United Nations Convention on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). After review, we deny Jiang\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b498-27\">Jiang, a native and citizen of China, entered the United States using a counterfeit Singapore passport. Jiang subsequently submitted an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief alleging persecution on account of his membership in Falun Gong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Falun Gong is a movement in the People\u2019s Republic of China that blends aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Taoism, Buddhism, and the meditation techniques of Qigong (a traditional martial art) with the teachings of Li Hongzhi. In 1999, the Chinese government banned Falun Gong as a \u201cthreat to social and political stability\u201d and began a nationwide crackdown against the movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The IJ denied Jiang\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. Specifically, the IJ concluded that Jiang\u2019s testimony was not credible because it was \u201cvague, general and for lack of a better term, gossamer.\u201d The IJ also noted: (1) that Jiang claimed to have joined Falun Gong at about the same time he acquired a passport to leave China and a visa to go to Malaysia; (2) Jiang\u2019s recent involvement with Falun Gong and his admission that he did not consistently practice Falun Gong in the United States; (3) that Jiang, upon arriving in the United States, did not immediately claim that he feared persecution and torture based on his Falun Gong membership, \u201cbut rather was apparently more than willing to get back on a plane\u201d; (4) that Jiang\u2019s demeanor \u201cappeared to be greater than nervousness\u201d; and (5) that Jiang\u2019s testimony appeared to have been \u201ccoached\u201d and \u201cmemorized.\u201d Given the above, the IJ stated that he \u201cquestion[ed] whether or not [Falun Gong] was practiced [by Jiang] in China.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Accordingly, the IJ concluded that Jiang had not met his burden of proof to establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal because he did not present specific and credible testimony, or produce any corroborative evidence, to demonstrate that he had suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of Falun Gong.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ also denied CAT relief because Jiang failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Jiang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Specifically, the BIA stated that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by the evidence given the \u201cnumerous inconsistencies in the evidence,\u201d noting, in particular: (1) the entries on Jiang\u2019s passport being inconsistent with his testimony; (2) the IJ\u2019s finding that Jiang\u2019s testimony was \u201cvague, general, and at times unresponsive\u201d; and (3) the lack of corroborative evidence to support Jiang\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Jiang petitions this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the opinion of the IJ because it is the final determination of the agency. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">[u]nder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. Thus, we do not engage in a de novo review of factual findings by the IJ. Similarly, we cannot find, or consider, facts not raised in the administrative forum, nor can we reweigh the evidence from scratch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations, citation, and alterations omitted). This Court has also concluded that \u201c[a]s with other factual findings, credibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. That is, the trier of fact must determine credibility, and [we] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">B. The IJ\u2019s Adverse Credibility Determination Regarding Jiang</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In this case, the IJ made very specific, cogent findings as to Jiang\u2019s credibility. Furthermore, the IJ specifically noted and relied upon material inconsistencies in Jiang\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">In <em>Forgue, </em>this Court concluded that the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1287 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">The cumulative inconsistencies in Jiang\u2019s version of events and documentary evidence are such that it was reasonable for the IJ to conclude that Jiang\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819 (\u201c[T]he IJ\u2019s extremely detailed adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s denial of [a petitioner\u2019s] petition.\u201d). Furthermore, Jiang has not carried his burden in rebutting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">Because we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the IJ, and because the IJ considered all the relevant evidence in the record in making its adverse credibility determination, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s denial of Jiang\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence. Furthermore, this Court has concluded that when a petitioner \u201chas failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for ... protection under CAT.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-16\">. An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \"refugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(42)(A). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory 'refugee' status.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\">. The IJ seemed to incorrectly determine that membership in Falun Gong may not fit within the five protected grounds for asylum and withholding of removal. For immigration purposes, Falun Gong is viewed as an imputed political opinion and a religion. <em>See Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 720-21 (9th Cir. 2004). The basis for the IJ's denial, however, was that Jiang failed to present credible evidence that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of Falun Gong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-14\">. The BIA reversed, however, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Jiang had filed a frivolous asylum application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
