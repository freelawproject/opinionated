Kenner also contends that the district court clearly erred in granting summary judgment on insufficient evidence (which, however, we review <em>de </em>novo). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Our review of the record on appeal, including pleadings and exhibits filed and arguments advanced in the appellate briefs of the parties, satisfies us that, under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review applicable to all rulings of the district court other than the grant of summary judgment \u2014 and on our <em>de novo </em>review of that judgment \u2014 there is no basis in fact or law for reversing the district court on any of its rulings in this case. Consequently, the orders and judgment of the district court are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"ALK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
