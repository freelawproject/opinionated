In his petition for review, Teng contends that the Board and the immigration judge erred in denying his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the CAT, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that Teng has failed to meet these standards. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-11\"> Teng does not challenge the Board\u2019s denial of his asylum claim as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
