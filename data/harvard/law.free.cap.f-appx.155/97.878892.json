Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs submitted and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Tessfay\u2019s motion. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We also deny Tessfay\u2019s motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
