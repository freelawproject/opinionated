It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2005). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). This presumption can be rebutted on a finding of a fundamental change of circumstances so that the alien no longer has a well-founded fear, or a finding that the alien could avoid persecution by relocating within the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A), (B) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-19\">Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngamrih, </em>371 F.3d at 187. The well-founded fear of persecution standard contains both a subjective and an objective component. \u201cAn applicant may satisfy the subjective element by presenting \u2018candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 201-02 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Berroteran-Melendez v. INS, </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1256 (9th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The objective element requires a showing of specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. Huam<em>an-Cornelio v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). Credibility findings, relevant to the subjective component, are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We accord broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that, if she were removed to her native country, her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); <em>see Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 370 (4th Cir.2004). A \u201cclear probability\u201d means it is more likely than not the alien would be subject to persecution. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). \u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal ... to establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal\u201d on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2005). A showing of past threat to life or freedom on such a ground creates a rebuttable presumption that the threat would recur upon removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i); <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 370. Withholding of removal is mandatory if the alien meets the standard of proof. <em>Stevic, </em>467 U.S. at 429-30,104 S.Ct. 2489.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio, </em>979 F.2d at 999 (internal quotation marks omitted)). We find the evidence was not so compelling as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">We further find the Board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance. Initially, we note the immigration judge did not deny Soumah her statutory and constitutional right to counsel. After being informed of her right to counsel, Soumah voluntarily chose to proceed pro se. Moreover, even if she was denied her right to counsel, Soumah has not shown she was prejudiced. <em>Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-14\"> The Board also denied Soumah\u2019s application for withholding under the Convention Against Torture. She does not challenge that holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
