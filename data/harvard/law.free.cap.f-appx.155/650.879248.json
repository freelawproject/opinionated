We previously rejected Steven Leon Shull\u2019s Equal Protection Clause argument and affirmed his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>United States v. Shull, </em>93 Fed. Appx. 586 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Shull\u2019s case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate our prior opinion and affirm Shull\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">A defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. 922(g) (2000), and has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense committed on different occasions is subject to a fifteen-year minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005). In supplemental briefs, Shull contends that the enhancement of his sentence based on the sentencing court\u2019s finding that he had the requisite number of prior violent felony offenses is contrary to the holding in <em>Booker. </em>Specifically, Shull contends that the facts supporting the application of \u00a7 924(e) were not charged in the indictment and found by a jury, nor were they admitted by him. He also contends that his convictions in North Carolina for breaking and entering were neither felonies, nor violent felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">Shull\u2019s predicate offenses consisted of five prior convictions in North Carolina for breaking and entering. He contends that, in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), these convictions should not be deemed punishable by a prison term exceeding one year, and therefore do not qualify as felony convictions. This argument was rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Blakely </em>did not alter ruling that North Carolina\u2019s lowest level of felonies are punishable by more than one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>in prison), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Shull also challenges the determination that his breaking and entering convictions qualify as \u201cviolent\u201d felonies. However, a conviction in North Carolina for breaking and entering has been held to satisfy the requirements of the statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>975 F.2d 1080, 1085 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that conviction in North Carolina for breaking and entering amounted to a \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and constituted a predicate violent felony). Thus, we hold that Shull had the necessary three predicate violent felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Furthermore, we have recently held that a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant had qualifying felony convictions that supported an armed career criminal designation does not violate <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>did nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 469, 163 L.Ed.2d 356 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Because on reconsideration of this case under <em>Booker, </em>we find no error in Shull\u2019s sentence, we reinstate our April 7, 2004 opinion and affirm Shull\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">\n<em>OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
