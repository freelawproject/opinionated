Ali does not contest the IJ\u2019s decision, affirmed by the BIA, to grant him the privilege of voluntary departure, rather than removal, but only appeals the refusal to grant a continuance of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The court is typically limited to reviewing the order of the BIA, but we may also review the underlying decision of the IJ to the extent it influenced the BIA\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s order, but also provided additional arguments to support the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Ali\u2019s request for continuance. Thus, we may review the orders of both the BIA and the IJ. We review the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe grant of a continuance of a deportation hearing lies within the sound discretion of the [IJ], who may grant a continuance upon a showing of good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">As a threshold matter, the government argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprives this court of jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order because the order affirms a discretionary decision of the IJ. This court has recently held that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not strip the court of jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions authorized by regulations rather than subchapter II of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the discretion to grant a continuance is authorized by regulation rather than the INA, the court has jurisdiction to review the order of the BIA affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Ali\u2019s request for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">Ali contends that the IJ\u2019s denial, and the BIA\u2019s affirmance, were an abuse of discretion because Ali had an application for labor certification pending before the Texas Workforce Commission and could file to adjust his status to permanent legal resident under section 245(i) of the INA as soon as the state and federal labor departments approved the application. Although the IJ denied Ali\u2019s request for continuance without stating a reason, the BIA, in its order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, noted that Ali had not shown that he met the requirements of section 245(i). Eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>to adjust status under section 245(i) of the INA requires a showing that the labor certification application was filed on or before April BO, 2001.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though Ali contends in his brief that an employer filed an application on his behalf by the 2001 deadline, the record contains no evidence to support this contention. Because Ali cannot show that he would meet the requirements of section 245(i) for adjusting status if the IJ continued the removal proceedings, Ah has shown no cause, much less good cause, for continuance. The IJ therefore did not abuse his discretion by denying the request for continuance, and the BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Ali also claims violations of his rights to due process and equal protection. Because Ah failed to cite any legal authority or provide adequate argument to support either claim, as required by Rule 28(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Ah waived the claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
