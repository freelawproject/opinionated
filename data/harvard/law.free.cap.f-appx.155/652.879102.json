We previously affirmed Dar\u00edan Harris\u2019 conviction. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>109 Fed.Appx. 583 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Harris\u2019 case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">Harris contends that the district court erred in sentencing him under the mandatory guideline system based on its finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he obstructed justice. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2002). Because this claim was not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>any fact (other than a prior conviction), which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by the jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant. 125 S.Ct. at 756. Although Harris initially objected to the enhancement, at sentencing, he withdrew his objection and admitted to the facts in the presentence report. He further negotiated the specific sentence he in fact received. Thus, there was no factual dispute and, correspondingly, no Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker. </em>With respect to whether the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines constituted plain error, we find Harris has not established that the error in treating the guidelines as mandatory affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215-25 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">Accordingly, we reinstate our September 21, 2004 opinion and affirm Harris\u2019 sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">\n<em>OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
