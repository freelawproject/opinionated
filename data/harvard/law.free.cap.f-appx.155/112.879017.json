Brooks, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 738 (5th Cir. 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded <em>for </em>further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing <em>Booker\u2019s </em>impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Brooks argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>Booker </em>because he was sentenced to \u201ceight years [of] imprisonment on the basis of guidelines enhancements which were unconstitutionally applied to him by the district court as they were neither proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, nor admitted by him.\u201d He also acknowledges that there \u201cis no statement in the record that could support an inference that [he] would receive a lesser sentence from the sentencing judge if the case was remanded under ordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He argues, however, that the district court will be \u201ccompelled\u201d to give him a lesser sentence because due process and ex post facto principles require that the court resentence him based on a strict application of the guidelines, without any increase in his sentence based on enhancements that violate the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">Brooks concedes that he failed to preserve his argument in the district court and that review of his argument is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). In order to establish that he is entitled to relief under a plain-error analysis, Brooks bears the burden of demonstrating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sentencing court would have imposed a different sentence had it sentenced him under an advisory, rather than mandatory, application of the guidelines. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733. Brooks concedes that he cannot make such a showing. Brooks\u2019s argument that he must be resentenced under a strict application of the guidelines, without any increase based on enhancements not found by a jury or admitted by him, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we conclude that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore reinstate our judgment affirming Brooks\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
