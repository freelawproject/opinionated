Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) because the district court imposed his sentence under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. We vacate Macia\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">Macia timely raised an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Thus, we review his <em>Booker </em>claim for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2005). The government concedes that the district court committed a statutory <em>Booker </em>error when it sentenced Macia under a mandatory guideline system. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005) (setting forth that two kinds of sentencing errors exist based on <em>Booker: </em>constitutional errors and statutory errors).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government then bears the burden of showing that the statutory error was harmless. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-22\">A statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless only if the government shows that the error did not affect the sentence, or had only a very slight effect. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf one can say with fair assurance that the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But we have written that the statutory <em>Booker </em>harmless error standard is not easy to meet: \u201c[i]t is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And here, the government not only concedes that a statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurred, but concedes that it cannot show that this error was harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the district court made no statement that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of whether the guidelines were advisory or mandatory. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292 (concluding that statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless where district court announced it would have imposed same sentence if guidelines were unconstitutional as applied mandatorily).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Some facts exist in the record that suggest the district court might have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. Macia moved for a downward departure, based on his allegation that he had escaped because his brother had died and that Macia was not given enough time to visit his relatives. The district court denied Macia\u2019s request, stating that \u201cthe circumstances under which both defendants were apprehended do not suggest anything that would support a downward departure or anything in mitigation of the sentence in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court then sentenced Macia to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment: the midpoint of the 12 to 18-month guideline sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Giovani, </em>416 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (stating, in preserved-error case, that sentence in midpoint of guideline range was one factor suggesting that statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless). The court noted that it was imposing this sentence \u201cdue to the lack of aggravating or mitigating factors.\u201d And the district court stated that it \u201ccarefully considered\u201d the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning the sentence: the court specifically determined that the sentence (1) met \u201cthe general goals of punishment ... for your criminal conduct of escape\u201d and (2) acted as a \u201cdeterrence to others who might engage in similar conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The government bears the burden of demonstrating harmless error. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. We are unable to say with fair assurance that Macia\u2019s sentence was not swayed substantially by the <em>Booker </em>error. Macia is due to be resentenced under an advisory guidelines system in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-15\">. Macia was serving a 170-month sentence for convictions of financial-based charges when he escaped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-23\">. Macia concedes that a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error did not occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">. The government mistakenly concedes that it cannot show harmless error \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the higher standard applicable to constitutional <em>Booker </em>errors. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). So, the concession does not determine the result. Still the government failed to discharge its burden of showing that the district court's statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\">. Macia had escaped with codefendant William Abraczinskas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-12\">. Also, the district court ordered the sentence to run consecutively to Macia\u2019s undischarged prior sentence, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a). Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) provides that a district court may impose a sentence to run concurrently <em>or </em>consecutively to an undischarged sentence, the district court indicated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing Macia\u2019s sentence. And \u00a7 3584(b) provides that, in deciding whether to impose a consecutive or a concurrent sentence, the court is to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
