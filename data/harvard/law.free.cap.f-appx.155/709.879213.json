Breton-Pichardo\u2019s appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel. This court granted counsel\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief asserting a claim under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and, in the same opinion, affirmed Breton-Pichardo\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Breton-Pichardo, </em>114 Fed.Appx. 577 (4th Cir. 2004) (unpublished). The United States Supreme Court granted Breton-Pichardo\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">The government has moved to dismiss the appeal based upon Breton-Pichardo\u2019s waiver of appellate rights. In his plea agreement, Breton-Pichardo waived the right to appeal sentencing guidelines factors. In <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005), this court determined that a waiver of the right to appeal in a plea agreement entered into prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>was not invalidated by the change in law and that <em>Booker </em>error fell within the scope of a generic waiver. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 169-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">We find that Breton-Pichardo knowingly and voluntarily waived appellate review of <em>Booker </em>claims. Accordingly, we grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss this portion of the appeal. We also reinstate our November 30, 2004 opinion affirming the district court\u2019s judgment in all other respects. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-19\"> Breton-Pichardo also filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
