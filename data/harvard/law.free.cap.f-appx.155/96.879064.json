Howard seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to grant Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in Howard\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

The notice of appeal was filed on April 15, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Howard failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We grant Howard\u2019s motion to supplement the record. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed.
