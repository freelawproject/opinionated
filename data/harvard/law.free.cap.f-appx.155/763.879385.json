Maredian was ordered deported in absentia to his native Pakistan when he failed to appear at a master hearing. Maredian argues that he is entitled to reopening of the proceedings because he received inadequate notice of the hearing date. He further agues that the BIA\u2019s ruling was violative of his Fifth Amendment due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">A deportation order entered in absentia pursuant to \u00a7 240(b)(5) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen \u201cif the alien demonstrates that he ... did not receive notice in accordance with [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1) &amp; (2) ].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(H) (2005). Maredian has not made such a showing. The record supports the findings of the immigration judge, adopted and affirmed by the BIA, that Maredian was personally served with written notice of the new hearing date and was also orally advised of such. Maredian has therefore not shown the BIA\u2019s ruling to be an abuse of discretion, <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005), and, having been afforded notice, he has also not suffered a due process violation. <em>Manzano-Garda v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 470 (5th Cir.2005). His petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
