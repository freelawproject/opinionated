The district court enhanced Rosales\u2019 sentence based upon his previous deportation for a crime of violence. Rosales now appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Because Rosales failed to object to his sentence, we review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 961 (11th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(No. 05-5141, July 1, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">Rosales argues that the sentencing enhancements for prior convictions as authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(l)-(2) are unconstitutional because the Supreme Court, in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), recently questioned its previous holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, the Supreme Court held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) \u201cis a penalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d Rosales contends that in light of <em>Shepard, </em>the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is no longer good law, and the use of the fact of a prior conviction must now be alleged in the indictment and proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant as part of a plea agreement. Rosales concedes, however, that we have rejected this argument <em>post-Shepard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">In <em>Shepard, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court explained that, while a dispute over whether a burglary was a violent felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act could be \u201cdescribed as a fact about a prior conviction, it [was] too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to <em>Jones[ v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) ] and <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.E.2d 435 (2000) ], to say that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>In <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (llth Cir.2005) (per curiam), we noted that although <em>Shepard </em>\u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>\u201d Indeed, in considering a challenge to an enhancement pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, we held that <em>\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Because the Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>it controls the outcome of the case. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in enhancing Rosales\u2019 sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
