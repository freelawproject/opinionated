Lawson was present for the first day of his trial on February 24, 2004, but absconded thereafter and has remained at large since. Lawson was sentenced in absentia to 262 months of imprisonment for Count 1 and to 240 months concurrently for Count 3. Lawson\u2019s attorney timely filed an appeal. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-26\">Although we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal, <em>Molinaro v. New Jersey, </em>396 U.S. 365, 366, 90 S.Ct. 498, 24 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970), we find that Lawson\u2019s escape status diming the pendency of his appeal \u201c \u2018disentitles the defendant to call upon the resources of the Court for determination of his claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v.

Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
