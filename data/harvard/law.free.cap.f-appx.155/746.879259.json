The district court sentenced Nino to 41 months in prison and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Nino claims his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. In district court, Nino objected to his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He now raises the type of error raised by a second respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan <em>(Fanfan </em>error), by claiming that imposition of a sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines regime violated his rights. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. The Government concedes that Nino at least \u201carguably\u201d preserved his Fanfan-error claim for appeal and that the issue is reviewed for harmless error. The Government explicitly waives any argument that the <em>Fanfan </em>error at Nino\u2019s sentencing was harmless and does not oppose a remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">For the first time on appeal, Nino contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As Nino concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it\u201d. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART FOR RE-SENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
