Petitioners claim that the IJ erroneously concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Upadhyah were not credible and ignored substantial evidence that they faced past and future persecution and torture based on Mr. Upadhyah\u2019s political affiliation with the Nepali congress. When, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, this court may review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">\u2018We give great deference to an [IJ\u2019s] decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility,\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002), and we \u201c \u2018will not review decisions turning purely on the [IJ\u2019s] assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chun v. INS, 40 </em>F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). We will uphold a finding that an alien is not entitled to relief if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350-51 (5th Cir.2002). Under substantial evidence review, we may not reverse a factual finding unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">In this case, the IJ carefully detailed the inconsistencies, contradictions, and omissions underlying the determination that Mr. and Mrs. Upadhyay were not credible. Based on the record, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78. As to petitioners\u2019 CAT claim, the record does not compel the conclusion that Nepali government officials would inflict, instigate, consent to or acquiesce in petitioners\u2019 torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-20\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
