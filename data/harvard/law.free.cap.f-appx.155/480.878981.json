(\u201cToyota\u201d), claiming damages for breach of written warranty, breach of implied warranty, and revocation of acceptance, each under the Uniform Commercial Code, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and Georgia statutory law. Toyota removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. After trial, a jury returned a verdict for Toyota. In this appeal, Plaintiffs, for the first time, challenge the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">Plaintiffs\u2019s complaint alleged that they purchased a 2002 Lexus for $66,678.65, exclusive of collateral charges, such as bank and finance charges. Plaintiffs asserted that the vehicle suffered various defects that violated the vehicle\u2019s written warranty and the implied warranty of merchantability. Plaintiffs claimed to have afforded the Lexus dealer a reasonable number of attempts to cure the defects, but no cure was effected. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the Uniform Commercial Code and Georgia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>law, for (without limitation) loss of use, diminished value, lost wages, aggravation, and other incidental and consequential damages, together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Plaintiffs also claimed they were entitled to either a refund of their purchase price or a free replacement under Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304(a)(4), and to a revocation of acceptance pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code and Georgia statutory law, again together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In its notice of removal, Toyota noted the parties complete diversity and that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. Toyota supported the amount in controversy by reference to the Plaintiffs\u2019s demand for damages in excess of the $66,678.65 purchase price. Plaintiffs presented no challenge to the district court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction; indeed, the Joint Preliminary Report and Discovery Plan (signed by counsel for both parties) states expressly that no question about the district court\u2019s jurisdiction exists, and the Joint Consolidated Proposed Pre-Trial Order (signed by both parties and also signed by the district court judge) again states expressly the absence of question about federal court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">After a jury verdict in favor of Toyota, Plaintiffs filed this appeal to raise a single issue: whether the district court exercised properly subject matter jurisdiction over this controversy. It is now Plaintiffs\u2019s position that Defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the amount in controversy exceeded the requisite amount to support removal jurisdiction. Although Plaintiffs raise this issue only after the jury rendered a verdict against them, a jurisdictional defect cannot be waived by the parties and may be raised at any point during litigation. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. United States, </em>149 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 1998) (gathering precedents acknowledging inability of parties to confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court and recognizing court\u2019s independent obligation to inquire into jurisdiction whenever jurisdictional infirmity may exist).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Because this case was first filed in state court and removed .to federal court by Toyota, Toyota bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Best Buy Company, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2001). When the plaintiff fails to plead a specific amount of damages, the removing defendant, by a preponderance of the evidence, must prove that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement. <em>Id. </em>With jurisdiction premised on diversity, Toyota must show that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">When the complaint does not claim a specific amount of damages, \u201cthe removing defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Best Buy, </em>269 F.3d at 1319. In <em>Best Buy, </em>the plaintiff sought damages for physical and mental injuries she alleged she suffered when she tripped while entering a Best Buy store. The complaint sought general, special and punitive damages, each in unspecified amounts. The notice of removal proffered no facts in support of the jurisdictional amount; instead, the notice of removal stated only that the plaintiff refused to stipulate that damages did not exceed $75,000 and that the jurisdictional amount was exceeded. When the plaintiff appealed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of Best Buy, we asked the parties to brief whether the jurisdictional amount was satisfied. Best Buy offered no evidence; it continued to rely on the negative inference from Plaintiffs refusal to stipulate and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>its unsupported conclusion that damages exceeded $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We said that \u201c[a] conclusory allegation in the notice of removal that the jurisdictional amount is satisfied, without setting forth the underlying facts supporting such an assertion, is insufficient to meet the defendant\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319-20. We rejected Best Buy\u2019s assertion that the plaintiffs refusal to stipulate that her claims did not exceed $75,000.00, without more, satisfied Best Buy\u2019s burden on the jurisdictional issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1320. And because the record contained no evidence relevant to the issue, we could not say \u201cthat the amount in controversy more likely than not exceeds $75,000,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1320; we ordered a limited remand for the district court to make factual findings on the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Plaintiffs argue that <em>Best Buy </em>compels a remand; we disagree. The notice of removal filed by Toyota \u2014 unlike the notice of removal in <em>Best Buy </em>\u2014 attaches a specified amount ($66,678.65) to one component of the damage request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the notice of removal set out other components of Plaintiffs\u2019s claims for damages. In the light of the quantified damages approaching the jurisdictional amount by themselves, together with the specification of additional other damages claimed, and combined with Plaintiffs\u2019s representations before trial that no question existed about the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, on this record we can say \u2014 unlike the <em>Best Buy </em>court \u2014 \u201cthat the amount in controversy might well exceed the jurisdictional amount.\u201d Toyota shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jurisdictional requirement is satisfied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. And the trial record makes clear that Plaintiffs \u2014 by the time of removal \u2014 deemed the defective Lexus to be entirely without value because of alleged safety defects that the manufacturer was unwilling or unable to remedy. <em>See Sierminski v. Transouth Financial Corp., </em>216 F.3d 945, 949 (11th Cir.2000) (allowing consideration of post-removal evidence in assessing removal jurisdiction provided the jurisdictional facts that support removal are judged as of the time of removal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-21\">. Although not cited in the district court, the parties\u2019s briefs address an alternative basis for federal jurisdiction: the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 <em>et seq. </em>That Act provides for federal district court jurisdiction over certain warranty claims brought by a consumer, provided the amount in controversy is at least $50,000 (exclusive of interest and costs). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(3)(B). Because we conclude that the district court had diversity jurisdiction, we do not consider whether this alternative source of federal jurisdiction was available.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
