For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-21\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b470-22\">Hall was convicted of aggravated child molestation and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal on March 21, 1997. <em>Hall v. Georgia, </em>226 Ga.App. 298, 485 S.E.2d 800 (1997). Hall filed a motion for reconsideration, dated March 30, 1997, but which was not filed until April 9, 1997. On April 29, 1997, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the motion for reconsideration as untimely. On March 3, 1998, Hall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>filed a state habeas petition, which was denied on August 1, 2003. A certificate of probable cause (\u201cCPC\u201d) was denied on January 12, 2004. Hall filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition on March 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">After the state responded that the petition was time-barred, Hall asserted that his conviction did not become final until May 9, 1997, which was the expiration of the ten-day period in which he could have filed a petition for certiorari review of the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Hall conceded, however, that current law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not provide for tolling of the limitations period for the time in which he could have sought review of the denial of CPC. Alternatively, he argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed as time-barred. The magistrate judge found that Hall\u2019s conviction became final ten days after Hall could have sought review of the state court of appeals\u2019 affirmance of his conviction. Additionally, the magistrate judge found that the reconsideration motion did not toll the limitations period because it was untimely, and that there was no tolling during the time to petition for review of the denial of a CPC. Finally, the magistrate judge determined that Hall was not entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over Hall\u2019s objections and dismissed Hall\u2019s petition as time-barred. The district court then granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of whether Hall\u2019s petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">II. Hall\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Hall argues that the district court erred by finding his \u00a7 2254 petition untimely because the motion for reconsideration and the time in which he could have sought review from the denial of a CPC should have tolled the limitations period, although he concedes that his position is not supported by case law. Alternatively, Hall argues that he was entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that the petition for federal habeas corpus relief was time-barred under the AEDPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1259 n. 5 (11th Cir.2004). A district court\u2019s decision on equitable tolling also is reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 1265 n. 11 (citing <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002)). \u201c[T]he district court\u2019s determinations of the relevant facts will be reversed only if clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">To be timely filed, Hall\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was due within one year of the date on which his conviction became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). \u201cThe time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review ... is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under [the AED-PA].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Wade, </em>379 F.3d at 1259. To be \u201cproperly filed,\u201d however, an application must meet the filing deadlines and time limitations on delivery. <em>Wade, </em>379 F.3d at 1260, 1264 (citing <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Here, we defer to the state court\u2019s ruling that Hall\u2019s motion to reconsider was not timely filed. <em>Wade, </em>379 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>at 1262 (explaining this court\u2019s deference). Accordingly, the untimely motion to reconsider was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and would not toll the limitations period. Moreover, the ten days in which Hall could have sought review of that denial also would not toll the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Furthermore, the time period did not toll during the ninety-day period in which Hall could have sought review of the CPC denial. Nor did it toll during the ten-day period in which Hall could have moved for reconsideration of the CPC denial. <em>See, e.g., Moore, </em>321 F.3d at 1380. Hall\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Steed </em>and <em>Coates,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>holding that \u201cthe time during which a petition for writ of certiorari is pending, or could have been filed, following the denial of collateral relief in the state courts, is not to be subtracted from the running of time for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\u201d <em>Steed, </em>219 F.Sd at 1300; <em>Coates, </em>211 F.3d at 1227. Therefore, Hall\u2019s conviction became final on March 31, 1997, and Hall had one year from that date to file his federal habeas petition. We conclude that the district court correctly found that more than one year elapsed before Hall filed his federal \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Finally, we reject Hall\u2019s arguments that he was entitled to equitable tolling. \u201cEquitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy that is typically applied sparingly; however, \u2018it is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control <em>and </em>unavoidable even with diligence.\u2019\u201d <em>Wade, </em>379 F.3d at 1265 (citing <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1286 (quotations omitted) (emphasis in original)). Hall has not offered any argument explaining how there were extraordinary circumstances that were beyond his control. Moreover, miscalculation of the dates, even if at the hands of an attorney, does not constitute extraordinary circumstances. <em>Steed, </em>219 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Hall\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">. <em>Steed </em>v. <em>Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2000); <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>211 F.3d 1225 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-16\">. Hall filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-ally Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), and, therefore, the provisions of that act govern this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. The district court is bound by the decisions of this court. Moreover, a panel of this court cannot overruled the decisions of a prior panel. <em>United States v.
