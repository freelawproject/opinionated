Charlton appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence, which was brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Charlton\u2019s motion asserts the district court did not have jurisdiction to sentence him beyond the statutory maximum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 788, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). According to Charlton, his sentence was increased based upon facts that were not charged in the indictment or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. The district court denied Charlton\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-21\">A district court\u2019s decision of whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). Section 3582(c)(1)(B) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-22\">The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b486-23\">(B) the court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). According to Rule 35, a court may: (1) correct a sentence that \u201cresulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error;\u201d and (2) reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing substantial assistance. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Charlton\u2019s claim of constitutional error under <em>Booker </em>is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). Charlton\u2019s motion essentially constitutes a collateral attack on his original sentence, for which he would need to submit an application to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. We have held, however, that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Charlton\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-15\">. On appeal, Charlton also asserts the court should have reduced his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Charlton failed to raise this claim in the district court, and we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Kent, </em>175 F.3d 870, 871 n. 1 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
