(\u201cKYE\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">LCTA was the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Structure Services Ltd. Pursuant to an \u201cOut Source Agreement\u201d, Structure Services provided laborers, including plaintiff Sau Dinh, to work at KYE\u2019s shipyard. Dinh was injured while performing repair work aboard a vessel at KYE\u2019s shipyard. LCTA paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Dinh under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The district court held that Dinh was KYE\u2019s borrowed employee, but that the indemnity clause in the contract between KYE and Structure Services barred LCTA\u2019s claim against KYE for reimbursement of the LHWCA benefits LCTA had paid to and on behalf of Dinh.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On appeal, LCTA argues that the district court erred by ruling that the indemnity clause in the Structure Serviees/KYE contract bars or defeats LCTA\u2019s reimbursement claim. LCTA\u2019s claim is based on <em>Total Marine Services, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, </em>87 F.3d 774, 779 (5th Cir.1996), in which this court stated that \u201ca borrowing employer is required to pay the compensation benefits of its borrowed employee, and, in the absence of a valid and enforceable indemnification agreement, the borrowing employer is required to reimburse an injured worker\u2019s formal employer for any compensation benefits it has paid to the injured worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The contract between Structure Services and KYE provides: \u201cStructure Services, Ltd. agrees to indemnify and hold [KYE] harmless from any claim due to negligence or injuries of their employees or by any governmental claim for withholding taxes, F.I.C.A. taxes and unemployment taxes attributable to covered workers.\u201d The district court held that this language constitutes a \u201cvalid and enforceable indemnification agreement\u201d under <em>Total Marine </em>that relieves KYE of its obligation to reimburse LCTA for compensation benefits LCTA paid to Dinh.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">LCTA argues that this provision should not bar its reimbursement claim because the provision is ambiguous and does not expressly provide indemnity for LHWCA liabilities. It also contends that reference to other portions of the Agreement supports its contention that indemnity for LHWCA liabilities was not mutually intended by the indemnity language. Specifically, LCTA notes that the contract does not require a waiver of the right of any insurer of Structure Services to recover from KYE. Finally, LCTA contends that any arguable indemnity obligation to KYE on the part of Structure Services should not bind LCTA because it is not a party to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">The district court considered and rejected all of LCTA\u2019s contentions, reasoning, in its ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">[T]he contract, although it could have been more artfully written, ... must [be] givefn] its plain and common sense meaning. Clearly, this is an arrangement where a labor pool employer is providing employees to KYE and, as part of that arrangement, the labor pool employer provides the Workers\u2019 Comp insurance, among others. That\u2019s one of the reasons for the agreement. So, they would administer the Workers\u2019 Compensation claims as set forth in the contract and be responsible for the insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">It would be sheer folly to go through this arrangement and then to be open to ... paying the claim without insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>[T]he Court interprets the word \u201cinjuries\u201d in that [indemnity] clause, in general, as an indemnification clause, as contemplated by <em>Total </em>and its progeny. And, that\u2019s the only way it really makes any sense in this context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Based on our <em>de novo </em>review of the summary judgment record in this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion. The summary judgment is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-18\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir.
