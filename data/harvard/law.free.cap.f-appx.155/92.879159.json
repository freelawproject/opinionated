Chu-A-Kong disputes the finding of removability, and asserts that he is eligible for relief from removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(h) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005). As Chu-AKong conceded removability as charged before the IJ and failed to apply before the IJ for relief under \u00a7 1182(h), we find that he has failed to exhaust all administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>see Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 861,160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-21\">We therefore conclude that we are without jurisdiction to consider Chu-A-Kong\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-22\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
