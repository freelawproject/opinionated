De Luna-Vigil, </em>87 Fed.Appx. 976 (5th Cir. 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>eration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Newsome v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1112, 160 L.Ed.2d 989 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The Government argues that this appeal is moot because Vigil was released from prison on January 27, 2004. Vigil contends that his appeal still presents a live issue because he is on supervised release until January 27, 2007. Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution requires that a \u201c \u2018case or controversy ... subsist\u00ed ] through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847 (5th Cir.1999). This requirement is met because Vigil is still subject to supervised release, a part of his total sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 928 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Vigil\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Guidelines is \u201cstructural,\u201d and \u201cpresumptively prejudicial,\u201d thus obviating the need for a specific showing of prejudice, has been rejected as inconsistent with this court\u2019s analysis in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, 411 F.3d </em>597, 601 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">Vigil\u2019 alternative argument, that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Guidelines constitutes plain error, also lacks merit. This court will not consider a Boo/cer-related challenge raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Vigil\u2019s argument that the record suggests that the district court may have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guideline system is refuted by the record. Since Vigil has not demonstrated plain error, \u201cit is obvious that the much more demanding standard for extraordinary circumstances, warranting review of an issue raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari, cannot be satisfied.\u201d <em>See Taylor, </em>409 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate our judgment affirming Vigil\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b142-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
