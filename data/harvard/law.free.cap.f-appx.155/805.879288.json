Davis, </em>226 F.3d 346, 348 (5th Cir.2000). Davis argues that the district court erred in dismissing his petition. This court reviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">A petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 which attacks errors that occurred at trial or sentencing should be dismissed or construed as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.; Pack v. Yusuff </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Davis\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenged his conviction, rather than attacking the manner in which his sentence was being executed. Davis has not shown that the remedy provided under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). Further, the district court lacked jurisdiction to construe Davis\u2019s petition as a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Davis\u2019s petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
