Appointed counsel for defendant, Michael Spivack, has filed a motion to withdraw with a brief prepared pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), to which defendant filed a one-page handwritten objection. Counsel\u2019s motion is granted and Guzman\u2019s convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Guzman signed a Statement of Facts conceding that, \u201cif this case went to trial,\u201d the government could establish beyond a reasonable doubt: that she arrived at Miami International Airport on a flight from Colombia; that a routine customs inspection of her baggage revealed several \u201cunusually heavy\u201d pairs of shoes containing heroin; that she knew the \u201csubstance contained inside the shoes was heroin\u201d; and laboratory tests showed that the shoes contained a total of 2,617 grams of heroin. After conducting a thorough change of plea colloquy pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, the district court found that the plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered, and that a sufficient factual basis supported the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Guzman subsequently filed written objections to the Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). She contended that she was eligible for acceptance of responsibility, minor role, and safety-valve reductions. At the sentencing hearing, the court concluded that Guzman deserved the benefit of the acceptance of responsibility and the safety-valve provision, but declined to grant her a minor-role reduction, finding that Guzman\u2019s \u201cown statement that she was bringing [the heroin to the United States] and was going to sell it herself ... and considering the amount and the nature of the drug, I cannot see that a minor role is appropriate here.\u201d The court imposed a sentence of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither Guzman nor her attorney asserted any objections to the court\u2019s findings of fact or the manner in which the sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel states that there are no non-frivolous claims that can be pursued on appeal but raises the issue of the district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction. Defendant Guzman\u2019s July 25, 2005, handwritten letter to the Clerk, which we construe liberally, raises three potential issues: (1) that her sentence of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment was too \u201charsh\u201d; (2) that the district court erred by failing to \u201cconsider\u201d her family circumstances; and (3) that because she \u201cdid not understand her lawyer,\u201d and was \u201cnervous wreck\u201d about pleading guilty, her guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">We have carefully considered these arguments and conclude that they present no issues of arguable merit for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The district court, after analyzing the characteristics of Guzman\u2019s offense, correctly concluded that she played an integral role in the importation of the heroin for which she was held accountable, and therefore did not clearly err in denying the minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The court determined that the applicable advisory sentencing guideline range was 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, imposed a sentence of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment and concluded that such a sentence was reasonable, considering the factors detailed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The record reflects that the district court carefully considered all of the relevant factors in imposing the sentence and correctly concluded, in light of the maximum sentence available, that the sentence imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The district court sentenced Guzman after reviewing the Pre-sentence Investigation Report and carefully considering \u201cthe factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) through (7).\u201d The PSI contained a \u201cPersonal and Family Data\u201d section that described in detail Guzman\u2019s family circumstances. The information contained in the PSI is nearly identical to the family circumstances raised in Guzman\u2019s objection filed in this Court. It is evident that the district court weighed these circumstances while deciding Guzman\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>A thorough Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 colloquy was conducted by the district court, where it correctly ascertained that she knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea. An independent review of the entire record reveals no issues of arguable merit. See <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Guzman\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
