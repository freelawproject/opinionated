Line-berry, </em>93 Fed-Appx. 632 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished). Following our judgment, Lineberry filed a petition for certiorari. The Supreme Court granted Lineberry\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the ease to this court for further consideration in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Lineberry\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Lineberry raised a <em>Booker-related </em>challenge to his sentence for the first time on direct appeal. Because Appellant made no <em>Booker </em>objection in the district court, however, Appellant\u2019s claim must fail under the plain-error test discussed in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Lineberry also argues that application of Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>would strip him of his constitutional protections against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. He explains that <em>Apprendi </em>gave him the right to a jury trial on all facts essential to his sentence and Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>stripped that right away. In <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-76 (5th Cir.2005) we rejected that argument and held that <em>Booker </em>required us to apply both Justice Stevens\u2019 merits opinion and Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>to all cases such as this one on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">For the reasons stated above, our prior disposition remains in effect, and we REINSTATE OUR EARLIER JUDGMENT affirming Lineberry\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. There is no indication that the district court, if given the opportunity to treat the guidelines as advisory only, would have imposed a lesser sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
