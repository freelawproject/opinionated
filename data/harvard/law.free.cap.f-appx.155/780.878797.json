He contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant, arguing that the affidavit in support of probable cause was a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. Long fails to establish that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply. <em>See United States v. Cavazos, </em>288 F.3d 706, 709 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 904-05 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Long\u2019s assertion that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction is likewise unavailing. Testimony established that Long\u2019s car was observed outside 1434 Gavilan prior to the search, that he possessed a key to the front door, that he knew the whereabouts of the key to the safe containing firearms, and that the safe contained a car alarm that matched one on his key chain. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and employing some common sense, we are convinced that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Long had knowledge of and access to the firearms inside the residence at 1434 Gavilan. <em>See United States v. Mergerson, 4 </em>F.3d 337, 349 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b808-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
