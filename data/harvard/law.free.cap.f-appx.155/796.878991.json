He contends that the district court committed plain error by relying on hearsay testimony to find that he violated a condition of supervised release by the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Pogue fails to make the requisite showing of plain error. <em>See United States v. Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.1994) (applying plain error analysis where defendant failed to object to hearsay evidence). Assuming without deciding that the district court erred by relying on hearsay testimony, the district court nonetheless could have imposed the same sentence based on violations that Pogue admitted. Pogue\u2019s claim therefore fails because he has failed to show that the district court \u201cwould have\u201d imposed a lesser sentence but for the admission of hearsay testimony. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-23\">Pogue also contends that the district court committed plain error by failing to apply the principles of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to the Government\u2019s burden of proof at the supervised-release revocation hearing. Even after <em>Booker, </em>the facts necessary for revocation of supervised release need not be found \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and the principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>Apprendi </em>as expanded by <em>Booker </em>do not apply to revocations of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 117-18 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
