The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue whether Marshall\u2019s supervisory writ application to the Louisiana Supreme Court on direct review of his conviction was properly filed or untimely and, if untimely, whether he was entitled to equitable tolling. The Respondent argues that the petition was timely filed and urges that the case be remanded. The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo when reviewing the denial of habeas relief. <em>Moody v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-24\">Pursuant to Louisiana Supreme Court Rule X, \u00a7 5(d), Marshall\u2019s writ application, postmarked October 25, 2000, was mailed \u201con or before the last day of the delay for filing,\u201d October 30, 2000, and was therefore timely. His conviction therefore did not become final until January 24, 2002, after the 90-day period for seeking Supreme Court review had expired. <em>See Flanagan v. Johnson, </em>154 F.3d 196, 197 (5th Cir. 1998). Marshall\u2019s July 31, 2002, state postconviction application tolled the limitations period until the Louisiana Supreme Court denied his timely writ application on December 12, 2003. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Marshall\u2019s January 20, 2004, federal petition, was filed with 138 days of the one-year period yet remaining, and was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-25\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
