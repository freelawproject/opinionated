Stallings asserts that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable under this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005), because the court applied as mandatory the sentencing range as determined by the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2004) and did not adequately take into account the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Our review of the record makes clear that the district court considered the guideline range as advisory and considered the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) in determining Stallings\u2019 sentence. We conclude that his sentence is reasonable. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
