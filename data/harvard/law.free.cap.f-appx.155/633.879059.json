Allen\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as potential issues the district court\u2019s compliance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Allen\u2019s guilty plea and the reasonableness of his sentence and extent of downward departure in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">Allen did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, therefore his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no plain error in the court\u2019s acceptance of Allen\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">Counsel also raises as a potential issue the reasonableness of Allen\u2019s 350-month sentence and extent of downward departure in light of <em>Booker. </em>It is clear from the record that Allen was sentenced under the mandatory application of the Guidelines, rather than under the advisory application mandated by <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that review for \u201creasonableness\u201d is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">This court\u2019s limited ability to review a sentence is derived from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000). <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). A defendant may appeal a sentence that is imposed in violation of the law, is imposed as a result of the incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines, is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable Guidelines range, or is imposed for an offense without a Guidelines range and is plainly unreasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. Thus, an appellant\u2019s challenge to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>court\u2019s exercise of discretion in setting a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range does not state an appeal-able question under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>Porter, </em>909 F.2d at 794. This court also lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742(a) \u201cto review the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure, except in instances in which the departure decision resulted in a sentence imposed in violation of law or resulted from an incorrect application of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Since this court lacks the authority to review a district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence within a correctly calculated Guidelines range and lacks the authority to review the extent of a downward departure, this issue lacks merit. <em>Porter, </em>909 F.2d at 794; <em>Hill, </em>70 F.3d at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Allen\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny Allen\u2019s motion to appoint substitute counsel. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
