While appellant urges that the \u201cquestion is important because the verdict is so unjust as to liability and also as to amount, and because of the fact that plaintiffs were endeavoring to go beyond the scope of the complaint and the bill of particulars as to the extent of the injuries,\u201d the only point argued is that there \u201cwas not sufficient proof of the pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">But this ground was not presented to the trial judge, when the objection was interposed. In fact, no ground of objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>was stated at the trial, and, consequently, none can be urged here. The definite ground of objection must be pointed out to give efficacy to the exception. <em>Semkin </em>v. <em>Hollander, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>485; 81 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>980; <em>Prout </em>v. <em>Prout, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>537; 81 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>757; <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Newark Call Printing, &amp;c., Co., </em>87 <em>N. J.

They were made under the direction of the hospital rontgenologist. They were actually made by one of his assistants, but he was able to identify them. They were marked for identification purposes, lie examined the photographs the following day, and discussed information disclosed by them with plaintiff\u2019s physician. The usual hospital routine for taking the photographs was followed. The physician and surgeon in attendance testified that the photographs were taken by his direction and in his presence. They were taken immediately after the accident, and after he had seen plaintiff. The plates were promptly developed, and were examined by the witness and the hospital rontgenologist, who conferred to determine the nature and extent of the injuries. The proof met the prescribed standard. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>135, 143; 122 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>882; <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>101 <em>N. J.
