On May 24th, 1933, the building inspector issued a permit for the construction of the building. The application for the permit was accompanied by plans and specifications which accurately showed the location of the proposed building. Thereupon prosecutor entered into a contract for the erection of the building. On June 7th, 1933, the contractor was advised by the building inspector, by letter, that the permit \u201cis hereby revoked, having been obtained under false pretense.\u201d Defendants made no effort to establish this allegation of false pretense, or any other ground for the revocation of the permit. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>prosecutor took depositions on notice, but there was no appearance for defendants, and no depositions were taken on their behalf. And there was no appearance by defendants to resist this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">It follows that this attempted exercise of power by the building inspector, in directing the revocation of the permit, was invalid. See <em>Montefiore Cemetery Co. </em>v. Newark, 3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1100; 130 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>730.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The application is granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
