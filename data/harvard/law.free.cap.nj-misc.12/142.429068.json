J. L. </em>157; 98 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>668. On the authority of that decision the application must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">It may be well to add that it does not appear that the certificate of August, 1933, has yet been filed. The present rule, dating from 1931, requires such filing before beginning the clerkship; and service prior to such filing may not be counted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
