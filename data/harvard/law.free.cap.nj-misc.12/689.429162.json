The defendant appeals and the grounds relied on for reversal are that its motion for nonsuit and for the direction of a verdict in its favor should have been .granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a sales lady. Toward the close of the day on October 4th, 1933, as she was passing the office of the assistant manager of the store, she was called in by that gentleman and introduced to a man named Wessley, an investigator in the employ of the Will-mark Service System, a detective organization with whom the defendant had a contract to investigate the efficiency and faithfulness of its employes. At Wessley\u2019s request the assistant manager left the room and Wessley proceeded to interrogate her about a fifty cent sale of paint which was claimed to be unaccounted for. He asked what money she had on her person and when she replied \u201cnone,\u201d she was placed in the \u25a0custody of another employe and requested to go to the rest room, bring back her purse and exhibit its contents. This she did and then asked if she might go and was told \u201cno,\u201d And that \u201cthis was not the first time.\u201d After signing a statement which Wessley had prepared, she again asked if she might go and was again refused. The investigator reported to the manager who directed her detention until he came up, and returned after some delay and told her to \u201ccome in to-morrow.\u201d When she reported the next morning she was told she could only be reinstated through the Philadelphia \u25a0office. .</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">It is contended on the appeal that she was not detained by the assistant manager, that the investigator acting under an independent contract could not bind the defendant by what he did, and that in any aspect the action of the investigator did not amount to an imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We think that in this condition of the proofs neither of the defendant\u2019s motions could have been granted. It was open to a jury to find that there was an unlawful restraint \u25a0of the plaintiff\u2019s liberty and that this was with the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>o\u00ed tlie defendant. Undoubtedly the latter was responsible for what the assistant manager said and did, and when he called the plaintiff in his office, and at the request of Wessley left the room, leaving the plaintiff in apparent charge of the latter, it became responsible for all that followed\u2014even if the defendant\u2019s contract with the Willmark Service constituted the latter an independent contractor, which is doubtful. The latter through its agent was doing exactly what it had contracted to do at so much per month. This was to \u201ccheckup\u201d on the efficiency and faithfulness of defendant\u2019s employes, the contract itself partaking as much of the nature of an employment as that of an independent relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">It is not necessary, however, to determine the character of this relationship as we think it was open to the jury to find that what Wessley did was participated in by the defendant\u2019s assistant manager in charge of the store, its employes and its management.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">While the circumstances proved ill connection with the particular sale of goods clearly justified investigation, such investigation must scrupulously avoid trenching upon the personal liberty of the individual. If action justifying personal restraint be indicated it must, in cases like the present, be -taken through the authorities constituted by law for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
