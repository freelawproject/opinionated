There are three specifications. The first is that \u201cthe trial court erred in awarding judgment in favor of plaintiff against defendant.\u201d This was definitely condemned by the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Passaic National Bank, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>449; 162 <em>Atl. Rep. 555. </em>The second is that \u201cthere was no legal evidence adduced to support the judgment in favor of plaintiff.\u201d This points to no judicial action to be reviewed. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Shryer, </em>106 <em>N. J. L. </em>432; 150 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>321. The third is that \u201cthe judgment in favor of plaintiff is contrary to law.\u201d This has been overruled many times as constituting no specification of anything beyond mere general error. <em>State </em>v. Lavine, 96 <em>N. J. L. </em>356, 357 (12); 115 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>335; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>538, 539 (1); 159 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>402.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">If there be no specification at all, the practice is to dismiss the appeal; but if the judgment .cannot, be reversed on any ground specified, it will be. affirmed. <em>Sentliffer </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>128, 130; 86 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>929; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Keegan, supra. </em>\u25a0 1</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">No alleged error being properly specified, the judgment is accordingly affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
