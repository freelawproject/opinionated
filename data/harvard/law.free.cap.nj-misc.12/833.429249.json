L. </em>1003, <em>p. </em>535. The prosecution maintained, however, that the pond was also a \u201crunway for migratory fish,\u201d and that for this reason it was not \u201cprivate waters,\u201d and a license was required. <em>Ibid. </em>Evidence was fully presented on the question whether the pond was in fact a runway for migratory fish, and the Court of Common Pleas decided as a question of fact that it was not, and consequently ordered an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The question, as we have said, was one of fact, and the finding by the trial court that the pond was not a runway for migratory fish was amply supported by the evidence. We see no reason whatever to question the propriety of that finding, even assuming it to be within our province to review it on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
