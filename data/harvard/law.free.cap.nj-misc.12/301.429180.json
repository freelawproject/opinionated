She suffered an injury while she was in its employ and an award was made in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Three points are raised, one, that the condition suffered by the petitioner was not the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. We think the evidence in the case was ample to justify the finding of the deputy commissioner that the injury to and subsequent condition of the petitioner was the result of an accident that arose out of and in the course of the employment within the meaning of our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The second point, that there was no cansal relation between the accident and the petitioner\u2019s injury, calls for the same answer. The case on these issues was one of fact and there was a plentitude of testimony sufficient to fully justify the commissioner\u2019s finding in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">As to the third point made, that the employe did not sustain any accident, it is sufficient to say that the testimony overwhelmingly supports the view that she did and, therefore, the writ attacking the order made in this ease will he dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
