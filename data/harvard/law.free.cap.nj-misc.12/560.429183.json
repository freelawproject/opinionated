Complaint being made, he was tried before the First Criminal Court of Newark and fined $25.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The power of the municipality to require a license of itinerant vendors and the validity of the ordinance in so far as it requires a license to be obtained by that class is not before us in this proceeding. The question brought up is whether or not the ordinance is effective to require a license to be obtained by one such as the prosecutor, who comes within the definition of a \u201cnew merchant\u201d set forth in the-ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Chapter 88 of the laws of 1931 has no application to \u201cnew merchants\u201d and the power to impose the requirement of obtaining a license upon the prosecutor must be found in the general power of the municipality granted by the Home Eule act and its amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The Home Eule act authorizes regulation of many kinds of businesses, in fact practically every kind of business that might be transacted within a municipality, but nowhere does it authorize a distinction between newly established businesses and those already in existence.

We are of the opinion that the ordinance in question makes an unwarranted discrimination in so far as it applies to those defined as \u201cnew merchants,\u201d and is to that extent void.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The conviction is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
