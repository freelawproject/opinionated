With this in mind, the solution of both the factual and legal difficulties becomes simplified.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">\u201cRespondent-appellant contends that petitioner has not established her case by the greater weight of: the credible evidence. But the only direct evidence as to the accidental injury is that given by one Cresse, a totally disinterested eye<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>witness, whose testimony is clear and convincing in every detail, and the testimony of one Stiefel, produced by the respondent-appellant, to deny the accident. Not only in theory but in fact, this witness appears to have been hostile to petitioner, yet his testimony, when analyzed, corroborates petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">\"Cresse\u2019s story is that petitioner\u2019s husband, since deceased, a trolley inspector of respondent-appellant, was alighting from a trolley car in the course of his duties on September 22d, 1931, on Bloomfield avenue, in Verona, opposite Stiefel\u2019s place of employment, when he missed his footing and fell, slightly cutting or abrasing his left leg just above the ankle. Decedent\u2019s written statement was taken by the respondent-appellant, after his leg was amputated and three days before he died, and was put in evidence by the respondent-appellant. This indicates Stiefel saw the occurrence. Stiefel denies this, basing his denial upon the fact that September 22d, 1931, was his day off. Irrespective of the facts that another witness for respondent-appellant testifies that Stiefel\u2019s 'day off\u2019 record is sometimes in error, and that, both petitioner and her daughter testify that Stiefel later told them he saw the accident, Stiefel himself testified that 'I seen him [decedent] from the trolley car he got off,\u2019 that he 'saw him [decedent] when he fell,\u2019 and that decedent thereafter asked Stiefel for some iodine, evidently for his leg, and that all this occurred the latter part of September, 1931. He further admits that he 'might have\u2019 told decedent to report the accident to the respondent-appellant at once. Finally, Stiefel bases his claim that September 22d, 1931, was his day off, mainly on the fact that it was a Thursday, his regular day off. As a matter of fact, September 22d, 1931, fell on a Tuesday, not Thursday. Nor does respondent-appellant produce its motorman, who operated its cars at the spot in question at or about the time claimed, to deny such occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">\"Nor is decedent\u2019s written statement to respondent-appellant\u2019s investigator, taken as above, to the contrary. This was taken by an investigator from respondent-appellant\u2019s welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>department. He was primarily interested in illnesses, not accidents. Therefore, decedent\u2019s illness, gangrene, was what was stressed, not its alleged cause, the fall, abrasion and infection. After discussing the gangrene and its inception at some length, the statement continues:</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">\u201c \u2018About two or three weeks before I remained away from work on October 6th, 1931 [\u00da <em>e., </em>in the neighborhood of September <em>22 </em>d], I had boarded an east-bound car on the Bloomiield-Oaldwell line on duty and, at about six o\u2019clock p. m., I attempted to alight from the car at Bloomfield and Mount Prospect avenues, Verona. As no passengers were getting off or on, I believe the operator, whom I do not remember, slowed down the car, and I stepped off the step and fell to my knees and hands on the street pavement, but I got right up and I did not feel anything wrong with me\u2014no pain resulted from the fall in my legs or hands and, to my best knowledge, I had not hurt myself at all * * *. John Stiefel told me that I ought to report it, but I said to him that I wasn\u2019t hurt and I didn\u2019t believe the fall amounted to anything * * *. I felt no pain or other effects of the pain the balance of the day nor any that day following. I didn\u2019t bother to examine myself because 1 didn\u2019t have any pain and I didn\u2019t believe I had injured myself. I never did report to the company about it. To my best knowledge the above are the only times that I had any kind of an accident while on duty. I never have had any trouble before with my legs, until Sunday, October 4th, 1931, when 1 noticed the foot was cold and numb, nor have I ever had any treatment for any condition like rheumatism or arthritis.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\u201cWhen we bear in mind the fact that decedent had just gone through the amputation of his left leg above the knee, it is little wonder that the trivial scratch he received at the time of the above fall appeared quite <em>inconsequential\u2014\u2018I </em>didn\u2019t believe the fall amounted to anything.\u2019 Small wonder, after such an operation, that he recollects no pain from such a scratch. It is a matter of common knowledge that infection may result from the slightest pin prick opening in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>skin. Clearly this pin prick opening may occur without a healthy man feeling any substantial amount of pain, certainly, without his recalling it after undergoing a major operation. Note that decedent does not say that he did not fall or that he was not injured in fact. He expressly says he did fall, though he 'didn\u2019t [then] believe I had injured myself.\u2019 But in the self-same statement he says that his physician, Dr. Bleier, 'thought the condition [gangrene] was caused by a fall,\u2019 and after recounting the above facts and another incident in his statement, decedent adds, 'to my best knowledge the above are the only times that I had any kind of an accident while on duty.\u2019 Decedent\u2019s statement, the respondent-appellant\u2019s strongest reliance, therefore does not deny the accidental injury, and such is clearly established by the requisite burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">''Petitioner\u2019s and the doctor\u2019s hearsay testimony as to the fall will, of course, not be considered in this aspect. But the fact that same were inadmissible <em>(Helminsky </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>369), and the fact that they may have improperly formed a part of the basis of the award by the bureau, will not result in a reversal here, when the burden of proof is otherwise properly sustained, since this court is to 'decide the merits of the controversy.\u2019 <em>Pamph. L. </em>1932, <em>ch. </em>25, \u00a7 19; <em>Helminsky </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201cFurthermore, the casual connection of decedent\u2019s ultimate death is properly established! There is ample testimony as to decedent\u2019s previous good health in all respects. Four doctors testify that the wound became infected; that this infection caused gangrene of the foot; that this gangrene spread and required amputation of the limb, and that decedent died as a result of this amputation. The testimony of Dr. Samuel, not an attending physician, for the respondent-appellant, stands practically alone to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\u201cRespondent-appellant objects that it did not have 'knowledge of the occurrence of the injury,\u2019 nor was it given written notice. Regardless of the fact that it is 'knowledge of the occurrence of the injury,\u2019 as distinguished from knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>merely of the accident, that is requisite, it would appear that respondent-appellant had such knowledge, if it was not, in fact, given written notice. \u2018First hand personal knowledge is not what is meant\u2019 by the statute, but \u2018what would be called knowledge in common parlance, such knowledge as most of us are confined to in the daily affairs of life.\u2019 <em>Allen </em>v. <em>City of Millville, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>356. Petitioner testifies that respondent-appellant\u2019s doctor in charge at the home office was told of the entire situation shortly after it occurred. The person in charge of respondent-appellant\u2019s welfare department at the home office called by respondent-appellant, testified that this physician, Dr. Pascall, was uncertain \u2018whether he should treat the case as a compensation case or as one of illness.\u2019 Finally, respondent-appellant sent its investigator to find out the true facts from the lips of decedent in the hospital, after the amputation and three days before he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">\u201cAs noted above, decedent does not there deny, either that he had an accident or that an injury resulted, but merely does not recollect pain as a result of such accidental injury. In such statement, on the contrary, decedent does set forth the fall exactly as petitioner now claims, explicitly calls it an \u2018accident\u2019 and says that, while he, decedent, \u2018did not believe I had injured myself,\u2019 his doctor thought his gangrene \u2018was caused by a fall.\u2019 The above clearly constituted compliance with the statutory requirements and decedent\u2019s statement is, admissible fox this purpose, if fox no other.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\u201cAs to the question raised by the respondent-appellant concerning the dependence of decedent\u2019s nephew, the testimony is that such nephew was actually being supported by decedent as a member of his family. The statutory requirement is that the claimant must be \u2018dependent in fact.\u2019 <em>Muzik </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>129. Even if dependency in fact means not only support in fact, but as well a duty to so support, in the face of such testimony, the burden was upon the respondent to show the existence of such nephew\u2019s parents, who were both able and responsible for his maintenance. This it did not attempt to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>\u201cFor the above reasons, the determination of the compensation bureau is affirmed, and an order may be entered accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Now in oar judgment the foregoing opinion of Judge Hartshorne in deciding the appeal in the Court of Common Pleas completely disposes of the reasons of the prosecutor in <em>certiorari </em>now presented. Those reasons in effect are: (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">There was no proof of knowledge or notice, either oral or written, as required by the statute; (2) the judgment of the workmen\u2019s compensation bureau and the Essex County Court of Common Pleas is unsupported by legal evidence; (3) the judgment of the workmen\u2019s compensation bureau and the Essex County Court of Common Pleas was based upon an incorrect assumption of law and facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Since we find no merit in the reasons or arguments on behalf of the prosecutor in certiorwi'i, as is demonstrated b.y the opinion in the court below, the judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
