CALIFORNIA PACKING CORPORATION, APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b221-4\">Submitted October 13, 1933</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ajx\">Decided January 8, 1934.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b221-7\">Before Justices Pabkeb, Lloyd and Pebskie.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-8\">Por the appellant, <em>Paul J. Duffy.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-9\">Por the appellee, <em>Joseph L.

J. L. </em>748; 70 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>314. Prom the plaintiffs testimony it appeared that he had bought a sealed can of \u201cDel Monte\u201d peaches at a local grocery store, opened it and ate part of the contents, noticed a peculiar odor and taste, poured out the rest of the contents, and discovered a medicated finger bandage of gauze, strongly impregnated with some drug. That he became sick in consequence, and claimed damages. That he complained to defendant by letter, and received a reply, which was admitted in evidence apparently without objection, and which stated that the matter had been referred to the National Canners\u2019 Association, whose investigator would undoubtedly call. That an investigator did call and that the can and bandage had been shown t'o him. They were not produced in court, plaintiff explaining that he had mislaid them. He testified (apparently without objection or question) that the can and peaches were prepared and sold by the defendant. Both sides rested, and defendant asked for judgment on three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>grounds: The appeal is based solely on the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The second ground is properly considered first, viz., \u201cthat no proof had been offered that the defendant prepared or sold the can and contents in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">As to this, it is sufficient to say that plaintiff specifically testified that defendant did that very thing. As his statement was in nowise challenged, we can only assume that he spoke with actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The first ground was \u201cthat no negligence on the part of defendant had been proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">As to this, it suffices to cite <em>DeGroat </em>v. <em>Ward Baking </em>Co., 102 <em>N. J. L. </em>188; 130 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>540.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The third ground was \u201cthat plaintiff had generally failed in his burden of proving the material allegations contained in his demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">If this means anything, it means that plaintiff had not sustained the burden of proof: which is something not considered on appeal except where there is no legal evidence to support the claim or some, essential element thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
