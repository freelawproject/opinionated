This was the sum and substance of the evidence, for plaintiff on the matter of liability. There was a motion to nonsuit on the ground that the evidence failed to show any negligence, which motion was denied, and the defendant proceeded to -take testimony showing that the floor had been oiled the preceding Saturday night, and then on the following Monday treated with a compound calculated to absorb the oil and prevent the floor from being or remaining slippery. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">If the defendant had rested on plaintiff\u2019s case, there might well have, been a nonsuit. <em>Abt </em>v. <em>Leeds Co., </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>311; 162 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>525. But the case as finally submitted showed a situation, as we view it, controlled by <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Kraft, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>532; 16.6 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>80, in which the Court of Errors and Appeals held that any error in the.refusal of a nonsuit was cured by the evidence later submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
