L. </em>1932, <em>ch. </em>60, as amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1933, <em>ch. </em>215.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Our examination of the record in this case shows that there is nothing before us for review. The record does not show any conviction of the prosecutor. It shows nothing more than the writ of <em>certiorari </em>and the complaint together with the affidavit made by the prosecutor in obtaining the writ of certiorari, and what purports to be the testimony. True the affidavit gives the prosecutor\u2019s version of the action taken by the recorder; but we repeat, there is nothing in the record showing a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
