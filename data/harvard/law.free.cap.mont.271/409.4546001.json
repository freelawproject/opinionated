We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>On July 29, 1994, a jury in the City Court of Great Falls convicted Greg Price of the offenses of driving under the influence of alcohol and resisting arrest. He was sentenced on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Price filed a notice of appeal in City Court on August 12,1994, and the file subsequently was transferred to the District Court. The City of Great Falls moved for dismissal of the notice of appeal on the basis that the appeal was not timely filed and, absent a timely appeal, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the case. After briefing by the parties, the District Court entered its order dismissing the appeal. Price appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Did the District Court err in dismissing Price\u2019s appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Section 46-17-311(2), MCA, requires that appeals from a city court to a district court for a trial de novo be undertaken \u201cby filing written notice of intention to appeal within 10 days after a judgment is rendered following trial.\u201d Price\u2019s notice of appeal was filed 14 days after he was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The District Court relied on <em>State v. Hartford </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 254, 741 P.2d 1337, in dismissing Price\u2019s appeal. In <em>Hartford, </em>we stated that the right to appeal from a court of limited jurisdiction to a district court is purely statutory and that a district court does not acquire jurisdiction absent timely compliance with \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA. <em>Hartford, </em>741 P.2d at 1338. There, the notice of appeal was not given within the statutory 10-day period and, as a result, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal. <em>Hartford, </em>741 P.2d at 1338. We reaffirmed the <em>Hartford </em>approach in <em>State v. Arthur </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 75, 761 P.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Subsequent to the court\u2019s order dismissing Price\u2019s appeal, however, we decided <em>State v. Schindler </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 489, 886 P.2d 978. <em>Schindler </em>is controlling and dispositive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The issue in <em>Schindler </em>was whether the notice of appeal from justice court to district court was timely. We observed that both the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure (Rules of Civil Procedure) and the Montana Uniform Rules for Justice and City Courts (Uniform Rules) had been adopted since <em>Arthur. Schindler, </em>886 P.2d at 979. Rule 21 of the Uniform Rules provides that time is to be computed under Rule 6 of the Rules of Civil Procedure; Rule 6 provides that intermediate weekend days and legal holidays are excluded in computing time periods prescribed by statute. <em>Schindler, </em>886 P.2d at 979-980. Applying those Rules to Schindler\u2019s notice of appeal, we concluded that the notice of appeal was timely filed. <em>Schindler, </em>886 P.2d at 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We reach the same result here. Price had 10 days after July 29, 1994, within which to file his notice of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA. Excluding four intervening weekend days, the tenth day was August 12, 1994. That is the day on which Price filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We conclude that Price\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed. We hold, therefore, that the District Court erred in dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
