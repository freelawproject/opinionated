We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">The facts necessary to our resolution of this appeal are undisputed. Martin Redfern (Redfern) worked for Montana Muffler and Tire, Inc. (Montana Muffler), in Anaconda, Montana. Montana Muffler terminated Redfern\u2019s employment effective at the end of his October 24, 1992, shift. Montana Muffler paid Redfern his wages for the previous two weeks by check on October 26, 1992; the check also included compensation for five days of earned vacation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">On October 29, 1993, Redfern filed a complaint alleging wrongful discharge against Montana Muffler and others in the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County. Montana Muffler moved for a change of venue, the motion was granted and the action was transferred to the Third Judicial District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Montana Muffler answered the complaint, generally denying Red-fern\u2019s allegations. It also asserted affirmative defenses, including that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Montana Muffler subsequently moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds and supported its motion with the affidavit of Kirk R. Wells, its president. The parties briefed the motion, and Redfern filed his affidavit in opposition. The District Court granted Montana Muffler\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment dismissing Redfern\u2019s complaint. Redfern appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">Did the District Court err in granting Montana Muffler\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo; summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Spain-Morrow Ranch, Inc. v. West </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 441, 444, 872 P.2d 330, 331-32 (citations omitted). Here, the parties agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that no genuine issues of material fact exist relating to the motion for summary judgment. The sole issue before us is whether the court erred in concluding that Montana Muffler was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Redfern\u2019s complaint was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Redfern\u2019s complaint alleges that Montana Muffler terminated his employment in violation of Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA). An action under the WDEA\u201cmust be filed within 1 year after the date of discharge.\u201d Section 39-2-911(1), MCA. The District Court determined that Redfern\u2019s employment with Montana Muffler ended on October 24,1992, the date of his discharge. On that basis, the court concluded that Redfern\u2019s October 29, 1993, complaint was barred by the one-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Redfern asserts that he continued to earn compensation from Montana Muffler for five days after his discharge on October 24, 1992, by virtue of the five days of vacation pay included in his final paycheck. Accordingly, he argues that the statute of limitations did not begin to rim until either October 30 or 31, 1992, pursuant to <em>Allison v. Jumping Horse Ranch, Inc. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 410, 843 P.2d 753. Redfern\u2019s reliance on <em>Allison </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The issue before us in <em>Allison, </em>as it is in the present case, was at what point the \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA, one-year limitation \u201cafter the date of discharge\u201d begins to run. We focused first on the \u00a7 39-2-903(2), MCA, definition of \u201cdischarge\u201d as \u201ctermination of employment.\u201d <em>Al</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>lison, </em>843 P.2d at 755. We then defined \u201ctermination of employment\u201d to mean \u201ca complete severance of the relationship of employer and employee by positive act on the part of either or both.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>843 P.2d at 755 (citations omitted). Finally, we determined that the WDEA statute of limitations, like other statutes of limitations, does not begin to run until the cause of action accrues; in the WDEA context, \u201cdamages do not occur until the employee is no longer earning compensation from the employer, ... and this can only occur upon a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>843 P.2d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Applied to the undisputed facts in the present case, neither the plain language of \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA, nor our decision in <em>Allison, </em>supports Redfern\u2019s position. Under \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA, it is clear that Redfern\u2019s \u201cdate of discharge\u201d was October 24, 1992. Analogizing to <em>Allison, </em>the \u201ccomplete severance\u201d of the employment relationship occurred at the end of Redfern\u2019s shift on that date; thereafter, Redfern was no longer \u201cearning compensation\u201d from Montana Muffler.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Redfern\u2019s argument that the five days\u2019 vacation pay kept him on Montana Muffler\u2019s payroll for five days past the date on which he was discharged and, thus, that he was still \u201cearning compensation\u201d under <em>Allison </em>for that period of time, is totally without merit. The vacation pay was a fringe benefit of Redfern\u2019s employment with Montana Muffler which he had earned during the employment prior to the date of his discharge on October 24, 1992. As of that date, he no longer was employed by Montana Muffler and no longer was earning vacation pay or any other type of wage or fringe benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA, bars Redfern\u2019s complaint. We hold, therefore, that the court did not err in granting Montana Muffler\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing Redfern\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
