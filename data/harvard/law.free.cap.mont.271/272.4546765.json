Winsor, Attorney at Law, Helena.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-6\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"AXU\">delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Arlene Eickmeyer (Arlene) appeals from an order of the First Judicial District Court, Broadwater County, granting Charles Eickmeyer\u2019s motion to dismiss her petition for increased maintenance. We affirm, holding that the District Court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA, bars Arlene\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The facts necessary to our resolution of this case are undisputed. The marriage of Charles Eickmeyer (Charles) and Arlene was dissolved in 1987. The dissolution decree incorporated Charles and Arlene\u2019s marital settlement agreement which stated, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n] either of us seeks an award of maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Arlene filed a Petition for Increased Maintenance in 1994. She alleged that a change of circumstances had occurred since the dissolution \u201cwhich is so substantial as to be unconscionable.\u201d She requested monthly maintenance in the amount of $750 and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in bringing the petition. Charles moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that it was barred by \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss and Arlene appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoJ\">Did the District Court err in concluding that Arlene\u2019s petition was barred by \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Post-dissolution maintenance proceedings are governed by \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">Whenever the decree proposed for modification does not contain provisions relating to maintenance or support, modification under subsection (1) may only be made within 2 years of the date of the decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Section 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. The District Court concluded that the statement \u201c[n] either of us seeks an award of maintenance,\u201d incorporated into the decree from Charles and Arlene\u2019s marital settlement agreement, did not constitute a \u201cprovision relating to maintenance\u201d under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. Thus, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>court, Arlene\u2019s petition for maintenance was barred because it was not brought within two years of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The interpretation and application of a statute are matters of law. <em>Matter of E-Z Supply </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 298, 883 P.2d 833, 835. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Barnard </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 103, 106, 870 P.2d 91, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The function of courts in interpreting statutes is to effectuate the intent of the legislature. <em>E-Z Supply, </em>883 P.2d at 835 (citations omitted). \u201cOur primary tool for ascertaining the legislature\u2019s intent is the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>E-Z Supply, </em>883 P.2d at 835; quoting <em>Sagan v. Prudential Insurance Company of America </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 506, 509, 857 P.2d 719, 722. \u201cIf the legislature\u2019s intent can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in the statute, we will go no further.\u201d <em>E-Z Supply, </em>883 P.2d at 835; quoting <em>State ex rel. Neuhausen v. Nachtsheim </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 296, 299, 833 P.2d 201, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The dispute in this case centers on the meaning of the \u201cprovisions relating to maintenance\u201d language in \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. The ordinary and plain understanding of the word \u201cprovision\u201d is \u201cto provide\u201d something. Indeed, this common understanding is reflected in the dictionary definition of \u201cprovision\u201d as \u201cthe act of supplying ...; something provided.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1459 (3rd ed. 1992). Thus, a \u201cprovision relating to maintenance\u201d under the statute is an affirmative and action-oriented undertaking; it is a present undertaking or action of providing maintenance for a spouse, providing other assets specifically in lieu of maintenance, or providing for the payment or seeking of maintenance in the future upon the occurrence of a specified event.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The language \u201cneither of us seeks an award of maintenance\u201d does not constitute a \u201cprovision relating to maintenance\u201d when compared to the plain meaning of \u201cprovision.\u201d The language does not provide maintenance for a party in any form, or even provide for maintenance as a future possibility. The mere inclusion of the word \u201cmaintenance\u201d in a decree via incorporation, such as occurred in this case, does not constitute a provision relating to maintenance under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Arlene relies on <em>Marriage of Cooper </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 34, 699 P.2d 1044, and <em>Marriage of Rush </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 498, 699 P.2d 65, in arguing that the language in her agreement and decree constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>a provision relating to maintenance under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. Both cases are inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In <em>Cooper, </em>we addressed an issue entirely different from the issue presently before us. There, the issue was which decree or order constituted the \u201cdecree proposed for modification\u201d for purposes of applying \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. <em>Cooper, </em>699 P.2d at 1045. In addressing that issue, we observed that the original dissolution decree contained a provision relating to maintenance requiring Mr. Cooper to pay $4,200 in seven equal installments of $600 to his former wife, and permitting the former wife to petition for maintenance on the completion of those payments. <em>Cooper, </em>699 P.2d at 1045. We did not define or interpret the \u201cprovision relating to maintenance\u201d language in \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. Thus, <em>Cooper </em>is inapplicable here and nothing therein supports Arlene\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In <em>Rush, </em>the former wife petitioned to modify a 1975 dissolution decree regarding maintenance more than two years after entry of the decree. <em>Rush, </em>699 P.2d at 66. The decree contained maintenance provisions requiring payment of $400 per month until the payments reached a total of $24,000; all required maintenance payments had been made. The district court entertained, but denied, the former wife\u2019s petition to modify. The issue on appeal was whether the court erred in determining that the former wife had not satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 40-4-208(b), MCA. <em>Rush, </em>699 P.2d at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Prior to addressing that issue, we determined the fact that the maintenance required by the decree had been paid did not preclude an additional maintenance award as a matter of law. <em>Rush, </em>699 P.2d at 66. In doing so, we did not specifically address the \u201cprovisions relating to maintenance\u201d language in \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA. Thus, nothing in <em>Rush </em>supports Arlene\u2019s argument here. Indeed, any analogy which could be drawn to <em>Rush </em>would support our statutory interpretation in this case since it is clear that, there, the original decree contained provisions for the payment of maintenance. <em>Rush, </em>699 P.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We conclude that the dissolution decree incorporating the parties\u2019 marital settlement agreement did not contain a provision relating to maintenance. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(a), MCA, bars Arlene\u2019s petition and in granting Charles\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
