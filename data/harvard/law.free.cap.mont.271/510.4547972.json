Upon discovering that the driver had a suspended driver\u2019s license, Estill arrested the driver and called for backup. It was also discovered that there were outstanding warrants against appellant. Deputy Hintz responded to Estill\u2019s call for backup and arrested appellant on the outstanding warrants. A neighbor was contacted to retrieve the car. Deputy Tillman agreed to stay with the car until the neighbor arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Appellant asked that her purse be left in the car because it contained food stamps that her children would need. Tillman went back to the car and retrieved appellant\u2019s purse which he gave to Hintz to take to the station. Narcotics were discovered in appellant\u2019s purse when it was searched at the jail without a warrant. Appellant was charged with criminal possession of dangerous drugs under \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Appellant filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless search of her purse. The District Court denied appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant reserved her right to appeal the suppression issue and entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of dangerous drugs under \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. Appellant was found guilty of the charged offense and received a deferred sentence. It is from the District Court\u2019s judgment that appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Did the District Court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from her purse following her arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact, and whether the court correctly applied the findings as a matter of law. <em>State v. Stubbs </em>(1995), [270 Mont. 364], 892 P.2d 547, 550. In addition, we determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>Stubbs, </em>892 P.2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Warrantless searches are considered unreasonable per se under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Stubbs, 892 </em>P.2d at 550 (citing <em>State v. McCarthy (1993), 258 </em>Mont. 51, 55, 852 P.2d 111, 113; citing <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, <em>19 L. </em>Ed. 2d 576). However, certain exceptions to the warrant requirement are recognized under federal and Montana law. <em>Stubbs, </em>892 P.2d at 550; <em>McCarthy, </em>258 Mont. 51, 852 P.2d at 113 (citing <em>California v. Acevedo </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 565, 111 S. Ct. 1982, 114 L. Ed. 2d 619). One of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest. <em>Chimel v. California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685; Section 46-5-102, MCA. In Montana, a police officer may reasonably search a person lawfully arrested and the area within the person\u2019s immediate presence for the purpose of (1) protecting the police officer, (2) preventing the person from escaping, (3) discovering and seizing the fruits of the crime, or (4) discovering and seizing any person or things which may have been used in the commission of the offense. Section 45-5-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The District Court concluded that the warrantless search of appellant\u2019s purse fell within the search incident to a lawful arrest exception, and therefore, was a valid search. The State argues that appellant\u2019s purse, an item of personal property immediately associated with her person, was properly searched at the jail as an incident to her lawful arrest pursuant to <em>New York v. Belton </em>(1981), 453 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Appellant was arrested on outstanding city warrants for acts unrelated to the stop of the motor vehicle and the arrest of the driver. None of the four purposes set forth in \u00a7 46-5-102, MCA, which permit a warrantless search of the area within the arrestee\u2019s immediate presence is applicable. Searching appellant\u2019s purse would not have protected the arresting officer; would not have prevented appellant from escaping; would not have resulted in discovering fruits of the crimes which resulted in the city warrants; and would not have resulted in the discovery of anything which may have been used in the commission of the offenses which resulted in the city warrants. Consequently, evidence gathered as a result of the warrantless search of appellant\u2019s purse should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We hold that the District Court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from her purse following her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-7\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
