We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">This case began with Clarke\u2019s claim for compensation for on-the-job injuries sustained in February 1990. As it turned out, Clarke\u2019s employer, Scott Massey d/b/a All Seasons Construction and Truss Fabrication (Massey), did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Accordingly, Clarke\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid by the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (Fund), which, in turn, assessed a penalty against Massey and asserted its right to be repaid for benefits it had paid to Clarke. Massey brought suit against the Fund and Clarke contending that Clarke was either an independent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tractor or acting outside the scope of his employment when he was injured. On November 12, 1991, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court issued its decision finding that Clarke was Massey\u2019s employee and directing that Massey reimburse the Fund for all amounts expended on Clarke\u2019s claim subject to the limitations prescribed by \u00a7 39-71-504, MCA. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied Clarke\u2019s claim for attorney fees as having been made for the first time in proposed findings filed after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Prior to that decision, however, in January 1991, Clarke filed an action against Massey in District Court in Missoula County seeking damages, attorney fees and costs under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-515 and 516, MCA. In that action, Clarke contended, among other things, that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees against Massey incurred in both the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and District Court proceedings. The District Court awarded Clarke damages against Massey for lost wages and medical expenses (subject to the \u00a7 39-71-518, MCA, offset and the \u00a7 39-71-511, MCA, reimbursement obligation for benefits paid) and for attorney fees and costs in the District Court action. It denied Clarke\u2019s claim for attorney fees in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court proceedings, however, on the basis that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to award fees in those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court file was closed February 7, 1992. Notwithstanding, on March 9, 1994, Clarke filed a motion in that court requesting an award of some $3,900 in attorney fees incurred in his defense of the underlying 1991 Workers\u2019 Compensation Court action. The court reopened the file, and on June 8, 1994, entered an order denying, without prejudice, Clarke\u2019s motion and permitting the filing of a new petition. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that the previous denial of Clarke\u2019s demand for attorney fees was the law of the case, but since that prior ruling had been on procedural, as opposed to substantive, grounds, the filing of a new petition for attorney fees was not precluded. On July 14,1994, the court again closed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Clarke filed his petition requesting attorney fees on August 25, 1994. Following the filing of Massey\u2019s response, both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment supported by briefs. On January 27,1995, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court issued its final order and judgment granting Massey\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denying Clarke\u2019s motion and dismissing with prejudice Clarke\u2019s petition. Clarke appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in granting Massey\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in dismissing Clarke\u2019s petition for attorney fees? Underlying that question is the issue of whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court properly interpreted the provisions of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA (1989), in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The standard of review for an appeal from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is the same as that used by a district court. We determine whether there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Our review of the court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary; we simply determine whether its legal conclusions are correct. <em>Murer v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 516, 519-20, 885 P.2d 428, 430. Here, there are no material facts in dispute, and the resolution of the issue presented hinges upon the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Clarke presents two arguments on appeal. First he contends that reading \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-117, MCA, 39-71-401, MCA, and 39-71-611, MCA, together leads to the conclusion that Massey was an employer; that he was, therefore, required by law to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance under one of three plans; and that, since he did not enroll in either the state fund or retain the services of a private insurer, \u201che should be consider [sic] a self-insured for the purposes of MCA 39-71-611.\u201d While creative, Clarke cites no persuasive authority for his position, and we conclude that it is without merit. Common sense and the plain language of the statutes at issue dictate that an employer cannot, at once, be both insured and uninsured for the same workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Secondly, Clarke argues that we should look behind the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, and somehow glean a legislative intent that the statute, nevertheless, applies to uninsured employers because, \u201c[i]t stretches credulity that any legislature would intend that an individual who violates one law should benefit by such a violation.\u201d Clarke\u2019s references to words of wisdom from Justices Holmes and Hand and from Judge Traynor notwithstanding, we, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>similarly, conclude that this argument is without any basis whatsoever in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">At the outset, we note that the 1989 codes apply to Clarke\u2019s 1990 injury. <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. Section 39-71-611, MCA (1989), permits the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to award reasonable attorney fees against insurers who have unreasonably denied benefits due a claimant. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Costs and. attorneys\u2019 fees payable on denial of claim or termination of benefits later found compensable. (1) The insurer shall pay reasonable costs and attorney fees as established by the workers\u2019 compensation court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(a) the insurer denies liability for a claim for compensation or terminates compensation benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">(b) the claim is later adjudged compensable by the workers\u2019 compensation court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">(c) in the case of attorneys\u2019 fees, the workers\u2019 compensation court determines that the insurer\u2019s actions in denying liability or terminating benefits were unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">(2) A finding of unreasonableness against an insurer made under this section does not constitute a finding that the insurer acted in bad faith or violated the unfair trade practices provisions of Title 33, chapter 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">In construing a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The rules of statutory construction require the language of a statute to be construed according to its plain meaning. If the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required, and we will resort to legislative history only if legislative intent cannot be determined from the plain wording of the statute. <em>Lovell v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 285, 860 P.2d 95, 99. Where the intention of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute, the courts may not go further and apply any other means of interpretation. <em>Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Mont. Power Co. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">There is absolutely nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA (1989), that would make its provisions applicable to uninsured employers, nor is there any indication whatsoever from that language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of any legislative intent that the statute be so applied. The statute refers to insurers and to no one else. Under 39-71-116(8), MCA(1989), an \u201c \u2018[i]nsurer\u2019 means an employer bound by compensation plan No. 1, an insurance company transacting business under compensation plan No. 2, the state fund under compensation plan No. 3, or the uninsured employers\u2019 fund provided for in part 5 of this chapter.\u201d It is undisputed that Massey does not fit into any category of that statutory definition. He is simply an uninsured employer, and \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA (1989), is inapplicable to him by its clear and unambiguous terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA(1989), in this case and, in doing so, properly granted Massey\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice Clarke\u2019s petition for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
