KOONTZ, JR.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The sole issue in this appeal is whether an indemnity provision in a vehicle lease agreement is void as against public policy insofar as the provision would entitle a party to indemnification for liability incurred as the result of personal injuries caused by its own negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. Estes Express Lines, Inc. and Estes Leasing (collectively \"Estes\") engage in the business of leasing trucks. On April 15, 1996, Estes entered into a written lease agreement to lease several trucks to Chopper Express, Inc. (\"Chopper\"), a trucking company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 18 of the parties' lease agreement contains an indemnity provision stating, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [Chopper] agrees to indemnify, defend and hold [Estes] harmless from:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   C. Any and all loss, cost, claim, expense, cause of action, loss of use and liability by reason of injury (including death) to persons or damage to property arising out of the use, operation, ownership, maintenance or control of a [leased] Vehicle whether covered by insurance or not, including claims in excess of insurance limits and all claims determined not to be covered by insurance irrespective of who, among [Chopper] or its insurance\n   carrier or others, may be the cause for such failure of coverage or recovery in excess of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   D. Any liability by reason of any claim asserted by an agent or employee of [Chopper].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 11, 2001, James D. Davis, Jr., a Chopper employee, was injured while operating one of the trucks leased from Estes under the lease agreement. Davis filed a personal injury action against Estes and a repair company, Redman Fleet Services, alleging that their negligence caused his injuries. Estes and Davis engaged in mediation and eventually settled Davis' claim for $350,000. In settling Davis' claim, however, Estes did not admit negligence or liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, pursuant to the indemnity provision in section 18(C) of the lease agreement, Estes demanded that Chopper reimburse Estes for the $350,000 settlement amount and $23,898.92 in attorneys' fees Estes incurred in reaching the mediated settlement. When Chopper refused this demand, Estes filed a motion for judgment against Chopper in the trial court asserting that Estes was entitled under section 18(C) of the lease agreement to indemnity from Chopper in the amount of the settlement and the attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Chopper filed a demurrer to Estes' motion for judgment. In the demurrer Chopper asserted, inter alia, that Estes was not entitled to indemnification because section 18(C) of the lease agreement was \"void as against public policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a brief supporting the demurrer, Chopper elaborated that under\n   <em>\n    Johnson's Adm'x v.

In the letter opinion, relying principally upon its interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hiett,\n   </em>\n   the trial court concluded that the indemnity provision in section 18(C) of the lease agreement is void as against public policy. Interpreting\n   <em>\n    Hiett\n   </em>\n   to hold that only releases and indemnification agreements pertaining to\n   <em>\n    property damage\n   </em>\n   are enforceable, and that both releases and indemnification agreements involving\n   <em>\n    personal injuries\n   </em>\n   are void, the trial court ruled that section 18(C) is void as applied to Estes' indemnity claim stemming from Davis' personal injury settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court permitted Estes to file an amended motion for judgment, which Estes filed again claiming that it was entitled to indemnification under section 18(C). The amended motion for judgment was not materially different from the original motion for judgment, other than an added assertion that Estes was not negligent and that Chopper, Davis, and a third party were responsible for Davis' injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chopper again filed a demurrer to the amended motion for judgment. By a final order, the trial court sustained Chopper's demurrer to the amended motion for judgment for the reasons stated in its prior letter opinion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Estes asserts as its sole assignment of error that the trial court erred in \"ruling as a matter of law that indemnity agreements contained in contracts wherein a private party indemnifies itself against the possibility of its own future negligence for personal injuries are against public policy and void.\" Although the particular indemnity provision at issue here is drafted broadly so as to include both personal injury and property damage, under this assignment of error the question presented is whether Estes, the indemnitee, may enforce the provision and receive indemnification from Chopper, the indemnitor, when the loss was the result of a personal injury to a third party that was caused by Estes' alleged negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Estes maintains that parties negotiating at arm's length are free to make contractual indemnity agreements shifting losses incurred through damage to a third party. Estes further maintains that such agreements are enforceable regardless of whether the indemnitee's negligence caused the damage to the third party and regardless of whether that damage was to person or property. With regard to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hiett,\n   </em>\n   which were relied upon by the trial court, Estes contends that those cases are applicable only to pre-injury release provisions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   not indemnity provisions. According to Estes, indemnity provisions do not give rise to the important public policy concerns implicated by pre-injury release provisions. This is so, Estes contends, because pre-injury release provisions bar an injured party from recovering from the negligent tortfeasor, while indemnity agreements merely shift losses by means of an independent contractual relationship. Upon this basis, Estes asserts that public policy does not forbid a party from indemnifying itself against liability for personal injury caused by future negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Chopper responds that the prohibition against pre-injury release provisions for personal injury announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hiett\n   </em>\n   applies with equal force to indemnity agreements relating to personal injury. Chopper maintains that both types of provisions violate public policy by allowing a contracting party to put \"at the mercy of its own misconduct\" the other party to the contract. Chopper points to our language in\n   <em>\n    Hiett\n   </em>\n   that \"this Court's decisions . . . have been limited to upholding the right to contract for the release of liability for property damage, as well as indemnification from liability to third parties for such damage\" to indicate that a party may only indemnify itself against losses from property damage, not personal injury.\n   <em>\n    See Hiett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2085678\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/244/191/\">\n    244 Va. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=418%20S.E.2d%20894\">\n    418 S.E.2d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin our review of the indemnity agreement between Estes and Chopper with the principle that \"the law looks with favor upon the making of contracts between competent parties upon valid consideration and for lawful purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Shuttleworth, Ruloff &amp; Giordano, P.C. v.

The purpose of pre-injury release provisions such as those in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hiett\n   </em>\n   is to prospectively extinguish one party's right to recover for future bodily injuries caused to that one party by the other party's negligence. The effects of such provisions are twofold: a party suffering personal injury is barred from seeking a recovery from the tortfeasor, likely depriving the injured party of all possibility of recovery, and the released party's motivation to exercise ordinary care to prevent harm to the releasing party may be diminished because the possibility of legal liability is removed. In both\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hiett,\n   </em>\n   these concerns were realized because, had the release provisions been enforced, the plaintiff would have been left with no possible recovery for the defendant's alleged negligence and those same defendants would have been, essentially, judgment-proof despite their negligence. As we stated long ago in\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   such provisions cannot be tolerated under an enlightened system of jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In contrast, the purpose of an indemnity provision is to pre-determine how potential losses incurred during the course of a contractual relationship will be distributed between the potentially liable parties.\n   <em>\n    See Safeway,\n   </em>\n   270 Va. at 289, 619 S.E.2d at 79. Moreover, indemnity provisions, including those indemnifying a party against future liability for personal injury caused by its own negligence, do not invoke the same public policy concerns as pre-injury release agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The primary reason for this distinction is that, unlike pre-injury release provisions, indemnity provisions do not bar or even diminish an injured party's ability to recover from a tortfeasor. Indeed, regardless of whether the indemnitee recovers from the indemnitor, the negligent indemnitee remains liable to the injured party. That being the case, it is evident that enforcement of an indemnity provision does not jeopardize in any way the injured party's ability to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We recognize that to allow a party to indemnify itself against its own negligence in causing personal injury to another potentially puts the indemnitor at the mercy of the indemnitee's own misconduct. Theoretically, it can be argued that an indemnitee may have a diminished concern with being negligent because of its contractual right ultimately to be reimbursed by the indemnitor, which may lead to less motivation to act with care toward preventing personal injury. However, the mere existence of an indemnity provision does not guarantee reimbursement by the indemnitor because, for example, it may have become insolvent. With no guarantee of indemnity, we think it highly unlikely that a party would neglect to exercise ordinary care simply in anticipation that it ultimately might not have to bear the burden of any liability incurred as a result of its failure to exercise ordinary care to avoid personal injury to another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Chopper does not put forth, and we cannot envision, any other reason why public policy would forbid a party from indemnifying itself against its own negligence through a contractual provision negotiated at arm's length with a willing indemnitor. The indemnity provision at issue here, set forth in section 18(C) of the lease agreement between Estes and Chopper, is thus enforceable even to the extent that it would entitle Estes to be reimbursed from Chopper in the amount of its loss as a result of Davis' personal injuries caused by Estes' alleged negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For these reasons, we hold the trial court erred in ruling that the indemnity provision in section 18(C) is unenforceable, and in sustaining Chopper's demurrer for that reason. Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    We also address a similar issue regarding indemnity provisions relating to personal injury in\n    <em>\n     W.R.

Ultimately, the trial court correctly concluded that\n    <em>\n     Safeway\n    </em>\n    did not address the issue presented in this case. In\n    <em>\n     Safeway,\n    </em>\n    although we held that the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act did not bar an indemnification claim pursuant to an indemnity provision nearly identical to section 18(C), the specific issue of whether the provision was void as against public policy was not before the Court.\n    <em>\n     Safeway,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Va.%20285\">\n     270 Va. at 288-90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634028\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/619/76/\">\n     619 S.E.2d at 79-80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4.\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Estes also added a contribution claim to its amended motion for judgment, but that claim is not at issue in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5.\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Estes alternatively refers to a pre-injury release provision as an exculpatory provision.
