A hearing was held on 26 June 2006 on the petition. On 6 July 2006, the trial court entered a juvenile adjudication and disposition order finding and concluding that D.S.A. was a neglected juvenile and removing D.S.A. from the custody of respondent-parents. Respondent-parents appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondent-father contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction where the juvenile petition failed to comply with the requirements set forth under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-209 and therefore must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-209 sets forth, \"[i]n a child-custody proceeding, each party, in its first pleading or in an attached affidavit, shall give information, if reasonably ascertainable, under oath as to the child's present address or whereabouts, the places where the child has lived during the last five years, and the names and present addresses of the persons with whom the child has lived during that period.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-209(a) (2005). Respondent-father contends that where DSS failed to attach an affidavit as to the status of D.S.A. to the juvenile petition, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-200 vests \"exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who is alleged to be abused, neglected, or dependent\" in the district court. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-200(a)(2005). This Court has previously stated that the omission of an N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-209 affidavit does not by itself divest the trial court of jurisdiction in a termination of parental rights case, and we see no reason to hold differently in the case of a juvenile adjudication and disposition.\n   <em>\n    In re J.D.S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9005018\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/170/244/#p249\">\n    170 N.C.App. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632815\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/612/350/#p354\">\n    612 S.E.2d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795488,3786707,3786455,3793944,3788505,3793787,3789308,3792765\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/360/64/\">\n    360 N.C. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634704,12634702,12634703\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/623/584/\">\n    623 S.E.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).

It was further noted, \"`[a]lthough it remains the better practice to require compliance with section 50A-209, failure to file this affidavit does not, by itself, divest the trial court of jurisdiction.'\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 249,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632815\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/612/350/#p354\">\n    612 S.E.2d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the instant case, statutory authority provided the lower court with jurisdiction; and where respondent-father's only contention on appeal supporting lack of jurisdiction is that the trial court was divested of such jurisdiction due to failure to attach the affidavit required under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-209, this argument must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondent-parents argue on appeal that the trial court erred in finding and concluding that D.S.A. is a neglected juvenile where there was insufficient evidence to support such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The allegations in a petition alleging abuse, neglect, or dependency shall be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-805 (2005).

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-101(15)(2005). The statute further states\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In determining whether a juvenile is a neglected juvenile, it is relevant whether that juvenile lives in a home where another juvenile has died as a result of suspected abuse or neglect or lives in a home where another juvenile has been subjected to abuse or neglect by an adult who regularly lives in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20673\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court found that D.W.G.B., the older sibling of D.S.A., was adjudicated abused and neglected on 25 August 2005. Respondent-mother's boyfriend, who was cohabiting with her at the time of the abuse, pled guilty to first-degree sexual offense with a child, first-degree sexual offense, sexual offense by a person in the position of a parent with a victim who is a minor residing in the home, taking indecent liberties with a child, felony child abuse inflicting serious bodily injury and crime against nature as to D.W.G.B. and was sentenced to 209 to 260 months' imprisonment. Respondent-mother has further been indicted for the crime of felony child abuse by a parent inflicting serious bodily injury and is awaiting trial on the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Each of these findings were supported by clear, cogent and convincing evidence in the record. These findings were based on files, documents, and orders to which the lower court took judicial notice. While respondent-mother contends that such evidence was considered in error due to the failure of the court to give notice to the parties that judicial notice was being taken and the possibility of the orders being subjected to a lower evidentiary standard, we find no merit in such contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 201 states that a court may take judicial notice on its own motion. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 201(c) (2005). Further, while it is the better practice to give express notice to the parties of the intention to take judicial notice of matters contained in the juvenile's file, it is not required.\n   <em>\n    In re M.N.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8300848\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/176/114/#p121\">\n    176 N.C.App. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635057\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/625/627/#p632\">\n    625 S.E.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632 (2006).

While there was evidence of an intention to place D.S.A. with the paternal grandparents, respondent-father testified at the hearing that he had been unable to convince respondent-mother of the plan and a social worker further testified that respondent-mother was not in favor of placing D.S.A. with the paternal grandparents and planned to take the child home with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Just as this Court decided in\n   <em>\n    In re A.B.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636739\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/635/11/\">\n    635 S.E.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), where these findings of fact are supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, it certainly follows that the conclusion of the trial court that D.S.A. is a neglected juvenile under the statute is supported by such findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Respondent-father next contends that the trial court erred in placing D.S.A. in the custody of DSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Specifically, respondent-father argues that the trial court erred in placing D.S.A. in the custody of D.S.S. where respondent-parents\n   were voluntarily willing to place D.S.A. with relatives, namely the paternal grandparents.

Further, DSS had not completed a home study of the paternal grandparents to determine whether such home was a safe environment for D.S.A. It cannot be said to be in the best interest of D.S.A. to be placed in a home where he could later be subject to removal were it determined that respondent-father was not the biological father of D.S.A., and in turn that the paternal grandparents were not relatives.

If the juvenile is placed in the custody or placement responsibility of a county department of social services, the court may order the director to arrange, facilitate, and supervise a visitation plan expressly approved by the court. If the director subsequently makes a good faith determination that the visitation plan may not be in the best interests of the juvenile or consistent with the juvenile's health and safety, the director may temporarily suspend all or part of the visitation plan.

This statute does not authorize DSS to do so. The provision in G.S. \u00a7 7B-905(c) affording the director of DSS to \"temporarily suspend\" visitation under certain circumstances does not suggest that DSS itself may, as in the instant case, be ordered to establish and implement its own plan. In authorizing the director of DSS to suspend visitation, the General Assembly was apparently concerned with those emergency circumstances where hearings before the trial court are not immediately practicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to the majority opinion, DSS must submit a visitation plan \"to the trial court for approval\" on remand.
