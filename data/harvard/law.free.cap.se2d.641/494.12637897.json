KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The circuit court entered judgment imposing, as a monetary sanction against Robert C. Nusbaum, an attorney, for his misconduct during a jury trial, an award of attorneys' fees and costs to the opposing parties. In the same judgment order, the circuit court found Nusbaum guilty of criminal contempt of court in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) and imposed a fine of $250 pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-457. Nusbaum petitioned for an appeal to this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-670(A)(3) from the circuit court's judgment imposing the monetary sanction. Nusbaum also appealed the conviction for contempt of court to the Court of Appeals of Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-318. We awarded Nusbaum an appeal, certified the appeal of his contempt of court conviction from the Court of Appeals to this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-409(A) and -409(B)(2), and paired the two cases. We will reverse the circuit court's judgment imposing the monetary sanction because a trial court's inherent authority to discipline an attorney does not include the power to punish the attorney by assessing a monetary sanction consisting of an award of attorneys' fees and costs. We will affirm the circuit court's judgment convicting Nusbaum of contempt of court and imposing a $250 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The incident giving rise to both the assessment of the monetary sanction and the conviction for contempt of court occurred on December 12, 2005 during a multi-week civil jury trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach. Nusbaum and Linda S. Laibstain represented the two plaintiffs. Everette G. Allen, Jr., along with another attorney, represented three of the four defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During Allen's cross-examination of one of the plaintiffs, Laibstain objected several times to alleged discrepancies in certain documentary evidence. Allen countered at one point by stating that Laibstain's complaints were not true. Laibstain then requested a brief bench conference. Nusbaum claims that, during this bench conference, which was not recorded, Allen again accused Laibstain of being untruthful. When the bench conference concluded, the circuit court took a recess. After the jury left the courtroom, the circuit court admonished the attorneys by stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, the [c]ourt is not going to tolerate the lack of civility between and among the lawyers. It's uncalled for. And with any objection that is required by any or all lawyers, the [c]ourt will hear the motion and make the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   And any movement towards touching or shoving will be dealt with properly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following additional cross-examination of that plaintiff and a subsequent luncheon recess, the circuit court informed counsel and the parties, outside the presence of the jury, that the bailiff had advised the court about an incident that had occurred immediately after the bench conference earlier that morning. The court then asked the bailiff to state on the record what she had observed. The court offered to place the bailiff under oath, but no one responded. The bailiff then gave this statement in open court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [W]hile all parties were at the side bar . . ., I saw Mr. Nusbaum get in Mr. Allen's face. Mr. Allen backed up, but he couldn't go any further because his back was to my podium, and I saw Mr. Nusbaum get in his face and shove him with the elbow. And I grabbed Mr. Nusbaum by his forearm, and I said, that was inappropriate. You will not do that again. And [Mr. Nusbaum]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   stated to me, \"I thought it was appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circuit court inquired whether anyone wanted to ask the bailiff questions. Allen responded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Your Honor, I will just say I didn't take any offense at that. This is-we have some heated discussions sometimes and sometimes lawyers get a little frazzled. And a lawyer bumps up against me, that doesn't bother me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Nusbaum has always been a gentleman with me and certainly I overlooked it, didn't think any more about it. But she has-the deputy has recited it the way it happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But I wouldn't-I hope the [c]ourt is not troubled by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The following colloquy then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: The [c]ourt is troubled by it, Mr. Allen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   MR. ALLEN: Then I'll sit down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: I appreciate your attitude, but the [c]ourt is troubled by it, very troubled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Nusbaum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MR. NUSBAUM: When Mr. Allen told the [c]ourt that Ms. Laibstain was not being truthful, I objected to that. You speak about a lack of civility; I can't recall ever telling a judge that another lawyer wasn't being truthful. I could disagree with what he said, I could have a different version testify [sic], but I never accused a fellow lawyer before the [c]ourt of being untruthful, and I resented it very much. And whatever-take a step forward, I would probably do it again under the same circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I did not mean to threaten Mr. Allen physically and I'm sure he didn't feel threatened, but when somebody says about my co[-]counsel that they are not telling the truth, I feel that it's my duty to step forward and make it clear that I object to that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Nusbaum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The jury is sitting in the box and had an opportunity to observe all of this. Now, whether they did or not, the [c]ourt does not propose to make that inquiry of the jury. That doesn't have anything to do with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the bailiff said, the conduct was inappropriate, and the [c]ourt is going to declare a mistrial and charge the plaintiffs with the trial expense for the days that the [c]ourt has been in session.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   MS. LAIBSTAIN: Your Honor, the one thing that we would like to do is object to the assessing the cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: . . . It's the most troubling experience I have ever had. . . . I didn't see the occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I think [the bailiff]-what she said, I have no reason but to accept [her] version of what happened. And the [c]ourt cannot let this thing go without declaring a mistrial and assessing the plaintiffs with the costs of the proceedings for the four or five days we've been in trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Is there anything further?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   MS. LAIBSTAIN: Your Honor, I think that we would like to be heard on that because-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   MS. LAIBSTAIN: We'd like to object to that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: I think that it should be done promptly. I'll give you a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Laibstain also advised the circuit court that she wanted to retain counsel to represent her and Nusbaum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nusbaum again objected to the basis of the circuit court's decision to declare a mistrial:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   MR. NUSBAUM: If Your Honor please, I want to just say a sentence or two for the record about the incident that the [c]ourt saw fit to address his basis for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I'd like the record to show that the incident occurred at-under the bench in a side bar conference where the judge was present, along with all four or five attorneys, and as I understand, Your Honor, you did not observe anything personally?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: I merely-I saw [the bailiff] take your arm and [say] something to you that conduct is inappropriate or something like that. That's the first attention I had, that's the only thing I saw, and that's why I asked her to recite what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   MR. NUSBAUM: Well, as Your Honor knows, we had already moved for a mistrial not on that basis, of course; it seems to me-and I respectfully want to put this in the record-that the [c]ourt has overreacted to [the bailiff's] experience or perception of what happened since it was apparently not significant enough to even attract her attention when you were standing right there within two or three feet of us, and so I do want to say that I don't feel like Mr. Allen was personally threatened in any way, I don't think he would even tell you that he felt threatened by the fact that we may have bumped each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I do acknowledge that the [bailiff] did take me by the arm as we were leaving to return to our tables and saying what she thought had happened was inappropriate, and I disagreed with her. But beyond that, I don't know that there is any conduct that would possibly be the basis for a mistrial. It was in the presence of the jury. There's no indication that the jury saw it or was disturbed by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: The jury was in the box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. NUSBAUM: I understand. But Your Honor didn't see it, it was up there in the cluster of the people that were standing very close to each other and there's no indication that the jury was aware of anything of the kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   So my objection is not to the granting of the mistrial, but the basis for it that the [c]ourt is saying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Allen then asked for \"`enhanced sanctions' meaning enough reimbursement to truly cover [the defendants] for the money that they will lose because of this continuance.\" In subsequently filed motions and memoranda, all the defendants urged the circuit court to use its inherent authority to impose sufficient sanctions so as to make them whole and prevent the plaintiffs from benefiting from their counsel's misconduct. Nusbaum, now represented by counsel, filed a written objection to the circuit court's decision to grant the mistrial and assess costs. Nusbaum argued not only that the circuit court had no basis for declaring the mistrial but also that it did not have the authority to impose costs against an attorney for conduct that did not violate either Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 or Rule 4:12(b). He noted that the proposed monetary sanction, if assessed, would exceed the maximum fine allowable in a summary criminal contempt proceeding under Code \u00a7 18.2-457.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nusbaum attached an affidavit to his written objection. In his affidavit, Nusbaum vowed that he never intended to have physical contact with Allen on the occasion in question. Nusbaum explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [T]he sidebar conference having ended, Mr. Allen turned around to return to his seat at defense counsel's table. As I was standing behind him, about to speak to him, and he was moving toward his seat, we bumped, and I believe he stepped back at the instant of contact,\n   <em>\n    understandably leaving [the bailiff] with the impression that he had been shoved or pushed.\n   </em>\n   I said to him quietly at that point that he ought not be telling [the] Judge . . . that [Laibstain] is untruthful. He responded, \"Well, she's not telling the truth.\" Disappointed, I turned around to walk to my seat, and he proceeded to his seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As I turned to go to my seat, [the bailiff] walked over and put her hand on my right forearm, as if to get my attention. I stopped, and she said to me, \"What you did was inappropriate.\" Since I had absolutely no sense of any improper physical contact or what she has described as pushing or shoving, I could only conclude that she was referring to the\n   <em>\n    conversation\n   </em>\n   I had just had with Mr. Allen. I responded that I thought it\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   appropriate. To my astonishment, still not understanding what [the bailiff] was referring to, she said\n   something to the effect that, if it happened again, it would be serious. I was perplexed by her concern, but gave it no further thought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In an opposing affidavit, Allen challenged Nusbaum's recollection of the incident. Allen asserted that Nusbaum's \"`physical contact' or `bump' was neither inadvertent, nor was it unintended.\" Allen stated that, after the bench conference ended, Nusbaum blocked his path and moved within inches of his face. Allen claimed that he stepped back twice until he was positioned against a podium. Then, according to Allen, Nusbaum shoved his elbow against Allen's chest and told Allen that everything Laibstain said was true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The circuit court reconvened on January 12, 2006 to decide whether to assess attorneys' fees and costs against Nusbaum. Before hearing argument on that issue, the circuit court announced that its decision to declare a mistrial \"was compelled by the uncontroverted account of [the bailiff].\" The court stated that, based on that account, it had \"concluded that Mr. Nusbaum deliberately in the presence of the jury physically attacked Mr. Allen.\" The court further stated that it was \"astounded and troubled that Mr. Nusbaum would execute and tender as an exhibit to his submission his affidavit seeking for the first time to challenge [the bailiff's] testimony.\" The circuit court then identified the two issues before it as a result of Nusbaum's misconduct: \"[I]s the [c]ourt authorized under existing statutes or decisions to impose upon Mr. Nusbaum such monetary sanctions as the [c]ourt had indicated it was considering initially; or . . . is the [c]ourt limited to the contempt remedies as are provided by [Code \u00a7\u00a7] 18.2-456(1) and 18.2-457 and, if so, the forms thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After each side presented argument, the circuit court determined that it did not have the power to impose \"financial sanctions\" under the circumstances of the case. The circuit court, however, found Nusbaum guilty of contempt of court under Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) for \"shoving counsel\" in the courtroom on December 12, 2005 and expressed its intention to punish him in accordance with Code \u00a7 18.2-457. The court then stated, \"I don't know what you-all's attitude about that is . . . whether you want to be heard at a later time or what with respect to that.\" Then, before anyone could respond, the circuit court disqualified Nusbaum's law firm from further service to the plaintiffs in the litigation, pursuant to its \"inherent authority.\" The circuit court then asked, \"How do you all want to do the sanctions?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In response to the circuit court's questions, counsel for Nusbaum reminded the court that, without a jury trial, the maximum punishment for a conviction of contempt of court is a fine of $250 or up to ten days in jail. His counsel stated, \"Well, if Your Honor does not have a jail sentence in mind, I don't think that there would be anything to be gained to have a separate hearing on a $250 fine, if that's what you have in mind.\" The circuit court then sentenced Nusbaum by imposing a fine of $250. At that point, Nusbaum's counsel noted an \"objection to the determination of the [c]ourt . . . and to all of the rulings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Soon after the January 12 hearing, Nusbaum filed a motion asking the circuit court to reconsider its decision to disqualify Laibstain and Nusbaum's law firm from any further representation of the plaintiffs. Nusbaum challenged the circuit court's inherent authority to disqualify an entire law firm based on the misconduct of one of its lawyers. In a memorandum filed in support of the motion, Nusbaum, however, advised that he was not asking the circuit court to reconsider any other part of its rulings, including the decision to disqualify Nusbaum. All the defendants opposed Nusbaum's motion to reconsider and, in addition, filed their own motions requesting the circuit court to reconsider its decision denying an award of monetary sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On March 21, 2006, the circuit court heard argument on the parties' respective motions. The circuit court decided to amend its January 12, 2006 ruling and permitted Laibstain and Nusbaum's law firm to continue their representation of the plaintiffs in the litigation. The circuit court further amended its prior decision by imposing as a sanction against Nusbaum an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to all the defendants for their time expended in preparing for and appearing at the January 12 and March 21 hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After the circuit court announced its decision, counsel for Nusbaum stated that he wanted to note specific objections to the contempt of court finding since he had voiced only a general objection to the court's rulings at the January 12 hearing. Nusbaum's counsel asked the circuit court to recite in its order Nusbaum's objection to the summary determination of contempt of court on the grounds that, \"where the misconduct is not seen by the judge[,] the defendant has a right to be accorded a trial on that particular issue, and the lack of a trial is a denial of due process.\" Nusbaum's counsel, however, stated, \"I am not asking [the court] at this time to change [its] ruling. I am simply going to make sure . . . that I have preserved any right of appeal with respect to the contempt finding.\" Allen opposed the attempt to interpose objections at that time and argued that the objections were not timely raised at the January 12 hearing and therefore could not be preserved by stating them at this later hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   During the final hearing, on March 27, 2006, the circuit court considered the form of its final order and the amount of monetary sanctions to be imposed against Nusbaum. A discussion again arose concerning the objections to the contempt of court finding that Nusbaum wanted to recite in the final order. His counsel again stated that he was not requesting the circuit court to reconsider its ruling but that, instead, he merely wanted the court's order to include the \"particulars\" of his objection with respect to the contempt of court conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the conclusion of this hearing, the circuit court entered its final order, imposing as a sanction against Nusbaum an award of attorneys' fees and costs to all the defendants in the total amount of $52,738.88. The order also set forth the circuit court's judgment convicting Nusbaum of contempt of court in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) and sentencing Nusbaum with a fine in the amount of $250. The parties noted their respective objections to the final order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   These appeals ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In his two appeals, Nusbaum raises distinct assignments of error challenging the imposition of the monetary sanction and the conviction for contempt of court. We will address them separately and in that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A. Monetary Sanction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In this appeal, Nusbaum challenges the circuit court's judgment awarding attorneys' fees and costs to all the defendants as a sanction for Nusbaum's misconduct. The dispositive issue is whether the circuit court erred by using its \"inherent power\" to impose the monetary sanction against Nusbaum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In that regard, Nusbaum argues that, absent a contractual or statutory provision permitting an award of attorneys' fees, a trial court does not have the authority either to make such an award or to impose it as a sanction. According to Nusbaum, the purpose of a trial court's inherent power to discipline an attorney is to protect the public,\n   not to punish the attorney or to compensate the parties; thus, a trial court cannot use such power to impose an award of attorneys' fees as a disciplinary measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In response, the defendants acknowledge that this Court has never decided whether a trial court's inherent power to discipline an attorney includes the power to impose a monetary sanction. Nevertheless, the defendants argue that such a sanction is reasonable and should be available to trial courts since it would be a less severe sanction than the suspension of an attorney's license to practice in a particular court, which is indisputably within a court's authority.\n   <em>\n    See Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth Bar Ass'n v.

Criminal Contempt of Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The circuit court convicted Nusbaum of contempt of court in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1). That provision permits a court or judge to issue \"attachments for contempt, and punish them summarily\" in cases involving \"[m]isbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or\n   interrupt the administration of justice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nusbaum challenges his conviction on three grounds: (1) that the circuit court violated his \"due process rights by summarily convicting him of indirect criminal contempt in a civil proceeding with no notice of the charge, no plenary criminal hearing and without substituting the Commonwealth as the prosecuting party;\" (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for contempt of court; and (3) that the circuit court erred by rejecting Nusbaum's affidavit and failing to dismiss the contempt charge based on his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   With regard to the first issue, the Commonwealth contends that Nusbaum did not properly preserve his due process objections. The Commonwealth asserts that Nusbaum's general objection to the circuit court's determination and all its rulings, which his counsel noted after the court announced its finding of contempt at the January 12 hearing, was not sufficiently specific to preserve the due process issues now raised on appeal. Continuing, the Commonwealth also points out that, when Nusbaum's counsel later stated more specific objections asserting a violation of his due process rights, he affirmatively stated he was not asking the circuit court to reconsider any matter. Thus, according to the Commonwealth, Nusbaum's failure to ask the circuit court to rule on his due process objections waived appellate review of them under Rule 5:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nusbaum counters that he initially objected to all the circuit court's rulings and later made the circuit court aware of the substance of his due process objections by stating them at the March 21 hearing and noting them on the final order. Thus, according to Nusbaum, he did all that was required under the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A) to preserve his objections for appeal. Nusbaum further contends that, having made the circuit court aware of his objections, he had no obligation to ask the court to reconsider any matter since the court had the opportunity, within 21 days of entering the final order, to vacate that order and change its rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Under Rule 5:25, we will not sustain error to a ruling of a trial court \"unless the objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals. In addition, a specific, contemporaneous objection gives the opposing party the opportunity to meet the objection at that stage of the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Weidman v.

At the January 12 hearing after the circuit court convicted Nusbaum of contempt of court, his counsel stated: \"[N]ote our objection to the determination of the [c]ourt . . . and to all of the rulings.\" Other than the circuit court's ruling disqualifying Nusbaum, Laibstain, and Nusbaum's entire law firm from continued representation of the plaintiffs, the only other rulings by the circuit court at that point were its finding that Nusbaum was guilty of contempt of court in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) and its decision to impose a fine of $250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Undoubtedly, everyone at the January 12 hearing was surprised when the circuit court, without prior notice to anyone, raised the issue of criminal contempt of court. However, at no point thereafter, either during the argument at that hearing or after the circuit court found Nusbaum guilty of contempt of court, did Nusbaum object to the court's proceeding summarily on what he now claims was a charge of indirect criminal contempt, without notice, without a plenary criminal hearing, and without substituting the Commonwealth as the prosecuting party. Nor did Nusbaum object to the fact the bailiff's statement was not offered under oath. Instead of objecting to the manner in which the circuit court had proceeded, Nusbaum's counsel stated that a separate hearing on the issue of a sanction would not be necessary if the court did not have a jail sentence in mind. Consequently, the circuit court made no ruling at the January 12 hearing on any of the due process issues now raised on appeal. They simply were not in front of the court at that time. Thus, the general objection by Nusbaum's counsel to the circuit court's rulings did not pertain to those issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Following the January 12 hearing, Nusbaum filed a motion asking the circuit court to reconsider its decision to disqualify Laibstain and the entire law firm from further representation of the plaintiffs. Nothing in that motion challenged Nusbaum's conviction for contempt of court or asserted a lack of due process afforded to him by the circuit court in making that finding. Moreover, Nusbaum affirmatively stated in a memorandum in support of the motion that he was not asking the circuit court to reconsider any other aspect of its rulings, including its decision to disqualify Nusbaum, individually, from further representation of the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Not until the March 21 hearing did Nusbaum state specific objections to the manner in which the circuit court had proceeded in finding Nusbaum guilty of contempt of court. Nusbaum's objection at that time was that, because the circuit court had not directly observed the misconduct, Nusbaum was entitled to a trial, the denial of which violated his due process rights. However, instead of asking the circuit court to reconsider and set aside the finding of contempt of court for those reasons, Nusbaum's counsel stated, \"I am not asking [the court] at this time to change [its] ruling. I am simply going to make sure ... that I have preserved any right of appeal with respect to the contempt finding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Nusbaum took the same position at the March 27 hearing. When a discussion arose about the objections Nusbaum's counsel wanted to recite in the circuit court's final order convicting Nusbaum of contempt of court, Nusbaum's counsel again stated that he was not requesting the court to reconsider its ruling. Instead, Nusbaum's counsel indicated he just wanted the order to reflect the \"particulars\" of his objections to the contempt of court conviction. Both Nusbaum and his counsel noted the \"particulars\" of the due process objections on the final order, but again, there was no ruling by the circuit court on those objections nor a request that it make one. In sum, this record contains no rulings by the circuit court on the due process issues raised on appeal nor any request by Nusbaum for the circuit court to rule on those issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We addressed an analogous situation in\n   <em>\n    Riner,\n   </em>\n   where we held the defendant did not afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on an issue subsequently raised on appeal.

Indeed, he admitted as much at the March 21 hearing when he told the circuit court he wanted to note specific objections to the contempt of court finding because he had stated only a general objection at the January 12 hearing.

Those issues, whether the circuit court violated his due process rights by summarily convicting him of indirect criminal contempt, with no notice of the charge, no plenary criminal hearing, and no substitution of the Commonwealth as the prosecuting party, are therefore waived on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5:25;\n   <em>\n    Riner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12631728\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/601/555/#p325\">\n    268 Va. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12631728\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/601/555/#p325\">\n    601 S.E.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Furthermore, this is not a situation where the circuit court prevented Nusbaum from voicing his objections, asking the court to rule on them, or requesting the court to reconsider a ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-384 (\"if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection shall not thereafter prejudice him . . . on appeal\"). At the March 21 hearing, the circuit court allowed Nusbaum to state on the record his objections to the contempt of court finding. At one point, the circuit court even stated that it wanted Nusbaum to do whatever he thought was necessary in order to preserve his appellate rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Of particular significance is the fact Nusbaum, after the January 12 hearing, filed a motion to reconsider but addressed only the circuit court's decision to disqualify Laibstain and Nusbaum's entire law firm from further representation of the plaintiffs. The circuit court ruled on that motion, as well as the defendants' motions asking the court to reconsider its decision denying an award of monetary sanctions. Yet, during all this time, Nusbaum never asked the circuit court to reconsider its contempt of court finding or to rule on the objections he raised at the March 21 hearing. While Nusbaum was perhaps surprised when the circuit court found him guilty of contempt of court, he subsequently stated his due process objections and had ample opportunities to ask the circuit court to rule on them.\n   <em>\n    Compare Jones v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2162414\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/194/273/#p280\">\n    194 Va. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20S.E.2d%20693\">\n    72 S.E.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (1952) (when defense counsel was taken by surprise and failed to object to the trial court's erroneous reply to a juror, the issue was not waived on appeal)\n   <em>\n    with Weidman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2109331\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/241/40/#p44\">\n    241 Va. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20164\">\n    400 S.E.2d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (counsel afforded trial court opportunity to rule intelligently by making position known at a hearing and by filing a motion for rehearing during the 21 days during which the trial court retained jurisdiction over the final order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We turn now to the question whether there was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court's finding of contempt of court.

He first asserts that the circuit court improperly relied on the unsworn statement of the bailiff to find Nusbaum guilty of contempt of court. Though recognizing that the failure to administer the oath to a witness can be waived, Nusbaum claims that a waiver cannot occur when a defendant is not informed that certain testimony will be used in a criminal proceeding. He further argues that, when the circuit court heard the bailiff's statement, it was not in the context of a criminal proceeding, and thus, it is doubtful whether the court weighed the statement in light of the proper standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, Nusbaum claims that, even if the circuit court could rely on the bailiff's unsworn statement, there was not sufficient evidence that he intentionally made physical contact with Allen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   With regard to Nusbaum's assertion that the circuit court improperly relied on the bailiff's unsworn statement, that issue, like his due process objections discussed earlier, is waived. In this instance, however, the waiver occurred because Nusbaum never raised the objection before the circuit court. As already discussed, the circuit court offered to place the bailiff under oath, but none of the parties requested that she be sworn. At no time thereafter did Nusbaum question whether the circuit court could rely on the bailiff's unsworn statement. We will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5:25;\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Ziherl,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632294\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/607/367/#p39\">\n    269 Va. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632294\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/607/367/#p39\">\n    607 S.E.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Thus, in determining whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for contempt of court, we consider the bailiff's statement along with the other evidence, i.e., Nusbaum's and Allen's statements to the circuit court on the day the incident occurred and their respective affidavits. The bailiff stated that she saw Nusbaum use his elbow to shove Allen. In his affidavit, Nusbaum explained the incident as an inadvertent \"bump\" that \"understandably [left the bailiff] with the impression that [Allen] had been shoved or pushed.\" Allen stated that the bailiff's \"recitation of the events that took place [was] consistent with [Allen's] own recollection.\" Allen further stated that \"Nusbaum's ... `bump' was neither inadvertent, nor was it unintended.\" Allen explained that, when he \"turned to resume questioning the witness[,] Nusbaum blocked [Allen's] path,\" forcing Allen to \"step[] back twice.\" Following the last step, according to Allen, \"Nusbaum shoved his elbow against [Allen's] chest, forcing [Allen] against the podium.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As reflected by the evidence, the circuit court heard conflicting versions of the incident. It was within the province of the court, as the fact-finder, to determine the credibility of the witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See Mercer v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165854\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/259/235/#p242\">\n    259 Va. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20S.E.2d%20213\">\n    523 S.E.2d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (2000). \"The factual determinations of the [circuit] court, like those of a jury, are binding on this Court, and we will reverse such findings `only if they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.'\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20S.E.2d%20213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20S.E.2d%20213\">\n    at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20S.E.2d%20213\">\n    523 S.E.2d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the circuit court's judgment finding Nusbaum guilty of contempt of court was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.

We find nothing in the record to demonstrate that the underlying factual assertion is correct. At the beginning of the January 12 hearing, the circuit court stated that it was \"astounded and troubled that Mr. Nusbaum would execute and tender as an exhibit to his submission his affidavit seeking for the first time to challenge [the bailiff's] testimony.\" As this statement reveals, the circuit court did not fail or refuse to consider Nusbaum's affidavit; the court merely found Nusbaum's account of the incident not believable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the reasons stated, we will reverse the circuit court's judgment imposing the monetary sanction against Nusbaum and vacate that sanction.
