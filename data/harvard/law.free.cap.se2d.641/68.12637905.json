Daly Seven, Inc. filed a new petition for rehearing on August 31, 2006. By an order entered November 17, 2006, this Court awarded Daly Seven, Inc. a rehearing pursuant to the provisions of Rule 5:39(e), but in doing so, did not set aside the judgment previously rendered on March 3, 2006.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-7\">\n      Now, therefore, in consideration of the record, the briefs originally filed by the parties, the petition for rehearing of Daly Seven, Inc. filed pursuant to this Court's order of August 11, 2006, the response of Ryan Taboada to that petition, and the argument of the parties, the Court is of the opinion that, for the reasons stated in the opinion in this case dated March 3, 2006, the judgment of this Court should not be set aside. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court sustaining the demurrer to Ryan Taboada's claim under Code \u00a7 35.1-28, reverse the judgment of the trial court sustaining the demurrer to Ryan Taboada's common law claim, and remand the case for a trial on the merits of that claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      As the majority opinion accurately recites, this appeal arises from the circuit court's judgment sustaining Daly Seven's demurrer to Taboada's amended motion for judgment alleging Daly Seven was liable for injuries Taboada sustained as a result of Derrick Smith's criminal conduct. While I agree with the majority opinion as to the disposition of Taboada's claim under Code \u00a7 35.1-28, I respectfully disagree that Taboada stated a common law claim for negligence cognizable in Virginia under the facts alleged. In my view, the majority opinion is in error for at least two reasons. First, the majority misreads the standard our precedent has applied to the duty of a common carrier to its passengers, which is the basis for the duty it now imposes on innkeepers. Second, even if the standard derived by the majority was supported by our case law, the majority applies that standard in this case in a manner inconsistent with the common carrier cases.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      As a general rule, \"the owner or possessor of land is under no duty to protect invitees from assaults by third parties while the invitee is upon the premises.\"\n      <em>\n       E.g., Wright v.

Thus, taking these allegations as true on demurrer, we are of opinion that the allegations as to Bateman's presence on Skate America's premises were sufficient to state a claim that Skate America was on notice specifically that Thompson was in danger of being injured by Bateman in a criminal assault.

As the following analysis of the common carrier cases shows, a \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard has always been read in the context of whether a \"specific danger just prior to the assault\" was known to the defendant carrier. \"[I]mminent probability of harm\" in\n      <em>\n       Wright\n      </em>\n      was simply another way of expressing the standard of \"specific danger just prior to the assault\" from the common carrier cases.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-25\">\n      For example, in\n      <em>\n       Connell v.

Consequently, the majority's reliance on the common carrier cases to establish an unconditional \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard to measure the duty of care owed by an innkeeper is not supported by the standard applied to carriers. Accordingly, I believe the majority errs in imposing a standard of foreseeability to measure the duty of an innkeeper that is inconsistent with the duty we have applied to a common carrier. Those cases, as we concluded in\n      <em>\n       Wright,\n      </em>\n      read foreseeability as requiring notice of a \"specific danger just prior to the assault,\" which is equivalently stated as requiring knowledge of an \"imminent probability of harm.\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      The majority does not argue that if the standard for duty of care articulated in\n      <em>\n       Wright\n      </em>\n      is applied in this case, the circuit court incorrectly ruled on the demurrer. To the contrary, it is readily evident that under a standard requiring an innkeeper to have \"notice of a specific danger just prior to the assault\" so that \"an imminent probability of harm to an invitee\" is known, Taboada has failed to plead facts sufficient to meet that standard. The circuit court's judgment is thus not erroneous when reviewed in the context of the standard under\n      <em>\n       Wright,\n      </em>\n      which should be the applicable standard in this case for the reasons outlined above.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      Even if the majority were correct in deriving the standard of care from the common carrier cases it now applies to Daly Seven, the application of that standard under the circumstances of this case is not supported by our precedent. This is so, in part, because no common carrier case, the majority's foundation for innkeeper liability, has imposed an elevated duty upon the carrier outside the confines of its vehicle or property in\n     an area generally accessible to the public. While the innkeeper-guest relationship may be analogous in some circumstances to a common carrier-passenger relationship when the guest is in his or her room, it is inapposite for determining the duty of care owed a guest in other areas of an inn readily accessible by the public, such as Daly Seven's outside parking lot.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      The majority correctly recites from\n      <em>\n       Birchfield\n      </em>\n      and\n      <em>\n       Connell\n      </em>\n      our prior language that a common carrier owed its passengers a duty of \"utmost care and diligence.\" In imposing an equivalent duty upon an innkeeper, however, the majority neglects to put the discussion in the context in which it occurred in the common carrier cases. The context makes an important and substantial difference because the elevated duty ascribed to the common carrier is uniformly restricted to \"those whom [the carriers] take into their coaches.\"\n      <em>\n       Birchfield,\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2026703\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/105/809/\">\n       105 Va. at 821\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20S.E.%20879\">\n       54 S.E. at 883\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ;\n      <em>\n       Connell,\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1870732\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/93/44/\">\n       93 Va. at 55\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20S.E.%20467\">\n       24 S.E. at 468\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n      <footnotemark>\n       4\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-35\">\n      As noted above, in all but one of the cases analyzing liability for the criminal acts of a third party within the context of a common carrier-passenger relationship, the alleged criminal act occurred within the confined area of the carrier's vessel, an area not accessible to the public. Only in\n      <em>\n       Hines\n      </em>\n      did an attack occur outside of the train car and engender liability on the part of the common carrier. However, as described earlier,\n      <em>\n       Hines\n      </em>\n      is clearly distinguishable from the other common carrier cases and the case at bar because it involved an affirmative act by the defendant to expose the plaintiff to criminal assault by discharging the plaintiff from the train. As we noted in\n      <em>\n       Wright,\n      </em>\n      the carrier's \"affirmative act of negligence in ejecting the passenger at a dangerous place\" distinguishes\n      <em>\n       Hines,\n      </em>\n      so it is inapplicable in the context of the other common carrier cases.\n      <em>\n       Wright,\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2098057\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/234/527/#p530\">\n       234 Va. at 532\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20S.E.2d%20919\">\n       362 S.E.2d at 922\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-36\">\n      Thus, the common carrier cases upon which the majority relies to fashion its rule of liability only find a duty on the part of the common carrier for criminal acts of a third party within the confines of the carrier: an area only accessible to the passenger and not to the public. No case imposes a duty on the carrier and resulting liability for breach where the plaintiff passenger is, for example, in the parking lot of a train station, at a bus station, or an airport concourse. These areas, like the outdoor premises in a hotel parking lot, are accessible by guests and the public and are not areas where our common law has found an elevated duty on behalf of the defendant common carrier to warn or protect the passenger or guest from third party assaults.\n      <footnotemark>\n       5\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      The majority's failure to apply the appropriate standard and to recognize the limitation of duty in publicly accessible areas also produces an inequitable and unjustifiable paradox. Comparing the facts and outcomes in\n      <em>\n       Wright\n      </em>\n      and the case at bar readily reveals this conundrum.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-38\">\n      For example, assume Individual A parks her car in a hotel parking lot, steps inside the hotel to ask directions, and returns to her car, where she is assaulted by a third party. Individual B parks his car in the hotel parking lot space next to Individual A, checks into the hotel at the same time, and returns to his car to get luggage, where he is assaulted by the same third party who is attacking Individual A. Assuming the same factual allegations as Taboada makes here, under the analysis adopted in\n      <em>\n       Wright\n      </em>\n      and by the majority, the hotel may be liable to Individual B, but not Individual A although assaulted by the same perpetrator at the same time and place.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      Similarly, if a hotel, conference center, grocery store, and service station operate\n     within close proximity of each other with adjoining parking lots and identical histories of criminal conduct on their premises, distinctly different results arise under the majority's analysis. A guest assaulted at the hotel could have a cause of action against the hotel, but no cause of action would lie against the owners of the other facilities for similar acts by the same assailant at the same time.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-40\">\n      The majority's standard for foreseeability appears to make the innkeeper a de facto insurer of his guest's safety and thereby imposes a standard above that placed on a common carrier in a similar context. In some respects, the innkeeper now has a higher degree of liability than a common carrier because the innkeeper is liable for assault in its outside parking area where no common carrier has been held to a similar standard.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-41\">\n      In conclusion, I believe the majority is in error because the common carrier cases do not support the standard that it now applies to innkeepers. Furthermore, even if the majority's standard were appropriate, it has not been applied to a common carrier for acts outside the carrier's vessel in areas accessible to the public, such as Daly Seven's outside parking lot. For these reasons, I find our jurisprudence does not support the conclusion that Daly Seven had a duty to protect Taboada from Smith's attack. Therefore, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the circuit court's judgment as to Taboada's claims under Code \u00a7 35.1-28 and the common law.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-42\">\n      This order shall be published in the Virginia Reports and shall be certified to the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
