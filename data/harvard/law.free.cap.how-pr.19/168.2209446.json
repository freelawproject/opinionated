The barrels had been manufactured by the plaintiffs and sent out to Cuba, and there filled with molasses and brought back to this port. The collector claimed duty upon the barrels at the rate of 24 per centum upon their value, as well as upon the molasses contained in them. The plaintiffs objected to pay the duty on the barrels, claiming that they were \u201c the growth or manufacture of this country,\u201d and that they were returned \u201cin the same condition \u201d in which they were exported. The collector insisted that they were not returned \u201c in the same condition\u201d\u2014that they were sent out <em>empty </em>and brought \"backfilled\u2014and that their condition was thereby changed, and therefore refused to admit them to entry, duty free. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The plaintiffs thereupon paid the duty under protest and appealed from the decision of the collector to the secretary of the treasury. The collector\u2019s decision being affirmed by the secretary of the treasury, the plaintiffs, within the time prescribed by law, brought this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">It. appeared from the testimony, that the plaintiffs at the time of the entry, by way of proving that the barrels were American produce and manufacture, offered to the deputy collector a certificate of the American Consul at Cuba, to the effect that the barrels in question had been brought to that port in an American vessel and there filled with molasses, and that such barrels were not the product or manufacture of Cuba. The plaintiffs also offered to make the usual oath that the barrels were the growth and manufacture of this country, as prescribed by the act of congress, but that the deputy collector replied in substance that such oath and certificate were useless; that the barrels having been exported empty and brought back filled, their condition was thereby changed, and that they were for that reason dutiable; that- such was the decision of the secretary of the treasury, and that duty must therefore be paid, and at the same time handed to the plaintiffs a written direction from the treasury department to that effect.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-6\">I. T. Williams, <em>for the plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-7\">Judge Roosevelt <em>and </em>Mr. Hunt, <em>for the defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-8\">The district attorney contended that the oath being required by the act of congress, could not be waived by the collector; and for a stronger reason could not be waived by his deputy\u2014and that the omission was fatal to the plaintiffs' recovery.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-9\">The court, Smalley, D. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AM\"><em>held </em>that it was only in case that the collector conceded that the article was entitled to entry duty free, so as to leave only the fact of the Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>can character of the article to be established, that the oath could be material for any purpose, or could be required by the collector\u2014that when the collector denied free entry to the article on some ground that conceded its commercial character, the oath would be an idle ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The court further <em>held </em>that the collector was estopped to set up the omission to make the oath as a defence ; his deputy having given the plaintiffs to understand at the time that it was not necessary, and that the collector was bound by the acts of his deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Upon the question as to whether the barrels were returned \u201c in the same condition \u201d as when exported, the court <em>held </em>that the filling them with molasses did not change their condition within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The court thereupon charged the jury to inquire:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">1. Whether the barrels imported were the same identical barrels that had been manufactured by the plaintiffs and exported by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">2. Did the deputy collector give the plaintiffs to understand that the oath of identity was waived, and would not be required, and put his refusal to admit them to entry duty free upon grounds other than the want of such oath. That if they find both of these questions in the aErmative they would find for the plaintiffs the sum so paid as duty upon the barrels.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The jury, without leaving their seats, found a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
