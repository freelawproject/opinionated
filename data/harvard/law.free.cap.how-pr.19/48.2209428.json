I am not led to adopt such a conclusion from the affidavits in this case. On the contrary, I am inclined to think the transaction may come within some of the provisions contained in this statute, which makes the property liable to the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">I am not satisfied that any good reason exists for .dissolving the injunction upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">As to the objection that the receiver has not given sufficient security to take possession of all the property of the company, it is enough to say that such possession of this property is not sought at the present time. The parties interested may at any time apply to the court to have the security increased if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">But while I am of the opinion that the injunction should not be dissolved on this motion, I by no means agree with the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the proceedings may not be discontinued; on the contrary, the court may, on payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and costs, in the absence of any evidence to show that any other creditor has sought to avail himself of the benefits of this action, order the action to be discontinued and the receiver to be discharged.' Although by the proceedings in the action, the plaintiff obtains no priority over other creditors, yet if a voluntary payment is made, there is no ground for further proceeding against the company. The distribution among all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>creditors is only to be upon a final decree in the action (\u00a7 37), and if no final decree is made in consequence of the discontinuance of the action, the provision is inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The motion to dissolve the injunction is denied, with $10 costs, unless the defendants pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim and the costs of this action, in which case the same is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
