The warrant of commitment (which is under the band and seal of Justice Quackenbush, one of the police justices of this city) not only in due form recites the conviction of the prisoner on competent testimony, of being a vagrant, but proceeds to state and specify the facts, circumstances or conditions, which made or constituted the prisoner a vagrant, and on competent proof of which it must be assumed that the committing magistrate determined that the prisoner was a vagrant. The words of the commitment are: \u201cWhereas Catharine Forbes stands charged, and is on competent testimony made before me, lawfully convicted of being a <em>vagrant\u2014in this, to wit: That she is a common prostitute </em>and idle person, of which conviction a lawful record in due form has been made and filed, and it appearing to me for the <em>cause aforesaid </em>that she is a vagrant within the meaning of the statute, &amp;c.; I do adjudge and determine that she be committed,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The commitment then, on its face, presents this question: Did competent and satisfactory testimony that the prisoner was a common prostitute and idle person authorize her conviction and commitment as a vagrant ? There was no such common law offence or crime as vagrancy or idleness, or vagrancy and idleness. By certain statutes all persons coming within a certain description defined and declared by the statutes are declared to be vagrants, and provision is made for their trial, conviction and imprisonment. We have two such statutes. By the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S., </em>879, <em>5th ed.): \u201cJill idle persons, who not having any visible means to maintain themselves, live without employment; </em>all persons wandering abroad and lodging in taverns, groceries, beer-houses, out-houses, market places, sheds or barns, or in the open air, and not giving a good account of themselves ; all persons wandering abroad and begging, or who go about from door to door, or place themselves in the streets, highways or other public places to beg or receive alms, shall be deemed vagrants.\u201d Common prostitutes as such are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>named in this statute, and although they may be, and are, perhaps, most likely to be, or to become vagrants within the description of the statute, yet it is plain if a common prostitute is lawfully convicted of being a vagrant under this statute, she must be so convicted, not merely on her confession, or on competent testimony that she is a common prostitute or an idle person, or that she is both a common prostitute and an idle person. This statute does not declare common prostitutes as a class or by name to- be vagrants, nor does it declare all idle persons to be vagrants, but <em>only such idle persons as live without employment, and yet have no means to maintain themselves. </em>By an act passed Jan. 23, 1833, which from its title and provisions would appear to be confined in its operations to the city of New York, \u201call common prostitutes <em>who have no lawful employment whereby to maintain </em>themselves,\u201d are declared vagrants. It is presumed that the prisoner, Catharine Forbes, was arrested and convicted under this act; but by this act common prostitution is neither defined nor declared to be a crime. By the act a certain class or description of common prostitutes are declared to be vagrants. Every word which defines this class or makes a part of this description, is material and important.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The magistrate, in acting under the act, has no right to drop, or disregard one word of that description. He has no right, I think, to say or determine that a common prostitute is a vagrant within this act, merely because she is also idle or an idle person, without proof of any other fact or circumstance. To be a vagrant within the act, the common prostitute must be without any <em>lawful employment whereby to maintain herself. </em>These words imply, I think, something more than being idle, or in an idle condition; and probably something more even than habitual idleness. They imply, I think, a want of any lawful business, occupation or means whereby to maintain herself. It is plain that substantially the same words as used in the Revised Statutes in describ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ing the kind or class of idle persons declared to be vagrants, mean something more than mere idleness, otherwise the statutes would have declared all idle persons to be vagrants. The object of this act is not to punish common prostitution as a sin or moral evil, or to reform the individual, but to protect the public against the crimes, poverty, distress and public burdens, which experience has shown common prostitution causes or leads to.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">These statutes declaring a certain class or description of persons vagrants, and authorizing their conviction and punishment as such, as well as certain statutes declaring a certain class or description of persons to be disorderly persons, and authorizing their arrest as such, are in fact rather of the nature of police regulations to <em>prevent </em>crime and public burdens and charges, than of the nature of ordinary criminal laws prohibiting and punishing an act or acts as a crime or crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">If the condition of a person brings him within the description of either of the statutes declaring what persons shall be deemed vagrants, he may be convicted and imprisoned, whether such condition is his misfortune or his fault. His individual liberty must yield to the public necessity or public good; but nothing but public necessity or the public good can justify these statutes, and the summary conviction without a jury and in derogation of the common law authorized by them. They are constitutional, but they should be construed strictly, and executed carefully in favor of the liberty of the citizen. Their description of persons, or classes of persons, who shall be deemed vagrants, is necessarily vague and uncertain, giving to the magistrate in their execution an almost unchecked opportunity for arbitrary oppression or careless cruelty. The main object or purpose of the statute should be kept constantly in-view, and the magistrate should be careful and see, before convicting, that the person charged with being a vagrant is shown either by his or her confession, or by competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>testimony, to come exactly within the description of one of the statutes. (See <em>opinion of </em>Edmonds, <em>Circuit Judge, in the People </em>agt. Phillips, 1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>95, <em>and the authorities there cited; Morris </em>agt. <em>The People, id., </em>441.) In this case there is not the least ground for supposing that the committing magistrate\u2019s proceedings were not in good faith, and with the sole view of conscientiously discharging his duty. But no record of the conviction has been produced, and by an affidavit made in this matter, it appears probable that none has been filed in the office of the clerk of the court of sessions, as required by the act of 1853, and the act of April 10, 1855, amending it; and I can therefore only look to the warrant of commitment to see whether the prisoner was lawfully convicted of being a vagrant, or of any crime or offence. For the reasons above stated, I think the commitment on its face does not show that the prisoner was lawfully convicted of being a vagrant, or of any other offence or crime. No statute of this state has yet declared common prostitution or idleness to be a crime, and I think, for the reasons above stated, that the determination of the committing magistrate that proof that the prisoner was a common prostitute and idle person, authorized her conviction of being a vagrant, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The prisoner, therefore, must be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">It will not be necessary to examine the other question raised in this matter, to wit, whether the prisoner be discharged on the ground that no record of conviction has been filed, as required by the acts before referred to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
