Then, too, the acts of misconduct and abandonment set up in the complaint are, most of them, denied or explained by the defendant; and the principal allegations are explained by other parties who were witnesses to the transactions. Upon the whole, after a careful examination of the whole matter, I have come to the conblusion that there is too much doubt raised by the facts now presented, as to her right to ultimate relief, to-justify me in extending to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>plaintiff the relief she now asks, especially as it is clearly shown that the defendant\u2019s means are very small, and not sufficient to enable him to make an allowance to be of much avail to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Application denied; order to be entered in Westchester county.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
