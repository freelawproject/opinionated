At the trial, upon these facts appearing, the defendant asked that the action be dismissed, (see <em>act, </em>\u00a7 45,) which the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>refused. We hold this to be error, and therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The respondent now asks for leave to go to the court of appeals, that he may have our decision upon this question reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We have already permitted a case, involving this precise point, to be taken to that court, and as the question is mainly one of practice in justices\u2019 courts, under the provisions of the act referred to, not involving the merits of an action, and in that point of view cannot be said to assert any substantial right of a party, we do not feel disposed to multiply cases on the subject in the court of appeals. For this reason the application is refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
