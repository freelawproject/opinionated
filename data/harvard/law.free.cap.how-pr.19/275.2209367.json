That said defendants, by said statement and report, falsely and fraudulently induced this plaintiff to believe, and from such statement and report this plaintiff was-induced to believe, and did believe, that the capital of said bank was unimpaired, and its stock worth the par value thereof. Whereas, in truth and in fact, the capital of said bank was impaired at and on said 19 th day of June, and on July 14th, 1858, and its stock \u2022 only worth about thirty cents on the dollar of the par .value-thereof; and said bank bad suffered a depreciation and loss of over $100,000 of its capital stock, all of which said defendants well knew when they made the false and fraudulent report and statement aforesaid, and published the same as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">And this plaintiff alleges that said quarterly report and statement so made by said defendants, as president and cashier of said Mohawk Bank of Schenectady, was false in stating that there was due from banks to said Mohawk Bank of Schenectady, on said June 19, 1858, said sum of $129,389-\u00ed2q\u00b0q;, and said defendants, as such president and cashier, well knew the same to be false.

That said defendants did also in and by such report, falsely and fraudulently state that on said June 19, 1858, said Mohawk Bank of Schenectady was in a sound and healthy' condition, and its capital stock unimpaired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>And this plaintiff further alleges and charges that the said quarterly report and statement of the condition and resources of the said Mohawk Bank of Schenectady, was made with intent to deceive and defraud the holders and owners of the stock of said bank, and those who might become purchasers and owners thereof.

H. Rosekbans, <em>Justice, </em>after hearing Mr. Beach on the part of the defendants, and Mr. Sherwood on behalf of the plaintiff, upon demurrer to the complaint, judgment was ordered in favor of the defendants upon demurrer with costs : with leave to plaintiff to amend upon payment of $25 costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-13\">The following opinion was delivered upon this decision :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-14\">Rosekbans, Justice. It may be assumed (although the fact is not alleged in the complaint,) that the Mohawk Bank of Schenectady was a banking association, organized under the general act, and that the defendant Maxon was president, and the defendant Swits, cashier of the bank. It is averred that the defendants, as president and cashier pf said bank on the 14th day of July, 1858, made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>published a quarterly report of the condition of said bank, as it existed on the 19th day of June, 1858, in pursuance of the requirements of section 125, title 2, chapter 18 of part 1 of the Revised Statutes; that this report falsely set forth that there was due from banks to the Mohawk Bank of Schenectady, $129,380 ; that this statement was wholly false to the knowledge of defendants; that it was made with intent to deceive and defraud the holders and owners of the stock of said bank, <em>and those who might become the purchasers and owners of such stock; </em>that plaintiff, believing such statement true, and relying upon it, in September, 1858, purchased 36 shares of the stock of said bank at par value, (being $50 per share,) and that said stock was not worth over thirty cents on the dollar of its par value. The defendants demur to the complaint upon the ground, 1st. That it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and, 2d. That there is a defect of parties defendant\u2014in this, that the Mohawk Bank of Schenectady should be made a party defendant. The section of the statute under and in pursuance of which it is averred the defendants made and published the quarterly report referred to, only requires of the president and cashier of a bank that they shall verify by their oaths the quarterly reports of the bank. It contemplates that the report and verification, after the oath is made, shall be delivered to the bank. The bank to forward it to the superintendent of the bank department, <em>and the superintendent is required to publish the statement in a newspaper printed in the county, city or town where the bank is located. </em>(2 <em>R. S., 5th ed., </em>432-3, \u00a7 125.) The report is not made or published by the president or cashier, <em>pursuant to the act. </em>It is made <em>by the bank </em>to the superintendent, and the <em>publication is by the superintendent. </em>But, assuming that the president and cashier can properly be said to have made and published the report <em>pursuant to the act, </em>it is difficult to understand how they can be made liable to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tiff, as a subsequent purchaser of the stock of the bank <em>from a stockholder, </em>by reason of any false statement contained in the report. It is quite clear that the report is required to be made to the superintendent solely, to enable him to exercise the supervision over the bank and its affairs which is imposed upon him by law, and so enable him to determine what action he shall take to protect the rights of bill holders, stockholders, and those who may have dealings with the bank. (2 <em>R. S., 5th ed., </em>442,3, 4, \u00a7 125, 128, 131, 132 <em>and fol.) </em>The publication of the report by the superintendent is required to protect the rights of the same parties^ The provisions of the statute referred to, are \u201c regulations to prevent the insolvency of united corporations, and to secure the rights of their creditors and stockholders.\u201d They have no reference to those who have dealings with individual stockholders, but to those only who have dealings with the corporation. They are not designed to protect the rights of those who may purchase the stock of the bank of individual stockholders. The report is not made to them or for their benefit, nor is it designed to influence their action as purchasers of stock. They have, therefore, no right to rely upon it in their dealings with individual stockholders. If any fraud is committed by the bank or its officers, in making a false report, they alone, for whose benefit and protection the law is enacted, can avail themselves of the fraud. No intent to defraud, by the falsity of the report, or its publication, <em>pursuant to the statute, </em>can be alleged by any except a party whose rights were intended to be protected by the statute. A false statement made with intent to induce a party to act, and upon which he does act, and thereby sustains damage, will enable him to maintain an action. But the statement must, either in fact or contemplation of law, be made to the party who claims that he has been defrauded and brings the action, and it must be made <em>with a view of inducing him to act upon it.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>A special letter of recommendation of an insolvent, as worthy of credit, given by a party who has knowledge of the insolvency, with the intent to induce the party to whom it is addressed, to give credit to the insolvent, and in consequence of which such credit is given, will enable the party defrauded to maintain an action for the damages which he has sustained. And a general letter of recommendation of credit of an insolvent, and like knowledge, qnd an intent to defraud any one to whom it may be presented, and who may act upon it, will be sufficient to maintain an action by any one who has given credit to the insolvent upon the faith of the letter of credit, and has sustained damage therefrom. The law regards the letter as addressed to and intended to influence the action of every one who gives credit to the insolvent upon the faith of the letter. <em>(Zobinski </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>3 <em>Ken. R., </em>332; <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Addington, </em>11 <em>Wend. R., </em>474.) <em>But when upon the face of the false statement, or from the circumstances under which it is alleged to have been made, it is apparent that the intent was to defraud a particular party, or class of persons, and none other, no one except the person, or one of the class intended to be defrauded, can maintain an action for damages arising from the falsehood. </em>Under the circumstances assumed, all other persons are apprised that the statement is not to them, or designed to influence their conduct, and if the)r rely upon it they do it at their peril. It is the result of their own folly, and the absence of an intent to defraud the plaintiff being apparent from the nature of the statement, or circumstances under which it was made, as <em>alleged in the complaint, </em>the pleading would be demurrable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">In this case, the complaint was that the making verification and publication of the quarterly report was in pursuance of the requirements of section 125 of title 2, chap. 18, part 1, of the Revised Statutes. At the time the report was made and published, the plaintiff was neither creditor, bill-holder or stockholder of the bank. The char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>acter of the quarterly report, and the circumstances under which it was made, <em>as alleged in the complaint, </em>shows that it was not made to him, or for his benefit, or to induce him to act upon it. They negative the averment that the report was made with intent to deceive and defraud those who might thereafter become purchasers of the stock of the bank of individual stockholders. The plaintiff is not, therefore, entitled to maintain his action. <em>(Easigi </em>agt. <em>Mann, </em>17 <em>How. U. S. R., </em>189,199.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">The case is clearly distinguishable from those in which corporations and their officers and agents have published false statements in prospectuses or otherwise, to induce parties to enter into engagements with such corporations, and in which they have been defrauded. Such statements are regarded in law as addressed to and intended to influence the conduct of all who may deal with the corporations, on the faith of the statements put forth, and for the damages which result therefrom, the corporation and its officers are bound to respond. <em>(Moffat </em>agt. <em>Winslow, </em>7 <em>Paige R., </em>124; <em>Gerhard </em>agt. <em>Bates, </em>20 <em>E.

I do not understand that it is at all necessary to the right of action that the representations should have been intended for the party sustaining the loss, or in any way addressed to him. If it be made openly and publicly, so that it might well come to his ears, and if it does come to his ears, and <em>he acts upon it, </em>the party making it shall answer to him for the damages. He shall not be at liberty to sow falsehood broad-cast, without being responsible for the loss it causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">A very late decision of the House of Lords was had in this case: \u2022 The chairman of a mining company by falsely representing to the stock exchange that two-thirds of the shares had been taken and paid up, procured the stock to be entered on the official list.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">A stranger seeing the stock so entered, and knowing the rule that no such stock was entered unless so paid up; and believing the fact to be in accordance with the representations, bought some of the stock on the exchange. <em>It was held </em>(affirming the judgment of the exchequer chamber,) that the purchaser had a right of action against the <em>directors, </em>for the fraudulent representations. <em>(Law Reports July, </em>1859, <em>XXI, p. </em>160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In the case before us, it is averred that the president and cashier of the bank, (leaving out the <em>oath </em>to their statement as mere surplusage,) made and published a statement of the condition of the bank, on a given day, which statement was to their knowledge grossly false, giving the particular item which was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The complaint adds that this statement was made and published \u201c in pursuance \u201d of certain statute enactments. If in other respects this averment came up to the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ciple I have stated, I consider it of no sort of consequence what the provisions of the statute were, or whether or not there were any statute on the subject; all that is required is the falsity of that statement, (known to the makers of it,) provided the statement be <em>so made </em>that it came properly to the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and <em>he relying upon it </em>sustained damage thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">That, in fact, it was made to a public officer, and in a way to ensure its publication in a conspicuous and official manner, may well be grounds for holding that it was intended to deceive the <em>public; </em>but I do not see that <em>therefore </em>the defendants are any the less guilty of fraudulent misrepresentations. Nor does it seem to me of any consequence that the <em>statute </em>referred to had for its object something entirely different from protecting the plaintiff or the public against the kind of injury which the plaintiff has sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The falsehoods may have been <em>made </em>for <em>one </em>purpose, and published for that; but <em>being </em>published, the public or any individual of the public has a right to <em>believe it. </em>It must have been the intention of the persons publishing it that it should be believed. And if believing it any one of the public acts on that belief, the makers and publishers of this falsehood are to be held liable for the consequences <em>they have caused.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">It seems to me refining too technically to .say that the defendants made the report to <em>the bank, </em>and the bank to the superintendent, and the superintendent published it. Granting that true, the <em>bank </em>did not <em>tell the falsehood, &amp;c.; </em>the persons who did, knew and intended the use to which this falsehood was to be, and was put. It is but one remove further off in the regular and usual chain by which the completed act was done. At any rate, the <em>complaint charges </em>that the defendants made and published the statement, and the case comes here on demurrer <em>conceding </em>that they <em>did so.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The averment of <em>intent </em>in the complaint is \u201c with intent to deceive and defraud <em>those who might become purchasers </em>and owners of the stock.\u201d This certainly is not so general as that the intent was to deceive and defraud the public. And <em>yet, </em>under the decision I have cited, a mere <em>stranger </em>to the making of the representations could have alleged <em>no other intent </em>than to deceive the public, and himself as one of the public. I should hold under our Code that the intent was sufficiently averred to authorize a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It seems to me that the ruling of the learned judge who gave the special term decision, (whose opinions are always entitled to great respect,) is not according to the present views of our courts, and I shall be in favor of reversing his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Hogeboom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Wright, J., being in court of appeals, gave no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Note.\u2014It has been settled in all the courts of England and of this country, that the officers and directors of a company making false statements or representations . which they know to be false, that become public, as to the organization, capital or condition of the corporation, are liable to any stranger coming to a knowledge of such false statements or representations, and suffering loss or damage by purchasing stock or dealing with the corporation <em>on the faith of such statements or representations.
