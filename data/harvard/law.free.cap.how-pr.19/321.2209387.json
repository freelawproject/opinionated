The plaintiff succeeded on one cause of action against the defendant, Edward D. James, and failed against him as to the other, and failed entirely as against the defendant, Sarah F. James. The recovery on the cause of action as to which the plaintiff succeeded was less than fifty dollars. Judgment ivas entered by the clerk in favor of the plaintiff, for his costs against the defendant Edward D. James, and he declined to allow costs to the defendant Sarah F. James.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In this, he acted correctly. The rule as to costs in such cases is prescribed by \u00a7 61 of the Code, and not by the general provisions of law applicable to costs. It is by that section, expressly provided that \u201c if judgment in the supreme court be for the plaintiff, he shall recover costs, and if it be for the defendant, he shall recover costs, except that upon a verdict he shall pay costs to the plaintiff, unless the judge certify that the title to real property came in question on the trial.\u201d In this case there was a verdict, and no such certificate was given by the judge. The clerk therefore was authorized to allow costs to the plaintiff, not only against the defendant Edward D. James, but against the other defendant also. <em>(See Howard\u2019s Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 55 <em>to </em>61, <em>and </em>\u00a7 68.) There is consequently no ground of complaint, and the adjustment of costs, as made by the clerk, is sustained, and the defendant\u2019s motion is denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
