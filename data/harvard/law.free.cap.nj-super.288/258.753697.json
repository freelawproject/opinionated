Jones, Individually and as Administratrix Ad Prosequendum of the Estate of Clayton C. Jones, appeals the dismissal of her complaint seeking damages attributable to the death of her husband as a result of colon cancer allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos. As of the date of trial, plaintiff\u2019s claims against all other named defendants had been dismissed voluntarily or as a result of orders granting summary judgment, or had been settled. The only defendant remaining in the case was defendant Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation (Owens or defendant), a manufacturer of asbestos products.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>After the jury was selected, but prior to opening statements, defendant requested a hearing pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 to determine the admissibility and adequacy of plaintiffs expert testimony, which plaintiff planned to introduce at trial through a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition taken six days prior to trial. Defendant also moved for summary judgment contending that plaintiffs medical proof of the cause of decedent\u2019s colon cancer was inadequate and that without medical evidence of causation, defendant was entitled to a dismissal of plaintiffs complaint. The trial judge reviewed the expert\u2019s report, the transcript of the expert\u2019s deposition testimony, and medical journals submitted in support of the medical opinion of plaintiffs expert. The judge allowed oral argument but concluded that an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing would be unnecessary. The judge found that the proposed expert evidence was insufficient to support plaintiffs claim and granted summary judgment to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We have considered the same information utilized by the trial judge and have compared that material to the standards enunciated in <em>Landrigan v. Celotex Corp., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>404, 605 A.2d 1079 (1992), and <em>Grassis v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>446, 591 A.2d 671 (1991). We conclude that plaintiffs proposed medical evidence was sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. We reverse and remand this matter for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Decedent died on November 22,1987, at the age of seventy, as a result of colon cancer that had spread to his lungs. He had been employed by E.I, DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company, Inc., for over thirty years as a laborer and truck driver. As one of his job functions, decedent had been required to \u201cload asbestos debris and also to bury asbestos waste,\u201d as a result of which he was \u201cexposed to asbestos dust pollution.\u201d During argument at the motion hearing on November 29, 1994, plaintiffs attorney asserted that he was prepared to submit evidence that Jones\u2019 \u201cexposure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>asbestos was extremely heavy for approximately thirty plus years of occupational employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In 1969 or 1971, Jones underwent a partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy to correct medical problems related to \u201cpeptic ulcer disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In 1974, at the age of fifty-seven, Jones was diagnosed as having pulmonary asbestosis. At that time, he discontinued his years-long habit of smoking three to four cigarettes per day. He did not consume alcoholic beverages. His family medical history indicated that his mother and father had died of \u201cnatural causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In May 1985, Jones was diagnosed with \u201ccarcinoma of the cecum\u201d or cancer of the colon. By August 1987, the cancer had spread to his lungs and brain, and he died a few months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Plaintiffs only expert witness was Dr. Howard Frumkin, a licensed physician specializing in occupational medicine, who has also received a doctoral degree in epidemiology. In 1988, Frumkin collaborated with Dr. Jesse Berlin and published an article entitled \u201cAsbestos Exposure and Gastrointestinal Malignancy Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d in the <em>American Journal of Industrial Medicine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The article reflected Frumkin\u2019s research into, <em>inter alia, </em>colon cancer causation by way of a \u201cmeta-analysis,\u201d that is, by way of \u201ca study that analyzes the results of other studies in a systematic manner.\u201d As a result of his research and meta-analysis, Frumkin concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">when all of the studies were combined systematically and when attention was confined to the studies with substantial asbestos exposure and to the studies that took account of latency, there was an increase in the rate of colorectal cancer related to asbestos exposure, compared to what was expected in the general population.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">At his <em>de bene esse </em>deposition, Frumkin testified that he had reviewed Jones\u2019 medical records dating from 1985 forward, many of which were hospital records. Frumkin had also reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Jones\u2019 medical records from a Dr. Charles A. Egoville, dating from 1982, as well as \u201cradiology reports from over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Based on his review of those records, Frumkin opined on direct examination that, \u201c[assuming that Mr. Jones was heavily exposed to asbestos, as described in your previous question, I believe that his asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor in the development of his colon cancer.\u201d Frumkin also testified that based on his meta-analysis, the \u201cSMR, the Standardized Mortality Ratio, was 1.61, representing a 61 percent increase in the risk of colorectal cancer mortality \u2014 61 percent increase\u00ae chance of dying from cancer of the colon or rectum following substantial asbestos exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">When asked about other risk factors that increased a person\u2019s chances of developing colon cancer, Frumkin testified that \u201c\u00aeietary factors,\u201d such as a \u201chigh fat diet, a diet high in red meat, a diet low in fiber, these are risk factors for colon cancer also.\u201d Frumkin also identified \u201cgenetic factors,\u201d \u201crare diseases,\u201d and a \u201csedentary lifestyle without much exercise\u201d as additional \u201crisk factors for colon cancer.\u201d Moreover, Frumkin testified that, \u201c[i]f somebody has more than one risk factor, then the risk [of developing colon cancer] would be even greater than if a person had only one risk factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">When Frumkin was asked whether he would change his opinion that asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor to the development of Jones\u2019 colon cancer if he learned that there were other risk factors present, Frumkin replied that he would not. Frumkin explained that, \u201c[i]f Mr. Jones had other risk factors for colon cancer \u2014 and he very likely did, being an American and eating the same kind of diet that we all do \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t change the fact that his asbestos exposure posed a risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">On cross-examination, Frumkin testified that he had not diagnosed Jones\u2019 cancer or provided any medical treatment to Jones. The focus thereafter turned to cancer causation, whereupon defendant\u2019s counsel inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>[Owens]: Okay. And you stated on your direct examination that all exposures contribute to the cumulative risk of developing colon cancer from asbestos exposure. Did I paraphrase that fair, fairly enough?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">[Frumkin]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">[Owens]: Okay. But what you didn\u2019t say, did you \u2014 I don\u2019t think I heard you say that all exposures somehow contribute to actually cause the colon cancer. Am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">[Frumkin]: The best way to try to explain that thought is that what we know from the epidemiologic data is that a large cumulative exposure to asbestos increases a person\u2019s risk of getting colon cancer. It\u2019s impossible to say that this exposure or that exposure was worse. All of the exposures taken together, in the aggregate, are what put a person into a higher risk category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">[Owens]: I understand that your answer relates to risk, but my question has to do with cause. Not all of the asbestos that was breathed in by Mr. Jones combined to cause his colon cancer, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">[Frumkin]: Well, I haven\u2019t used the word \u201ccause.\u201d The words that I\u2019ve used have been to substantially contribute to the development of his cancer. I\u2019m avoiding the word \u201ccause\u201d because many things together, diet, and other factors, combine to cause a case of cancer. Cause is a complicated word when you think about it. I do think that the sum total of all of the asbestos that he inhaled put him into a category where the asbestos contributed to the development of his cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">[Owens]: But you agree with me that not all exposures combined to cause him his colon cancer, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">[Frumkin]: No, I think the best way to state my thought is that all of the exposures taken together created his increased risk of colon cancer and contributed to the development of his colon cancer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Subsequently, defendant\u2019s counsel asked Frumkin whether the primary risk factor for colon cancer was a person\u2019s diet. Frumkin testified that diet was the risk factor about which most was known and \u201cseems to be the risk factor associated with the greatest variability in colon cancer.\u201d When then asked what information Frumkin had been provided about Jones\u2019 dietary habits, he replied that he had received \u201c[n]one.\u201d Additionally, when asked whether Jones\u2019 elevated cholesterol level was consistent with a \u201chigh-fat diet,\u201d Frumkin replied that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">In deciding Owens\u2019 motion, the judge first determined that Frumkin had failed to consider other possible causes of Jones\u2019 cancer, such as family history, diet, alcohol consumption, and \u201cprior bowel diseases.\u201d The judge then noted that Frumkin had not expressly stated that asbestos exposure had caused Jones\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>cancer, but had only opined that Jones\u2019 asbestos exposure had substantially contributed to the development of his colon cancer. Finally, the judge determined that Frumkin had failed to \u201cquantify\u201d the substantial contribution that Jones\u2019 asbestos exposure or other possible causes had made to the development of Jones\u2019 colon cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The trial judge concluded that Frumkin\u2019s expert opinion would be excluded. Defendant was therefore granted summary judgment. We conclude that the trial judge erred in reaching its three conclusions, and also in finding that Frumkin\u2019s testimony would not aid the jurors, but rather would confuse them.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 provides: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Frumkin\u2019s qualifications were not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The 1991 Supreme Court Committee Comment notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">Rule 702 follows Fed.R.Evil. 702 verbatim....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">This rule intends to incorporate New Jersey case law establishing the general criteria for admissibility of expert testimony articulated by <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 208 [478 A.2d 364] (1984). As restated by <em>Landrigan v. The Celotex Corporation, </em>127 N.J. 404, 413 [605 A.2d 1079] (1992), these criteria include the requirements that \u201c(1) the intended testimony must concern a subject matter that is beyond the ken of the average juror; (2) the field testified to must be at a state of the art such that an expert\u2019s testimony could be sufficiently reliable; and (3) the witness must have sufficient expertise to offer the intended testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">LBiunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>1991 Supreme Court Comment Committee comment on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Epidemiologic studies, that is, \u201cthe studies of disease occurrence in human populations,\u201d have been found to be evidential and scientifically reliable in toxic tort litigation. <em>Landrigan, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 605 A.2d 1079. Frumkin is both a physician and an epidemiologist, as was the expert in <em>Grassis. </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 451, 591 A.2d 671. As in <em>Grassis, </em>Frumkin did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>not examine plaintiffs decedent prior to his death, but was provided with decedent\u2019s medical records, which contained substantial information pertinent to decedent\u2019s lifestyle essential to epidemiological evaluation. As noted in <em>Landrigan, </em>\u201cepidemiologists, like experts generally, must be able to identify the factual bases for their conclusions, explain their methodology, and demonstrate that both the factual bases and the methodology are scientifically reliable.\u201d 127 <em>N.J. </em>at 417, 605 A.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">A review of decedent\u2019s medical records reveals the following facts: (1) Jones had undergone abdominal surgery in 1969 or 1971 to correct complications arising from a peptic ulcer; (2) Jones\u2019 parents had died as a result of \u201cnatural causes,\u201d their deaths thus not being explicitly attributed to colon cancer; (3) Jones did not consume alcoholic beverages; and (4) Jones\u2019 years-long habit of smoking three to four cigarettes per day ended in 1974. Although Frumkin admitted that he was not supplied any information concerning decedent\u2019s diet, he presumed that decedent\u2019s diet was a risk factor which he would be required to consider. He also admitted on cross-examination that decedent\u2019s elevated cholesterol level was consistent with a \u201chigh-fat diet.\u201d Frumkin clearly factored into his opinion deleterious aspects of decedent\u2019s diet, yet he was able to conclude that decedent\u2019s asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor to the development of colon cancer. Thus, the judge was incorrect when he determined that Frumkin failed to consider information about Jones\u2019 family and personal medical history and his level of alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The trial judge predicated his decision, in part, on the fact that Frumkin had not expressly stated that asbestos exposure had caused decedent\u2019s colon cancer. However, an expert is not required to phrase his conclusion in such a simplistic fashion. In <em>Grassis, </em>we observed that the trial court\u2019s opinion appeared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQDO\">to be predicated upon a notion that there was but a single cause of the particular cancer condition. There is no requirement in the law that a single cause be found and proven. All that is required is that the plaintiff show that a defendant\u2019s conduct or defective product was a proximate cause of the condition, i.e., a <em>substantial factor in bringing the condition about. </em>... Apparently, the \u201cmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>likely than not\u201d or 51% standard has in this and its companion cases been thought of as applying to asbestos exposure as the single cause of the disease, rather than to the proof of a significant factor in bringing about the disease. We do not tell a jury that a significant factor must be one that is 5%, 15%, 30% or 40%; we merely tell a jury that it must be \u201csignificant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">[248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457, 591 A.2d 671 (emphasis added) (citations and a footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Furthermore, the trial judge here did not follow our admonition in <em>Grassis </em>rejecting a 2.0 relative-risk factor as a \u201cthreshold\u201d to the admission of epidemiological evidence. Additionally, the judge did not heed to the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of relative risk factors in <em>Landrigan, </em>in which Justice Pollock noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">Counsel acknowledged that under certain circumstances a study with a relative risk of less than 2.0 could support a finding of specific causation. Those circumstances would include, for example, individual clinical data, such as asbestos in or near the tumor or a documented history of extensive asbestos exposure. So viewed, a relative risk of 2.0 is not so much a password to a finding of causation as one piece of evidence, among others, for the court to consider in determining whether the expert has employed a sound methodology in reaching his or her conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">[127 <em>N.J. </em>at 419, 605 A.2d 1079.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Frumkin\u2019s opinion clearly \u201cquantified\u201d the substantial contribution that decedent\u2019s exposure to asbestos made to the development of his colon cancer. Frumkin opined that his statistical meta-analysis revealed that persons subjected to substantial asbestos exposure fell under a Standardized Mortality Ratio of 1.61, \u201crepresenting a 61 percent increase in the risk of colorectal cancer mortality \u2014 a 61 percent inerease[d] chance of dying from cancer of the colon or rectum following substantial asbestos exposure.\u201d Frumkin testified that this increased risk was \u201cstatistically significant,\u201d and he stated that asbestos exposure remained a significant factor even when other risk factors, e.g., diet, genetic factors, rare diseases, and sedentary lifestyle, are taken into consideration. Frumkin then related Jones\u2019 asbestos exposure to other cancer-causation risk factors and testified that Jones\u2019 exposure \u201calso posed a risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">We also note that the trial judge did not conclude that Frumkin\u2019s opinion had been based on an unsound methodology or on a methodology that is unsupported by some consensus of experts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the field. <em>See Landrigan, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 420-21, 605 A.2d 1079; <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chem. Corp., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>421, 449-50, 593 A.2d 733 (1991). On remand, before admitting Frumkin\u2019s testimony, the court may wish to revisit the question of appropriate methodology particularly in light of Frumkin\u2019s acknowledgment in his deposition that his meta-analysis conclusion is not \u201cuniversally shared\u201d in the medical community. Universal acceptance of a particular methodology is not required before scientific opinion is admitted, yet the opinion must have the support of a consensus of experts in the field. <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 449-50, 593 A.2d 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In sum, the decision to grant summary judgment was premised on criteria that are not required and the judge failed to consider that plaintiffs expert was fully apprised of decedent\u2019s medical history and had factored into his conclusion a presumption of an adverse diet. Under the circumstances, it was error to grant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
