Defendant had taken the child to Morocco, where the parties had resided before coming to the United States, pursuant to a separation agreement which granted her sole physical custody and permitted her to take up residence with the child in another country. We hold that the Family Part lacked subject matter jurisdiction and, in any event, should have deferred to the divorce and custody proceedings that had already commenced in Morocco.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff holds both American and French citizenship. Defendant is a citizen of Morocco. The parties were married pursuant to Islamic law by a Moroccan court in 1992. Following their marriage, the couple moved to France where their daughter Lina was born in 1993. In the latter part of 1993, the parties moved to Morocco. When their business plans failed, the couple emigrated to New Jersey, where plaintiffs parents operated a restaurant. While residing in New Jersey, the parties\u2019 marital relationship deteriorated, causing plaintiff to leave the family residence and move into his parents\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">On February 22, 1995, the parties entered into a separation agreement under which they retained joint legal custody, but physical custody was granted to defendant. The agreement provided that defendant and Lina could take up residence in another country so long as defendant abided with the provisions of the agreement. Plaintiff was given twelve weeks of visitation with the child each year in the country where he resided, but was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to pay all travel expenses incurred in connection with that visitation. The period of visitation was to be determined by plaintiff. In turn, plaintiff was required to pay child support in the weekly amount of $125 until Lina\u2019s emancipation. The agreement granted defendant permission to obtain a divorce pursuant to Islamic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In the event of a breach of the agreement, the non-breaching party was required to provide the defaulting party with written notice of the breach by certified mail and allow thirty days to cure the breach. The agreement, which was to be interpreted according to the principles of New Jersey law, was to be incorporated into any divorce judgment obtained by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Within a week of the execution of the agreement, Lina was sent to live with defendant\u2019s parents in Morocco. Defendant herself moved to Morocco in April 1995. Sometime between April 27 and May 3, 1995, defendant filed a petition for divorce and custody in the Primary Court of Rabat. Plaintiff was served with the summons and complaint and was ordered to appear before the Primary Court on October 16, 1995 for a hearing on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Plaintiff filed a complaint in the Family Part on May 2, 1995, in which he sought a judgment of divorce, equitable distribution, sole custody of Lina, and child support. Defendant was served with the summons and complaint on August 8, 1995, and filed a motion to dismiss several days later. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Although the Family Part judge\u2019s oral opinion is not a paragon of clarity, he apparently found that the New Jersey courts had subject matter jurisdiction and that New Jersey constituted Lina\u2019s \u201chome state.\u201d The judge seemingly determined that defendant had wrongfully removed Lina from New Jersey to Morocco. We derive that interpretation from the judge\u2019s allusion to defendant\u2019s holding the New Jersey courts \u201chostage.\u201d In any event, the judge scheduled a hearing to determine the child\u2019s best interests, ordered defendant to return Lina to the United States within a week, and awarded plaintiff sole custody of the child pending disposition of the issues. In addition, the judge re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>strained defendant from proceeding with her petition for custody in Morocco.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Defendant filed a motion for leave to appeal. We granted a temporary stay pending disposition of the motion and requested the Family Part judge to supplement his oral opinion with a written statement of reasons. In his supplemental opinion, the judge acknowledged that the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-28 to -52) (UCCJA) was not applicable. The judge also noted that the Hague Convention was not applicable because Morocco is not a signatory to the treaty. The judge nevertheless determined that New Jersey was Lina\u2019s home state based upon the length of time she had resided here. The judge also found that defendant had removed Lina from New Jersey by \u201csubterfuge\u201d and that the provision in the separation agreement allowing defendant to take up residence in another country with Lina was not applicable because defendant had breached the agreement by refusing to permit plaintiff to exercise his right of visitation. We granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal following receipt of the Family Part judge\u2019s supplemental opinion. We also continued our stay of the Family Part\u2019s order pending disposition of the appeal, which has been accelerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Initially, we find no basis in the record for the Family Part judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant wrongfully removed Lina from New Jersey to Morocco. The separation agreement clearly contemplated that defendant would leave the United States with Lina and take up residence in another country. This is not a matter of interpretation. The agreement expressly granted defendant permission to take this course.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">So too, the record is barren of anything supporting the judge\u2019s finding that defendant breached the agreement by denying plaintiffs right of visitation. Although plaintiff in his affidavit which accompanied his complaint alleged in conclusory fashion that he had not been permitted to visit Lina, it is undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>he never made any support payments as required by the <em>agreement. </em>He also neither tendered nor offered to tender travel expenses, a precondition to his right of visitation, until April 17, 1995. Moreover, plaintiff never gave written notice of the alleged breach which would have triggered the opportunity to cure the alleged default within thirty days. It is true that on April 17, 1995, plaintiffs lawyer represented in a letter to defendant\u2019s attorney that plaintiff was willing to travel to Rabat to pick up the child and exercise his right of visitation. However, defendant was reluctant to accept this arrangement because of problems involving Lina\u2019s passport and her fear that the child would not be returned. In any event, assuming that defendant\u2019s refusal to accede to plaintiffs demand constituted a breach of the agreement, this default occurred long after the child had been lawfully removed from the United States to Morocco. Moreover, plaintiff filed his complaint sixteen days after his attorney\u2019s demand, a clear violation of the provision in the separation agreement allowing the defaulting party an opportunity to cure within thirty days. Of course, once plaintiff filed his complaint seeking custody in derogation of the express terms of the agreement, defendant\u2019s fear that plaintiff would not return the child if visitation were permitted became a concrete reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">This is not a case in which a child was spirited away from his or her custodial parent. The judge\u2019s finding to the contrary is clearly a mistaken one and is so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand our intervention and correction. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146,162,199 A.2d 809 (1964). The judge went so wide of the mark that a mistake must have been made. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Family Part judge\u2019s determination that the New Jersey courts had subject matter jurisdiction was less than precise. We thus examine possible sources of jurisdictional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>A. <em>State Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We agree with the judge\u2019s determination that the UCCJA is not applicable to this case. The UCCJA was formulated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s failure to delineate in detail the extent to which the Full Faith and Credit Clause, <em>U.S. Const. </em>art. IV, \u00a7 1, requires states to honor the child custody decrees of other states. <em>E.E.B. v. D.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>595, 602-03, 446 A.2d 871 (1982), cert. <em>denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>1210, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1203, 75 L.Ed.2d 445 (1983); <em>see generally Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15, 24-25, 459 A.2d 628 (1983); <em>Borys v. Borys, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>103, 109-18, 386 A.2d 366 (1978). In line with the vast majority of states, New Jersey enacted its version of the UCCJA in 1979. L.1979, c. 124, \u00a7 1. According to the legislative findings, the articulated objectives of the statute were to avoid jurisdictional conflict between the courts of different states in child custody matters, discourage protracted child custody controversies in the interest of promoting a stable environment for the child, deter child abductions, ensure that a particular custody dispute is decided in the state \u201cwith which the child and his family have the closest connection,\u201d and \u201c[fjacilitate the enforcement of custody decrees of other states\u201d here in New Jersey. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The focus of the UCCJA is thus on the relationship between the states. Significantly, a \u201cstate\u201d is defined as \u201cany state, territory, or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-30j. Notable in its absence from this definition is any reference to a foreign country. Nevertheless, the UCCJA contains one provision dealing with international custody disputes. Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-51 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">The general policies of this act extend to the international area. The provisions of this act relating to the recognition and enforcement of custody decrees of other states apply to custody decrees and decrees involving legal institutions similar in nature and to custody rendered by appropriate authorities of other nations, if reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard were given to all affected persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>In a series of decisions, New Jersey courts have construed this section as conferring jurisdiction only where the court is asked to recognize and enforce a custody decree entered by the authorities of a foreign country. <em>See Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 533, 548 A.2d 195 (App.Div.1988); <em>Loos v. Manuel, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 621, 651 A.2d 1077 (Ch.Div.1994); <em>Roszkowski v. Roszkowska, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 629, 644 A.2d 1150 (Ch.Div.1993). The Chancery Division\u2019s decision in <em>Ali v. Ali, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154 (Ch.Div. 1994), is not to the contrary. That case also involved a party\u2019s attempt to enforce a custody decree entered in a foreign territory. <em>Id. </em>at 158. To the extent that the <em>Ali </em>decision can be read as asserting original jurisdiction over a custody dispute involving a child residing in another country, it is plainly inconsistent with Justice (then Judge) Coleman\u2019s opinion in <em>Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 548 A.2d 195, that \u201c[t]he UCCJA only applies to an international child custody case when the State is asked to recognize and enforce decrees of foreign countries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 548 A.2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>Schmidt </em>and its progeny distinguish between the exercise of original jurisdiction in a child custody dispute and the enforcement of foreign decrees. This distinction permeates the UCCJA Our Supreme Court commented upon the distinction in <em>Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15, 459 A.2d 628. There, the Court noted that \u201c[t]wo main threads run through the [UCCJA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 459 A.2d 628. \u201cThe first bears upon when a state should exercise original jurisdiction in a custody proceeding, that is, when no other state is in the midst of custody proceedings or has made a custody award after such proceedings.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe second significant statutory strand relates to enforcement and modification of a custody decree \u00f3f another state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 459 A.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Legal commentators have also discussed this distinction. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brigitte M. Bodenheimer, <em>The Rights of Children and the Crisis in Custody Litigation: Modification of Custody In and Out of State, </em>46 <em>U.Colo.L.Rev. </em>495, 501 (1975); Julia R. Rutherford, Note, <em>Removing the Tactical Advantages of International </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Parental Child, Abductions Under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, </em>8 <em>Ariz.J.Int\u2019l &amp; Comp.Law </em>149, 152 (1991). This limitation has been described in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">while the UCCJA is reciprocal among those states and territories of the United States which have enacted it; it is not reciprocal between the United States and any other country. While Section 23 of the UCCJA makes it applicable to the international arena, the UCCJA does not contain language providing for judicial reciprocity. Thus, the UCCJA only recognizes and enforces foreign and domestic custody decrees within the United States and its territories. A state court in the United States, under the UCCJA, may enforce custody or visitation rights ordered by a foreign court against a United States citizen but it cannot order a citizen of another country to return a child to the United States.... In international child custody disputes, United States courts should favor ICARA [International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11601-11610] over the UCCJA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">[Rutherford, Note, <em>Removing the Tactical Advantages of International Parental Child Abductions Under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, </em>8 <em>Ariz.J.Int\u2019l &amp; Comp.Law </em>at 152.]</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We do not suggest that this view is universal. Our examination of the decisions of other jurisdictions discloses that the issue has received uneven treatment. <em>Compare In re Stephanie M., </em>7 <em>Cal.4th </em>295, 27 <em>Cal.Rptr</em>.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706, <em>cert. denied sub nom.

Black, </em>441 <em>Pa.Super. </em>358, 657 A.2d 964, <em>app. denied, </em>668 A.2d 1119 (Pa.1995) (applying UCCJA to international child custody disputes and construing the definition of \u201cState\u201d to encompass foreign nations) <em>with Koons v. Koons, </em>161 Misc.2d 842, 615 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>563, 567 (Sup.1994); <em>Klien v. Klien, </em>141 <em>Misc.2d </em>174, 533 N.Y.S.2d 211, 214 (Sup.1988) (holding that UCCJA applies to international disputes but that foreign countries are not \u201cstates\u201d for purposes of the statute). We perceive no need to revisit the area in the context of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>presented here. We adhere to our opinion in <em>Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 548 A.2d 195. The UCCJA is thus inapplicable because this case involves the assertion of original jurisdiction over a custody dispute involving a child who resides in a foreign country.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We have examined other New Jersey statutes as well. N.J.S.A 2A:34-23 authorizes the Family Part to resolve questions relating to alimony, maintenance and the \u201ccare, custody, education and maintenance of ... children.\u201d We do not construe this general grant of power as conferring original jurisdiction in international custody disputes. <em>But see Macek v. Friedman, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>614, 618, 573 A.2d 996 (App.Div.1990). To do so would render nugatory most of the provisions of the UCCJA. We are convinced that N.J.S.A 2A:34-23 simply authorizes the courts to enter various orders in matrimonial actions where subject matter jurisdiction otherwise exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We are also satisfied that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-2 does not confer jurisdiction. This statute prohibits the removal of children of divorced or separated parents from New Jersey without the consent of both parents unless by court order. <em>See Holder v. Polanski, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>344, 544 A.2d 852 (1988); <em>Cooper v. Cooper, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>42, 491 A.2d 606 (1984); <em>Cerminara v. Cerminara, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448, 669 A.2d 837 (App.Div.1996). As noted above, plaintiff effectively consented to the removal of Lina from New Jersey under the separation agreement, and, in any event, this section is inapplicable because it covers only children who are \u201cnatives of this State, or have resided five years within its limits....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">B. <em>Federal Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention) was ratified by the United States on April 29, 1988. Later that same year, Congress passed the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11601 to 11610, which provided a set of procedures designed to implement the treaty. <em>See generally Duquette v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Tahan, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 556, 600 A.2d 472 (App.Div.1991). The ICARA confers concurrent jurisdiction of all \u201cactions arising under the Convention\u201d on the federal district courts and the courts of the states. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11603(a). Four jurisdictional requisites must be satisfied to invoke the Hague Convention. First, the nations involved must be signatories to the Hague Convention. <em>Roszkowski v. Roszkowska, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 633, 644 A.2d 1150. Second, \u201cthe party petitioning the court must demonstrate that the child involved was \u2018habitually resident in a Contracting State [i.e., one which is a signatory to the Convention] immediately before any breach of <em>custody----Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Hague Convention </em>art. 4). Third, the child must be under the age of sixteen. <em>Id. </em>at 634, 644 A.2d 1150 (citing <em>Hague Convention </em>art. 4). Fourth, the removal to or retention of the child in a country other than the child\u2019s habitual residence must have been wrongful. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 644 A.2d 1150 (citing <em>Hague Convention </em>art. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Plaintiff has failed to meet the first, second, and fourth requirements for invocation of the Hague Convention. First, Morocco is not a signatory to the Convention. Second, plaintiff did not have custody rights in the child prior to her removal from the United States, but merely visitation rights. \u201c[T]he Convention does not mandate the return of children to the noncustodial parent for the purpose of visitation.\u201d <em>Viragh v. Foldes, </em>415 <em>Mass. </em>96, 612 N.E.2d 241, 246 (1993). Although plaintiff and defendant have joint legal custody under the separation agreement, the right to custody as contemplated by the Convention consists of \u201c \u2018in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Hague Convention </em>art. 5(a)). Any fair reading of the separation agreement reveals that plaintiff does not have that right. All he has under the agreement is a \u201cright of access\u201d to the child. <em>See Hague Convention </em>art. 5(b) (a complete copy of the Convention is available as an appendix to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Duquette v. Tahan, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 563-79, 600 A.2d 472). Breach of such a right does not trigger an automatic duty under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the Convention to return the child. Finally, as noted, there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that Lina was wrongfully removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We have also reviewed the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1738A (PKPA). The PKPA provides that the courts of each state are required to enforce child custody decrees entered by any sister state. 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A(a). The federal statute is inapplicable because it concerns only the enforcement in one state of decrees previously entered by the courts of another state. Moreover, there is nothing in the language or history of the PKPA suggestive of a congressional intent to apply the statute to decrees issued by foreign governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We thus conclude that the Family Part lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case. In reaching this conclusion, we nevertheless emphasize the limited contours of our holding. We stress that there is no evidence in. this case indicating the child was kidnapped or otherwise wrongfully removed from New Jersey to a foreign country. New Jersey has long exercised <em>parens patriae </em>jurisdiction to protect the safety and welfare of children having substantial contacts with this State. <em>See Fantony v. Fantony, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>525, 535-36, 122 A.2d 593 (1956); <em>Lippincott v. Lippincott, </em>97 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>517, 519-21, 128 A. 254 (E. &amp; A.1925); <em>Clemens v. Clemens, </em>20 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 389-90, 90 A.2d 72 (App.Div.1952); <em>Lavigne v. Family and Children\u2019s Soc\u2019y, </em>18 <em>N.J.Super. </em>559, 575-76, 87 A.2d 739 (App.Div.1952), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>473, 95 A.2d 6 (1953). This inherent jurisdiction is not dependent upon statutory grants. <em>Clemens v. Clemens, </em>20 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 389, 90 A.2d 72. Indeed, there is authority for the proposition that the inherent jurisdiction of the courts to protect children residing or having a substantial connection with New Jersey is more extensive than the grants conferred by statute. <em>Hachez v. Hachez, </em>124 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>442,446,1 A.2d 845 (E. &amp; <em>A, </em>1938); <em>Clemens v. Clemens, </em>20 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 389-90, 90 A.2d 72. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>have no occasion to determine whether our inherent jurisdiction might be implicated in other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Even were we to find that the Family Part had subject matter jurisdiction, the result would not be different. In our view, the court would have been obliged to abstain and defer to the jurisdiction of the Moroccan court under recognized principles of international comity. Comity \u2018\u201cis neither a matter of absolute obligation on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will upon the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>O.N.E. Shipping Ltd. v. Flota Mercante Grancolombiana, S.A., </em>830 <em>F. </em>2d 449, 451 n. 3 (2d Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. </em>113, 163-64, 16 <em>S.Ct. </em>139, 143, 40 <em>L.Ed. 95 </em>(1895)), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>923, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>303, 102 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988). It is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons falling within its protection. <em>Ibid. </em>In other contexts, it has been said that \u201ca court may abstain from [asserting] jurisdiction when the extraterritorial effect of a particular remedy is so disproportionate to harm within the United States as to offend principles of comity.\u201d <em>Consolidated Gold Fields, PLC v. Minorco, S.A., </em>871 F.2d 252, 263 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>492 <em>U.S. </em>939, 110 <em>S.Ct. 29, </em>106 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>639 (1989); <em>see also Virgin Atlantic Airways v.

The record is devoid of evidence suggesting in any way that the best interests of the child will not be protected. Under these circumstances, we believe that the Family Part should have abstained even assuming that it had subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
