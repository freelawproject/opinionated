LEVY, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">In this matter we consider when a police officer can make an investigatory stop of a motor vehicle driver when a police mobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>data terminal reveals that the license of the owner of the vehicle has been suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The State and the defendant stipulated the following factual events leading to the issuance of two motor vehicle summonses to defendant. On July 31, 1994, at approximately 7:49 a.m., defendant was driving a 1984 Chevrolet station wagon. Although Police Officer Yarzab, who was following the vehicle, observed no violations of law, he checked the registration (license plate) of the car in his police computer. He learned the vehicle was registered to David Parks; David Parks\u2019 driver\u2019s license was suspended; David Parks was born in 1961, was in weight class six,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was five feet eight inches tall, and was a male. The officer did not recognize the driver of the vehicle and had no prior familiarity with Parks, but was able to see the driver from the shoulders up as he followed in his patrol car. From that viewpoint, he believed there was a \u201cgeneral match\u201d to the information revealed by the computer in that the driver was approximately the right age, right weight and right height.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Officer Yarzab stopped the station wagon and the driver (defendant), upon inquiry from the officer, admitted his license was suspended. He also failed to produce proof of insurance. Summonses were then issued for driving with a suspended license, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3^10, and driving without insurance, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">After the municipal judge denied his motion to dismiss the charges, defendant was convicted of each charge. He appealed to the Law Division and again moved to dismiss, but the Law Division judge denied the motion and defendant was again convicted. He was sentenced to pay appropriate fines, serve a term of community service and his driver\u2019s license was further suspended for an aggregate of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Defendant concedes the computerized lookup of the records from the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) was not an unconstitutional intrusion of his privacy because vehicle license plates are openly displayed and the records are public. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 39:3-33; N.J.S.A 47:1A-2. We agree that this use of a mobile data terminal does not interfere with a driver\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and does not constitute an unreasonable seizure of either the driver or his official records.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Defendant\u2019s narrow argument on appeal is that the officer lacked a reasonable particularized suspicion to stop the driver of the station wagon, because the officer was not in a position to identify the driver as the person described in the vehicle\u2019s registration and related records found by the computer. He urged each trial court to find the stop was made illegally because the officer \u201ccan point to nothing particular that told him that [the] man behind that wheel, when he only sees the back of his head, is David Parks.\u201d In the Law Division, defendant characterized the stop as \u201crandom\u201d and argued that from the police officer\u2019s location in a patrol car behind the station wagon, the officer could not observe anything about the defendant other than sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cexcept in those situations in which there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed ... stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver\u2019s license ... [is] unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>648, 663, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1391, 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, 663 (1979). Our Supreme Court has held that the articulable reasons causing a police officer to suspect criminal activity must be based on the totality of circumstances he faces. <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 504, 517 A.2d 859 (1986). An investigatory stop of a person who might be involved in criminal activity is valid \u201conly if the officer has a \u2018particularized suspicion\u2019 based on an objective observation that the person stopped has been or is about to engage in criminal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Here, when the police officer decided that the person he saw operating the station wagon generally matched the description from the records of the Division of Motor Vehicles, he had the requisite articulable, particularized and reasonable suspicion that the driver was David Parks whose driver\u2019s license had been revoked. Thus he acted properly in stopping the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Each trial judge recognized that the stipulation presented only a limited version of the underlying facts. That is, it was stipulated that the officer knew the vehicle owner\u2019s sex, height, weight and age and that the officer \u201cbelieve[d] that there was a general match,\u201d of that information to the person observed driving the vehicle. There was no direct or cross-examination of the officer to flesh out this broad statement of fact. The trial judges accepted it as meaning that in the officer\u2019s opinion, there was a general match. As the Law Division judge said: \u201cThe only way to assess that is to have a trial, and thus determine the credibility where you\u2019d bring out these very things.\u201d Although full examination and cross-examination of the arresting officer would certainly have produced a better record for initial fact finding and for appellate review, the lower court judges had to rely on the stipulation at face value, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The added coincidental fact that six weeks later the same officer stopped the same vehicle after a similar lookup, only to find that someone other than defendant was the driver, is of no moment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That circumstance does not impact on the reasonableness of Officer Yarzab\u2019s particularized suspicion at the time he stopped defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The State urges us to hold that once the officer learns from the mobile data terminal that the vehicle\u2019s owner does not have a valid driver\u2019s license, the officer is authorized to stop and detain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>any person driving that vehicle in order to cheek that person\u2019s identification. The information alone, then, would provide a police officer with an \u201carticulable and reasonable suspicion\u201d that the driver is unlicensed as soon as the computer search reveals the owner is unlicensed. <em>See e.g., </em>Annotation, <em>Inference or Presumption that Owner of Motor Vehicle was its Driver at Time of Traffic, Driving or Parking Offense, </em>49 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>449 (1956). We reject this broad brush approach in favor of further articulation of the facts supporting a reasonable suspicion. When there is additional evidence of defendant\u2019s identity as the driver of his vehicle at a particular time, it may be inferred that the owner was the driver. <em>See State v. Kay, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 259-61, 376 A.2d 978 (Law Div.1977); <em>see also In re Emberton, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 214, 262 A.2d 899 (App.Div.1970) (facts and circumstances known to police officer constitute probable cause to believe offense committed). We hold that when the officer\u2019s observation of the driver indicates that the driver could reasonably be the person described in the DMV records, then the dictates of <em>Delaware v. Prouse, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Davis, supra </em>are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We conclude that Officer Yarzab reasonably believed there was a \u201cgeneral match\u201d of the computerized information to his observations of the driver of the station wagon. That constituted a particularized suspicion that the driver was operating while on the revoked list, permitting the officer to make a investigatory stop of the vehicle to ascertain the driver\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\"> It was stipulated he weighed 200 pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> It was stipulated that the same officer saw the same vehicle on November 5, 1994, and stopped it after checking his computer, but this time the driver was Dennis Sellers, defendant\u2019s fifty-year-old uncle, who was six feet one inch tall and weighed approximately three hundred pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
