Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980); <em>Campbell v.

Moreover, all the issues of law raised by petitioner are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We emphasize that our role in reviewing the Acting Commissioner\u2019s findings in a case of this kind is to determine \u201cwhether the findings of fact could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record, considering the proofs as a whole,\u201d ... and \u201c[w]here expertise is a pertinent fact, ... [to] accord due regard in that respect as well.\u201d <em>In re Boardwalk Regency Casino License Application, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 333, 434 A.2d 1111. <em>See Matter of Hotel and Restaurant Emp. and Bartend., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>297, 316, 496 A.2d 1111 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>352, 508 A.2d 223 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1085, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1467, 89 <em>L.Ed.2&amp; </em>723 (1986). <em>See also In re Suspension of Heller, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>292, 309, 374 A.2d 1191 (1977); <em>Mayflower Securities v.

We are satisfied that sufficient evidence appears in the record to support the Acting Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Furthermore, it is not our function to substitute our independent judgment for that of an administrative body, such as the Department, where there may exist a difference of opinion concerning the evidential persuasiveness of the relevant proofs. <em>De Vitis v. New Jersey Racing Com\u2019n, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 489, 495 A.2d 457 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>337, 508 A.2d 213 (1985); <em>In re Boardwalk Regency Casino License Application, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 334-335, 434 A.2d 1111; <em>First Sav. &amp; L. Assn. of E. Paterson v. Howell, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 321-22, 209 A.2d 343 (App.Div.1965), <em>certif. denied, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>368, 230 A.2d 400 (1967). As a reviewing court, we will not weigh the evidence anew, draw inferences and conclusions from the evidence or resolve conflicts therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>We also point out that the decisions of administrative agencies, such as the Department, carry -with them the presumption of correctness. <em>Gerba v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirem. Sys. Trustees, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>174, 189, 416 A.2d 314 (1980); <em>Korelnia v. Pub. Employees\u2019 Retirem. Sys. Trustees, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>163, 416 A.2d 308 (1980). The interpretation by an administrative agency of a statute, which it is authorized to enforce, is entitled to substantial weight. <em>Matter of Board of Educ. of Town of Boonton, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>523, 534, 494 A.2d 279 (1985), <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1072, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1388, 89 L.Ed.2d 613 (1986). We may not vacate an agency\u2019s decision because of doubts as to its wisdom or because the record may support more than one result. <em>See Henry v. Rahway State Prison, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 579-80, 410 A.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The purpose of the notification requirement contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-19(e), of the Air Pollution Control Act, is to ensure that the Department is immediately notified of a release of a toxic substance so that if the release involves either the risk of serious harm to the public health, or to the environment, or the risk of panic, those risks could be minimized through either the Department\u2019s emergency response team or by local efforts coordinated by the Department. As our Legislature recognized by its enactment of N.J.S.A 26:2C-19(e), it is absolutely imperative that the Department be notified of such a release immediately, so that help can be dispatched, evacuation started, traffic patterns rerouted, and local police, fire, hospitals and ambulance squads and the local civil defense office notified. To do this effectively, however, it is imperative that the Department receive immediate notice of a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The term \u201cimmediate\u201d, which is not defined in the Air Pollution Control Act, must be given its ordinary and commonly understood meaning. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1; <em>Jamouneau v. Harner, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>500, 513, 109 A.2d 640, cert. <em>denied, </em>349 <em>U.S. </em>904, 75 <em>S.Ct. </em>580, 99 <em>L.Ed. </em>1241 (1955). According to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>\u201cimmediate\u201d means \u201c[p]resent; at once; without delay; not deferred by any interval of time\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>(5th ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>1979). That source also indicates that the word \u201cimmediate,\u201d denotes that action is or must be taken either instantly or without any considerable loss of time. <em>Ibid. </em>In determining whether notification is \u201cimmediate\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-19(e) for purposes of imposing penalties, the Department considered the reasonableness of the response, citing its own opinion in <em>Mobil v. DEP, </em>13 <em>N.J.A.R. </em>791, 801 (1988). In <em>Mobil, </em>the Commissioner stated that the word \u201cimmediately\u201d is intended to \u201crequire notification as soon as is reasonably possible under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Mobil, supra, </em>13 <em>N.J.AR. </em>at 801. The Commissioner recognized in <em>Mobil </em>that the meaning of \u201cimmediately\u201d requires \u201ca ease-by-case determination as to whether notice was given as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Here, the Acting Commissioner found that Occidental\u2019s failure to notify the Department of the release of the vinyl chloride monomer until twenty-eight minutes after it occurred was not reasonable under the circumstances. There is ample evidence in the record to support this finding and conclusion. It is undisputed that the release was contained by Occidental employees within five minutes. The failure to call the Department was not a result of a reasonable effort to secure the site. Additionally, it is undisputed that Occidental employees had access to phones at least twice during the twenty-eight minutes and did not take these opportunities to call the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Acting Commissioner also concluded that even assuming that it was \u201creasonable\u201d to gather information for the Department\u2019s required incident notification form before notifying the Department, at the very least the call could have been placed some seven minutes earlier, that is, twenty-one minutes after the release occurred. Of the seven minutes, approximately three minutes were unaccounted for and four minutes were spent unnecessarily walking back to the administration building when there was a phone in a building adjacent to the release site. Thus, regardless of whether Occidental should or should not have gath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ered the information for the required form, the Acting Commissioner properly found that the additional seven minute delay was not reasonable under the circumstances. Clearly, a seven minute delay as to the release of a highly toxic substance, such as vinyl chloride monomer, can mean the difference between life and death or serious harm to the environment or both in certain situations. Fortunately, neither human life nor the environment were jeopardized by the release of the highly toxic substance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Although we affirm the final administrative action of the Department finding that Occidental failed to immediately notify it of the release of the vinyl chloride monomer as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-19(e), we are constrained to vacate the $4,000 penalty assessed against Occidental and remand the matter to the Department for a redetermination of the penalty under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-19(b) and for a statement of reasons for the amount assessed. In light of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s prior ruling, Occidental did not have an opportunity to address the issue of the assessment of the penalty before the Acting Commissioner. Occidental should be given such an opportunity upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Accordingly, except to vacate the $4,000 penalty imposed upon Occidental and remand the matter for a redetermination of the penalty, the final administrative action under review is affirmed. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
