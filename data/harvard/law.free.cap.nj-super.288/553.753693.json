Cutler Home Inc. (the corporation) was a closely-held corporation over which Cutler exercised majority control. In early 1990, plaintiff Michelle Jennings and Cutler met, began dating, and shortly thereafter, Jennings moved in with him. They lived together until July 1992 when the relationship dissolved. During the time they were together, Cutler presented Jennings with many extravagant gifts, including a new Mercedes Benz automobile. He also paid her expenses, such as her credit card bills, ranging from $7,000 to $10,000 per month, and a $29,000 dental bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">In the spring of 1992, Cutler gave Jennings a $150,000 mortgage on one of the properties owned by the corporation. When the property was sold, however, Cutler refused to authorize payment to Jennings, and Jennings instituted this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The primary question presented is whether a duly perfected mortgage, given with the expectation it will be satisfied in the future out of the proceeds of sale of the liened property, can be the subject matter of a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Sometime in early 1992, Jennings asked Cutler for $250,000 because, she claimed, she was concerned about what she would do if something happened to him. The record reflects that when Cutler declined to give her cash, Jennings asked for a house at \u201cThe Beagle Club,\u201d one of the real estate developments owned by the corporation. According to Cutler, after \u201cnegotiating\u201d with Jennings, they reached a compromise whereby he agreed to give Jennings a mortgage in the sum of $150,000 representing one-half the value of one of the Beagle Club development houses; specifically, he agreed to give Jennings a mortgage on a sample home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>located at 32 Elliot Drive in the Township of Voorhees, Camden County (32 Elliot Drive).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Cutler testified that, when Jennings asked for the mortgage, he did not believe that, by agreeing, he was really giving her anything of value. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">[A]t that point I saw a way to basically satisfy her mind that she was getting something through this mortgage. <em>In my mind the mortgage was not giving her anything ... </em>because the house wasn\u2019t sold. It was a sample house at the time. Who knows if I was ever gonna sell it____ I was renting houses that I had built on spec in other developments. So at that point when the mortgage was suggested that was almost an out for me, that I didn\u2019t have to do anything. I didn\u2019t have to put up any money, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">After she agreed to accept the mortgage, Jennings testified Cutler told her to retain an attorney \u201cto make sure everything was legal.\u201d Jennings then retained Michael Ridgway and Cutler paid his attorney\u2019s fee. The record reflects that in an undated letter, Cutler requested Ridgway to draft an agreement reflecting the parties\u2019 intentions. The letter to Ridgway from Cutler provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeO\">Enclosed please find check # 1394 in the amount of $500.00. Let this act as retainer/deposit in this matter. <em>Miss Jennings and I have come to an agreement that I will gift to her $150,000. </em>Miss Jennings would only receive this gift at the settlement of 32 Elliot Drive at The Beagle Club in Voorhees, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">Since you will be representing Miss Jennings in this matter, <em>can you draw up an agreement between her and I, that in her best interest, will guarantee her payment of this gift at the settlement when it occurs of 82 Elliot Drive. I think that I have been clear with my intentions in this matter. </em>If you could draft this agreement for Miss Jennings to review as soon as possible it would be greatly appreciated, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">In the letter, Cutler also explained his plans for satisfying existing liens on various lots in the development tract including 32 Elliot Drive, indicating his intention to sell three other lots and thereby obtain a release of all title restrictions for the entire development tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">On April 9, 1992, Ridgway forwarded to Jennings a proposed form of note and mortgage instructing her to submit them to Cutler for his signature as an officer of the corporation and to return them to Ridgway for recording. In the letter, Ridgway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>advised Jennings there probably was \u201csufficient equity in the property,\u201d but also cautioned that some \u201cuntoward event\u201d still could interfere with payment of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Although the mortgage stated there was \u201cno due date for payment of th[e] obligation,\u201d the note and mortgage, dated April 10, 1992, provided that the corporation would pay Jennings $150,-000 out of the proceeds of sale of 32 Elliot Drive. Additionally, the note stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\"><em>[Jennings] has been given a Mortgage dated April 10th, 1992, to protect [her] if the promises made in this Note are 'not kept. I agree to keep all promises made in the Mortgage </em>covering property I own located at 32 Elliot Drive in the Township of Voorhees in the County of Camden and State of New Jersey. All terms of the Mortgage are made part of this Note, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Upon receiving the note and mortgage, Cutler asked his employee, Cheryl DiSanti, a licensed real estate agent, to determine if the mortgage and note were legal documents and to explain their import to Jennings, which she did. Then Cutler executed and notarized the note and mortgage and returned both instruments to Ridgway, who had the mortgage recorded. Thereafter, Ridgway sent the note and mortgage to Jennings, who secured them in her safe deposit box.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">On June 29, 1993, after the relationship between Jennings and Cutler had ended, the corporation sold 32 Elliot Drive. At the closing, Cutler refused to authorize payment of $150,000 to Jennings from the proceeds of sale. Consequently, Surety Title Corporation (the title company) withheld the funds and placed them in escrow at Cutler\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Jennings instituted suit against Cutler, the corporation, and the title company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on several grounds, including breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation and tortious interference with contract. The judge disposed of most of the claims by motion, and the case proceeded on the issue of whether a completed gift had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>been accomplished by Cutler\u2019s transfer of the executed note and mortgage to Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">On the motion for summary judgment, defendants contended Jennings had failed to demonstrate the existence of an <em>inter vivos </em>gift, because she had not proved delivery, irrevocable relinquishment of dominion and control over the subject matter of the gift, and donative intent. Cutler conceded he intended to give, and did give, Jennings the mortgage, but insisted that his true intent was to give her nothing. He argued that the property may never have been sold and even if it were sold, he still maintained control over the sales proceeds. Thus, he argued that because he never relinquished control over the money, the gift was incomplete. Relying on <em>dicta </em>in <em>Scherer v. Hyland, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>521, 527, 380 A.2d 704 (App.Div.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>127, 380 A.2d 698 (1977), Cutler further asserted that the mortgage had no independent legal force because a promise to pay money in the future for which no consideration is given cannot be the subject of an <em>inter vivos </em>gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On the motion for summary judgment, the judge determined that the \u201cdelivery of [the] mortgage and its recordation satisfied]\u201d the elements of delivery and relinquishment of dominion and control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">I\u2019m holding that there is a difference between a note or a check on the one hand, an IOU whatever you want to call it which, in fact, essentially says, I will' do something in the future, and a mortgage which is recorded which is then the relinquishment of control over the asset to the ejctent of that mortgage, the land, it could be land and improvements, whatever it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The parties proceeded to trial on the remaining issue of intent. At the conclusion of trial, the judge reiterated his prior ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">I had held earlier that as a matter of law two of the [gift] elements were shown. In other words, delivery, was it dear that the mortgage was turned over by defendant to the plaintiff and quite candidly I don\u2019t think that was ever in dispute? And two, did it come out to an absolute and irrevocable relinquish[ment] of ownership and dominion in defendant over the object given?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">The judge then made findings concerning Cutler\u2019s lack of credibility, specifically commenting on Cutler\u2019s attempt to obfuscate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>issue of his intent by claiming he never had the intention to give her the money:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\"><em>For Mr. Cutler, ... I was not at all confident in defendant\u2019s recitation of his past state of mind. </em>And I arrived at that conclusion for several reasons. First of all, he\u2019s indicated he\u2019s a builder and yet he says he didn\u2019t believe, in essence, that a mortgage created ... a protective lien. He\u2019s a mortgagee or was a mortgagee and yet he didn\u2019t think there was protection by the creation of a mortgage lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[H]is knowledge had to be reinforced by [his awareness the mortgage would be recorded as a hen on the property], [He] was aware of the financial information requested of him so a determination could be made of any equity in the Elliot Drive property. From that, he had to have been aware that the giving of the mortgage was something more than just a symbol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">Another thing of influence to me was the fact that the documents were notarized. There\u2019s a certain formality to all of this____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\n<em>He never said to anyone else at the time, my intent is other than what everything else shows.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">Mr. Cutler is not a babe in the woods. He\u2019s a sophisticated businessman. And I am unwilling to accept in his instance the application of the old song title, I didn\u2019t know the gun was loaded. All of these lead me to the conclusion to satisfy me clearly, convincingly, thoroughly <em>that there was an intent on the part of Mr. Cutler to give the lien, the mortgage and he knew full well what h'is consequences were. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Thus, the judge concluded that regardless of Cutler\u2019s unexpressed intentions when he delivered the mortgage and note to Jennings, Cutler unequivocally manifested his intent to make a gift of the $150,000 mortgage to Jennings, subject only to the possibility of defeasance if 32 Elliot Drive were not sold, or if sold, did not generate sufficient equity to completely satisfy the mortgage. The trial court found Cutler\u2019s testimony regarding his secret intent was not credible, and rejected Cutler\u2019s belated attempt to set aside a clearly executed agreement, impliedly finding that the parties \u201cintended the mortgage to secure payment of $150,000 if and when the property was sold and ... [if] sufficient equity [existed] to satisfy the obligation.\u201d Accordingly, the judge concluded the mortgage was a valid enforceable <em>inter vivos </em>gift and entered judgment in the sum of $150,000 plus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>interest and costs in favor of Jennings, but denied Jennings\u2019 claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The three elements required to establish an <em>inter vivos </em>gift are (1) a donative intent on the part of the donor; (2) an actual or symbolic delivery of the subject matter of the gift; and (3) an absolute and irrevocable surrender by the donor of ownership and dominion over the subject matter of the gift, at least to the extent practicable or possible, considering the nature of the thing to be given. <em>In re Dodge, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>192, 216, 234 A.2d 65 (1967); <em>accord Pascale v. Pascale, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>20, 29, 549 A.2d 782 (1988); <em>see Basse v. Raab, </em>138 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>432, 433, 46 A.2d 787 (E. &amp; A.1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">These elements are interrelated. To constitute an <em>inter vivos </em>gift, not only must the donor have a clear intention to give a gift, but the gift must be completed. Clearly, Cutler had the intent to give the mortgage to Jennings. Although Cutler may not have wanted to make a present gift of $150,000 to Jennings, and even may have secretly regretted giving Jennings the mortgage on 32 Elliot Drive, nonetheless Cutler clearly manifested his intent to make a gift of the mortgage. His intent is reflected in his undated letter to Ridgway, instructing Ridgway to \u201cdraw up an agreement ... [which] will guarantee [Jennings] payment of this [$150,000] gift at the settlement ... of 32 Elliot Drive,\u201d and emphasizing he had \u201cbeen clear with [his] intentions in the matter.\u201d Additionally, his intent is revealed by the formal manner in which his intentions were memorialized: that is, he accepted that the agreement would be embodied in the form of a mortgage, engaged his employee, a real estate expert, to assure the legality of the document and explain its legal significance to Jennings, and then executed the mortgage as presented. All of these actions manifested Cutler\u2019s intent to give Jennings the mortgage as a gift. Moreover, once Cutler executed the mortgage in recordable form and delivered it to Jennings, knowing it would be recorded, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>irrevocably relinquished his interest in the mortgage subject to its defeasance by Cutler upon sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The law is well settled: For a gift to be complete, \u201cone [person must] renounce[ ] and another ... immediately acquire[ ] all title and interest\u201d in the subject matter of the gift, and the strongest and most essential evidence of completion is \u201cdelivery of possession\u201d of the item given. <em>Egerton v. Egerton, </em>17 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>419, 421 (Prerog.Ct.1864). Hence, a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift requires \u201ca subject capable of passing by delivery, and an actual delivery at the time of the alleged gift.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In <em>Egerton, </em>the court declined to recognize as valid a gift by the donor to his wife of the privilege of subscribing for a new issue of stock in a company in which the donor already held shares. Although the stock had been subscribed for in the name of the donor\u2019s wife, the stock had not been issued or paid for by the donor before he died. The court held \u201c[t]he gift must have been either of the stock, or of the money to purchase the stock.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Since the stock had not yet issued, the donor did not own and, therefore, could not give it as a gift. The court determined there was no gift \u201ccapable of passing by delivery,\u201d but instead \u201ca mere contract to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422. The instant case is materially different because the subject of the gift, the mortgage, was capable of delivery, and was, in fact, delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Nonetheless, defendants argue that the gift of the mortgage is like the gift of a promissory note which merely represents a promise to pay money in the future and, therefore, cannot constitute a completed gift. We disagree. The giving of a mortgage, unlike a note, does not merely represent a promise to pay money in the future. Although satisfaction of the mortgage must abide a future event such as sale of the property for a sufficient price, that contingency does not render the gift incomplete. Unlike the gift of a note which is \u201cthe delivery of a promise only, and not the thing promised,\u201d <em>Voorhees v. Woodhull, </em>33 <em>N.J.L. </em>494, 498 (E. &amp; A. 1869), here the \u201cthing promised\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>delivered was the mortgage conveying to Jennings a present-existing legal interest in real estate. Moreover, once Cutler delivered the mortgage to Jennings, he relinquished all power to affect its validity except, of course, to obtain its cancellation upon sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As for defendant\u2019s argument that lack of consideration voids the gift, on its face this argument appears unsound because by definition \u201ca gift is a transfer without consideration,\u201d <em>Herr v. Herr, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>79, 88, 98 A.2d 55 (1953). However, the fact that a mortgage is the subject matter of the gift adds another dimension to the analysis. Commentators disagree concerning whether consideration is required when a mortgage is intended as a gift. <em>Great Falls Bank v. Pardo, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388,400 &amp; nn. 7-8, 622 A.2d 1353 (Ch.Div.1993) (discussing various court decisions and commentaries); <em>see also </em>29 <em>New Jersey Practice, Law of Mortgages </em>\u00a7 32, at 104-08 (Roger A. Cunningham &amp; Saul Tischler) (1975). Professor Cunningham and Judge Tischler discuss the problem that arises when parties agree \u201cto create an enforceable personal obligation gratuitously, without any consideration at all, and to secure its performance by a mortgage.\u201d 29 <em>New Jersey Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 32, at 104. Although they acknowledge that \u201c[i]n New Jersey, ... a promissory note, without consideration and not under seal, intended as a gift, cannot be made the basis for recovery either at law or in equity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 105-06 n. 40 (citing <em>Egerton v. Egerton, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>419 and <em>Voorhees v. Woodhull, supra, </em>33 <em>N.J.L. </em>494), they, nonetheless, conclude that a mortgage given to secure performance of such a promise, though lacking in consideration, should be valid provided it is not a sham and the parties intend the mortgage as security for the obligation. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07 &amp; n. 43. Professor Osborne agrees, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">There is no reason why a mortgage without a personal obligation should1 not be permitted. This is important in several types of cases [including] ... where the transaction is intended as a gift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\n<em>In the gift cases, a suggested test of validity is whether the parties intended the mortgage to secure a debt or other personal obligation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>[Osborne, <em>Handbook on the Law of Mortgages </em>\u00a7 104, at 162 (2d ed.1970), <em>quoted in part in </em>29 <em>New Jersey Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 32, at 107 n. 46 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\"><em>See also, </em>1 Glenn, <em>Mortgages, Deeds of Trust and Other Security Devices as to Land </em>\u00a7 5.6 (1943). <em>But see </em>Tiffany, <em>Treatise on the Modem Law of Real Property, </em>\u00a7 1401, at 278 (3d ed. 1939) (\u201cEven though a consideration is not necessary to the validity of [a] mortgage.... [the] mortgage [is] invalid, not because it [is] not supported by a consideration, but because the obligation secured by it was not so supported.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Our review of the issue persuades us that the validity of a mortgage given as a gift should be determined based on the existence of the three elements required to prove a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift, without reference to a contractual consideration for the conveyance. This is because, assuming intent to give the mortgage is demonstrated, \u201can enforceable mortgage requires only two things, \u2018(1) an executed conveyance and (2) a condition on the conveyance \u2014 an agreement between the parties to defeat the conveyance upon some future act usually of the mortgagor.\u2019 \u201d 29 <em>New Jersey Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 32, at 106 &amp; n. 42 (quoting Clapp, <em>Consideration is Not Necessary for a Mortgage, </em>58 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>145, 148 (1935), and relying on Judge Clapp\u2019s analysis that \u201ca mortgage is an executed conveyance\u201d with an \u201cexecuting conditional limitation on the fee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">In the instant matter, the conveyance was complete upon Cutler\u2019s delivery of the mortgage in recordable form, subject to defeasance upon Cutler paying the underlying obligation of $150,-000 from the proceeds of sale or demonstrating there was insufficient equity in the property to pay Jennings from the sale. Under the terms of the mortgage, Cutler had no personal liability to Jennings to pay the $150,000. Consequently, had the property sold for less than any outstanding superior liens, Jennings would not have received anything. The record reflects that what Jennings obtained as a gift was a present interest in real property subject to defeasance when the property was sold. The fact that Jennings may never have received the $150,000 secured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>mortgage because the property may not have been sold, or if sold, may not have generated sufficient proceeds to pay off the mortgage, does not invalidate the gift although it may have disappointed Jennings\u2019 expectations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Finally, we note the trial judge relied on <em>Basse v. Raab, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 433, 46 A.2d 787, where our highest court held that a gift of an assignment of an existing mortgage given by the mortgagor to a third party upon advice of counsel was valid because \u201cthere was an intent to make a gift[,] ... actual delivery of the subject matter of the gift, and a relinquishment by the donor of all dominion over it.\u201d Since the factual predicate for that holding is unclear and the court in <em>Basse </em>did not expressly hold that consideration is not required for a mortgage to be the subject of an <em>inter vivos </em>gift, we are reluctant to base our decision solely on <em>Basse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">However, to the extent <em>Basse </em>can be so interpreted, we rely upon it and here expressly hold that a mortgage given as a gift (ergo without consideration) is enforceable where donative intent is shown and the mortgage is executed in recordable form by the mortgagor and delivered to the mortgagee, thus evidencing an irrevocable relinquishment of the mortgagor\u2019s dominion and control over the mortgage, subject, of course, to his or her right to obtain its release in accordance with the terms of the mortgage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The note contained a provision requiring payment of reasonable attorney fees in the event of default. The judge denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees finding that Jennings had an opportunity to present proof of the services rendered and the reasonableness of their value during trial but failed to do so. He rejected Jennings\u2019 counsel\u2019s request at the close of trial for permission to file an affidavit of services after defense counsel opposed the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We note that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a contractual provision is not \u201cthe award of counsel fees under <em>R. </em>4:42-9,\u201d but instead is an element of damages, which ordinarily must be proved \u201cin the same manner as ... any other item of damages.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Fair Lawn Dairies, Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206, 216, 206 A.2d 585 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>450, 210 A.2d 73 (1965). There, our Supreme Court observed that plenary proof of the reasonableness of the services rendered may not be required where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">the proceeding before the trial court dealt mainly with other substantive issues and only incidentally with the matter of counsel fee, an affidavit of services had been filed by the attorney for the plaintiffs, ... the attorney for the defendants-appellants voiced no objection to this procedure],] ... [and] the affidavit of services]] is sufficiently complete to enable [the trial court] to reach a fair determination as to the extent of the legal services rendered and the reasonable value to be paid pursuant to the contractual provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\"><em>[Cohen v. Fair Lawn Dairies, Inc., supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 452, 210 A.2d 73.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Although we recognize the instant proceeding focused mainly on the substantive issues concerning the validity of the mortgage as a gift with only incidental reference to the attorneys fees Jennings paid to prosecute the action, nevertheless, the record indicates Jennings did not meet the requirements of <em>Cohen. </em>Thus, the trial judge did not err in excluding attorney\u2019s fees as part of damages, nor did the judge abuse his discretion in declining to reopen the record to permit the admission of further proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-11\"> The title company was dismissed from the case following entry of an order directing it to place the escrowed funds with the Clerk of the Court. That order is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\"> The fact that Cutler was able somehow to prevent the title company from paying Jennings from the proceeds of sale is irrelevant to our view of the gift as completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"> We note, however, a gift of a mortgage compliant with the requisite elements nevertheless may not be enforceable if the transaction is a sham. <em>See </em>29 <em>New Jersey Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 32, at 106 n. 41) (criticizing <em>Risley v.
