Alloway, III, and New Hampshire Insurance Co. appeal from an order dismissing their complaint filed against defendant General Marine Industries, L.P. The motion judge concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 products liability claim for economic loss was not cognizable under New Jersey law and that plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">In October 1989, Glasstream Boats, Inc., (Glasstream) filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Georgia. On March 30, 1990, under \u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, Glasstream sold its assets to GAC Partners, L.P. GAC Partners, L.P., is the former name of defendant, General Marine Industries, L.P. (GMI).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">On July 14,1990, Alloway purchased a Century Grande XL boat from defendant retailer Mullica River Boat Basin (Mullica) for $61,070. Century Boats (Century), a division of Glasstream, manufactured the boat. Mullica delivered the boat to Alloway on approximately July 26, 1990. On July 25, 1990, plaintiff, New Hampshire Insurance Co. (New Hampshire), issued a comprehen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>sive insurance policy to Alloway covering the boat. The boat sank on approximately October 15,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Alloway paid his deductible of $2,490 and New Hampshire paid $40,106.63 to repair the boat, as required under the insurance policy. After repairing the boat, Alloway received $38,770 for the boat as a trade-in for the purchase of a new boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In his original complaint, Alloway asserted three theories of recovery. In count one, Alloway alleged that he purchased, from Mullica, a boat with a warranty that provided for \u201crepair or replacement of any part found to be defective.\u201d He alleged that Mullica was \u201cunable and/or unwilling\u201d to honor the warranty, and that he suffered a resulting economic loss. In count two, he alleged that Century manufactured a defective boat and that as a result of the defect, he suffered an economic loss. In count three, Alloway alleged that Glasstream \u201cnegligently manufactured and inspected\u201d the boat and Mullica \u201cfailed to identify the defect in [the boat] in an inspection completed prior to the delivery\u201d of the boat to plaintiff. Plaintiff Alloway alleges economic loss as a result of the negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">After Alloway filed his complaint, he assigned all of his claims against defendants to plaintiff New Hampshire, excluding his claim for loss in value of the boat. New Hampshire, as an assignee, filed an amended complaint and asserted claims against defendants by repeating the allegations originally asserted by Alloway in counts two and three of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Alloway demanded as damages the \u201cdifference in value between the price paid for the boat and the market value of the boat in its defective condition,\u201d the insurance deductible, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. New Hampshire demanded $40,106.63, the amount it paid to repair the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>GMI moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaints, arguing that plaintiffs did not have a products liability or Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) warranty claim for economic loss and that plaintiffs\u2019 suit was barred by 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 363 (\u00a7 363), a section of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Code). After oral argument, the motion judge granted GMI\u2019s motion, holding that plaintiffs\u2019 only remedy was for breach of warranty under the UCC, and that plaintiffs\u2019 products liability and UCC warranty claims were barred by \u00a7 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The motion judge dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 products liability and negligence claims, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">I conclude that successor liability under the <em>Ramirez </em>doctrine ... does not apply to consumer buyers suing for economic loss only to a product which they have purchased____ Alloway ... cannot reach GMI on the facts here____ [T]he UCC clearly governs this relationship____ [B]ut for the bankruptcy of Glasstream, Alloway could have reached Glasstream and its Century Boat division, but bankruptcy, in fact, did intervene. GMI ... bought the assets out of bankruptcy subject to an order ... making the purchase free and dear of all daims____ [I]n this instance, that purchase of assets simply does not make [GMI] liable for all of Glasstream\u2019s old customers on their various warranty claims for economic loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARy\">... [D]espite the claims of .negligence ... being made here, what we have is essentially a contract claim, a warranty claim based and sounding in the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in which I believe buyers bare [sic] the risk that sellers [may be] ... near ... going out of business or going bankrupt____<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">In reaching this conclusion, the judge either did not consider or declined to follow <em>Santor v. A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>52, 207 A.2d 305 (1965) (holding that a consumer can institute a products liability suit for economic loss to the product). Instead, he relied primarily on <em>Spring Motors v. Ford Motor Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>555, 489 A.2d 660 (1985) (holding that a commercial buyer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>defective goods cannot maintain a strict liability or negligence suit for economic loss to the product, as the remedy is a breach of warranty suit under the UCC), and <em>D\u2019Angelo v. Miller Yacht Sales, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>683, 619 A.2d 689 (App.Div.1993) (extending <em>Spring Motors </em>to consumer transactions and holding that consumers cannot institute a products liability suit for direct economic loss to the product resulting from conduct that constitutes a breach of express or implied warranties because the exclusive remedy is under the UCC). The judge concluded that plaintiffs could not institute a strict liability claim for economic loss, citing <em>D\u2019Angelo, </em>and that the <em>Ramirez </em>successor liability doctrine only applied to personal injury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Plaintiffs argue that: (1) a consumer can assert a products liability claim for economic loss to a product under <em>Santor; </em>(2) a consumer who institutes a products liability claim for economic loss to a product can proceed against the manufacturer\u2019s successor under the doctrine established in <em>Ramirez v. Amsted Indust., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>332, 431 A.2d 811 (1981); and (3) a consumer\u2019s products liability claim for economic loss against a successor that purchased a bankrupt corporation\u2019s assets in a bankruptcy proceeding is not precluded by \u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (Code). We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In <em>Santor, </em>Daniel Santor purchased a carpet which turned out to be defective. 44 <em>N.J. </em>at 55, 207 A.2d 305. He sued the manufacturer (not the distributor) and recovered $1,512, the carpet\u2019s lost value. <em>Ibid. </em>We reversed the trial court, stating that \u201cabsent personal injury or damage to health consequent upon use of the product ... there is no action in this State on the part of a purchaser of goods for breach of warranty in respect of their quality or fitness for use except as against the party from whom he has purchased them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 207 A.2d 305 (quoting <em>Santor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>v. A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc., </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 322, 197 A.2d 589 (App.Div.1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The Supreme Court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">From the standpoint of principle, we perceive no sound reason why the implication of reasonable fitness should be attached to the transaction and be actionable against the manufacturer where the defectively-made product has caused personal injury, and not actionable when inadequate manufacture has put a worthless article in the hands of an innocent purchaser who has paid the required price for it____ It should make no difference that the defect in the product did not or was not likely to cause harm to the purchaser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 60, 207 A.2d 305.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">The Supreme Court stated that Santor\u2019s remedy would be \u201climited to the loss of value of\u2019 the carpet. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 207 A.2d 305. This loss was measured by \u201cthe difference between the price paid by plaintiff and the actual market value of the defective carpeting at the time when plaintiff knew or should have known that it was defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69,207 A.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">In 1985, the Supreme Court declined to extend <em>Santor </em>to cases involving a commercial buyer. <em>Spring Motors, supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 561, 489 A.2d 660. In <em>Spring Motors, </em>a commercial truck company unsuccessfully sued Ford Motor Company for providing trucks with defective transmissions. <em>Ibid. </em>On appeal, we held that under <em>Santor, </em>Spring Motors had a strict liability claim for economic loss. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that a commercial buyer must institute claims for damage to the product itself under the Uniform Commercial Code and that under the UCC, a commercial party could sue another commercial party that was not in privity. <em>Ibid. </em>In ruling that a commercial party could not sue for economic loss under a strict liability theory, the <em>Spring Motors </em>Court made the following determinations: (1) in a commercial transaction, both parties have equal bargaining power and are capable of allocating the risk of the transaction; (2) in enacting the UCC, the Legislature created a \u201ccarefully-conceived system of rights and remedies to govern commercial transactions,\u201d and permitting Spring Motors to proceed under a tort theory would dislocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>provisions of the UCC; and (3) in prior New Jersey cases that permitted commercial parties to recover economic loss, the complaining parties suffered either damage to property other than the product in question or personal injury. <em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 489 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The Court used these factors to distinguish a commercial transaction from a consumer transaction and refused to permit a commercial party to use a strict liability theory to recover for economic loss. The <em>Spring Motors </em>Court also noted that the UCC imposed barriers to consumer recovery; these include the \u201cnotice to a seller of breach of warranty\u201d and the \u201cseller\u2019s ability to limit or disclaim liabilities to an innocent purchaser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 489 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Court noted that the California Supreme Court in <em>Seely v. White Motor Co., </em>63 <em>Cal.2d </em>9, 45 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>17, 403 P.2d 145 (1965), refused to follow <em>Santor. Id. </em>at 572, 489 A.2d 660. In <em>Seely, </em>a consumer who purchased a truck for use in his hauling business sued the dealer and manufacturer of the truck for its purchase price and the lost profits he sustained when the truck overturned due to brake failure. The California court ruled \u201cthat in the absence of personal injuries or property damage strict liability was inapplicable.\u201d <em>Ibid. Spring Motors </em>noted that the concurring and dissenting opinions in <em>Seely </em>still \u201cembraced <em>Santor </em>\u201d and that although <em>Seely </em>has since emerged as representing the majority view, <em>Santor </em>has \u201cattracted the support of a few jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 573, 575, 489 A.2d 660. The Supreme Court also observed that commentators had been critical of <em>Santor. Id. </em>at 574-75, 489 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">However, the Supreme Court in <em>Spring Motors </em>did not overrule <em>Santor. </em>It expressly distinguished the facts in <em>Spring Motors </em>as an action by a commercial plaintiff and specifically concluded, \u201c[W]e need not reconsider the <em>Santor </em>rule that an ultimate consumer may recover in strict liability for direct economic loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 489 A.2d 660. With respect to the liability of remote suppliers, the Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Santor </em>by stating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201cIn New Jersey ... a consumer may recover direct economic loss in a strict liability action against a remote supplier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 489 A.2d 660. In a concurring opinion, Justice Handler stated, \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion in this case suggests an acceptable narrowing of the breadth of our holding in <em>Santor. </em>It does not, however, serve to displace that decision or to signal a different rule in cases in which the requirements of sound public policy and fairness call for its continued application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597,489 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Since the <em>Spring Motors </em>decision, both the Supreme Court and this Appellate Division have cited <em>Santor </em>as current law in New Jersey. <em>See, e.g., T. &amp; E. Indust., Inc. v. Safety Light Corp., </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>371, 388-89, 587 A.2d 1249 (1991) (citing <em>Santor </em>for the proposition that New Jersey has rejected the principles of caveat emptor and privity of contract in certain transactions); <em>Livingston Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 501, 592 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1991) (\u201cWe are nevertheless bound by <em>Santor, </em>which the 1985 <em>Spring Motors </em>opinion expressly declined to reconsider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In <em>D\u2019Angelo, </em>we addressed a consumer\u2019s right to recover economic loss under a strict liability theory. Plaintiff Gennaro D\u2019Angelo purchased a yacht which sank. He sued under strict liability, contract and fraud theories. <em>D'Angelo, supra, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 685-86, 619 A.2d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In addressing D\u2019Angelo\u2019s strict liability claim, we stated that the <em>Spring Motors </em>Court expressly left open the question of whether a consumer buyer must look exclusively to the UCC for direct economic loss. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 619 A.2d 689. We interpreted the <em>Spring Motors </em>Court\u2019s statement that it need not reconsider the <em>Santor </em>rule as leaving the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Santor </em>in question. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 619 A.2d 689. We therefore concluded that the consumer buyer\u2019s claim for conduct that constitutes a breach of implied or express warranties must be asserted under the UCC. On reevaluation, we now conclude that the panel of this court that decided <em>D\u2019Angelo </em>may have misconstrued the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Spring Motors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Since <em>Santor </em>has not been overruled, we must follow it. If <em>Santor </em>is to be overruled, it should be overruled not by this court, but by the Supreme Court. Moreover, we note that our Legislature\u2019s concern with protecting consumers who purchase defective products casts considerable doubt on whether the Legislature intended by its enactment of the UCC to reverse the holding in <em>Santor, </em>which pre-dates the UCC. We discern no legislative intention to limit the rights of consumers in cases such as this in which a consumer bought a new boat which promptly sank due to its defects. We therefore elect not to be guided by <em>D\u2019Angelo </em>in our decision in this case. <em>Cf. Delgozzo v. Kenny, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 182, n. 8, 628 A.2d 1080 (App.Div.1993) (following but questioning <em>D\u2019Angelo\u2019s </em>rule that economic damages find their remedy solely in the UCC). <em>See also </em>William A. Dreier et al., <em>N.J. Products Liability &amp; Toxic Torts Law </em>\u00a7 7:2 (1995) (suggesting that the issue has yet to be resolved and requires resolution by the Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><em>Santor </em>is still the law applicable to the consumer purchases and the motion judge erred when he faded or declined to adhere to its holding. We conclude that Alloway as a consumer was permitted to sue under a strict liability theory. Additionally, New Hampshire, as a subrogee of Alloway\u2019s claim, is entitled to assert the assigned claim under any theory assertable by its assignor. <em>See Culver v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>451, 458, 559 A.2d 400 (1989) (\u201cthe principal rationale behind insurance subrogation [is] that \u2018the insured should be reimbursed for his payment to the insured,\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co. v. Pellecchia, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>162,171,104 A.2d 288 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">As noted, the motion judge concluded that \u201csuccessor liability under the <em>Ramirez </em>doctrine ... does not apply to consumer buyers suing for economic loss only to a product which they have purchased____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Traditionally, corporate law states that \u201cwhere one company sells or transfers all of its assets to another, the second entity does not become liable for the debts and liabilities, including torts, of the transferor.\u201d <em>Conway v. White Trucks, </em>885 F.2d 90, 93 (3d Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Polius v. Clark Equipment Co., </em>802 F.2d 75, 77 (3d Cir.1986)). <em>Accord, Ramirez, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 340, 431 A.2d 811. However, the Court in <em>Ramirez </em>established the following principle of successor liability in product liability cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">[W]here one corporation acquires all or substantially all the manufacturing assets of another corporation, even if exclusively for cash, and undertakes essentially the same manufacturing operation as the selling corporation, the purchasing corporation is strictly liable for injuries caused by defects in units of the same product line, even if previously manufactured and distributed by the selling corporation or its predecessor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">[86 <em>N.J. </em>at 358, 431 A.2d 811.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The <em>Ramirez </em>Court stated that successor liability is appropriate because: (1) the successor corporation destroyed plaintiffs remedies against the original manufacturer by acquiring the original manufacturer\u2019s assets; (2) the successor corporation can assume the original manufacturer\u2019s \u201crisk spreading role\u201d; and (3) the successor benefits from the continued operation of the original manufacturer\u2019s business and \u201cgood will\u201d and therefore should assume responsibility for the original manufacturer\u2019s defective products. <em>Id. </em>at 349-50, 431 A.2d 811 (quoting <em>Ray v. Alad Corp., </em>19 Cal.3d 22, 136 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>574, 582, 560 P.2d 3, 11 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">We note that in its analysis of the \u201crisk spreading role,\u201d the <em>Ramirez </em>Court relied on <em>Santor:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">In this developing field of the law, courts have necessarily been proceeding step by step in their search for a stable principle which can stand on its own base as a permanent part of the substantive law. The quest has found sound expression, we believe, in the doctrine of strict liability in tort. Such doctrine stems from the reality of the relationship between manufacturers of products and the consuming public to whom the products are offered for sale. * * * The obligation of the manufacturer thus becomes what in justice it ought to be-an enterprise liability, and one which should not depend upon the intricacies of the law of sales. The purpose of such liability is to insure that the cost of injuries * * * resulting from the defective products, is borne by the makers of the products who put them in the channels of trade, rather than by the injured or damaged persons who ordinarily are powerless to protect themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 350-51, 431 A.2d 811 (quoting <em>Santor, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 64-65, 207 A.2d 305).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Defendant contends that the rule of successor corporate liability enunciated in <em>Ramirez </em>is limited to suits by plaintiffs who have suffered personal injuries. We disagree. We note that the exact ruling in <em>Ramirez </em>espoused recovery for \u201cinjuries\u201d and did not limit the injury to physical injury. <em>See id. </em>at 358, 431 A.2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Additionally, we note that in <em>Santor </em>the Court traced the historical basis of its conclusion, citing <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors Inc., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>358,161 A.2d 69 (1960).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">It is true that most of the discussion in <em>Henningsen </em>centers about the right to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by a person not a party to the contract of sale between the purchaser on the one hand and the dealer or the manufacturer on the other. And it was held that, regardless of privity, the injured person, i.e., the purchaser\u2019s wife, could recover against the manufacturer and dealer for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, which by operation of law became an incident of the sale of the automobile to her husband. But plaintiff says defendants overlook that the suit included a claim by Claus Henningsen against Chrysler Corporation for damage to his car in the mishap which resulted in his wife\u2019s injuries. Recovery for such damage was allowed against both dealer and Chrysler Corporation. With respect to the manufacturer, the controlling principle was said to be that when a manufacturer puts a new automobile in the stream of trade and promotes its purchase by the public, an implied warranty that it is reasonably suitable for use as such accompanies it into the hands of the ultimate purchaser from the dealer. 32 <em>N.J., </em>at p. 384[, 161 A.2d 69].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">[44 <em>N.J. </em>at 58,207 A.2d 305.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Moreover, the <em>Santor </em>Court stated that a consumer\u2019s strict liability claim should not depend on whether there was a personal injury. <em>Santor, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 207 A.2d 305 (\u201cIt should make no difference that the defect in the product did not or was not likely to cause harm to the purchaser.\u201d) <em>See also </em>John L. McGoldrick and Fredrick Smith, <em>New Jersey Product Liability Laws </em>\u00a7 1 \u2014 6:4.1 at 28 (1994) (There is no \u201cobvious reason to limit the defendant\u2019s liability to those cases which involve physical injury since the kind and degree of injury may be merely fortuitous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">A distinction between personal injury and economic loss in the application of the successor liability doctrine attacks the underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ing reasoning of <em>Santor, </em>i.e., it should not matter whether the consumer suffers a personal injury or an economic loss if the manufacturer makes a defective product and places it in the stream of commerce. In either case, the consumer has suffered damages and should be permitted to recover from an entity that purchased the assets of the manufacturer of the defective product. Of course, the consumer must produce evidence to establish that the purchasing corporation should be liable as a successor under <em>Ramirez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Defendant also argues that because Alloway filed a proof of claim in the Glasstream bankruptcy, it had an adequate remedy against Century and therefore the <em>Ramirez </em>doctrine is inapplicable. That contention was not mentioned by the motion judge in granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). We need not specifically address defendant\u2019s contention, as its argument is one which is not encompassed by a motion to dismiss. Under <em>R. </em>4:6 \u2014 2(e), the test is \u201cwhether a cause of action is \u2018suggested\u2019 by the facts.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Electronics, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989) (quoting <em>Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189,192, 536 A.2d 237 (1988)). The court\u2019s inquiry \u201cis limited to examining the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged on the face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31. The \u201creviewing court \u2018searches the complaint in depth and with liberality5 \u201d to determine whether a plaintiff has stated a cause of action. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Memorial Park, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 252, 128 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1957)). Plaintiffs are entitled to all reasonable inferences of fact. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Clearly, plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint stated a cause of action. Discovery undoubtedly will encompass a detailed exploration of the filing of a proof of claim by Alloway in the bankruptcy court and a determination as to whether Alloway had a realistic opportunity to redress his loss. The facts revealed after discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>may affect the applicability of the principles announced in Ramirez. When the trial court is called upon to decide that issue, it will want to consider <em>Wilkerson v. C.O. Porter Machinery Co., </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 567 A.2d 598 (Law Div.1989) (imposing successor liability under <em>Ramirez </em>in Chapter 11 proceeding) and <em>Goncalves v. Wire Technology &amp; Machinery Co., </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 601 A.2d 780 (Law Div.1991) (adopting <em>Wilkerson </em>to find purchaser of assets of Chapter 7 debtor potentially liable for injuries arising out of defects in product line.) Also pertinent are <em>Bussell v. DeWalt Prods. Corp., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499 (App.Div.1992), and <em>Pacius v. Thermtroll Corp., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 611 A.2d 153 (Law Div.1992). Defendant\u2019s argument is one which is more properly raised in a motion for summary judgment and is not one to be used in support of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In granting defendant\u2019s motion, the motion judge made reference to the fact that the bankruptcy sale to GMI was a sale \u201cfree and clear of all claims.\u201d The motion judge did not fully articulate why that stated fact was relevant. The judge specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGe\">GMI ... bought [Glasstream] out of bankruptcy subject to an order ... making the purchase free and clear of all claims. In my view, in this instance, that purchase of assets simply does not make it liable for all of Glasstream\u2019s old customers on their various warranty claims for economic loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We presume that the judge was referencing \u00a7 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 363 of the Code provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">(b)(1) The trustee, after notice and hearing, may ... sell ... other than in the ordinary course of business, property of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">(f) The trustee may sell property under subsection (b) ... free and dear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the estate, only if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(1) applicable nonbankruptcy law permits sale of such property free and dear of such interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">(2) such entity consents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">(3) such interest is a lien and the price at which such property is to be sold is greater than the aggregate value of all liens on such property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">(4) such interest is a bona fide dispute; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(5) such entity could be compelled, in a legal or equitable proceeding, to accept a money satisfaction of such interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[11 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 363(b)(1), (f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We initially note that \u00a7 363 does not speak of a sale \u201cfree and clear of all claims,\u201d but refers to a sale \u201cfree and clear of any interest in such property____\u201d 11 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 363(f). The relevant question is whether \u00a7 363(f) applies to plaintiffs\u2019 suit predicated on a theory of strict liability. There appears to be authority which would permit plaintiffs claim. <em>See Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Chambersburg Beverage, Inc., </em>75 <em>B.R. </em>944, 948 (Bank. N.D.Ohio 1987) (\u201cGeneral unsecured claimants including tort claimants have no specific interest in debtor\u2019s property. Therefore, \u00a7 363 is inapplicable for sale free and clear of such claims.\u201d); <em>Wilkerson, supra, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 293, 567 A.2d 598 (Law Div.1989) (An \u201corder under section [363] can only protect the purchaser of ... property against \u2018any interest in such property.\u2019 Plaintiffs [product liability suit is not] an interest in the purchased property and [\u00a7 363] does not affect plaintiffs claim.\u201d) (citing <em>Volvo White Truck, supra, </em>75 <em>B.R. </em>at 948). A potential cause of action, a chose in action, is clearly neither an \u201cinterest in property\u201d nor a \u201clien\u201d 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 363(f)(3). <em>Cf In re All American of Ashbum, Inc., </em>56 <em>B.R. </em>186, 189-90 (Bank.N.D.Ga.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>805 F.2d 1515 (11 Cir.1986) (holding that \u00a7 363 precludes the application of the successor liability doctrine because person alleging product defect obtains a priority over other claimants in the bankruptcy and imposition of the doctrine would devalue the debtor\u2019s assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">We consider <em>Volvo White Truck, supra, </em>to be most persuasive. A suit against a corporation that purchased a debtor\u2019s assets is not a <em>claim </em>against a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and therefore does not affect the Code\u2019s priority scheme. <em>See, e.g., Zerand-Bernal Group, Inc. v. Cox, </em>23 F.3d 159, 162 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that a lawsuit against a corporation that purchased assets from a bankrupt is not a claim against the debtor). We are also persuaded based upon the excellent analysis in <em>Wilkerson, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 567 A.2d 598, that <em>All American </em>is quite distinguishable from the facts in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We conclude that the motion judge erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. The order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-13\"> The record on appeal does not include a copy of the bankruptcy court order or purchase agreement. Defendant states in its brief that the bankruptcy court order provided that GAC did not assume any warranties of Glasstream's assets. We accept that representation as true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> GMI removed plaintiff's complaint to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. By successive orders, plaintiffs' complaint was referred to the United States Bankruptcy Court and thereafter was remanded by that court to the Law Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-15\"> After the judge\u2019s decision was memorialized, New Hampshire and Mullica\u2019s insurer, New Jersey Property-Liability Guaranty Association (NJPLGA), filed in the Law Division a stipulation of dismissal of New Hampshire\u2019s subrogation claims against Mullica because NJPLGA was insolvent. Thereafter, plaintiffs and Mullica filed in the Law Division a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice of plaintiffs' complaint against Mullica.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal prematurely, since the filing date preceded the dismissal as to Mullica which converted the order of dismissal into a final judgment. We will consider plaintiffs' notice of appeal as if properly filed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
