While petitioner has declined to disclose the reason for his request, as he is entitled to do <em>(Matter of Farbman &amp; Sons v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>62 NY2d 75), he intimates that he is investigating whether the dog, after being fully trained at Department expense, was improperly conveyed from the Transit Police Department to his trainer, then a member of the force, without compensation to Transit, and states that the dog was subsequently employed by the Port Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">While it appears that 43 RCNY 1-05 (d), which provides that the approximate date of an agency\u2019s FOIL determination shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>not exceed 10 business days from the date of the agency\u2019s acknowledgment of receipt of the request, may be in conflict with Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 (3), which provides that within five business days of the receipt of a request, an agency must either make the requested records available, deny the request or acknowledge receipt of the request with a statement indicating the approximate date when a determination will be made <em>(cf., Lecker v New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>157 AD2d 486, <em>appeal dismissed </em>75 NY2d 946), respondents, who acknowledged petitioner\u2019s request with the advice that a determination would be reached in approximately 120 days, did not rely on the local rule, and it is unclear why petitioner believes himself injured by that rule and seeks its nullification. Accordingly, we find that petitioner lacks standing to contest the validity of the rule or its possible conflict with Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 (3) <em>(see, Society of Plastics Indus. v County of Suffolk, 77 </em>NY2d 761, 772-773).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">We also find that respondents properly redacted the documents they provided to petitioner so as to delete canine training categories, since such would reveal nonroutine criminal investigative techniques and procedures (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2] [e] [iv]; <em>see, Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">However, we find that Supreme Court erred in determining that respondents did not have the burden of establishing that redaction of names of individuals was necessary to protect their personal privacy pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (b) and \u00a7 89 (2) <em>(see, Matter of Scott, Sardano &amp; Pomeranz v Records Access Officer of City of Syracuse, </em>65 NY2d 294, 297). We therefore remand the matter for a determination as to whether respondents have met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Reargument granted, and upon reargument, the unpublished decision and order of this Court entered on June 11, 1998 (Appeal Nos. 1512-1512A) is recalled and vacated and a new decision and order substituted therefor.
