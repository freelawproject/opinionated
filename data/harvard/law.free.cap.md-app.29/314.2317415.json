We must reverse because of the State\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 616S (a), the Intrastate Detainer Act. That section provides that an accused who is serving another sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjL\">. . in any correctional institution under the jurisdiction of the Department [Division of Correction] or whenever any county or city jail receives a detainer against any prisoner serving a sentence in the county or city jail any such prisoner shall be brought to trial within 120 days after the request of the prisoner for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint has been delivered to the State\u2019s Attorney ... of the county in which the indictment, information, or complaint is pending and to the appropriate court; <em>provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. </em>The request of the prisoner shall be filed within 30 days of the prisoner\u2019s notification of any untried indictment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>information, or complaint and shall be accompanied by a statement from the warden or superintendent having custody, setting forth the term of the commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the date of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the Board of Parole and Probation relating to the prisoner. The written notice and statement provided herein shall be delivered by certified mail.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 616S mandates that if the case is not prosecuted within the 120 day period, the trial court has no jurisdiction over the matter, the untried charging document is not viable, and the case must be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"AUE\">In the instant case the record discloses that appellant was indicted, <em>inter alia, </em>for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. The indictment was handed down by the Grand Jury for Prince George\u2019s County on May 1, 1974. The appellant, Sherman Elroy Gardner, III, was at that time confined for an unrelated offense at the Maryland Correctional Training Center in Hagerstown, Maryland, where he was serving a three year sentence dating from January 15, 1974. The appellant, upon notice of the detainer lodged as a result of the indictment, executed a \u201cRequest for an Immediate and Speedy Trial\u201d on May 15, 1974 and it, together with the other information required by Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 616S (a), was forwarded to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. While nearly all other paper writings in the record bear a stamped date indicating when the papers were received for filing, neither the appellant\u2019s request for immediate and speedy trial nor the Division of Correction\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Inmate Status\u201d denotes any such stamping or date of receipt. We observe that the Division of Correction\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Inmate Status\u201d was completed by the Division on May 24, 1974, and that it, together with the appellent\u2019s request for immediate and speedy trial, was filed in the record sometime thereafter, but prior to June 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>1974, when appellant\u2019s then counsel moved to dismiss the indictment against appellant, seemingly on the basis of our decision in <em>Matter of Trader, </em>20 Md. App. 1, 315 A. 2d 528 (1974), <em>reversed </em>272 Md. 364, 325 A. 2d 398 (1974). No contention has been made in this Court by the State that appellant did not fully comply with the requisite terms of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 616S. We, therefore, shall presume that there was full compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The threshold question arises as to when the statutory period of 120 days began to run. Because no other date, as we have said, is otherwise indicated in the record, for purposes of this opinion we shall commence the accounting from the date the Certificate of Inmate Status was executed by the Division of Correction, <em>i.e., </em>May 24, 1974. Under that accounting the appellant, absent a continuance for good cause, \u00a7 616S (a), was required to have been tried no later than September 21, 1974, but no trial took place on or before that statutorily prescribed date. The trial was not, in fact, commenced until December 17, 1974, or approximately 90 days after the 120 day period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The State argues that because the appellant, on June 14, 1974, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the Juvenile Waiver Law, formerly Md. Ann. Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 3-808 (4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial court apparently deferred ruling on that motion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pending the decision of the Court of Appeals which had granted certiorari on our decision in <em>Matter of Trader, </em>20 Md. App. 1, 315 A. 2d 528 (1974). The State then contends that the constitutional attack by the appellant precluded him from seeking dismissal of the indictment because he was not brought to trial within the time prescribed by Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 616S (a). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>State\u2019s argument might be valid if the State, at a hearing in open court, at which appellant or his counsel appeared, had requested a continuance \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d bottomed on appellant\u2019s assault upon the constitutionality of the then Maryland Juvenile Waiver Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the State did not so request at the hearing, the trial judge might have considered appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, based upon the allegation that the Juvenile Waiver Act, formerly Courts Art. \u00a7 3-808 (4),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was unconstitutional, as \u201cgood cause\u201d for a continuance pending a resolution of the issue by the Court of Appeals. Neither action was, however, taken. In fact, no hearing was even held on the June 14 motion to dismiss until October 30, 1974, at which time it was denied on the basis of the Court of Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Trader, supra, </em>filed September 13,1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In <em>Barnes v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 262, 315 A. 2d 117 (1974), <em>aff'd State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. 195, 328 A. 2d 737 (1974), Judge Thompson, writing for this Court, pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201c. . . [W]e apply to the Intrastate Act the liberal construction requirement of Section 616J, in order to encourage expeditious and orderly disposition of outstanding charges against a prisoner then incarcerated under a term of imprisonment. \u00a7 616B. . . . Failure to bring the appellant to trial within 120 days from the date of delivery to the State\u2019s Attorney . . . and the appropriate court . . ., requires that the subject indictment be dismissed with prejudice. \u00a7 616S (c).\u201d 20 Md. App. at 268.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>See also Hoss v. State, </em>266 Md. 136, 292 A. 2d 48 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The appellant\u2019s request for trial in the instant case, filed, as we have stated, on May 24, 1974, was, in the words of Judge O\u2019Donnell in <em>State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. at 198, \u201c. . . negatively \u2014 if not affirmatively \u2014 ignored. . . .\u201d The appellant\u2019s motion of June 14, 1974 to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds did not, in any way, by the mere filing thereof, <em>ipso facto, </em>toll the running of the 120 day span <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>prescribed by \u00a7 616S (a). The appellant\u2019s statutory right, properly exercised by him, was ignored, apparently on the misguided or misdirected belief that the June 14, 1974 motion excused compliance with Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 616S <em>(a). </em>As we have previously indicated, the motion might have tolled the statute if the requisite hearing prescribed by \u00a7 616S (a) had been held and good cause for a continuance had been demonstrated. No hearing was held prior to the time that the statute had run its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We believe the closing words of Judge O\u2019Donnell in <em>State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. at 213, clearly and succinctly to state our view in this matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cWe lament the fact that by our decision we are now compelled to discharge one who was convicted by a jury ... [of robbery with a deadly weapon and related charges], but the results are not of our doing. As was cogently observed by Mr. Justice Clark, who delivered the majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 659 (1961): \u2018 \u201cThe criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own existence. ... \u2018If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 Under the facts here, governmental personnel by their laxity and apathy ignored the mandates of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Just as in <em>Barnes, </em>we have no choice but to reverse this case. We do so by reason of the trial court\u2019s having lost jurisdiction over the case 120 days after appellant properly filed, under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 616S, a request for an immediate and speedy trial. The State\u2019s laxity or mistaken interpretation of the clear and unambiguous provisions of \u00a7 616S leaves us with no alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\">. By <em>Laws </em>1975, ch. 554, former Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 3-808 was repealed and reenacted as Courts Art. \u00a7 3-804(d). Courts Art. \u00a7 3-808 as reenacted is now concerned solely with the question of venue. Those provisions of Courts Art. \u00a7\u00a7 4-501 \u2014 4-530 which prescribed a different form of treatment of persons alleged to be juvenile offenders^ in Montgomery County, were repealed by <em>Laws </em>1975, ch. 554, \u00a7 2, effective July 1,1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">.
