Kemp MacDaniel, of the assault of a detective and of hindering two detectives in the lawful performance of their duty. After exhaustively analyzing his reasons for leniency, notwithstanding a presentence report recommending incarceration, Judge MacDaniel imposed the sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">\u201cFor the reasons stated, I am going to fine Mr. Laurie on count one $100 and costs, and I am going to fine him on count two, which is unlawfully hindering the detectives in the performance of their duty, $100 and costs, and place him generally on probation with the understanding that he doesn\u2019t need supervision to the extent of appearing in front of a Probation Officer or anything of that nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">Counsel for appellant asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">\u201cWhat will be the period of probation?\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amk\">to which the judge replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\">\u201cGeneral probation. I am not going to set a period. Normally I would sentence an individual to a year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>in jail, place them on probation for two years, something of that nature. I am not doing it. The main thing I want a general probation for is just in the event Mr. Laurie gets involved in any other problems he can be brought back in. It will be more or less an unsupervised probation. He is not going to have to appear. He has to be interviewed and give some information to the Probation Officer. By the way, this Probation Officer is not the one who made the recommendation of sending him to jail. But any information he needs today, it will be a general probationary type of thing that in short order will be lifted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">MR. STEWART: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">THE COURT: All right. He will be given time, it can be worked out through the Probation Department, to pay the fine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Appellant now argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">\u201cPLACING APPELLANT UNDER \u2018PROBATION GENERALLY\u2019 AFTER SENTENCING HIM TO PAY A FINE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS IMPROPER AND A COMPLETE NULLITY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">His argument relies upon <em>Costello v. State, </em>240 Md. 164, which held that \u201cMaryland law authorizes probation only before verdict and upon the suspension of sentence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 167, and <em>Comm\u2019r of Motor Vehicles v. Lee, </em>254 Md. 279 holding that the imposition of a fine upon plea or finding of guilt is inconsistent with the granting of probation before verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Appellant loses sight of the fact that both <em>Costello and Lee </em>were decided before the Maryland General Assembly enacted a short but comprehensive delineation of a court\u2019s authority to suspend sentences or to grant probation <em>after </em>a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>By Chapter 480 of the Acts of 1970, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641A was adopted. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cUpon entering a judgment of conviction, <em>the court </em>having jurisdiction, <em>may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation </em>upon such terms and conditions as the courts deem proper. The court may impose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a lesser period be served in confinement, suspend the remainder of the sentence and grant probation for a period longer than the sentence but not in excess of five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abz\">Probation may be granted whether the offense is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. <em>If the offense is punishable by both fine and imprisonment, the court may impose a fine and place the defendant on probation as to the imprisonment. </em>Probation may be limited to one or more counts or indictments, but, in the absence of express limitation, shall extend to the entire sentence and judgment. The court may revoke or modify any condition of probation or may reduce the period of probation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Clearly the court is authorized to \u201cimpose a fine and place the defendant on probation as to the imprisonment.\u201d From the first sentence of \u00a7 641A, it would appear that the court may impose <em>and </em>execute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the fine but suspend imposition of the imprisonment, predicating the latter suspension upon terms of probation for a period \u201cnot in excess of five years.\u201d Although the suspension of the imposition of a sentence was recognized prior to the statute, <em>Skinker v. State, </em>239 Md. 234, 238; the Court of Appeals has said that it is a better practice to impose the penalty and then, if advisable, suspend its execution upon probationary conditions. <em>Kelly v. State, </em>151 Md. 87, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The \u201cgeneral probation\u201d given here obviously was not predicated upon the suspension of the fine imposed, since the court provided that the appellant \u201cwill be given time . to pay the fine.\u201d Nor did the court state that it was suspending the imposition of imprisonment, which it was expressly permitted to do by the statute, notwithstanding the imposition of a fine. To the contrary, the judge\u2019s explanation of his reasons for the sentence imposed precludes that intention. When explaining that had he tried the case without a jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\"... I would have still felt you were guilty but I would not have given you a record. I would have given you probation without verdict, given you a fine and forgotten about it. The fact that you chose a Jury trial and have been found guilty is not going to change my disposition of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Even before that, the court described appellant as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\"... not the kind of person who is going to repeat a crime and do something again. <em>He is not a person who needs a jail sentence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In the absence of an expres\u00e9 reservation or a clearly expressed intention to suspend imposition of imprisonment upon probationary terms when a sentencing judge imposes a pecuniary penalty to be paid, the bare addition of probation will not reserve the right to impose an imprisonment sentence if the terms of the probation are violated. When the fine is paid, revocation of probation is meaningless and the probationer can violate its terms with impunity. Thus, such probation is void in the absence of a reservation by the judge of his power to impose imprisonment if the terms of the probation are violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">We further note that the trial judge failed to limit the probationary period to a term \u201cnot in excess of five years.\u201d In fact, when appellant asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">\u201cWhat will be the period of probation? \u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the court replied;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cGeneral probation. I am not going to set a period.... it will be a general probationary type of thing that in short order will be lifted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Although the question of an indefinite term is not raised by appellant, we hold that a probationer is entitled to know the maximum period of probationary living to which he must conform. An indefinite and open-ended \u201cgeneral probationary type of thing\u201d does not comport with the legislative purpose implicit in the expressed five year restriction on probation, any more than a \u201cgeneral incarceration type of thing\u201d would comply with the sentencing requirements for crimes which provide sentence \u201cnot in excess of five years.\u201d We think it is implicit in the language of \u00a7 641A that maximum terms to be served as a probationer must be as definitely described as are terms of imprisonment upon sentencing. <em>Cf. Hyman v. State, </em>29 Md. App. 399, n. 2. Although probationary restrictions may be lessened or discontinued before the maximum is served, a defendant should not be left hanging as to the outside limits of his punishment, and a reviewing court should be assured that the five year limitation has not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">That part of the sentence which we have found illegal is only the \u201cgeneral probation.\u201d We will, therefore, vacate that portion of the sentence which placed appellant on probation. The payment of the fine will fulfill the entire lawful penalty imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Appellant next argues that the trial judge imposed a harsher sentence because appellant elected a jury trial than he would have, had appellant been tried without a jury. That argument just doesn\u2019t wash. The court explained that although he could not strike the jury verdict, he would impose only that which he might have done had he tried the case alone. He was explaining why the jury\u2019s verdict must stand, notwithstanding he might have granted probation before verdict. He also seemed to be explaining why he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>rejected the admonitions of the prosecutor and presentence investigators that appellant should be incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">None of appellant\u2019s pro se arguments, included in his brief as an \u201cexposition of his trial,\u201d were preserved. The amendment to express the charge more specifically in statutory language was admitted only after the trial judge inquired and received appellant\u2019s reply that there was no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">\n<em>That portion of the sentence providing probation vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Baltimore County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">. The distinction between imposition and execution of a sentence recognized in Hite v. State, 198 Md. 602, 607 was not altered by the enactment of Ch. 480, Acts of 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
