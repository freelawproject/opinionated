Both alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that he was a delinquent child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One gave as reason that on 9 July 1974 he had stolen a bike belonging to C. Daniel Saunders (Code, art. 27, \u00a7 340). The other gave as reasons that on 12 December 1974 he had (1) received a pair of binoculars belonging to George Outten, knowing them to have been stolen (Code, art. 27, \u00a7 467), and (2) stolen the binoculars (Code, art. 27, \u00a7 341). The petitioner in each petition was William T. Blackiston, Jr., Deputy Sheriff of Kent County. At an adjudicatory hearing which terminated on 3 March 1975, the court found under the petition concerning the binoculars that appellant was a delinquent child. It dismissed the petition concerning the bike. At a dispositional hearing on 20 March 1975 appellant was committed to the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene for placement at Maryland Training School. The Secretary was directed to provide psychiatric and psychological services. An appeal was noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>THE CONFESSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">At the adjudicatory hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a confession obtained by the authorities from appellant was challenged. Evidence was received on the motion to suppress it. On 11 July 1974 Saunders reported the theft of his bike to the office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Sheriff for Kent County. On 12 December 1975 Outten reported to that office that his home had been broken and entered and that personal property had been stolen. Blackiston and Deputy Sheriff Jess Metcalfe investigated the crimes. Their investigation led them to appellant, one of a group of suspects. On 18 January 1975, about 4:00 p.m., Blackiston and Metcalfe, in uniform and wearing side-arms, went in their official car to the trailer home where appellant lived with his parents. Appellant was the first \u201csuspect\u201d they went to see. Blackiston said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he was my man. I wanted to investigate to find out who was.\u201d The deputies told the parents they wanted to see appellant. Appellant appeared from within the trailer, and Blackiston took him to the car parked nearby to interrogate him. Blackiston testified that he did this \u201cBecause it\u2019s generally my policy to do an interrogation on my grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Appellant was born in January 1958. At age 8 years and 10 months he was in the second grade in a school in Wilmington and was given an I.Q. test known as the WISC (Western Intelligence Scale for Children). His verbal score was 74, performance was 78 and full scale I.Q. was 73. The next year he was placed in the \u201cSpecial and Emotionally Maladjusted\u201d third grade class in a Kent County school. In 1968, 1969 and 1970 he was in primary \u201cspecial education\u201d at Millington. \u201cSpecial education\u201d was \u201ca special placement in classes for children who cannot function or get along in a regular class for various reasons.\u201d In May 1971 he was again given the WISC test and also an achievement test known as WRAT. On the former his verbal score was 75, his performance quotient was 92 and his full scale I.Q. was 81. On the WRAT test his reading level was 3.9, spelling was 4.3 and arithmetic was 3.3. In 1971 he attended the sixth grade at Galena Middle School. He was present 66 days and absent 8 days. He withdrew and his records were sent to Chestertown Middle School on 3 January 1972, although it seems that he did not attend that school. On 14 February he was transferred to Cambridge State Hospital where he remained until 27 March 1974, when he was discharged to his parents. There were home visits, so that the actual time spent in that Institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>was about one year and four months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Institution\u2019s final diagnoses on discharge included \u201cadjustment reaction of adolescence, conduct disturbance\u201d and \u201cborderline mental retardation with other (and unspecified) condition.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The condition on release and prognosis was, \u201cPatient\u2019s condition on leaving was excellent from the physical and psychiatric viewpoint. However, prognosis is considered guarded if patient doesn\u2019t have enough supervision at home and if he doesn\u2019t have a job in the community.\u201d Appellant did not return to school. This was the background of the youth Blackiston took to the police car to interrogate.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\n<em>Circumstances Surrounding the Obtaining of the Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Blackiston sat in the front seat and placed appellant in the back seat. Blackiston testified that he read all the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to appellant and that appellant said he understood them. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Do you knowingly waive these rights?\u2019 and [appellant] didn\u2019t know what the words \u2018knowingly waive\u2019 meant, so I explained to him that if he wanted to talk to me about Mr. Outten\u2019s property he could stop any time and not tell me anything. And he advised me okay.\u201d There was evidence tending to show that the confession was voluntarily in the traditional sense. Blackiston said that neither he nor Metcalfe made any threats, gave any promises or extended any inducements to appellant to get him to talk. Metcalfe, who had remained at the trailer to talk to the parents, appeared about the time Blackiston finished giving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and sat in the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>seat next to Blackiston. The interrogation proceeded. Appellant gave a verbal statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Appellant\u2019s father gave his version of what occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201cHe drove up to the yard and my wife went to the door and said a Trooper car was here, and I said, \u2018What - Trooper,\u2019 and she said, \u2018From Maryland.\u2019 Then they came up to the door and one had his hat on [apparently Blackiston] and the other one didn\u2019t. Before he knocked on the door she opened the door. And he said \u2014 I can\u2019t tell one from the other, but the one that had the hat on said, \u2018Could I talk to Stanford?\u2019, and she said, \u2018Come on in.\u2019 They came in and the short one, the one that didn\u2019t have the hat on, wasn\u2019t completely in the door. My wife called to [appellant], he was in the back, in the back bedroom and he came out of the trailer on th\u00e9 porch part. She said to him, \u2018They want to talk with you.\u2019 Then the one that had the hat on said, \u2018Boy, go to the car.\u2019 They went on to the car. Then the one that didn\u2019t have the hat on, he went out first. He was the last one getting in the car. I watched out the window.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">He denied that the deputies told them why they wanted to talk to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Appellant told what occurred when the deputies arrived:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\u201cI was in the bedroom, in the back bedroom in the trailer, getting my.shirt. Then my mother called me out there on the porch because the policemen was there. Then the young one, with the hat on, asked my father could he ask me some questions. The one in the doorway didn\u2019t say anything. Then we went out into the car and that was when he started asking me questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">According to appellant, he, Blackiston and Metcalfe went out to the car at the same time. Metcalfe said, addressing appellant by his first name, \u201c_, we\u2019ve got some trouble around here and I think you know about it.\u201d Then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Blackiston \u201cstarted reading off my rights.\u201d Appellant denied, however, that anything was said about a lawyer. He said he went with the \u201cpolicemen\u201d because he was afraid they would take him to Chestertown and lock him up.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On cross-examination the State pursued the matter of the voluntariness of the statement in the traditional sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201cQ. Now, did they ever threaten to hit you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">Q. Or beat you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">Q. Did they make any promises or do anything to you that was bad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">A. No sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Blackiston was recalled by the State. He said that when he and appellant went to the car, Metcalfe remained at the trailer to talk to the parents. About ten or fifteen minutes elapsed before Metcalfe came to the car. Blackiston said that when he and appellant first arrived at the car \u201cI introduced myself and advised [appellant] that I wanted to talk to him about George Outten\u2019s home being broken into and some things being taken.\u201d Blackiston iterated that he then gave the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and that appellant said he understood them and waived them. On cross-examination, asked why he did not talk to appellant in the trailer about the Outten matter, Blackiston replied: \u201cI do it differently at times, but I generally take the people out in the car to talk.\u201d He said he tried \u201cto deal with\u201d both adults and juveniles the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\n<em>Admissibility of the Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judge below granted the motion to suppress the confession. Upon our independent constitutional appraisal, see <em>Davis v. North Carolina, </em>384 U. S. 737, 741-742 (1966), we think it was properly excluded. We reach this conclusion for alternative reasons. The confession was inadmissible both because an effective waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to retained or appointed counsel was not shown, and because it was the fruit of a poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The judge below apparently relied on the failure to show a valid waiver of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and right to counsel in holding that the confession was to be excluded. We are in accord. The rule of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966) is that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 444. It is manifest that the statement here was obtained during a custodial interrogation. \u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court noted, <em>at </em>444, n. 4: \u201cThis is what we meant in <em>Escobedo [v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478 (1964)] when we spoke of an investigation which had focused on an accused.\u201d See <em>Myers v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 534 (1968); <em>Duckett v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 563 (1968). Effectuation of the <em>Miranda </em>rights may be waived \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>at 444. \u201cAfter such warnings have been given, and such opportunity [to exercise the rights] afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 479. \u201cIf the interrogation continues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. .. . This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights, <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938), and we reassert these standards as applied to in-custody interrogation. Since the State is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.\u201d 384 U. S., at 475. \u201cMoreover, any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege. The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation.\u201d Id., at 476. Although \u201c[a]n express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement could constitute a waiver,\u201d id., at 475, we believe that the State did not meet its heavy burden to demonstrate that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. In reaching this determination, we have considered the background of appellant, his mental capacity, his education, the separation from his parents in order to interrogate him, the place of interrogation and its conduct by two armed officers. The \u201ccourts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d of fundamental constitutional rights and do not presume acquiesence in their loss. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, </em>at 464. In short, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the background, experience and conduct of appellant, we cannot say that appellant, in the constitutional sense, intelligently relinquished or abandoned his known rights or privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The alternative reason why we think the confession here was inadmissible requires a look at the doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree as it applies in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On 14 January 1963 the Supreme Court of the United States decided <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U. S. 471. Nearly half a century before, the Court held that evidence seized during a search unlawful under the Fourth Amendment could not constitute proof against the victim of the search. <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U. S. 383 (1914). The exclusionary prohibition extended as well to the indirect as the direct products of such invasions. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U. S. 385 (1920). The exclusionary rule had traditionally barred from trial physical, tangible materials obtained either during or as a direct result of an unlawful invasion. It followed from the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 U. S. 505 (1961), that the Fourth Amendment may protect against the overhearing of verbal statements as well as the more traditional seizure of tangible evidence. Thus, verbal evidence which derived so immediately from an unlawful entry and an unauthorized detention may be no less the \u201cfruit\u201d of official illegality than the more common tangible fruits of an unwarranted intrusion. That is, the policies underlying the exclusionary rule do not invite any logical distinction between physical and verbal evidence. <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U. S., at 486.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine may not be applicable where the prosecution has learned of the evidence from an independent source or where the connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint. The Court said, <em>id., </em>at 487-488:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cWe need not hold that all evidence is \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but .for the illegal actions of the police. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u2018whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Although the Fourth Amendment was held to apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643 (1961), the Court of Appeals of Maryland promptly expressed the belief that <em>Wong Sun </em>was not intended to, and did not control state prosecutions. As far as this State was concerned, <em>Wong Sun </em>was buried. When original appellate jurisdiction in criminal causes devolved on the Court of Special Appeals, it followed the lead of the Court of Appeals. For twelve years, those accused and convicted of crimes endeavored from time to time to resurrect <em>Wong Sun, </em>but their attempts were firmly rejected by the appellate courts of Maryland, which steadfastly adhered to the view that <em>Wong Sun </em>did not apply. See cases cited in Ryon v. State, 29 Md. App. 62, n. 13 at 73-75 (1975). In <em>Carter v. State, </em>274 Md. 411, n. 9 at 431-432, decided 11 April 1975, the Court of Appeals indicated some doubt as to its holdings with respect to <em>Wong Sun, </em>but left for another time the question of their continuing viability. That time came three days later when <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, was decided. Characterizing as \u201cdicta\u201d the prior declarations that <em>Wong Sun </em>\u201cinvolved a federal prosecution, not a state one\u201d, and that <em>Wong Sun </em>was \u201cnot intended to, and does not control prosecutions in state courts\u201d, and noting that \u201csuch statements would now appear to have been erroneously gratuitous observations\u201d, <em>id., </em>n. 4, at 478-480, the Court exhumed <em>Wong Sun. </em>It applied the <em>Wong Sun </em>rationale in holding that when information serving as a basis for probable cause was obtained or derived as a result of an illegal search and seizure, the doctrine of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d applies to preclude the use of such information as the basis for a search warrant. <em>Id., </em>at 478-482.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>It now appears that the Supreme Court always deemed <em>Wong Sun </em>controlling in state prosecutions. On 26 June 1975 it decided <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>95 S. Ct. 2254, and the decision was firmly bottomed on <em>Wong Sun. </em>In applying the <em>Wong Sun </em>holdings to determine the validity of a conviction obtained in a criminal prosecution by the State of Illinois, the Court simply assumed without question that <em>Wong Sun </em>controlled. If this left any doubts as to the status of <em>Wong Sun </em>in Maryland criminal prosecutions, they were swiftly resolved. On 30 June 1975 the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case of <em>Ryon v. Maryland, </em>95 S. Ct. 2674. Minnie Sue Ryon had been tried in the Circuit Court for Harford County, convicted of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to life imprisonment. We affirmed the judgment on direct appeal, holding that <em>Wong Sun </em>did not apply to exclude a confession obtained from Mrs. Ryon. <em>Ryon v. State, </em>No. 376, September Term, 1973, filed 11 June 1974, unreported. The Court of Appeals denied certiorari, 272 Md. 747 (1974). The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remanded the cause to that Court \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>Brown v. Illinois.\" </em>Complying with this mandate, we applied the <em>Wong Sun </em>teachings, reversed the judgment below because Mrs. Ryon\u2019s confession was the fruit of the illegal arrest of her, and thus, was admitted in evidence in error, and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Ryon v. State, </em>29 Md. App. 62 (1975). It is clear that the <em>Wong Sun </em>doctrine is now the law of this State.* *****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>We have indicated that the confession was obtained from appellant during a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d of him within the contemplation of <em>Miranda. </em>We think also that appellant was in custody at the time within the contemplation of <em>Wong Sun. </em>When Blackiston took appellant to the car and placed him in the back seat in order to interrogate him, appellant was deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way and was, in fact, being detained. We do not think that a full-fledged arrest is a prerequisite of the application of the <em>Wong Sun </em>doctrine. Cf. <em>Morales v. New York, </em>396 U. S. 102, 105-106 (1969). The question is whether the detention was illegal. We believe it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Courts Art. \u00a7 3-821, as in effect on 18 January 1975, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u201cA child may be taken into custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">(1) Pursuant to the order of the court under the provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">(2) Pursuant to the law of arrest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">(3) By a law enforcement officer or other person authorized by the court when he has reasonable grounds to believe that the child is in immediate danger from his surroundings and that his removal is necessary for his protection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">(4) By a law enforcement officer or other person authorized by the court when he has reasonable grounds to believe that the child has run away from his parents, guardian, or legal custodian.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">It is clear that appellant wras not taken into custody under (1), (3) or (4) of the statute. Nor is there any indication that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Further, the record does not reflect that the deputies had probable cause for a warrantless arrest. Blackiston said that after a report of the crimes had been received from the victims, an investigation was made, after which he and Metcalfe went to talk to appellant. Asked if he went to appellant\u2019s home \u201cfor the possibility of having him confess to the crime of B &amp; E\u2019s around in that area\u201d, Blackiston said, \u201cNot at first. I went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>there to investigate a crime that took place and wanted to know what he knew about it. I never know whether they will confess or not.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Metcalfe said they \u201chad reason to think\u201d appellant was involved in the breaking of the Outten home and that they \u201cunderstood\u201d that appellant \u201chad been riding around Golts\u201d (the place where appellant lived), on a bike similar to the stolen one. This, absent further explanation, is obviously so insufficient to constitute probable cau.se for an arrest that discussion is unwarranted.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Stanley v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 507 (1974), <em>cert. den., </em>271 Md. 745; <em>Hearsay and Probable Cause: An Aguilar and Spinelli Primer, </em>by Judge Moylan of this Court, 25 Mercer L. Rev. 741 (1974). Nor can we find from the record before us that appellant waived his right not to be taken into custody except upon legal grounds. If he freely and voluntarily went to the car with Blackiston and effectively consented to enter and remain therein to be questioned, the burden was on the State to so establish. The record does not show, in the circumstances here, that the State met this burden. We conclude that the detention of appellant, prior to and during the interrogation of him, was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Having found that the detention of appellant was illegal, we consider next the effect of this illegal conduct by the authorities on the admissibility of the confession. In <em>Ryon secundus </em>we found <em>from Wong Sun </em>and the cases related thereto, that statements obtained following an illegal detention were not rendered inadmissible simply because of that illegality, nor were they rendered admissible simply because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were fully given. 29 Md. App. 62 at 71. Admissibility of such statements, <em>vel non, </em>must be answered on the facts of each case, upon consideration of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">(a) the voluntariness of the statement, which is a threshold requirement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(b) compliance with the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards, which is as important in determining whether the statements were obtained by exploitation of the illegal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">(c) other relevant factors, such as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">(i) the temporal proximity of the detention and the confession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">(ii) the presence of intervening circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">(iii) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">In the context of this second reason why the confession was inadmissible, that it was the fruit of a poisonous tree, we assume, for the purpose of decision that the statement was voluntary, and that there was full compliance with the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards. We, therefore, look to the other relevant factors. The confession followed close upon the heels of the illegal detention; there was no significant time lapse. There were no circumstances intervening between detention and the confession. The admitted purpose of the detention was to interrogate and the taking of appellant to the car from his home and the presence of his parents was patently flagrant, the admitted purpose being so the interrogation of appellant could be on Blackiston\u2019s own grounds. Thus, the confession was come at by exploitation of the illegality of the detention and not by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. Therefore, the confession was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">\n<em>THE TANGIBLE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Immediately after obtaining a statement from appellant in the car, the deputies and appellant returned to the trailer. Blackiston asked the parents whether they had seen appellant with a pair of binoculars. The father replied that he had seen binoculars in appellant\u2019s possession \u201cthe other day\u201d and said to appellant, \u201cBoy, ya tell the man where ya have them if you got it around here.\u201d Blackiston\u2019s version of what happened next was that appellant fetched the binoculars from somewhere in the trailer. The father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>version as given at the hearing was that appellant\u2019s mother found the binoculars and gave them to the police. On the record before us, it appeared that the inquiry about the binoculars stemmed from appellant\u2019s statement to the deputies. That is, from the record, we can only conclude that the deputies were led to the binoculars by what appellant told them. There was no evidence sufficient to establish that the deputies learned of the binoculars from a source independent of the confession. Blackiston testified that Outten made a complaint but the records regarding it were not produced. He also said that Outten told them what had been stolen, and that Metcalfe made a list of the articles as described by Outten, but the record is completely silent as to what articles were listed. The record just does not disclose that the authorities knew that binoculars had been stolen from Outten or that they had reason to believe that they were in the possession of the appellant, one of a number of suspects, until they obtained the confession. The deputies did not inquire about or seek the binoculars until they interrogated appellant but they did make inquiry and seek them immediately thereafter. The short of it is that, on the evidence, the binoculars were obtained through the confession and were a fruit of it. There was a causal connection between the confession and the tangible evidence which was not broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>QUESTION FOR DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The question for decision on this appeal is whether, upon proper identification, the binoculars were admissible in evidence at the adjudicatory state of the delinquency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The court below, not having the benefit of <em>Brown, Everhart </em>or our second <em>Ryon </em>opinion, admitted the binoculars in evidence over objection, stating, \u201cIt seems to me that based on the testimony thus far that these have come into the hands of the police without any violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>anybody\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Wong Sun </em>and its progeny teach us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We look first at the admissibility of the binoculars in the frame of reference of the primary illegality being an unauthorized detention. When official misconduct resulting in the primary taint is an unreasonable search and seizure or an illegal arrest or an unauthorized detention, the Fourth Amendment is invoked. Violation of the Fourth Amendment right brings into play the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule applies to render inadmissible both tangible evidence and testimonial evidence derived from the official misconduct and tainted thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>granting the primary illegality, namely, that the detention of appellant was unauthorized, it followed that not only the subsequent confession was illegal, as we have indicated, but also that the binoculars improperly came into the possession of the deputies. The testimonial evidence derived from the detention, and the tangible evidence derived from the testimonial evidence. In other words, the detention led to the confession and the confession led to the binoculars. Each was the immediate, direct and proximate cause of the other with no break in the causal connection by time or circumstances. The primary taint flowed down to the confession and from it to the binoculars. The State did not establish that the binoculars were come at by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. Under the <em>Wong Sun </em>doctrine, the binoculars were inadmissible in the hearing on the delinquency of appellant, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">We next look at the admissibility of the binoculars in the frame of reference of the primary illegality being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>obtaining of the confession from appellant. As we have indicated, an alternative reason why the confession was inadmissible was that it was obtained without an effective waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. This official misconduct invoked the Fifth Amendment. The question is whether the <em>Wong Sun </em>doctrine applies when the primary illegality is a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The State argues- strongly that it does not. It points out: \u201cIn <em>Carter </em>and <em>Everhart, </em>the Court of Appeals had adopted the \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 analogy in the context of illegal searches and seizures.\u201d It asserts: \u201cNo decision in this State, however, has mandated the application of that doctrine where the poisonous tree has Fifth Amendment roots.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It cites and'quotes from George, <em>The Fruits of Miranda: Scope of the Exclusionary Rule, </em>39 Colo.L.Rev. 478 (1967). Professor George, who believed that \u201cto exclude derivative evidence on the strength of <em>Miranda </em>is to push the decision to its outer limits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 489-491. He would not exclude any evidence discovered as the result of a coerced confession. The State quotes in J. Cook, <em>Constitutional Rights of the Accused </em>\u2014 <em>Trial Rights, </em>\u00a7 97 at 362 (1974), entitled \u201cFruits of an illegal confession\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201cOnce it is determined that a statement was improperly obtained from an accused, it follows that any other evidence obtained as a result of the illegality is equally inadmissible. Thus, a confession ostensibly valid may be inadmissible by virtue of the taint of a previously improperly obtained confession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">It answers this assertion by observing that \u201c[n]early all the cases cited by Cook to support his position, however, involve subsequent confessions tainted by previous improperly obtained confessions. Only a few involve the exclusion of tangible evidence the existence of which was uncovered through an illegal interrogation.\u201d We are not persuaded to adopt the State\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Miranda, </em>at 479, declared flatly that until its required warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, \u201cno evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d It warned, <em>id., </em>n. 48, at 479: \u201cIn accordance with our holdings today and in Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 492, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 1765; Crooker v. State of California, 357 U. S. 433, 78 S. Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448 (1958) and Cicenia v. LaGay, 357 U. S. 504, 78 S. Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523 (1958) are not to be followed.\u201d In <em>Harris v. Neto York, </em>401 U. S. 222 (1971), the Court retreated somewhat from this position. Concluding that statements of the accused, taken without informing him of his right of access to appointed counsel, could be used to impeach the direct testimony of the accused at trial, the Court observed, at 224:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cSome comments in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion can indeed be read as indicating a bar to use of an uncounseled statement for any purpose, but discussion of that issue was not at all necessary to the Court\u2019s holding and cannot be regarded as controlling. ... It does not follow from <em>Miranda </em>that evidence inadmissible against an accused in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief is barred for all purposes, provided of course that the trustworthiness of the evidence satisfies legal standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Then in <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>94 S. Ct. 2357 (1974), the Court held admissible the testimony of a witness whom the police discovered as a result of the defendant\u2019s statements which were excluded because in giving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings the police omitted the one that the defendant had the right to free counsel if he could not afford to hire counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In both <em>Harris </em>and <em>Tucker, </em>the misconduct of the police violated only the prophylactic rules developed by <em>Miranda to </em>protect the right against self-incrimination. <em>Tucker </em>at 2361 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>2367. Thus, the exclusionary rule did not apply because its deterrent purpose necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in wilful, or at the very least, negligent conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right. \u201cWhere the official action was pursued in complete good faith, however [as it was in Tucker], the deterrence rationale loses much of its force.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2365. In the instant case, we do not have official action pursued in compete good faith, with the confession rendered inadmissible by the mere inadvertent omission of one of the prophylactic <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We have the confession being obtained in the absence of an effective waiver of the constitutional rights relating to self-incrimination and assistance of counsel to which appellant was entitled.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The rationale of the holdings in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Tucker </em>does not apply to make admissible the tangible evidence obtained here, any more than it would apply to make admissible evidence derived from a confession not voluntary in the traditional sense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Far from limiting the <em>Wong Sun </em>doctrine to Fourth Amendment violations, <em>Tucker </em>expressly invited the application of that doctrine to Fifth Amendment violations in a proper case. The Court, 94 S. Ct. at 2365, quoted what it said in <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U. S. 338 (1974) about the exclusionary rule. Its prime purpose, said <em>Calandra, </em>at 347, \u201cis to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201c \u2018The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u2019 Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 217, 80 S. Ct. 1437, 1444, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Then the Court in <em>Tucker </em>declared, at 2365:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cIn a proper case this rationale would seem applicable to the Fifth Amendment context as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We think the case before us is such a proper case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The weight of authority in other jurisdictions considering the admissibility of tangible evidence derived from statements unlawfully obtained is that such evidence is not admissible. <em>People v. Paulin, </em>306 N.Y.S.2d 929, 934 (Ct. App. N.Y. 1969), held that tangible evidence seized as a result of suppressed statements to the police was properly excluded. The court in <em>People v. Peacock, </em>287 N.Y.S.2d 166 (S.Ct. A.D. 1968), said, at 168: \u201cIf, indeed, defendant\u2019s admissions were the source of the proof against him, we would hold, consistent with the <em>rationale </em>in the cases relating to the use of evidence proceeding from an illegal search and seizure, that the fruits of the unlawful conduct in eliciting the admissions without the mandated warnings were equally excluded.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>155 S.E.2d 96, 99 (N. C. 1967) held that the trial court should have excluded evidence relating to where the police found a pocketbook \u201cbecause they found it in consequence of the incompetent statement,\u201d citing <em>Wong Sun, Silverthorne, </em>and <em>Walder v. United States, </em>347 U. S. 62 (1954). In <em>Commonwealth v. Leaming, </em>247 A. 2d 590 (Pa. 1968), in a homicide prosecution, the location of the victim\u2019s body was a direct result of an admission given by the accused to the police. The admission was found to be inadmissible at the trial. The court said, at 594: \u201cThus, . . . the evidence concerning the finding of the victim\u2019s remains and all evidence pertaining to the body itself was constitutionally inadmissible against him at trial.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Noble </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>v. State, </em>478 S.W.2d 83 (Texas, 1972) found that tangible evidence was the result of a custodial interrogation at a time when the accused had not been properly warned. It held that the evidence was inadmissible as the fruit of the poisonous tree, there being no showing that \u201cthese items would have been obtained regardless by means sufficiently distinguishable from the underlying illegality to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 84. The court in <em>United States v. Cassell, </em>452 F. 2d 533, 541, (7th Cir. 1971), holding that a statement was inadmissible, held \u201calso that the handwriting exemplar obtained by the agents following the admission also was inadmissible as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In <em>United States v. Castellana, </em>488 F. 2d 65, 67, (5th Cir. 1974), the court determined that the accused\u2019s statements were illegally elicited. The question then was. whether tangible evidence should be excluded as derivatives of the accused\u2019s unlawfully elicited responses. It held, at 68: \u201cSince we have found that [the F.B.I. Agent\u2019s] questions constituted unlawful custodial interrogation, and the handguns were the products of those questions, [the accused\u2019s] statements and guns must be excluded from evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Parker v. Estelle, </em>498 F. 2d 625 (1974), was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit between the time of the original <em>Castellana </em>opinion and the rehearing. The court said, at 629, \u201cThere can be no doubt that the <em>Silverthorne </em>principle, announced in a search and seizure context, is applicable to a suppressed confession case. . . .\u201d It noted, at 629, n. 11, what <em>Silverthome </em>said was the policy behind the rule: \u201cThe essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Court but that it shall not be used at all. 251 U.
