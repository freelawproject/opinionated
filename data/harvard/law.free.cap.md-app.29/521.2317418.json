Sometime after that conveyance he improved a garage on the back lot of the property by building two apartments over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The father instituted a suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for sale in lieu of partition. In addition to the value of his one-half interest he sought reimbursement for the improvements and contribution from the children for the mortgage he had paid off after they had become half owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">All issues on appeal relate to the distribution of the funds received from a sale of the property. When the sale was first held under court order, the children\u2019s bid of $80,000 was accepted as the highest. However, even though time extensions were obtained to permit compliance with the contract of sale, they were forced to default. The trustees again offered the parcels for sale at public auction under order of the court \u201c. . . to resell the property described in this proceeding at the risk and expense of the Defendants [the children].\u201d The resale brought a purchase price of $95,500, which was $15,500 higher than the original purchase price bid at the first sale by the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The questions having to do with the distribution of proceeds from that sale, here raised by appeal and cross-appeal, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">1. Should the father be compensated for the improvements he had constructed (two apartments)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">2. Should the children be awarded one-half of the apartment rentals during their co-tenancy (and between the first and second sale)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">3. Who is entitled to the $15,500 increase in the purchase price after the children defaulted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">4. Is the father entitled to contribution for discharging the prior mortgage?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The chancellor did not compensate the father for the value of the apartments,, finding that the father had not met his burden of proof. However, he sought to balance the equities somewhat by denying the children an allowance for rentals therefrom during the co-tenancy. The children were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>awarded the amount of money by which the final purchase price exceeded the price at the initial sale upon which they had defaulted, and were also allowed the rental payments for the apartments between the dates of the two sales. The chancellor also compelled contribution from the children for one-half of the cost of discharging a mortgage which was paid off by the father soon after the creation of the co-tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The Law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cA circuit court may decree a partition of any property ... on the ... petition of any ... tenant in common .... If it appears that the property cannot be divided without loss or injury to the parties interested, the court may decree its sale and divide the money resulting from the sale among the parties according to their respective rights . . . .\u201d Real Property Art., \u00a7 <em>14-107.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Such an action is equitable in nature so that the chancellor is accorded broad discretionary authority. In <em>Dugan and Lyman, Trustees v. Mayor, &amp;c of Baltimore, </em>70 Md. 1, 8, the Court of Appeals quoted Justice Story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201c \u2018In matters of partition\u2019 says Judge STORY, \u2018a Court founds itself upon its general jurisdiction as a Court of equity, and administers its relief, <em>ex oequo </em>[sic] <em>et bono </em>according to its own notions of general justice and equity between the parties.\u2019 1 <em>Story\u2019s Equity Juris., sec. </em>656 b.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Recently, the Court of Appeals has again described the latitude allowed an equity court in distributing the proceeds of a partition sale. Judge Horney wrote for the Court in <em>Bowers v. Balto. G. </em>&amp; <em>E. Co., </em>228 Md. 624, 629:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cWith respect to a sale [in lieu of partition] ..., we repeat what was probably first said in <em>Story v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>1 Y. &amp; C. Ex. 538 (1835), 2 Y. &amp; C. Ex. 586 (1837), that the \u2018Court, in decreeing a partition, does not act ministerially and in obedience to the call of those parties who have right to partition, but founds itself upon its general equitable jurisdiction/ and will \u2018adjust the equitable rights of all the parties interested in the estate.\u2019 .. . And see <em>Meyers v. East End Loan &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>139 Md. 607, 613 . . ., holding that courts of equity do not hesitate to adapt their methods to the exigencies of justice or to protect the equitable rights of those concerned . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Notwithstanding the broad discretion allowed the chancellor, there are certain general principles and guidelines to which he must adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">1. Improvements</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">One such principle relates to the compensation to which a co-owner may be entitled for the value of any improvement he has put upon the property. The chancellor below observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cAlthough there is no Maryland case directly in point the general rule of law seems to be that a co-tenant who makes a substantial improvement to the property, such as the apartments constructed by George Maas, is entitled to be compensated, but only to the extent to which the improvements are shown to have enhanced the value of the property at the time of sale .... the burden is on the tenant who makes the improvements to show that they enhanced the value of the property, and it is in this respect that the plaintiff has failed to support his claim .... The plaintiff here relies on the testimony of Mr. Harry Riepe, an experienced and well known appraiser, but this court has read his testimony carefully and at no time did the witness ever state that at the time of sale the property was more valuable because of the construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>apartments over the garage on the rear portion of the tract. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Appellant agrees in his brief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cIf this assertion by the Trial Court is factually correct, Appellant may not prevail on this point of his appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We find the court\u2019s assertion to be correct both legally and factually. While it may be true that there is \u201cno Maryland case directly in point . . .\u201d there is certainly Maryland authority espousing the principle as being the law of Maryland. In <em>Williams v. </em>Harlan, 88 Md. 1, 5 the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cThere can be no question that as between Win. H. Greenway, and his co-tenants he would be entitled to a lien for the amount expended by him on improvements and repairs made upon the joint property with their knowledge or at their request or in good faith for the benefit of all. This doctrine is fully settled by all the authorities. Mr. Pomeroy in his <em>Equity Jurisprudence, </em>section 1289 says: \u2018When two or more persons are joint-owners of real or other property, and one of them in good faith for the joint benefit, makes repairs and improvements upon the property which are permanent, and add a permanent value to the entire estate, equity may not only give him a claim for contribution against the other joint-owners with respect to their proportional shares of the amount thus expended, but may also <em>create a lien </em>as security for such demand upon the undivided shares of the other proprietors.\u2019 To the same effect 18 Am. and Eng. Encyl. of Law, p. 602; <em>Green v. Putman, </em>1 Barbour 500; <em>Hall v. Piddock, </em>21 N.J. Eq. 311; <em>Gavin v. Carling, </em>55 Md. 530.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In an annotation entitled \u201cAdjustment on partition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>improvements made by tenant in common,\u201d 1 A.L.R. 1189, the rule for \u201cCompensation out of proceeds of sale\u201d concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201c ... if the improvements made by one co-tenant add to the amount which the property will bring on the partition sale ordered, the amount so added is to be paid to him out of the proceeds of the sale, in addition to his pro rata share of the proceeds. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The author of the annotation lists Maryland as being in accord with this proposition, citing <em>Hogan v. McMahon, </em>115 Md. 195, 202-3, and invites comparison with <em>Gittings v. Worthington, </em>67 Md. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">However, as Judge Raine pointed out, the extent of a co-tenant\u2019s right to compensation for improvements is the extent to which his improvements enhance the value of the property at the time of sale. 59 Am.Jur.2d, \u00a7 53. Thus,' compensation based upon the original cost of the improvement or even the replacement cost is not allowed \u201cbecause it might result in the other owners being improved out of their property by an extravagent or unbusinesslike co-tenant, and the improvement may have depreciated at the time of the sale.\u201d Anno. 1 A.L.R. 1189,1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">A review of the testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness affirms Judge Raine\u2019s observation. The testimony elicited was based upon replacement cost rather than on the amount by which the property was enhanced by virtue of the improvements at the time of sale. We certainly find no abuse of discretion in rejecting the testimony as failing to establish a foundation for compensation. <em>Cf. Trainer v. Lipchin, </em>269 Md. 667; <em>Stratakis v. Beauchamp, </em>268 Md. 643. Nor do we find the chancellor\u2019s conclusion that the tenant\u2019s improvements had not been shown to have enhanced the value of the property to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">2. Rent</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Although a co-tenant is normally entitled to an accounting for rent for three years prior to suit, <em>Colburn v. Colburn, </em>265 Md. 468, 474, the chancellor refused to award to the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>any rent which accrued prior to the first sale. In doing so, he expressly exercised his broad equity discretion in distributing the proceeds of a partition sale, as heretofore noted. The chancellor\u2019s opinion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, one co-tenant must account to the other for rents received from third parties. On the other hand the court has the power to adjust the equities between the parties. Even though the facts in <em>McLaughlin v. Barnum, </em>31 Md. 425, are different this court reaches the same result, for to do otherwise would be inequitable. Where the costs of the improvements were borne by George Maas and contribution to him has been denied herein, it would be a gross inequity to deprive him of the net rental income. As pointed out by the defendants it would be inequitable, if not outrageous, to deny the children an off-set for the rents against an allowance to the father of the credit for improvements. It would be equally inequitable to deny the father\u2019s claim for improvements, but to allow the children to share in the rental income that flowed solely from the improvements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We find no error. In <em>Gittings v. Worthington, </em>67 Md. 139, 149, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly within the power of a court of equity to adapt its methods to the exigencies of justice, ... for the purpose of relieving the hardship of a particular case.\u201d (recited with approval in <em>Godwin v. Banks, </em>89 Md. 679, 688 relating again to partition).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The chancellor was clearly within his authority. We note, however, that he did not attempt to apply that discretion to the rents that accrued between the first and second sale of the property, and for good reasons hereafter stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">3. Overage</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Upon default following their successful bid at the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sale, the. children, by decree, bore the risk that the resale might bring less than the bid they had defaulted upon. <em>Mealey v. Page, </em>41 Md. 172, 183. Fortune smiled on them, however, and the resale brought more, not less, than their original bid. The chancellor awarded the children the $15,500 excess, and we think properly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Miller, <em>Equity Procedure, </em>\u00a7 526 explains the resale procedure under Chapter XXVI entitled \u201cSALES UNDER DECREES,\u201d citing <em>Mealey, supra, </em>as authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201c\u00a7 526. Disposition of proceeds of sale. \u2014 When a re-sale is made the proceeds are to be disposed of as follows: the costs, fees and expenses of the re-sale, including the proper commissions, are to be deducted; and also the amount of the original purchase money due, with interest from the date of the first sale to the date of the receipt of the purchase money of the second sale. The proceedings for a re-sale, after final ratification, treat the first contract as binding on the original purchaser. The property is re-sold as the property of the defaulting purchaser, and at his risk. He is therefore entitled to any excess in the proceeds of sale at the re-sale, just as he would be responsible for any deficiency. The purchaser is to be charged with the whole purchase money and costs of the re-sale, and credited with the payments he has made, and with the proceeds of the second sale. If the latter amounts are not sufficient to pay the sum for which the property was first sold, the purchaser is to be charged with the deficiency. The application of the cash paid as a credit on his purchase is in no sense a forfeiture inasmuch as he is entitled to any surplus which may remain.\u201d [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The chancellor followed this directive to the letter. As our case law indicates, so have numerous other chancellors in Maryland. The theory was explained in <em>State v. Hoboken Bank, </em>84 Md. 325, 330 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201c . . . under a judicial resale the property is in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>again put under the hammer, it is put there not as a new, distinct independent procedure, but as a means and solely as a means to realize the money which the original but defaulting purchaser failed to pay. The resale takes place under the original decree, supplemented by an order. It is made by the same trustees, in the same proceedings and with a view to pay off the same indebtedness for the payment of which the property was sold in the first instance, and the money realized by it is always applied precisely as would have been applied the money bid at the original sale had that money been paid by the first purchaser. The resale is simply an execution of the decree for a sale. Its very name imports that it is not such a new sale as to be a distinct proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The rationale is stated with simplicity in <em>Cont. Tr. Co. v. Balt. Refrig. Co., </em>120 Md. 450, 456 which explains that where the trustee at a sale has accepted a purchaser, and the sale has been approved and ratified, such purchaser becomes the equitable owner of the property. The first contract of sale was not set aside, but the re-sale \u201cwas a summary proceeding for the enforcement of that contract, and the property was resold as the property of the purchaser and at its cost and risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The same <em>ratio decidendi </em>was applied by the chancellor to the rents for the period between the two sales. That ruling is supported by rulings of the Court of Appeals from at least as early as 1868, until at least as late as 1968. In <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank of Md. v. Clarke, </em>28 Md. 145, 156 it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">\u201cAs the purchaser is made to bear all loss by depreciation subsequent to the time of sale, he should be entitled to all profit that he may be able to make of the property after that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In <em>Merryman v. Bremmer, </em>250 Md. 1, 8, Judge Barnes wrote for the Court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">\u201cThe purchaser is entitled to the rents and profits of the land sold as he has become the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>owner of the property. He is not only entitled to possession of the property, but it remains at his risk, even though legal title may not be conveyed. <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank v. Clark, </em>28 Md. 145 (1868). Miller, <em>Equity Procedure, </em>\u00a7 512, page 604 (1897). If the land appreciates in value that benefit accrues to the purchaser; if it depreciates in value that is the purchaser\u2019s loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">None of these cases involved the precise factual posture before us. Here the defaulting purchasers were also beneficiaries of the sale. Because of their purchase at the original sale and subsequent default, they have realized a greater amount of money as their share of the distribution than did the father. This resulted from the chancellor\u2019s division of the original purchase price between the co-tenants and his subsequent award of the entire excess of the second purchase price over the first to the defaulting purchasers. While this division is founded upon sound judicial precedent, in this particular case such a distribution allows one tenant to deprive his co-tenant of the true value of the property. It might have been avoided had Judge Raine been asked to order some procedure upon default other than sale at the original purchaser\u2019s risk which he was empowered to do under Md. Rule BR6, \u00a7 c which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cIn case of default by the purchaser in a sale reported to the court, the court, on application, . . . may order a resale at the risk and expense of such purchaser, or <em>may take such other action as justice may require. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">4. The Mortgage Pay Off</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">At the time of the dissolution of the marriage in 1943, appellant and his wife conveyed the property by straw deeds to a straw party who reconveyed it to appellant and his children as tenants in common. Both straw conveyances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>warranted the property specially and contained covenants that the grantors (parents) had done:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201cno act, matter or thing whatsoever to encumber the property hereby conveyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There was in existence at that time, however, a mortgage on the property executed by the real grantors, appellant and his wife, (as opposed to the straw party to whom they had represented that warranty). Less than one year later,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellant discharged the mortgage by full payment of the $4,770 balance due. The children did not assume any obligation under the mortgage, nor was the mortgage assigned to appellant upon discharge for subrogation or otherwise. The payment was made and full release recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Citing <em>Hogan v. McMahon, </em>115 Md. 195, 203, appellees, as cross-appellants, recognize that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">\u201c \u2018Where a tenant in common discharges a mortgage upon the joint property, equity treats him as an assignee of the mortgage as against his co-tenants interest in the property, and this though no actual assignment is made.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">They further concede (this time, citing <em>Aiello v. Aiello, </em>268 Md. 513) that the right of contribution can be enforced by obtaining an assignment, or by asserting a right of subrogation as a surety, or by enforcing an equitable lien against the co-tenant\u2019s interest. See also annotation, 48 A.L.R.2d 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">However, they contend that the father no longer has such relief available because of the lapse of over 25 years after he had a right to seek such relief. They base this conclusion on one or all of three equitable and legal reasons: laches, limitations and/or estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">We find that the court below erred in awarding the father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>contribution for the discharge of the mortgage, although the chancellor\u2019s motivations were unquestionably equitable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cit would be inequitable, even outrageous, to allow the children to force their father to assume the whole burden of the mortgage when they received the benefit of his payment discharging the mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Notwithstanding that \u201ccourts of equity do not hesitate to adapt their methods to the exigencies of justice or to protect the equitable rights of those concerned . . .\u201d, <em>Myers, supra, </em>139 Md. at 613, there is a barrier which even the \u201cexigencies of justice\u201d may not penetrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Here a presumption of a gift to appellant\u2019s infant children, <em>Brandenburg v. Harshman, </em>193 Md. 104, 110; <em>Quillen v. Bell, </em>158 Md. 677, 683; <em>Fister v. Fister, </em>222 P. 2d 620 (Colo.), by his having paid off the mortgage, is bolstered by deeds declaring the property was conveyed unencumbered. The children were the objects of the father\u2019s natural bounty which \u201cis of itself a circumstance sufficient to raise an inference that a gift was intended. .. .\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Restatement (Second), <em>Trusts, </em>\u00a7 442 b; <em>Lacey v. Van Royen, </em>259 Md. 80, 88-89. In light of the total absence of evidence to overcome the inference of a gift, the express conveyance \u201cwithout encumbrances\u201d from the parents through 'a straw party, and the release of the mortgage by the father with no attempt to secure a right to contribution by subrogation, assignment or lien (see <em>Aiello v. Aiello, </em>268 Md. 513, 519); no equitable right in the father has been shown entitling the chancellor to balance the equities by forcing the children to contribute to the pay off of a mortgage which occurred more than 20 years prior to the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The authority upon which a co-tenant is ordinarily entitled to contribution for discharging a mortgage traces to <em>Hogan v. McMahon, supra, </em>relied upon by both parties. Further scrutiny of that authority revealingly distinguishes it from the facts of this case. <em>Hogan </em>relies primarily upon two cases, one from Maine and one from Maryland preceding <em>Hogan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The Maine case, <em>Look v. Horn, </em>97 Me. 283, is quoted as saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201c \u2018Where a mortgage is discharged <em>on payment made by one of the joint mortgagors, </em>or his successors in interest, it may be treated in equity as still subsisting for the protection of the party making payment, or the delinquent\u2019s share in the mortgaged premises may be regarded as subject to a lien for the amount paid on the mortgage for his benefit.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Hogan v. McMahon, </em>115 Md. at 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Here the children were not \u201cone of the joint mortgagors,\u201d they were not indebted at all. The joint mortgagors were the father and his former wife. If not indebted, they were not delinquent and, consequently, there is no \u201cdelinquent\u2019s share in the mortgaged premises\u201d to which a lien could attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The Maryland authority is more direct, if less explicit. <em>Parsons v. Urie, </em>104 Md. 238 holds that when one or more of several tenants in common pays the joint mortgage debt on their land, he is entitled to have the mortgage <em>kept alive </em>so as to secure reimbursement of the amount paid from his co-tenants. That case reasons first from the more basic premise that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cIt must be conceded that the general principle is that the payment of an incumbrance by one whose duty is to pay extinguishes it, although there are exceptions to the general rule which are as well settled as the rule itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">One of these well settled exceptions was expressed and applied as controlling.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201cIt is well settled that if one tenant in common pay a mortgage debt, he can \u2018keep the mortgage on foot until reimbursed the moiety paid for the other tenant in common.\u2019 <em>Stebbens v. Willard, </em>53 Vt. 665; <em>Look v. Horn, </em>97 Me. 283.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Although the exception noted in the Maine case that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>co-tenant was also a co-mortgagor was not expressed as a qualification to the rule laid down in <em>Parsons, </em>we note that the Court in <em>Parsons </em>looks to the Maine case for its authority. We also note that <em>Parsons </em>\u2019 facts indicate that the co-tenants were also mortgagors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The father provided us no reply brief as cross-appellee, and we know of no authority that would permit the chancellor to impose a personal debt upon the children where none ever existed. Upon remand the children should be relieved of the obligation to contribute to their father\u2019s mortgage which he discharged over a quarter of a century ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>Case remanded for amendment of the decree in conformity with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>Costs to he divided equally.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\">.
