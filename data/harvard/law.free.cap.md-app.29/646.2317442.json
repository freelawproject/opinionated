On 26 March Howell noted an appeal. On 7 April, Kaschenbach\u2019s motion for a new trial was heard and denied. On 25 April he noted an appeal. By our order of 10 July 1975, upon motion of the State, and pursuant to Maryland Rule 1035 b (3), we dismissed the appeal noted by Kaschenbach \u201cinsofar as it goes to the judgment . . . entered on February 27, 1975, ... as not having been filed with the lower court within the time prescribed by Maryland Rule 1012. . . .\u201d We further ordered Kaschenbach\u2019s appeal, \u201cinsofar as it goes to the denial of a motion for a new trial, be, and is hereby, limited to the issue of the propriety of the trial court in its denial of that motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">\n<em>THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">At the guilt stage of the trial, Clough testified that while driving on the Beltway he gave two hitchhikers a ride. When he stopped to let them out \u201cthe guy in the front pulled a gun out, and stuck it up to my head, and asked me if I had any money, and I told him I didn\u2019t. Then he said, get out. So I got out.\u201d He described the gun: \u201c [i]t was a .22, it looked like a .22 to me anyway. ... It was, I think it was just like a black or darkish color.\u201d On cross-examination he was asked how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>he arrived at the conclusion that it was a .22. He said: \u201cWell, I\u2019d seen a lot of .22s, and when I saw it out of the corner of my eye, that\u2019s what it looked like pretty much to me. ... It was a dark color, like a blackish or a dark blue.\u201d Shortly after the commission of the offense, Howell and Kaschenbach, on foot, were seen by Corporal Franklin E. Pugh of the Baltimore County Police. Pugh had received a report of the Clough incident over his police radio, and the men he saw answered the description of the felons. He accosted the two men. \u201cAt this time I observed a small handgun laying on the ground behind the two subjects, directly beneath, behind them. . . . And when I stopped them when I looked down directly behind the two subjects I was standing in front of, the handgun was laying on the ground.\u201d Pugh described the weapon: \u201cIt was a model 1969 .22 caliber gas, made in Italy, black with brown plastic grips.\u201d Kaschenbach had \u201ca small brown holster\u201d hooked to his belt \u201cright in the small of his back.\u201d The gun and holster were received in evidence without objection. Howell testified in his own defense. On cross-examination he said that he knew that Kaschenbach carried \u201cthis tear gas gun for self protection. ... He told me about it, but that\u2019s the first time I seen it, that night.\u201d Kaschenbach also testified. He admitted that he \u201cdid carry a tear gas gun for my protection, because last year I was jumped by six guys, and it\u2019s on record at Essex Police Station, and so I purchased a gun, which is not fatal but is harmful, to give me enough time to get away from attack.\u201d He did not have a permit for it, \u201c. . . I didn\u2019t think I needed one; I didn\u2019t know if it was actually illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">At the hearing on Kaschenbach\u2019s motion for a new trial, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney told the court: \u201cYour Honor, we have secured the services of a mutually acceptable expert in the person of Mr. Howard Donahue.\u201d Howard T. H. Donahue, the owner of Donahue\u2019s Gun Specialties, was called by Kaschenbach and gave his qualifications. The State stipulated \u201cas to Mr. Donahue\u2019s qualifications as an expert witness in the field of guns generically.\u201d He was shown the gun admitted in evidence. Donahue said that he had examined it a short time ago in his shop. Upon questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>by defense counsel he testified, as we understand it, that the weapon could not be readily converted \u201cby normal, simple tools\u201d into a conventional pistol which would fire bullets. There was a baffle which made very difficult the drilling out of the barrel to open it completely. On cross-examination, however, he discussed the explosive mechanism used to discharge the weapon. He was shown two copper caps. He identified each as \u201ca tear gas projectile.\u201d One had been fired. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that one has been fired by seeing a relatively heavy imprint of the firing pin on the rear of the place and also the slightly swollen nature of the place, which would indicate an explosion took place within.\u201d According to Donahue, \u201cAs far as the weapon is concerned, the name tear gas is a misnomer.\u201d He explained: \u201cTear gas is a rather large quantity of very fine particles, it\u2019s not actually a gas at all. And to fire it, firing would expel these projectiles, which are very highly irritating to the eyes. . . . My opinion is that if the gun were pointed at somebody\u2019s face, whether it contained blank or tear gas, at close proximity, that is, two feet or less, it would be extremely destructive to an individual\u2019s eyes.\u201d The witness was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">\u201c [I]n the case of the weapon you have examined, and that you have in your hand at this moment, and relating that weapon to the casings, which I have also asked you to examine, do I understand correctly that it is your opinion that the propellant for the tear gas, the infinitely small tear gas projectile you referred to, is some form of explosive?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Donahue replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cWell, chemically you have a mercury oxide cyanate, or fulminate of mercury, or one that stiffenates, which is a nitrate compound, and it\u2019s an explosive; in fact, they are both extremely violent explosives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The court inquired: \u201cThe fulminate of mercury, or whatever the other term is, is the explosive propellant, is that correct, sir? I mean, the explosion causes whatever else is in that cap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>to be propelled?\u201d Donahue said that was correct. The court pursued the matter. Donahue answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cNow, that explosive causes whatever is in there to be propelled?\u201d The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201c. . . . Now, that which is in there, not the explosive itself, but whatever content the cap has, when the explosion takes place, and that is propelled, is that destroyed upon contact, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">THE WITNESS: Do you mean the chemical preparation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">THE WITNESS: Is that destroyed on contact with the individual it strikes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">THE COURT: Yes, sir, or whatever it may strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">THE WITNESS: It possibly will go into a solution. But that I do not know. I know that the gas is a highly irritant property; whether it\u2019s destroyed or not I do not know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">The General Assembly, concerned with the increase of crimes of violence, took action by enacting ch. 13, Acts 1972, adding new sections 36B-36F, entitled \u201cHandguns\u201d, to art. 27 of the Code. In so doing it set out these findings and declarations in \u00a7 36B (a) as a \u201cDeclaration of policy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-13\">\u201c(i) There has, in recent years, been an alarming increase in the number of violent crimes perpetrated in Maryland, and a high percentage of those crimes involve the use of handguns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">(ii) The result has been a substantial increase in the number of persons killed or injured which is traceable, in large part, to the carrying of handguns on the streets and public ways by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-15\">(iii) The laws currently in force have not been effective in curbing the more frequent use of handguns in perpetrating crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>(iv) Further regulations on the wearing, carrying, and transporting of handguns are necessary to preserve the peace and tranquility of the State and to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Subsection (d) of \u00a7 36B provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">\u201cAny person who shall use a handgun in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article,!<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall, in addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor, be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than five nor more than fifteen years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than the minimum sentence of five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Section 36F (a) defined \u201chandguns\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201cThe term <em>\u2018handgun\u2019 </em>as used in this subheading shall include any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person, including a short-barreled shotgun and a short-barreled rifle as these terms are defined below, except it shall not include a shotgun, rifle or antique firearm as those terms are defined below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In <em>Todd v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 127, 135 (1975), we found it to be the legislative intent in the \u201cHandguns\u201d statute \u201cto include any hand weapon simulating the appearance of a pistol or revolver that is capable of discharging a missile by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>any method of propulsion.\u201d We believed that legislative use of the word \u201chandgun\u201d rather than the more restrictive word \u201cfirearm\u201d was a matter of deliberate choice. <em>Id., </em>at 138. In reaching the finding in <em>Todd, </em>we looked to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1973) for the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><em>Gun </em>\u2014 A weapon consisting essentially of a metal tube from which a projectile is fired at high velocity into a flat trajectory. A device that shoots a projectile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\"><em>Handgun </em>\u2014 A firearm that can be used with one hand; a pistol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\"><em>Firearm </em>\u2014 Any weapon capable of firing a missile, especially a pistol or rifle using an explosive charge as a propellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\"><em>Missile </em>\u2014 Any object or weapon that is fired, thrown, dropped or otherwise projected at a target; projectile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The same dictionary states that a \u201cpistol\u201d is \u201cA firearm designed to be held and fired with one hand.\u201d It defines \u201cprojectile\u201d as \u201cA fired, thrown, or otherwise projected object, such as a bullet, having no capacity for self-propulsion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged (1968) gives as a meaning of projectile \u201ca body projected by external force and continuing in motion by its own inertia.\u201d It illustrates a use of the word: \u201csubatomic particles used as projectiles in atom smashing.\u201d It sets out as a \u201cspecific\u201d definition, \u201ca missile for a firearm, cannon, or other weapon.\u201d It defines missile as \u201ca weapon or other object thrown or projected (as a stone, bullet, or artillery shell).\u201d \u201cWeapon\u201d has been judicially defined in Maryland. In <em>Bennett v. State, </em>237 Md. 212, 214-215 (1964), the Court of Appeals adopted the language of 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson\u2019s ed., 1957), \u00a7 961, p. 111, stating that a weapon \u201cis generally defined as anything used or designed to be used in destroying, defeating, or injuring an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>enemy, or as an instrument of offensive or defensive combat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Todd, </em>it was manifest that the weapon propelled a projectile, and the issue turned on the nature of the propellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is manifest that the propellant was an explosive charge, and the issue turns on whether the weapon propelled a projectile. The evidence adduced was legally sufficient to show, in light of the definitions above set out, that the weapon here propelled projectiles, and the expert witness so testified. \u201cTear gas\u201d, he explained, \u201cis a rather large quantity of very fine particles, it\u2019s not actually a gas at all. And to fire it, firing would expel these <em>projectiles, </em>which are very highly irritating to the eyes.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (emphasis added). We think that the size of the projectile is of no moment. Whether it be as big as an artillery shell or as small as a subatomic particle, it is still a projectile.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">That the weapon in question was a gun is plain. That it may be carried and used in the hand is equally clear; so it was a handgun. It projected an object by means of an explosive force, and it had the appearance of a .22 caliber pistol. We have found that what it propelled were projectiles or missiles. It was capable of inflicting serious injury; \u201cit would be\u201d, the expert said, \u201cextremely destructive to an individual\u2019s eyes.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, its characteristics were such as to meet all the requirements of a handgun within the contemplation of the \u201chandgun\u201d statute. We hold that its use in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence as defined by art. 27, \u00a7 441 was a misdemeanor proscribed by \u00a7 36B (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Our holding is a narrow one. It is that a weapon, in the form of a pistol<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which will, or which is designed to, or which may readily be converted to expel, by an explosive force, tear gas in the form of finely divided solids or particles, is a \u201chandgun\u201d within the meaning of art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 36B-36F.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Kaschenbach asks if the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial \u201cwhere the evidence clearly reveals that the State had failed to show that a tear-gas gun is a handgun under Article 27, Section 36B (d)?\u201d Our holding that the weapon here was a handgun in the contemplation of the statute is dispositive of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Howell also urges that the court below erred in deciding that a tear gas gun is included under the handgun statute. Under our holding the court did not err.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>We give a caveat. It necessarily follows from our holding that a weapon of the type which is the subject of this opinion comes under all of the provisions of the handgun statute. Such a weapon is, therefore, subject not only to the proscriptions against unlawfully wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, \u00a7 36B (b), and unlawfully using a handgun in the commission of certain crimes, \u00a7 36B (d), but also to the provisions requiring a permit to carry a handgun, \u00a7 36E. We point this out because there is indication in the record before us that at the present time those charged with issuing handgun permits take the view that a permit is not required to carry such a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Howell, whose appeal goes to the propriety of the judgments against him, also questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\n<em>The Conviction of Assault with Intent to Rob</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The testimony of Clough was legally sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of an assault with intent to rob him as charged, and Howell does not argue to the contrary. Howell attacks the proof of his criminal agency, claiming that \u201cthe identification in this instant case was questionable and not believeable.\u201d We observe that Clough made a positive judicial identification of Howell as one of the felons. This was enough in law for the trier of fact to find the criminal agency of Howell. The allegations of Howell that the lighting at the time of the commission of the crime was poor and that Clough was uncertain in an identification at an initial confrontation, go only to the weight to be given the judicial identification. We note that in addition to the positive judicial identification of Howell, he was apprehended shortly after the commission of the crime in the proximity of the car stolen from Clough, that he fit the description given by Clough to the police, that he was in the company of another who fit the description of the second felon, and that a weapon answering the description of the weapon used in the crime was found at Howell\u2019s feet when he was accosted by the police. We hold that the court was not clearly erroneous in its judgment that Howell was a criminal agent in the assault with intent to rob. Maryland Rule 1086; <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>The Conviction of the Use of a Handgun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">At the trial Clough identified Howell as the person who \u201cpulled a gun out, and stuck it up to my head, and asked me if I had any money. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This evidence was legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>sufficient to sustain the conviction of Howell of the misdemeanor of using a handgun in the commission of a felony. <em>Broadway v. State, 23 </em>Md. App. 68, 75-80 (1974); Code, art. 27, \u00a7 12; <em>Williams v. State, supra. </em>The trial court was not clearly erroneous in its judgment that Howell was guilty as charged under the third count of the indictment. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">\n<em>As to Leonard Francis Kaschenbach, Jr.: order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">As <em>to Lowell Douglas Howell, Jr.: judgments affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\n<em>One-half costs to be paid by Leonard Francis Kaschenbach, Jr.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>11</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. The convictions were under the second and third counts of the indictment jointly charging them. The court found both accused not guilty on the first count charging the assault of Clough \u201cbecause that merges into the second count.\u201d The State \u201cabandoned\u201d the fourth count, charging the larceny of the use of Clough\u2019s automobile. This is according to the transcript of the proceedings at the guilt stage of the trial. At the penalty stage the court observed, \u201cThe State abandons counts one and four.\u201d We note that the docket entry under date of 27 February 1975 reads: \u201cState abandons counts 1 and 4.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. The judge imposed sentence thus: \u201cAs to both Defendants, on count number two, five years in the Department of Correction, suspended indefinitely.

For long past the General Assembly of Maryland has been concerned with the use of dangerous and deadly weapons in the commission of crimes. In 1886 it created the crime of wearing or carrying a weapon concealed upon or about the person or of wearing or carrying it openly with the intent of injuring any person unlawfully. Acts 1886, ch. 375. Although frequently amended, the substance of the 1886 Act remained the same. The Act as amended is now codified as art. 27, \u00a7 36. In 1927 a more severe penalty for the common law offense of robbery was authorized when that felony was committed with a dangerous and deadly weapon. Acts 1927, ch. 457, now codified as art. 27, \u00a7 488. In 1933 the Legislature enacted the Uniform Machine Gun Act. Acts 1933, ch. 550, codified as art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 372-383, included the declaration that possession or use of a machine gun in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a crime of violence was a felony, \u00a7 373, and the possession or use of a machine gun for offensive or aggressive purpose was a penitentiary misdemeanor, \u00a7 374. Machine guns must be registered, \u00a7\u00a7 378-379. In 1941 the General'Assembly regulated the sale, transfer and possession of pistols and revolvers. Acts 1941, ch. 622; Code, art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 441-448. Section 445 (c) proscribed the possession of a pistol or revolver by any person \u201cwho has been convicted of a crime of violence, or of any of the provisions of this subtitle or who is a fugitive from justice or a[n] habitual drunkard, or addicted to or an habitual user of narcotics, barbiturates or amphetamines. . . Section 445 (b) prohibits the sale or transfer to such person or to \u201cany person under twenty-one years of age as required by federal law.\u201d In 1971, the misdemeanor of carrying a deadly weapon upon school property was established. Acts 1971, ch. 614; art. 27, \u00a7 36A. It was a year later that the General Assembly, more and more concerned with the increase of crimes of violence, took further action by enacting the \u201chandgun\u201d statute. In 1973, it became a felony under the law of this State for an individual to have certain weapons, whether open or concealed, on or about his person, \u201cwhile aboard or with intent to board an aircraft engaged in certificated air commerce services.\u201d Acts 1973, ch. 334; Code, art. 27, \u00a7 36A-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">These various statutes covered a variety of weapons. The \u201ccarrying or wearing weapon\u201d statute, art. 27, \u00a7 36, as first enacted, applied to \u201cany pistol, dirk-knife, bowie-knife, slung-shot, billy, sand-club, metal knuckles, razor or any other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind whatsoever (penknives excepted).\u201d As in effect in 1971 the same weapons were proscribed and \u201cswitchblade knife\u201d had been added, the exception being changed to \u201cpenknives without switchblade.\u201d With the enactment of the \u201chandgun\u201d statute in 1972, \u201cpistol\u201d was eliminated and \u201chandguns\u201d were excepted. By Acts 1974, ch. 718, \u201cnunchaku\u201d, defined as \u201ca device consisting of two pieces wood, metal, plastic, or other like substance connected by any chain, rope, leather or other flexible material not exceeding 24 inches in length\u201d was added. \u00a7 36 (a) and (b). As now in effect, \u201chandguns\u201d are without the ambit of the \u201ccarrying or wearing weapon\u201d statute. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Legislature excluded pistols and other handguns from the provisions of the \u201ccarrying or wearing weapon\u201d statute, it included in \u00a7 36B, provisions comparable to those in \u00a7 36. In addition to making it a felony to use a handgun in the commission of crime by \u00a7 36B (d), the statute, by \u00a7 36B (b) made it a misdemeanor for any person to wear, carry, or transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, upon or about his person, or to wear, carry or knowingly transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, in any vehicle traveling upon, the public roads, highways, waterways, or airways or upon roads or parking lots generally used by the public in this State. Punishment for first and subsequent offenses were set out in \u00a7 36B (b) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Exceptions were provided in \u00a7 36B (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Neither the statute authorizing a greater penalty for robbery committed with a dangerous and deadly weapon nor the \u201ccarrying or wearing weapon\u201d statute defined \u201cdangerous and deadly weapon.\u201d Judicial decision has defined \u201cweapon\u201d, as we have indicated, as anything used or designed to be used in destroying, defeating, or injuring an enemy, or as an instrument of offensive or defensive combat. Bennett v. State, <em>supra, </em>214-215. It is necessary to show, however, that the weapon is dangerous or deadly, Vincent v. State, 220 Md. 232 (1959), proof of either being sufficient, Bell v. State, 5 Md. App. 276 (1968). See Hayes v. State, 211 Md. 111 (1956). The character of a weapon as dangerous or deadly is not necessarily determined by its design, construction, or purpose. It is when a weapon is in fact used in such a way as is likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm, that it may properly be regarded as a dangerous or deadly weapon. Bennett v. State, <em>supra. </em>A knife may be either a deadly or only a dangerous one, depending on the size of the blade and the manner of its use. Bell v. State, <em>supra. </em>A \u201cgravity knife\u201d has been held to be a dangerous and deadly weapon. Savoy v. State, 236 Md. 36 (1964). A microphone cord on a taxi radio may be a dangerous weapon. Bennett v. State, <em>supra. </em>An unloaded pistol is at least a dangerous weapon. Hayes v. State, supra; Wallace v. Warden, 226 Md. 670 (1961). A starter\u2019s pistol is a dangerous weapon, Jackson v. State, 231 Md. 591 (1963), as is a gun fully loaded but not fireable, Myers v. State, 237 Md. 632 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">. Although it is manifest that at the guilt stage of the trial, the judge concluded that the weapon here was a handgun within the ambit of \u00a7 36B, the reasons for his conclusion were not readily apparent from the transcript of the trial. He had no doubt that it was \u201ca dangerous and deadly weapon\u201d, referring to Hayes v. State, 211 Md. 111 (1956), but the problem was whether there was any authority that the legislature included in \u201cthe generic term handgun\u201d, starter pistols, cap pistols or a tear gas gun. Although the weapon was \u201ca gas pistol and not an honest to heavens Jesse James pistol\u201d, he ruled that it was a handgun under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In denying the motion for a new trial, the court was more specific. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>accepted an opinion of the Attorney General, 58 O.A.G. 572, 576 (1973), which found it \u201cabundantly clear that the term handgun as defined in Section 36(P\u2019) of Article 27 of the Annotated Code of Maryland covers the same weapons as contemplated in the \u2018Gun Control Act of 1968\u2019, codified at 18 U.S.C. 921 (3). The Gun Control Act of 1968 defines firearm as \u2018. . . any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm.\u2019 . . . There can be no question but that the definition of firearm contained in the Gun Control Act of 1968 contemplates and includes the definition of a handgun under the Maryland Statute.\u201d The court observed that the testimony of Donahue was that the weapon here \u201ccould not be corrected to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, other than any projectile which it was already designed to expel.\u201d The court discussed \u201cprojectile\u201d, and found that the weapon in question fell within the definition of a device \u201cdesigned to expel a projectile by the action of an explosion.\u201d The court made an alternative finding, that the weapon fell within the definition of \u201cany destructive device\u201d set out in subsection (D) of the federal statute. \u201cBecause the testimony before the court, and common sense, tell us that this device, if used in close proximity to the skin or the eyes, would have a certain destructive effect. . . The court continued: \u201cSo that under either approach it is the court\u2019s opinion that this device falls within the definition as set forth by the Legislature, and certainly falls within the contemplation of the Legislature at the time of the passage of this Bill. In other words, the court is holding as a matter of law that the Legislature, through its language, had the legislative intent to include within the prohibition contained in Article 36 [B] devices such as the State\u2019s exhibit in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">We need not, and do not now, determine whether the Maryland handgun statute covers the same weapons included in the federal Gun Control Act of 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\">. Clough was requested by the prosecutor \u201cto leave the witness stand, come right down into this part of the courtroom, and I want you to look around carefully, and see if you can identify in the courtroom today anyone whom you saw on that night that this robbery took place.\u201d Clough identified two persons. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">\u201cA. One is sitting in the back, all the way to the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">THE COURT: Go back and put your hand on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">THE WITNESS: This one right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>MR.

They were Howell and Kaschenbach. But the record does not reflect, at this point, which of the two was the one who held the gun. We have cautioned before that care should be taken to have the record properly show what was obvious to those present. That the man who held the gun is \u201cRight here\u201d, does not tell the reader of the record who the man is. Fortunately, the matter was cleared up in the record on cross-examination of Clough. Howell\u2019s attorney stated in examining Clough: \u201cYou have told the court that Lowell Howell, this tall boy, is the one who held the pistol.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b679-16\">. Howell, as an indigent, applied to the Public Defender for assignment of counsel to represent him on appeal. The appearance of an assigned public defender to represent him was entered. Kaschenbach was represented on appeal by privately retained counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b679-7\"><em>Lowe, </em>/.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlX\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In 1928 Mr. Justice Charles Evans Hughes pointed out that judges are constantly sustaining the validity of legislation which as legislators they would probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>condemn. That is within the judicial aegis and our proper function. We exceed that function when we extend the scope of legislatively proscribed activities to include that which the legislature \u201cmight\u201d have meant to proscribe, but did not clearly so indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Most laws, by their nature, curtail activities that, but for the law, would be accepted and continued as a matter of right. It is my view that, when our lawmakers restrict these rights in an effort to accommodate the needs of contemporary society, the restriction should be limited to that which is clearly stated without additional limitations being placed upon the activities of our citizens by our judicial interpretation of what we believe the lawmakers <em>might have intended </em>to include. This should be so without regard to our opinion of the activities restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">I raised no dissent in <em>Todd v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 127, but my silence was maintained with some trepidation when I considered how far the language of that opinion might carry us. The journey is already upon us. There, as pointed out by the majority here, we found it to be the legislative intent in enacting Sections 36A through 36F of Article 27,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201c ... to include any hand weapon simulating the appearance of a pistol or revolver that is capable of discharging a missile <em>by any method of propulsion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">I can at least question the correctness of our decision in <em>Todd', </em>I do dissent from our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Whatever our own view of the propriety of outlawing tear gas guns may be, it can play no part in our interpretation of the intent of the Legislature in enacting its handgun proscription. \u201cWe must not be guilty of taking the law into our own hands, and converting it from what it really is to what we think it ought to be.\u201d <em>Rex v. Ramsey, </em>1 C &amp; E 126, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">In interpreting the statute in <em>Todd, </em>we sought the intent of the Maryland Legislature by referring to the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, 1st Department, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma and <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. </em>In extending our interpretation of the Maryland Legislature\u2019s intent to include tear gas as a projectile, we now have rung in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">If tear gas consists of projectiles as declared by the majority, so even more does the wadding of a blank cartridge starter pistol since the black powder residue will penetrate the skin when fired in close proximity thereto. Reasoning from the sublime to the ridiculous, we couple <em>Todd\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u201cany method of propulsion\u201d to the majority\u2019s view of a projectile and conclude that a water pistol falls more readily within the judicial definition of a handgun than does a tear gas gun. While the majority assumed the projectile must be capable of inflicting injury, we find no such requirement in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Both in <em>Todd </em>and here, the majority relied upon the \u201cDeclaration of policy\u201d prefacing the statute in question. That declaration said in effect that the \u201csubstantial increase in the number of persons killed or injured\u201d is traceable to the carrying of handguns on the streets and public ways by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity. The restriction placed upon \u201cwearing, carrying and transporting handguns\u201d was intended to reverse that trend. Nowhere do I find indicia of legislative intent therein indicating that the General Assembly meant to include in that restriction air guns or tear gas pistols.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">It seems to me that the facts of both <em>Todd </em>and the instant case are indicative that the legislation is effective, if only to a limited degree. When criminals resort to air pistols <em>(Todd, supra) </em>and tear gas guns, the danger of death and serious injury in the perpetration of crime is greatly lessened. The declaration of policy indicates (to me) that since we cannot find the means to stop crime absolutely, the danger of death or injury from the commission thereof with a handgun will be made more difficult and especially onerous, toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>end that life and limb may be preserved while we continue to seek the solution to the preservation of property as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">In addition to the declaration of policy, the majority finds sustenance in the Legislature\u2019s choice of the term \u201c \u2018handgun\u2019 rather than the more restrictive word \u2018firearm\u2019. ...\u201d I agree that this wording was a \u201cmatter of deliberate choice; \u201d however, I cannot agree that \u201cfirearm\u201d is more restrictive than \u201chandgun.\u201d By the majority\u2019s own definition, taken from <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1973), a \u201cfirearm\u201d is <em>\u201c[a]ny weapon </em>capable of firing a missile.\u201d (Emphasis added). That term includes long arms as well as handguns and long arm inclusion in the handgun law was clearly not the legislative intent. \u201cFirearms\u201d may be more restrictive as to the means of propulsion; however, it does not restrict the type of projectile.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Common sense (for which I cannot cite judicial authority) leads me to conclude that if the Legislature intended to proscribe the \u201ccarrying, wearing or transporting\u201d of tear gas, it would have done so, not only when carried in the shape or form of a \u201chandgun\u201d but in whatever other form it may take, such as a fountain pen, cosmetic compact, cane or other such container purchasable as a weapon of self defense. It is inconceivable that the Legislature would subject a person to imprisonment merely because of the shape of the tear gas container he carried and not do so to another carrying an equally dangerous but differently shaped container. I have taken the liberty of assuming that the majority would be willing to accept a restriction on their definition requiring that the shape of a handgun should at least resemble a \u201cpistol, [or] revolver,\u201d if not under the maxim \u201cnoscitur a sociis,\u201d since those descriptive terms are used in the definition in \u00a7 36F, then by their express reference thereto in the \u201cnarrow holding.\u201d See p. 10 of majority opinion. Without that shape restriction, a permit would be required to transport aerosal bombs and shaving cream dispensers.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Even more does my unauthoritative common sense lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>me to the conclusion that the term \u201cprojectile\u201d upon which the majority opinion turns (spoken of in one of the dictionary definitions), should be viewed in the context of its use, <em>ie., </em>that which is fired from a handgun. We are hard pressed to reach a result when we must consider sub-atomic gaseous-like particles as projectiles in the same category as the bullet in a cartridge or the shot in a shell. The majority\u2019s opinion of the Legislature\u2019s intent to include tear gas guns is supported entirely by a semantic foundation of lexical morphemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">It is my opinion that if the General Assembly wishes to create the crime of transporting tear gas weapons or add a mandatory penalty for using them to perpetrate a crime, it should say so in a clear enough manner that we need not seek its intent in New York, Oklahoma, the District of Columbia or scattered among proliferate terms in various dictionaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
