This was made manifest in <em>Beard v. State, </em>216 Md. 302 (1958), in which a divided Court attempted to deal with the problem. The majority opinion held, in essence, that a form of indictment charging the current offense and alleging the historical fact or facts of one or more prior offenses was valid. In other words, an indictment for a subsequent offense must contain an averment as to a prior offense, and such an averment and proof thereof did not deprive the accused of a right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>McCoy v. State, </em>216 Md. 332 (1958), <em>cert. den. </em>858 U. S. 853, <em>Garrigan v. Superintendent, </em>218 Md. 662 (1958), <em>Toyer v. State, </em>220 Md. 205 (1959), and <em>Torres v. Warden, </em>227 Md. 649 (1961) generally applied the <em>Beard </em>holding, but several serious questions, pointed up In <em>Beard, </em>were left unanswered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The opinion of the Court in <em>Beard </em>suggested that the Kules Committee consider the matter. 216 Md., at 320. See <em>Torres, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>at 653, n. 2. The result was the proposal of Maryland Rule 713, which was adopted by the Court of Appeals on 15 September 1961, effective 1 January 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Rule 713 answered the questions. It first deals with the indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201cIn a case where a greater punishment is prescribed for a second or subsequent conviction of the same offense the indictment for each succeeding offense shall charge only the current offense and shall not refer to the fact that the State intends to prosecute the defendant as a second or subsequent offender.\u201d Section a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">It next provides for notification to a defendant that he is to be prosecuted as a second or subsequent offender:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cThere shall be attached to such an indictment an addendum which shall warn the defendant that the State has evidence that he has formerly been convicted of the same offense, including the date and court in which he was previously convicted, that it intends to prosecute the accused for the current offense as a second or subsequent offender, the maximum punishment which may be imposed upon the defendant if he is convicted of the current offense and found to be a second, or subsequent offender, and the right of the accused under this Rule to elect that the issue of whether or not he is a second or subsequent offender be tried concurrently with the trial for the current offense or be determined by the court or jury after the verdict on the current offense.\u201d Section b.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Section c prescribes that the indictment and addendum shall be served as are indictments under Rule 706. Section d, \u201cTrial-Election by Defendant\u201d; \u00a7 e, \u201cFailure to Elect\u201d; \u00a7 f, \u201cSeparate Trial of Subsequent Offender Issue\u201d; \u00a7 g, \u201cRecess or Dismissal of Jury\u201d; and \u00a7 h, \u201cNew Jury Challenges\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>pertain to the trial. We summarized their provisions in <em>Ware v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 302, 306 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cThe accused may elect that the issue of whether or not he is a second or subsequent offender be tried concurrently with the trial for the current offense, or that the issue be determined separately after the verdict on the current offense. Also, he may waive a jury for determination of that separate issue, even though the current offense is tried before a jury. The second proceeding is not a trial of guilt, but the determination of an issue. That issue is simply the historical fact of a prior conviction and the identity of the defendant as the person so convicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In a prosecution of an accused for a current offense as a subsequent offender, only one sentence is proper. It is error to impose separate sentences on the current offense and the addendum. <em>Ware v. State, supra, </em>at 306-307; <em>Reid v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 6, 8-9 (1970), <em>cert. den. </em>259 Md. 735; <em>Simmons v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 355, 368-369 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">THE CASE <em>SUB JUDICE</em></p>\n<p id=\"ApX\">\n<em>Statement of the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">On 3 April 1975 Bernard Sullivan was convicted at a bench trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore of carrying a handgun on his person in violation of Code, art. 27, \u00a7 36B. On 28 April he was sentenced to 6 years. He appealed. On appeal, he does not contest the validity of his conviction. The questions he presents go only to the legality of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">At the guilt stage of the trial, the State proved its case by an agreed statement of facts given by the prosecutor. The defense did not offer evidence. A verdict of guilty was rendered. The State told the court that it had no recommendation as to sentence but that there was \u201cinformation provided from the NCIC with respect to the defendant\u2019s previous record....\u201d The prosecutor said: \u201cMy record reveals that he is currently on probation for a handgun violation to March 12, 1977.\u201d There were no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>prior convictions. The judge indicated that he was going to impose a sentence of six years. Defense counsel pointed out that Sullivan was not charged as a second offender. The court asked: \u201cDoes he have to be under the statute?\u201d The issue was cleanly drawn. The State argued that under art. 27, \u00a7 36B an accused could be sentenced as a second or subsequent offender without being prosecuted as such. The defense maintained that to be subject to an increased sentence, an accused must be charged as a subsequent offender and that such charge must be proved. The court held the imposition of sentence <em>sub curia.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">When the court convened for the penalty stage, memoranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and argument were received from counsel, and the court again deferred the imposition of sentence. The proceedings resumed' two weeks later. It was the position of the defense that Rule 713 was applicable, and that in the absence of compliance with that Rule, Sullivan could not be punished as a subsequent offender. The State claimed that art. 27, \u00a7 36B was without the ambit of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>The Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The crime of which Sullivan was convicted was created by the General Assembly by ch. 13, Acts 1972, effective the date of its passage on 27 March 1972. The dominant purpose of the Act was to stop the alarming rise in the use of handguns in the commission of crimes of violence. <em>Wright v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 309, 317 (1975). See \u201cDeclaration of Policy\u201d, art. 27, \u00a7 36B (a). The provisions of subsection (b) are relevant to the case before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Subsection (b) makes it a misdemeanor for any person to \"wear, carry, or transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, upon or about his person\u201d, and to \u201cwear, carry or knowingly transport l* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] any handgun, whether concealed or open, in any vehicle upon the public roads, highways, waterways, or airways or upon roads or parking lots generally used by the public in this State.\u201d The subsection prescribes the punishment on conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">(i) if the misdemeanant had not been previously convicted of a violation of \u00a7 36B, or of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of \u00a7 36, or of carrying a deadly weapon on public school property in violation of \u00a7 36A, \u201che shall be fined not less than two hundred and fifty ($250.00) dollars, nor more than twenty-five hundred ($2,500.00) dollars, or be imprisoned in jail or sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than 30 days nor more than three years, or both; provided, however, that if it shall appear from the evidence that the handgun was worn, carried, or transported on any public school property in this State, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment of not less than 90 days\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">(ii) if the misdemeanant had previously been once convicted of such crimes, \u201che shall be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than 1 year nor more than 10 years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than the minimum sentence of 1 year; provided, however, that if it shall appear from the evidence that the handgun was worn, carried, or transported on any public school property in this State, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment of not less than three years\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">(iii) if the misdemeanant had previously been convicted more than once of such crimes \u201cor any combination thereof\u2019, \u201che shall be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than three years nor more than 10 years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than the minimum sentence of three years; provided, however, that if it shall appear from the evidence that the handgun was worn, carried, or transported on any public school property in this State, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment of not less than 5 years\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(iv) if it shall appear from the evidence that a handgun \u201cwas carried, worn, or transported with the deliberate purpose of injuring or killing another person, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment of not less than five years\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>The Ruling of the Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">In sentencing Sullivan to six years the trial judge held that Rule 713 did not control the procedure to be used in art. 27, \u00a7 36B. He adopted, in substance, the view of the prosecutor. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cOn April 3rd, Bernard Sullivan was convicted by me in this court of a handgun violation under warrant 47500885.1 found at that time as a matter of fact that Bernard Sullivan did on or about December 23rd 1974 unlawfully wear or carry on or about his person a handgun in violation of Article 27 Section 36B and after the verdict of guilty was entered I was informed by the State that the defendant had previously been convicted of a handgun violation on March 13, 1974. I then proceeded to sentence the defendant to six years. The penalty as a second offender being a maximum of ten years rather than a maximum of three years as a first offender. Mr. Sullivan was tried under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Section 36B. He was not tried as a second offender as such. The question before me is whether a separate allegation or charge of a prior conviction under Article 27 Section 36 or 36B must be made before a penalty under Article 27 Section 36B (b) (ii) can be imposed. The defendant was convicted under Subsection (b) of Section 36B which prohibits the unlawful wearing, carrying, or transporting of handguns and this subsection further prescribes the penalties in paragraphs one through four. The legislative intent expressed in Article 27 Section 36B shows an intent that the handgun law was passed to provide for more stringent penalties. This is evidenced by the provisions for mandatory minimum sentences in Section 36B. It is also apparent by combining the substance of the crime with the penalties for first, second, and subsequent offenders into one subsection that the legislature is mandating the court to impose sentence on the basis of the record of the defendant rather than allowing sentencing to depend on whether a separate second offender section has been charged. When the defendant, Bernard Sullivan, was charged with a violation of Section 36B he was put on notice that if he was a second offender then he would be subjected to the penalties of paragraph two and I hold that no separate addendum is necessary. As was stated in Ware versus State 13 Maryland Appeals 302 at 305, \u2018an addendum is no more than a warning to a defendant that the State intends, upon conviction of the offense charged in the indictment, to seek the imposition of a more severe punishment because of his previous conviction of the same or a related offense\u2019. And I hold that Rule 713 does not control the procedure to be used in Article 27 Section 36B.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\n<em>Issue for Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The issue for decision is whether the sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>was legal. Sullivan attacks the sentence by advancing three contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cI. Appellant was denied due process of law when he was sentenced as a second offender without first having been charged as a second offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">II. There was not sufficient evidence to convict and sentence the Appellant as a second offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">III. The Appellant received an illegal sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">We do not agree with the trial judge. We think that an accused whom the State intends to prosecute as a subsequent offender must be given notice that comports with art. 21 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland, and the State and federal constitutional guarantees of due process of law. We believe that Rule 713 adequately and appropriately takes this into account.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no proper basis, in any event, for a conclusion that Rule 713 was not intended to apply to art. 27, \u00a7 36B. The mere fact that the statute authorizes more severe punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>a subsequent offender is not sufficient notice in the constitutional sense that the State intends to prosecute an. accused as a subsequent offender. The Rule, by its dear and unequivocal language, governs a case \u201cwhere a greater punishment is prescribed for a second or subsequent conviction of the same offense.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (b) so prescribes and the procedures of the Rule must be followed with regard to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We agree with Sullivan that there was no evidence sufficient to establish a prior conviction. The fact of a prior conviction of a crime within the contemplation of \u00a7 36B (b) had to be proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt. It offered no <em>evidence </em>whatsoever on the matter. The \u201cproof\u201d consisted merely of a statement by the prosecutor: \u201cMy record reveals that he is currently on probation for a handgun violation to March 12,1977.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We conclude that the six year sentence imposed was illegal. Sullivan was not prosecuted as a subsequent offender as required by Rule 713. Therefore, unless there was compliance with Rule 713, he could only be punished upon conviction of the current offense proscribed by art. 27, \u00a7 36B (b), as a person who had not been previously convicted of a crime which, under that statute, subjected him to increased punishment. Thus, the maximum sentence authorized upon his conviction was three years. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 36B (b) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">We add these observations. Sullivan was tried in the Criminal Court of Baltimore under a statement of charges prepared by a police officer and filed in the District Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> M.D.R. 706, \u00a7 c 3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The crime alleged was a misdemeanor, Code, art. 27, \u00a7 36B (b), with an authorized penalty of a fine of not more than $2500 and imprisonment of not more than three years, \u00a7 36B (b) (i). Therefore, the District Court had concurrent jurisdiction with the Criminal Court of Baltimore. Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (c). \u201cIndictment\u201d as used in Rule 713, includes \u201ca grand jury indictment, a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>information and a charging document as defined in Maryland District Rule 702 (Definitions).\u201d By M.D.R. 702, \u00a7 a, \u201ccharging document\u201d means \u201carrest warrant, summons to a defendant, statement of charges, citation, or criminal information.\u201d The District Court has no rule comparable to Rule 713. In view of our conclusion that in a circuit court trial a person may not be subject to the increased punishment authorized by art. 27, \u00a7 36B unless he is prosecuted as a subsequent offender under procedures prescribed by Rule 713, the question is how these procedures are to be fulfilled under District Court charging documents. See <em>Moaney v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 408 (1975). The further question, arises as ta how a person is to be so prosecuted in the District Court, in the light of the fact that Rule 713 does not apply to that Court and that the District Court has no comparable rule. These questions are not before us, but it may be that the Rules Committee will deem it advisable to consider them in the contemplated revision of the Criminal Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>Conviction affirmed; sentence vacated; case remanded for imposition of a legal sentence.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\">.
