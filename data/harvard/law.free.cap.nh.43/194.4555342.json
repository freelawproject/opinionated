Bach member could have but ten shares, and he must be or become a subscriber for one share for every sum of $500 thus bid off by him, and pay the dues thereon. The articles also contained provisions for the redemption of the mortgaged premises \u201c by the payment of an amount to be determined by the directors\u201d; for the investment of the funds \u201c not required for advances to members\u201d; and for the termination of the association whenever its funds should be sufficient to pay all liabilities and $500 on each \u201cunpurchased share\u201d; in which case the debts -were to be settled, and such dividend made to the holders of such shares, and no further monthly dues were to be paid. Where, agreeably to these articles, a member of the association owning ten shares, upon bidding off ten such sums of $500, received therefor, after the deduction of the premiums, $2110, and gave his bond and mortgage to secure the payment by him to the association of the interest on the $2110 monthly, and the monthly dues upon his ten shares, and his fines according to the articles:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Held, </em>that the contract was not usurious, unless it was in fact a device to evade the statute as to usury; that whether it was such a device was a question of fact; and that from the mere terms and provisions of this contract the court could not, as matter of law, hold it usurious:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-5\"><em>Held, </em>also, that where the condition of such mortgage had been broken, the plaintiffs, to whom it had been executed as trustees for the association, in an action upon the mortgage, wore entitled to a conditional judgment for the full amount due according to the terms of the condition, as the contract was not upon its face usurious, and had not been shown to he so in fact.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-6\">\"Writ or Entry, on mortgage, to recover possession of certain real estate in Hooksett, in this county, for condition broken, and the purpose of foreclosing the right in equity to redeem the same.

In May, 1857, in accordance with the rules of the association, he sold to the association, according to article 14, his ten shares, and received $2110 for the same, and at that time gave said bond and mortgage, conditioned, among other things, to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>two dollars per month upon each of his ten shares, and the interest upon the $2110, every month, making the $30.55 each month, and in case of failure to pay said sums monthly, to pay certain fines, specified in the articles of association. There was paid monthly, June, $25.50 ; July, $30.55 ; and August, 1857, $30.55. In March, 1858, the defendant paid $106.25, being the interest for seven months, but no part of the dues on the shares, of which sum $32.40 was passed to credit of fines, and the balance to interest.

For neglect to pay these monthly dues, the member is liable to a fine for each share of twelve cents for the first month, twenty-five cents for the second, thirty-seven cents for the third, fifty cents for the fourth, and one dollar for each succeeding month. All shares on which no payment is made for six months, are forfeited, though the directors may, in certain cases, remit the forfeiture. Members paying their dues- three months or more in advance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>are entitled to interest at the rate of six per cent. Whenever the funds of the association amount to $500, that sum is to be \u201c put up to competition,\u201d and the member offering the highest premium is to have it, \u201cfor the purpose of building, or purchasing freehold or leasehold premises, or removing incumbrances therefrom.\u201d This transaction is termed in the articles, \u201cpurchasing shares,\u201d but, if not colorable, is, in fact, nothing more than the member receiving $500, less the premium, at the time, in lieu of the $500 to which he would be entitled at the winding up of the association. It is^ the sale of his right to the $500, when it shall accrue, for a less sum in hand. No member can \u201cpurchase \u201d more than ten shares, and he must be the owner of a number of shares equal to the number he shall thus \u201cpurchase,\u201d or become so by subscribing and paying the value of such as he has not already subscribed and paid for; or, in other words, he must pay or have paid the dues upon one share for every $500 that he thus obtains, and he can obtain but ten such sums in all. A member purchasing one such sum, could, at the time of the purchase, elect to receive nine more at the same rate of premium, and upon the same terms, in which case the nine amounts were to be paid him out of \u201cthe next moneys to be received.\u201d Among other things, \u201cthe purchaser\u201d is required to give his bond, secured by mortgage of the real estate, for the payment of his monthly dues and fines, and the interest, which, under the name of \u201c a redemption fee,\u201d is to be paid monthly, at the rate of six per cent per annum. Article 17 provides for a redemption of the mortgaged premises, by payment of an amount to be determined by the directors. Whenever there are funds enough to pay all liabilities, and $500 on each \u201cunpurchased\u201d share, the debts are to be paid, and such a dividend is to be made to the holders of such shares, and no further monthly dues are to be paid, but the association is to terminate. The agreed case states that the association was limited to eight years ; but in the articles, which are made part of the case, we find no provision for a termination, other than that already stated. The funds, not required for advances to members, were to \u201cbe invested upon bond and mortgage, or such other security\u201d as should be determined, agreeably to the articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We can see that, in such an association, the relative advantages of the accumulators and the borrowers, as they are sometimes termed, may be by no means equal, and that a member obtaining an advance may, in some cases, be subjected to an exorbitant rate of interest; but we can not, as matter of law, pronounce the contract, upon which such advance is made, usurious. The monthly payment is not, apparently, exacted for the advance, but for the privilege of membership, and of ultimately sharing the dividend. Although the member obtaining an advance upon all his shares is to receive no dividend, he still continues interested in the profits of the association, as the time at which his payment of monthly dues and interest will cease is dependent upon them. If the transaction here is to be regarded as an advance to Dunn, it was from funds in which he had a common interest with the other members, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>which he continued interested, and \u201cis to be regarded as a dealing with the partnership funds,\u201d rather than as a loan. <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>6 Bing. N. C. 180; <em>Gilpin </em>v. <em>Enderly, </em>5 B. &amp; Ald. 954; Chit. Cont. (10th Am. Ed.) 774; <em>Burbidge </em>v. Cotton, 8 E. L. &amp; Eq. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">If the transaction is to be deemed a sale by Dunn for a present sum of his right to a future dividend of $500 upon each share, it seems no more open to objections than somewhat similar transactions in <em>post obit </em>bonds, annuities, stock contracts, and negotiable securities. 2 Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. 897; Chit. Cont. 774, 775; Story Cont., secs. 595, 600; <em>Beetee </em>v. <em>Bidgood, </em>7 B. &amp; C. 453; <em>White </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>3 B. &amp; C. 277, by <em>Bailey, J. </em>The contract does not provide for the return of the sum advanced at all events. The association has other means of accumulation beside the monthly payments and the interest on advances ; and, whatever may be the probabilities in fact, we can not say, as matter of law, that, by the contract, Dunn will ever be obliged to refund the $2110 ; for, whether he will be called on at all, and if so, for how much, will depend on the gains of the association; for as soon as these are sufficient for a dividend of $500 on each \u201cunpurchased share,\u201d his payments are to cease. 1 Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. 896-898; Chit. Cont. 774; Story Cont., sec. 600. As the provision for fines applies equally to all members, whether obtaining advances or not, and as it can be avoided by making the payments as they fall due, we can- not hold it usurious, however harsh we may deem its terms. <em>Citizens\u2019 Association </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>25 Barb. 263; <em>Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Ainsworth, </em>22 Barb. 118; 2 Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. 898; Chit. Cont. 775. <em>We </em>can not, therefore, pronounce the contract upon its face usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">These views accord with the current of decisions elsewhere: <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Barnes; Burbidge </em>v. <em>Cotton; Citizens\u2019 Association </em>v. <em>Webster; Merrill </em>v. <em>McIntire, </em>13 Gray 157; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>McIntire, </em>13 Gray 168; <em>Bibb Association </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>21 Geo. 592; Chit. Cont. 773. In Pennsylvania, the court seem to have held a transaction, differing somewhat in form from the present one, usurious, upon the ground that it was a mere cover to effect loans at illegal rates of interest. <em>Kempfert </em>v. <em>Building Association, </em>30 Penn. 465; <em>Hughes\u2019 Appeal, </em>30 Penn. 471. But, under our practice in an action at law, we understand that to be a question of fact for the jury. In the <em>Building Association </em>v. <em>Meriden Co., </em>24 Conn. 160, there was a loan to a party who was not a member. <em>The Building Association </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>24 Conn. 147, is not in conflict with the views we entertain. In that case, upon a somewhat different state of facts, the court, sitting in equity, found that a direct loan was made at fifteen per cent interest, and held that a statute' allowing the association to take \u201ca bonus,\u201d in addition to the legal rate of interest, did not authorize it to take an additional interest of nine per cent, under the name of \u201ca bonus.\u201d Although we can not say, as matter of law, that the present transaction was usurious, it does not follow that it was not so in fact. However benevolent may have been the original purpose of such associations, we can not fail to see that they may easily be perverted to become instruments of extortion, and mere covers for usury. It is said that, \u201c\"Where a contract is not on the face of it usurious, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>is always a question of fact for the jury to determine whether it is a mere device to evade the statute, or is a <em>bond fide </em>transaction, to which the statute does not apply, the intention of the parties being the test of the legality of the transaction. Story Cont., sec. 601; Chit. Cont. 779. Where the parties have made the contract which they intended, and, without any mistake of fact, have secured by it illegal interest upon a loan, perhaps the question of their intention to violate or evade the statute may not be material. 2 Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. 896; Story Cont., sec. 597. Where it is alleged that, under color of a transaction not unlawful upon its face, an attempt has been made to evade the statute, that question is for the jury. <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Barnes; Tate </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>3 T. R. 538; <em>Gilpin </em>v. <em>Enderly, </em>2 Pars. Cont. 420; Story Cont., secs. 593, 595, <em>600; </em>2 Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. 896, 897; <em>Train </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>2 Pick. 152; Chit. Cont. 780, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Unless the defendant desires a discharge of the ease, in order to try this or some other question, there must be a conditional judgment for the plaintiffs, lor the full amount due according to the terms of the mortgage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
