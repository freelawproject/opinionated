that two suits were brought against said Rollins by his creditors, in which Robinson was summoned as his trustee, and that a suit was brought by Rollins against Robinson to recover the debt alleged to be due from Robinson to him; that at the February term, 1854, of this court, when those suits were pending, Robinson came to him (Wood), he being the attorney of the plaintiff in those suits, and desired a continuance of the trustee suits, and that no more questions should be put to him that term in his disclosure therein, which had been commenced before that time; that Wood objected to this, and insisted on completing the disclosure; that Robinson said that if he would grant his request, the matter should be settled up before the next term of the court, and offered to pay a large sum if it was not settled; that Wood consented, and at Robinson\u2019s request, as counsel for said creditors, signed and delivered to Robinson the following agreement: \u201cIn the action,\u201d &amp;e., describing it, \u201cI agree to ask said Robinson no more questions than I feel bound to do as counsel, and if all the questions are answered, and the said.disclosure signed, I will place the same in the hands of the clerk of the court, to be by him kept until sworn to at such future time as may be necessary, provided the plaintiff' has to try trustees\u2019 liability, by the court or jury\u201d; that in the course of the foregoing conversation, Robinson said that all the claims against Rollins would be settled together, and it was said that some of the claims held in Portsmouth against Rollins could be settled for less than their face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">Upon cross-examination as to this conversation, Wood said that it was not the understanding that Robinson should go round and see Rollins\u2019, creditors, but that he, Wood, was to get claims as cheap as he could ; that he could do so, as he had seen some of the Portsmouth creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Wood also testified, on direct examination, tliat in the summer of 1854, Gilman called on him to collect his demands against Rollins, and directed him to notify Robinson that he should collect his claims by suit, and summon Robinson as trustee; that he notified Robinson of this, and what Gilman wras about to do, and Robinson called on him and said something to the effect that he -would call on Gilman and have some arrangement made; that he did not want a suit commenced (the witness said he could not give his exact words); that no suit was commenced; that after this the witness was informed, by either Robinson or Gilman, or both, that the matter had been arranged, and that no suit was to be commenced; that after this, shortly before Robinson\u2019s death, Wood saw Robinson as to carrying out the settlement they had agreed on, and asked him \u201c if the matter would be settled, as they had talked about before the September term,\u201d and said that if not, he should proceed with the disclosure; that Robinson assured him he had no doubt it would be done; that it would be settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">On cross-examination, Wood said he thought Gilman did not bring to or leave wfith him the notes, in the summer of 1854 ; that he was to notify Robinson, and he thought he \"was to do nothing further till he saw Robinson, but he could not tell whether he was to proceed or not without further direction, in case Robinson refused to do any thing; that Robinson did not say he would pay the notes, or procure them to be paid, but said he would see Gilman and have some ari\u2019angement made about it, witliout having any suit; or that Robixxson said he would see Gilman and see if some ax\u2019rangement could not be made to prevent bx\u00fanging a suit;

The evidence did not sustain the set-off The agreement alleged was definite; it means one thing and one thing only, that he would pay the notes. The agreement proved was indefinite; it does not say the same thing, and we say it does not mean the same thing. It does not necessarily nor by any fair construction mean the same thing. It might mean that it should be arranged otherwise than by paying the notes, as by satisfying Gilman that he had nothing in his hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">The agreements set out in the set-off are within the statute of frauds. Comp. Stat. 459, sec. 9. Gilman retained his notes, and Rollins was still liable to him upon them. The promise alleged and that proved, if any, was to pay Rollins\u2019 debt. Such a promise is collateral, and within the statute. 2 Wheat. Sel. 350, 351, 352, and cases cited; 1 Saund. 211, n. 2; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>2 Wils. 94; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>39 N.

In those eases the plaintiff\u2019 had in his possession the property of his debtor, as security for his debt, and passed it over to the defendant, upon his promise to pay the debt. That would be an assumption of the plaintiff\u2019s debt. . In this case Gilman had no property or lien as security for his debt, and gave up nothing to Robinson. Nothing took place between them of the nature of a purchase, or assignment of any property, debt, or right. The case, therefore, does not come within the principle of those cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-10\">The evidence does not show that the chief object of Robinson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>to benefit himself, or to subserve some purpose of his own. Bobinson denied all indebtedness to Hollins, and there is no evidence that he was indebted to him, or had in his hands auy of his property. But if Bobinson\u2019s chief object was to avoid being harrassed by a law-suit, that is not enough. It lacks an essential element\u2014 a valuable consideration. Gilman\u2019s forbearance. to commence a trustee suit was not a sufficient consideration, if it had been in writing. There was no value in it. Forbearance to sue, or the discontinuance of a suit, or the discharge of an attachment, is not sufficient to take a promise not in writing out of the statute, but there must be a transfer of some property, or valuable right. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Symmes, Nelson </em>v. <em>Boynton, Curtis </em>v. <em>Brown, Fish </em>v. Hutchinson, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Black, </em>20 Ala. 309.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">The third statement of the set-off comes within the statute. It must mean that he would see the notes were settled and paid by Eollins himself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-6\">Bell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnMB\">A brief statement of set-off was, in substance, that in consideration that said Gilman would not bring a suit on two promissory notes due to him from one Eollins, and summon said Eobinson as trustee of said Eollins, he would procure said notes to be settled and paid to said Gilman; that said Gilman did not bring such suit and did not summon said Eobinson as trustee, whereby said Eobinson became liable to perform his promises aforesaid. This statement was rejected, because, as we infer from the argument, it is a claim for uncertain and unliquidated damages, and therefore inadmissible as a set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>27 N. H. 427, the case of <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Hoag, </em>6 Cow. 613, is cited to the point, that the insertion of the word <em>demands </em>in the New-York statute of set-off did not authorize a set-off of uncertain damages, their statute being in this respect similar to ours; and the same rule was adopted in that case. The question consequently is, if the claim here set up is a claim for unliquidated damages; and it does not strike us in that light. Though not in terms a guaranty.of the two promissory notes described in the set-off j it was in substance such a guaranty \u2014 a contract to procure the notes to be paid. The rule of damages, in such a case, can only be the amount due on the notes for principal and interest \u2014 an amount to be ascertained by simple computation. Our impression then is, that this set-off should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">At a later stage of the case, the court held the evidence introduced incompetent to support the set-off, which had not been rejected, on the ground of variance. This set-off is stated in the same form as that before recited, except in the terms of the promise, which are, first, \u201cthat he would pay said notes\u201d; second, \u201cthat he would pay to said Gilman a sum equal to the amount of said notes and interest.\u201d The evidence relied on to prove the alleged promise is, \u201cthat Eobinson said he would call on Gilman and have some arrangement made; that he did not want a suit commenced; that no suit was commenced; that after this the witness was informed by either Eobinson or Gilman, or both, that the matter had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>arranged.\u201d In this evidence there is no proof of a promise to pay the notes, or the amount of them, or to procure them to be settled and paid, as the allegation is in the rejected statement. It is merely that he would have some arrangement made. Subsequently the witness says he saw Robinson and asked him if the matter would be settled as they had talked before the September term, and Robinson assured him he had no doubt it would be done \u2014 that it would be settled. In this assurance we find something more nearly approaching a promise to pay the notes, because a promise to settle a note is a promise in effect to pay it. The language used does not necessarily import that he would settle, or cause the notes to be settled. The terms were loose and indefinite, and the question re'ally was, whether the jury, weighing the evidence and the circuinstances, could rightfully understand the language to be an engagement to cause the debt to be paid, or to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On his cross-examination, the witness says that Robinson did not say he would pay the notes, or procure them to be paid, but said he would see Gilman and have some arrangement made about it, without having any suit, or that he would see Gilman and see if some arrangement could not be made to prevent bringing a suit. It is very apparent that Robinson, as well as the witness, understood that he was making an agreement which was to supersede the necessity of a trustee suit against him. In many cases it is not so much the question what terms were used, as what was intended. \"Where the words are certain, it is generally for the court to construe them; but where the jury must decide what was said, they must also judge what was the meaning of the parties in the language they are found to have used. If the evidence tends to prove an engagement inconsistent with that alleged, and it is capable of no interpretation that can be reconciled with it, the court may pronounce the evidence incompetent on the ground of variance; but where the evidence admits of being understood, in a sense which would support the declaration, and the doubt is whether it is quite sufficient to support the writ, it seems generally more advisable to leave the question to the jury, who are supposed to be more able to judge of the weight of the testimony, as to the facts, than the court. As the jury might perhaps have been persuaded that the meaning of the language used was, that Robinson would pay, or settle the notes, or cause them to be settled, and that it was so understood by the parties, we think that question should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">It is insisted that the promise in question is to pay the debt of another, and is therefore within the statute of frauds. That statutory provision here is substantially the same as in England, and is held to receive the same construction. The promise here is in terms to pay the debt of Rollins. That debt still remains in full force against Rollins, and the promise is therefore collateral to it. It falls within the terms of the statute, and must be governed by it, unless there is some recognized exception -within which it may fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">It is competent for the court- to establish exceptions to statutes, expressed in general and sweeping terms, where cases are found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>come within the letter of the enactment, hut do not fall within the reason and apparent purpose of the law. A large class of cases is found which fall within the general language of the statute of frauds, which were very easily decided to be exceptions. This class of cases has been very generally recognized in the later decisions, and by the elementary writers, though the principle, by which they seem to us to be governed, is either overlooked or obscurely referred to. As they fall within the terms of the statute, the argument is constantly insisted upon that they must be governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The exception to which we refer is, that if the debt of another, which a man promises to pay, is also his own debt, the statute has no application. His promise to pay his own debt is not required to be in writing, and the courts have held, with great reason, that if a person, when promising to pay his own debt, thereby engages to pay the debt of another person, this incidental effect shall not render his verbal promise ineffectual. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>3 Met. 396. A debtor, for instance, pays the amount of his debt to a third person, who thereupon promises to pay it to the creditor; by the receipt of the money he becomes debtor for it, and his promise to pay it to the creditor is but a promise to pay his own debt, though it will also discharge the original debtor. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>3 Met. 396; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>7 Cush. 136; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>29 Me. 214; <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Bucklin, </em>2 Denio 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">To make the debt his own, it is indispensable that the promisor should have received an adequate consideration from the original debtor, or the creditor. 2 Leigh\u2019s N. P. 1031; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>10 B. &amp; C. 679; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Pell, </em>2 C. &amp; M. 716; <em>Alger </em>v. <em>Scoville, 1 </em>Gray 396; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Cush. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">It is not enough that a consideration, which would be good and sufficient to sustain a contract in other cases, that is, \u201csome benefit to the party promising, or some trouble, prejudice, or inconvenience to the party to whom the promise is made,\u201d has passed between the parties; nor is it enough that a legal or sufficient consideration has passed between the original debtor and the creditor, at the request of the promisor, to bring a case within this exception. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Cush. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Thus, to except a promise from the statute, it is never sufficient that the promisee has agreed to allow time to the debtor; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>12 Johns. 291; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>15 Wend. 182; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>15 Wend. 343; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>20 Wend. 201; or to forbear to bring a suit against him for a time; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>4 Johns. 422; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>15 Wend. 182; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>20 Wend. 201; <em>King </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>2 Stra. 873; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>2 Wils. 94; <em>Kirkham </em>v. <em>Martyr, </em>2 B. &amp; Ald. 613; 1 Saund. 211, a; 10 N.

H. 32, where the plaintiff had obtained the account book of his debtor, as a pledge to secure the debt, and the defendant, in consideration that the plaintiff' would deliver the book to one B to collect the demands, verbally promised the plaintiff' to pay him the amount due from the debtor, if B could not collect enough for that purpose, and it was held that the contract was not within the statute of frauds. In this case, says <em>Parker, C. </em>J., there is not only a new consideration, but one which is distinct from and independent of the debt; and the delivery of the books to B, on the defendant\u2019s request, being in effect the same as a delivery to the defendant himself, this new consideration passes between the parties to the new contract. Oases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>this sort are not within the statute, and no writing is necessary to make the contract valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">In the case before the court, it appears that the plaintiffs\u2019 intestate had had large dealings with Eollins, the original debtor, who had failed; and no settlement had been made between them; that Eobinson had been trusteed by others, and had been examined at length as to their transactions, and was then unwilling to answer further; the defendants\u2019 intestate employed an attorney to commence a trustee suit against Eobinson as trustee of Eollins, who conversed with him in relation to the suit; that he was very unwilling to be trusteed, and then gave the assurances relied upon by the defendant. Eollins was no party to the negotiation, and the benefit to be derived from Gilman\u2019s omission to sue, was wholly Eobinson\u2019s. He was assumed by Gilman to have in his hands property or funds for which he might be charged as the trustee of Eollins. If he had such funds, or property, and of sufficient amount to pay Gilman\u2019s debt, the waiver by Gilman of his right to commence a trustee suit would form such a consideration for his promise as would make it valid without writing, according to the principles adopted by the authorities. The promise to pay the debt was an admission, or might be regarded as an admission by the jury, that he had property for which he might be chargeable to the amount of these notes, as was held in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Rayner, </em>12 Johns. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">It would seem, then, that the question what was the intention and meaning of Eobinson in the assurances which he gave, and the question whether he had funds of Eollins\u2019 in his hands, should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
