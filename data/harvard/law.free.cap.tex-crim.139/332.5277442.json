We do find a motion to quash the indictment because it is alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>same is duplicitous in that it charges the commission of two offenses in one count. We do not think the same subject to such objection. It charges in substance that appellant while intoxicated and while under the influence of intoxicating liquor drove and operated an automobile upon a public highway, etc. We gather that appellant\u2019s objection to this count in the indictment is based upon the use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d instead of the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d the latter of which being contained in Art. 802, P. C. denouncing this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In Lewellen v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep. 640, 114 S. W. 1179; Harris v. State, 58 Texas Crim. 523, 126 S. W. 890; Canterberry v. State, 44 S.
