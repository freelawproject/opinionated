It was situated on the highway three and one-half miles north of Rusk. The witness had a search warrant issued upon proper affidavit as disclosed by the record. As a result of the search they found four one-half pints of liquor and one full pint of liquor, tax paid. The liquor was whisky. It was located in the Rockwood Inn and was the property of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Appellant did not testify for himself and produced no witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The appellant in this case is the same person as in cause No. 20,885 (Joe Weaver v.

State (Page 134 of this volume) and for the reasons stated in the opinion in that case, the motion in this case is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
