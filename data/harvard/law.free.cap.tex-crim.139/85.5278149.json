M. Rich. By proper averments it was alleged that Brown County was dry territory. It was also alleged that appellant had been convicted of an offense of like character on the 20th day of July, 1937. Upon conviction appellant\u2019s punishment was assessed at a fine of $500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">There is incorporated in the transcript what is denominated a statement of facts. It is not approved by the trial judge and is not shown to have ever been filed in the trial court. It is not subject to consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">A number of bills of exception are found in the record. As qualified no error is manifest.

There is found within the papers a statement of facts which' does not show to have been filed in the case and was not approved by the judge. Counsel may be correct as a matter of fact but there is nothing in the record to bring that to the attention of this court. It cannot be done by the mere statement of counsel in his brief nor in his motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">We find nothing before us for consideration, and accordingly, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
