H. Whatley, do solemnly swear that I have reasons to believe, and do believe, that Alvin Mosley, on or about the 14th day of October, 1939, in the County of Harrison, and State of Texas, and before the making and filing of this complaint, did then and there unlawfully on or about his person carry a pistol against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">The information follows the complaint in that it is there charged that appellant did carry <em>on or </em>about his person a pistol. It will be noted that this offense is charged in the disjunctive, and such allegation has often been held bad because of such fact. The allegation should have charged this offense in the conjunctive, that is, the word \u201cand\u201d should have been used in place of the word \u201cor,\u201d and failing to do so the complaint and information are bad for uncertainty. We quote from Branch\u2019s Penal Code, p. 556, as follows: \u201cAn indictment or information alleging that defendant did carry on \u2018or\u2019 about his person a pistol is bad for uncertainty, because the allegation is in the alternative. Davis v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App. 638, 5 S. W. 149; Canterberry v. State, 44 S. W. 522; Countryman v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep. 23, 105 S. W. 181; Lewellen v. State, 54 Texas Crim.
