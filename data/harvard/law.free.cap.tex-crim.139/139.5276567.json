Appellants were adjudged guilty of contempt for violating an injunction issued in a civil case. They sought release by way of habeas corpus and were remanded to custody by the district court of Wichita County. Hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">In view of the fact that the commitment grew out of proceedings had in a civil action, we are constrained to decline to entertain jurisdiction. In Ex parte Cummings, 170 S. W. 153, it is shown that the commitment grew out of proceedings had in a civil action. Cummings sought to appeal to this court after he had been remanded to custody by the district court in a habeas corpus proceeding. This court declined to entertain jurisdiction, and dismissed the appeal* In Ex parte Hill, 114 S. W. (2d) 247, a similar situation was presented. In dismissing the appeal in that case the court said: \u201cWherever the matter of confinement grows out of a civil proceeding and appellant appeals, this court will decline to entertain the appeal by reason of the comity between this court and the civil courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
