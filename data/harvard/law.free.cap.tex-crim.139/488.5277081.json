It would add nothing to the State\u2019s jurisprudence to recount the nauseating facts of the night-life of both of these unfortunate people, and we will only say that we think they are sufficient to evidence the appellant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged and as found by the jury. The trial court, in an admirable charge, seems to have given the appellant every conceivable right raised by the evidence, and perceiving no error reflected by the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
