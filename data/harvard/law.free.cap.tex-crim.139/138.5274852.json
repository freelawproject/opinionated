Williams, an employee of the Texas Liquor Control Board, testified that on July 20, 1939, he went to the premises of the appellant in company with one Red Brown and purchased from her a half pint of whisky and a can of beer; that he paid fifty-five cents for the whisky and twenty-five cents for the can of beer. The witness kept the whisky and beer as evidence against the appellant upon the trial of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-18\">The appellant did not testify upon the trial, nor did she introduce any testimony in her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">No bills of exception appear in the record, but in the motion for new trial, the contention is made that the representative of the Liquor Control Board was an accomplice whose testimony required corroboration. This question has been held many times contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention, the leading case being Stevens v. State, 110 S. W. (2d) 906.
