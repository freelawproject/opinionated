Leach by striking him with a brush axe. The death of deceased grew out of a dispute appellant and deceased had had relative to some land. At the time appellant killed deceased he and deceased were with a surveyor who had been employed to make a survey of the land in an effort to properly divide it between appellant and deceased. According to the testimony of the State, appellant, without provocation, struck deceased with a brusk axe. According to appellant\u2019s version, he (appellant) acted in self-defense in striking deceased. Deceased thereafter died from the wound he had received at the hands of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">No bills of exception are brought forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The charge of the court appears to have adequately presented the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The- foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
