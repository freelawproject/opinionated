Appellant and his wife testified that they had sold no beer. We quote from the testimony of appellant\u2019s wife: \u201cI did have some beer on the 8th of June, 1939, but I had it for medicinal purposes.\u201d She testified further that it was upon the advice of a physician that she used the beer for medicinal purposes. Appellant testified as follows: \u201cMy wife had been in bad health for some time and I keep beer for her to drink. I do not sell beer or liquor. I had the beer introduced in evidence in my possession on the 8th day of June, 1939, but I did not have it for the purpose of sale. My wife had been in ill-health since the 12th day of November, 1938,. and we have consulted about three doctors about her condition. Dr. Moss advised her to drink three bottles or cans of beer per day, that the beer would be good for her as a stimulant and as a tonic, and I had that beer in my possession for no other purpose than for her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The possession alone of beer in a dry area is not an offense. Before such possession is an offense it must be for the purpose of sale, and this fact must be shown by the evidence to be true. Appellant\u2019s affirmative defense was that the beer was possessed for medicinal purposes. Notwithstanding appellant submitted a requested instruction covering his affirmative defense, the court declined to give such charge, and nowhere in the main charge was such affirmative defense submitted. Under the circumstances, we must order a reversal of the judgment. See White v. State, 278 S. W. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We disclaim any intention of holding that the evidence is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
