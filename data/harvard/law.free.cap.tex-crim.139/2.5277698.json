We do find a statement of facts, and upon a perusal thereof it is evident that appellant stoutly denied such sale, and corroborated such denial by other witnesses. There is evident a sharp contradiction of the State witnesses\u2019 testimony. This, however, was a matter to be solved by the jury, and we have no disposition nor reasonable grounds for disturbing their judgment therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">We find many matters complained of in this trial set forth in the motion for a new trial, but same are not brought before us in a proper bill of exceptions, and they can not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-16\">Finding no error herein, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
