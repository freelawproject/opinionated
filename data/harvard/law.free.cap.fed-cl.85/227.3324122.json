In its September 23, 2008 order, the court deferred ruling upon plaintiffs September 23, 2008 motion for supplemental pleadings \u201c[bjecause plaintiff currently has a Motion for Supplemental Pleadings and a Motion to Add a Refund Claim for Year 2007 pending before the court, ... [and ojnce these motions are fully briefed, the court shall issue a ruling.\u201d Order 3, Sept. 23, 2008. Although plaintiff has been afforded ample opportunity \u2014 thirty days \u2014 to reply to defendant\u2019s response to her motion for injunctive relief, she has not done so, and the court determines, given plaintiffs silence, that there is no reason to delay its ruling. Each motion is addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-21\">I. Defendant\u2019s Motion for More Definite Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">On May 5, 2008, defendant filed a motion for a more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d). Defendant argued that plaintiff omitted special matters, as required by former RCFC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>9(h)(6),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby preventing it from determining whether the court possesses jurisdiction over plaintiffs amended complaint. The court granted defendant\u2019s motion on August 1, 2008, and plaintiff filed a more definite statement on August 13, 2008. Defendant now submits a second motion for a more definite statement and notes that plaintiffs more definite statement \u201crelies upon a spreadsheet ... which sets forth the tax year, approximate time of filing of tax return, place of filing of tax return, wage income, reasonable compensation exemption limit, and amount of refund. Plaintiffs spreadsheet fails to include the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded for tax years 1975-1983.\u201d Resp. United States Pl.\u2019s More Definite Statement &amp; Mot. Leave File Supp\u2019l Pleadings (\u201cDef.\u2019s Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mots.\u201d) 3. Plaintiffs omission of this information for the years 1975-1983, defendant maintains, renders plaintiffs more definite statement deficient under the RCFC. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to provide \u201cthe basic information required by RCFC 9(h)(6)\u201d for tax years 1975-2002 and has also failed to provide a copy of those refund claims. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, defendant asserts that plaintiff \u201cdid not identify the date and place each claim for refund was filed for the years 1975 through 2007,\u201d information that defendant maintains is necessary \u201cin order to verify that the jurisdictional requirements for the suit have been met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">As the court previous indicated in its August 1, 2008 order, former RCFC 9(h)(6) governed special matters required to be plead in the complaint in tax refund suits. The complaint \u201cshall include\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">In any action for refund of federal tax, for each tax year or period for which a refund is sought, the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded; the date and place the return, if any, was filed; the name, address, and identification number of the taxpayer or taxpayers appearing on the tax return; the date and place the claim for refund was filed; and the identification number for each plaintiff, if different from the identification number of the taxpayer. A copy of the claim for refund shall be annexed to the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">RCFC 9(h)(6) (2002). Instead of furnishing copies of the claims for refund, plaintiff submitted an appendix, \u201cSpreadsheet Showing the Tax Year, Place and Time of Filing, Wage Income, Reasonable Compensation Limit, and Approximate Amount of Tax Refund,\u201d which she generated using Microsoft Excel. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp.

Plaintiff has not, however, satisfied the requirements set forth in former RCFC 9(h)(6) for the reasons cited by defendant. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion is granted. Plaintiff must submit a more definite statement that complies with the amended RCFC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">II. Defendant\u2019s Motion to Stay Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Defendant asks that the court, pursuant to section 7422(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stay proceedings through March 7, 2009, with respect to plaintiffs 2006 tax year. Def.\u2019s Mot. Stay Proceedings (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot. Stay\u201d) 1. Section 7422(e) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">If the Secretary prior to the hearing of a suit brought by a taxpayer in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax ... mails to the taxpayer a notice that a deficiency has been determined in respect of the tax which is the subject matter of taxpayer\u2019s suit, the proceedings in taxpayer\u2019s suit shall be stayed during the period of time in which the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter. If the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court, the district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, shall lose jurisdiction of taxpayer\u2019s suit to whatever extent jurisdiction is acquired by the Tax Court of the subject matter of taxpayer\u2019s suit for refund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(e) (2000) (footnote added). Defendant notes that plaintiffs amended complaint requests a refund of income tax for the 2006 tax year. Def.\u2019s Mot. Stay 1. Furthermore, defendant indicates that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), on October 8, 2008, issued a Notice of Deficiency to plaintiff that reflected an increase in income tax for the 2006 tax year. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. According to defendant, plaintiff has ninety days after the Notice of Deficiency was mailed within which to file a petition with the United States Tax Court (\u201cTax Court\u201d). <em>Id. </em>(citing I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a)). It therefore argues that proceedings in this case must be stayed through March 7, 2009. <em>Id. </em>at 3 (citing eases); <em>ac- \u25a0 cord </em>Def.\u2019s Reply Supp. Mots. 2 (\u201cUnder \u00a7 7422(e)[,] proceedings in a tax refund suit will be stayed[] if the taxpayer is sent a notice of deficiency with respect to the tax which is the subject matter of the suit, during the period of time in which the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency and for 60 days thereafter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">, Plaintiff asserts that she does not want to petition the Tax Court and that \u201cthe forum selected by the Plaintiff ... should be respected by the Court.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n Mot. Stay &amp; Mots. 3. Plaintiff argues that \u201cfor purposes of [I.R.C.] Section 6422(e), the hearing of the taxpayer\u2019s suit has already occurred [because] in the instant case it can be concluded that any type of substantive hearing has taken place with respect to the merits of Ms. Van Vorst\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5; <em>accord id. </em>at 5-6 (\u201cAll the correspondence with the Appeals office and the Taxpayer Advocate and all the civil penalties levied against [plaintiff] over the last five years could be argued to have substantially determined all of the issues in the pending litigation----[I]t should be concluded that a hearing has taken place____\u201d). <em>But see </em>Def.\u2019s Reply Supp. Mots. 2-3 (arguing that plaintiffs contention that a hearing has already occurred \u201cis without merit\u201d and urging the court to \u201cdiscard! ]\u201d such contention). Furthermore, plaintiff states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">We have warned this Court of the deceitful practices of the Defendant, in their at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tempt to delay the proceedings so that the Utah office of the IRS issues a [Notice of Deficiency] in their race to use the provisions of Section 7422(e) to stay the proceedings. We were right. Following seven months since the filing of the Plaintiffs complaint, these individuals continue to stall the proeeedings[,] claiming that they have no tax return information, that [they] cannot find any tax return information, that there have been no hearings, and [they] continue to mislead the Court by failing to disclose all the pertinent file information that they have in their possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">PL\u2019s Opp\u2019n Mot.

Plaintiff maintains that defendant \u201cis conspiring to charge [her] with additional taxes and penalties and interest so that [she], having spent thousands of dollars in legal fees, never sees a penny of her stolen wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">As defendant indicates, the Notice of Deficiency plaintiff received sets forth a procedure for taxpayers who decide not to file a petition with the Tax Court. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply Supp. Mots. 4-5. The Notice of Deficiency plaintiff received explicitly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO5\">If you decide not to file a petition with the Tax Court, please sign and return the enclosed waiver form to us. This will permit us to assess the deficiency quickly and will limit the accumulation of interest. We\u2019ve enclosed an envelope you can use. If you decide not to sign and return the waiver and you do not petition the Tax Court, the law requires us to assess and bill you for the deficiency after 90 days from the date of this letter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-25\">Def.\u2019s Mot. Stay Ex. A. Defendant maintains that \u201c[u]nless[ ] plaintiff agrees to a waiver of the restrictions on the assessment and colleetion of the deficiency in tax for the 2006 year, defendant\u2019s motion to stay proceedings with respect to that year should be granted.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply Supp. Mots. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"ATcb\">Notwithstanding plaintiffs apparent frus(ration over the circumstances that precipitated her filing the instant action, Congress has addressed this precise issue in section 7422(e), which does not afford the court latitude in determining whether to stay proceedings. To the contrary, section 7422(e) explicitly states that if a Notice of Deficiency is mailed to the taxpayer and that Notice of Deficiency pertains to the tax that is the subject matter of the taxpayer\u2019s lawsuit, then \u201cthe proceedings in taxpayer\u2019s suit <em>shall </em>be stayed____\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(e) (emphasis added). Use of the term \u201cshall\u201d denotes the imperative and connotes a mandatory obligation. <em>See Merck &amp; Co. v. Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., </em>482 F.3d 1317, 1322 (Fed.Cir. 2007); <em>Sys.

Plaintiff asserts that the court should grant her motion because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsJ\">the 28 March 2008 correspondence is legally of extraordinary importance because it allows the court to see fust hand the practices of the Defendant\u2019s agents, where they deny that a tax return was filed; they deny deductions allowed by the U.S. Congressional statutes and issue $5,000 penalties without providing explanation or no justification for these wrongful exactions,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahn\"><em>py </em>This correspondence relates to plaintiffs 2006 tax year-. As discussed in Part II, <em>supra, </em>a stay of these proceedings is appropriate with respect to the 2006 tax year, Accordingly, the court denies plaintiffs August 13j 2008 motion to supplement. Plaintiff may renew her motion after the stay is lifted,</p>\n<p id=\"AP1\">Motion to Add a Refund Claim for Year 2007</p>\n<p id=\"AnA\">in her motion to add a claim for refund, plaintiff indicates that she filed a tax refund claim for year 2007 and that the IRS denied her claim. PL\u2019s Resp. &amp; Mots. 7. Plaintiff asserts that she \u201chas met the administrative claim for refund requirements ... and can file a suit for refund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, plaintiff argues that \u201cit can be stated that the tax refund claim for year 2007 has been rejected or deemed rejected by the Defendant\u2019s agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(the Commissioner). Therefore, since the tax return provided in detail the basis of Plaintiff s refund claim, the tax can be recovered by filing a suit____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Defendant, however, argues that plaintiff \u201cdoes not allege that she has made full payment of her income tax liability for the 2007 tax year[,] and the correspondence which she has attached to her response ... indicates a balanee due for the 2007 tax year of $18,914.30.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp.

In most eases concerning federal taxes, all federal courts are prohibited from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief by the Anti-Injunction Act. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) (\u201cExcept as provided ..., no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person.... \u201d). Section 7421(a) \u201cprovides that once a tax has been assessed, a taxpayer is powerless to prevent the [IRS] from collecting that tax.\u201d <em>Stiles v. United States, </em>47 Fed.Cl. 1, 2 (2000). To the extent that plaintiffs motion implicates the Anti-Injunction Act, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief. Accordingly, the motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">With respect to plaintiffs allegations that defendant\u2019s counsel has violated RCFC 11, plaintiff has failed to comply with the requirements set forth for bringing an RCFC 11 motion for sanctions. <em>See </em>RCFC 11(c)(2). Even if plaintiff properly filed such a motion, it must be denied because plaintiffs allegations are entirely unfounded. As the court explained in its September 23, 2008 order, counsel for defendant has not engaged in any conduct designed to delay proceedings in this case. In order for this case to proceed forward, plaintiff must comply with the RCFC and furnish the appropriate information such that the United States Department of Justice can gather the appropriate facts to understand the full extent of plaintiffs claims and respond accordingly. In her effort to present a full record to the court, plaintiffs numerous motions to supplement the pleadings, rather than defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain the appropriate information that will move this case forward, have contributed to delaying proceedings. At all times, counsel for defendant has acted in a responsible and professional manner, and there is no basis for imposing sanctions based upon plaintiffs contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">B. Motion for Award of Legal Cost[s]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Plaintiff also seeks attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. Subsection (a) of section 2412, which \u201capplies to all parties before the United States Court of Federal Claims,\u201d <em>Neal &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>121 F.3d 683, 685 n. * (Fed.Cir.1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXID\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a judgment for costs[,] ... not including the fees and expenses of attorneys, may be awarded to the <em>prevailing party </em>in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action. A judgment for costs when taxed against the United States shall, in an amount established by statute, court rule, or order, be limited to reimbursing in whole or in part the prevailing party for the costs incurred by such party in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a)(1) (emphasis added).

Consequently, plaintiffs motion is premature and is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">YI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">For the reasons stated above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">1.

After defendant filed its motion, the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cCourt of Federal Claims\u201d) amended the language of the RCFC \u201cto conform to the general restyling\u201d of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. RCFC 9, Rules Committee Note (Nov. 3, 2008). Most of the revisions to the RCFC were minor textual changes. However, RCFC 9(h)(6), which specifically pertained to special matters applicable to tax refund suits, was redesignated RCFC 9(m) and amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">(m) Tax Refund Claim. In pleading a claim for a tax refund, a party must include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">(1) a copy of the claim for refund, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">(2) a statement identifying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">(A) the tax year(s) for which a refund is sought;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">(B) the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">(C) the date and place the return was filed, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">(D) the name, address, and identification number (under seal) of the taxpayer(s) appearing on the return;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">(E) the date and place the claim for refund was filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">(F) the identification number (under seal) of each plaintiff, if different from the identification number of the taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">RCFC 9(m). As the rules committee note indicates, an additional requirement \u2014 that taxpayer identification numbers be included under seal\u2014 was added to the rule. RCFC 9, Rules Committee Note (Nov. 3, 2008). For the reasons explained in this ruling, plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirements of the former rule. Going forward, the parties shall comply with the RCFC, as amended, because doing so will be feasible and will not work injustice. <em>See </em>RCFC 86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">. Even if there had been no amendment or stylistic change to RCFC 9(h)(6), plaintiff would still have been required to file a more definite statement.
