It having been determined that the offending vehicle was not an uninsured motor vehicle, underinsured protection is not available to the Watnicks individually, until they each exhaust by payment the insurance for pain and suffering afforded pursuant to the Quebec Automobile Insurance Act, which is in the sum of $20,000 each assuming, but without conceding, that they could legally recover more than $20,000 each. <em>(Reichel v Government Empls.

In view of the fact that the most that could be recovered under the law of the place where the accident occurred is $20,000, this claim could never become an underinsured claim. <em>(Matter of Napolitano [MVAIC], </em>21 NY2d 281; <em>Rose v Travelers Ins.

Federal is not the tortfeasor, but rather a person who has contracted with the Watnicks to pay to them reparations for the legal liability of the tortfeasor. Federal\u2019s liability can be no greater than the legal liability of the underlying tortfeasor to the Watnicks. <em>(Kilberg v Northeast Airlines, </em>9 NY2d 34; <em>Babcock v Jackson, </em>12 NY2d 473; <em>Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41.)

On September 6, 1988, Jay and Marianna Watnick, residents of New York State, were driving through St. Agathe, Quebec, when their automobile was struck by a vehicle operated by Jay Anderson, a resident of Quebec. Jay and Marianna Watnick were severely injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">When the accident occurred, the Watnicks were insured under a motor vehicle liability policy issued by Federal Insurance Company, a New York State insurance carrier. The policy contained an uninsured motorist endorsement and an optional supplementary uninsured motorist endorsement (denominated \"Underinsured Motorists Coverage\u201d) in the single limit of $300,000 <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [\u00b6] [1], [2]; Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 311 [4] [a]). The purpose of the uninsured motorist endorsement was to \" 'provid[e] coverage to insured persons who suffer automobile accident injuries at the hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of financially irresponsible motorists\u2019 \u201d <em>(see, Rowell v Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>77 NY2d 636, 640). The underinsured motorist endorsement provided protection to a covered person for bodily injury sustained in an automobile accident where the applicable bodily injury liability bond or policy provided coverage that was less than the limit of the subject policy. Under the policy in this case and the applicable section of the Insurance Law, Federal was obligated to pay underinsured motorist coverage only after the limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies had been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [\u00b6] [2]). Although the underinsured motorist endorsement in the insurance policy allowed a setoff for any amount paid or payable under workers\u2019 compensation, the endorsement allowed Federal to reduce the limit of bodily injury liability only by sums paid by or on behalf of persons or organizations who might be legally responsible. The endorsement did not permit Federal to reduce the limit of bodily injury insurance coverage by the maximum amount payable, as opposed to paid, under applicable bodily injury liability insurance policies. The policy allowed either party to make a written demand for arbitration if the parties did not agree (1) whether the covered person was legally entitled to recover damages, or (2) as to the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Anderson\u2019s vehicle was insured for \"bodily injury\u201d liability under the Quebec Automobile Insurance Act (QAIA), a mandatory system of insurance reparations administered by the provincial government of Quebec. That program affords insurance coverage to all \"owners\u201d of road vehicles who use a public highway within the Province of Quebec <em>(see, </em>QAIA \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 17). Through applications made to its automobile insurance board, the Regie, the QAIA compensates nonresident claimants \"to the extent that [they are] not responsible for the accident\u201d <em>(see, </em>QAIA \u00a7 8) to a maximum of $20,000 <em>(see, </em>QAIA \u00a7 44). Claimants aggrieved by a determination by an officer of the R\u00e9gie regarding compensation for bodily injury may appeal to the Appeals Section of the R\u00e9gie and then to the Commission des Affaires Sociales <em>(see, </em>QAIA \u00a7 56). The record indicates that in addition to bodily injury coverage under the QAIA, the Anderson vehicle was insured by Commerce Insurance Company, an insurance company not licensed to do business in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Jay and Marianna Watnick sought compensation from the R\u00e9gie for their injuries. The R\u00e9gie awarded Jay Watnick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>$82.12 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for suffering and loss of enjoyment of life and denied Marianna Watnick\u2019s claim, finding her 100% at fault for the accident. The Watnicks did not appeal from the R\u00e9gie\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Prior to receiving the determination from the R\u00e9gie regarding Jay Watnick\u2019s claim, the Watnicks filed claims with Federal under the uninsured and underinsured motorist endorsements of the motor vehicle liability policy. Federal denied coverage and commenced this proceeding, seeking to stay arbitration of both claims. Federal contended that the offending vehicle was neither uninsured or underinsured, as defined by the statutory and decisional laws of New York. The Watnicks argued that the offending vehicle was uninsured because the QAIA was not a \"bodily injury liability bond or policy\u201d within the meaning of New York\u2019s Insurance Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In separate orders, Supreme Court, Nassau County, concluded that the offending vehicle was neither uninsured nor underinsured, and granted Federal\u2019s applications to stay arbitration of both claims. The Appellate Division affirmed as to the uninsured claim but reversed as to the underinsured claim, denied Federal\u2019s application to permanently stay arbitration of the underinsured motorist claim, and directed the parties to proceed to arbitration on that claim <em>(see, </em>176 AD2d 38). The Court also allowed Federal to set off \"the maximum amount [that Jay Watnick may receive] pending the Regie\u2019s determination,\u201d to satisfy the statutory requirement of exhaustion by payment and \"expedite the arbitration\u201d <em>(see, id., </em>at 43). The Appellate Division held that since the limit of the QAIA bodily injury liability coverage was less than that provided under the Watnicks\u2019 underinsured motorist endorsement, the offending vehicle was underinsured <em>(see, id., </em>at 42).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The issues presented on appeal are whether the Watnicks may recover damages under the uninsured and underinsured motorist endorsements in their vehicle liability insurance policy with Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Federal does not challenge the conclusion by the prior courts that the Anderson vehicle was not uninsured. However, the Watnicks maintain that those courts erred in concluding that the offending vehicle was not \"uninsured\u201d within the meaning of the Insurance Law and the subject policy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Watnicks argue that the legislative purpose of providing maximum and expeditious protection to the innocent victims of financially irresponsible motorist coverage in New York mandates liberal construction of the statute and the policy, and the conclusion that the offending vehicle was either uninsured or underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We agree with the conclusion reached by the prior courts that the Anderson vehicle was not uninsured, and the Watnicks cannot recover under the uninsured motorist endorsement in their vehicle liability policy with Federal. Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1) requires that every motor vehicle insurance policy contain an uninsured motorist endorsement under which the insurer agrees to pay an insured any damages caused by an owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle. An \"uninsured motor vehicle\u201d is one as to which no proof of financial security exists, as defined by subdivision (3) of section 311 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 5202 [c], [d]). Section 311 (3) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law defines the term \"proof of financial security\u201d to mean proof of ability to respond in damages for liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as evidenced by an owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance. An \"owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance\u201d provides insurance against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages because of bodily injury to or death of any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, or operation of a specific motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the State of New York, or elsewhere in the United States in North America or the Dominion of Canada <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 311 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Here, the QAIA provides bodily injury insurance coverage to all owners of road vehicles using a public highway in the Province of Quebec. Therefore, the Appellate Division correctly concluded that the QAIA is tantamount to an owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance. Under the QAIA, Anderson can respond in damages, up to $20,000, for any bodily injury he may cause to others in an automobile accident on a Quebec highway. Thus, the QAIA provides Anderson with proof of financial security. In addition, the record indicates that Anderson\u2019s vehicle was insured by Commerce Insurance Company. As such, the prior courts correctly held that Anderson\u2019s vehicle was not uninsured and granted Federal\u2019s application to stay arbitration of the Watnick\u2019s uninsured motorist claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">However, we disagree with the conclusion reached by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Appellate Division that the Watnicks should arbitrate their underinsurance claim with Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Federal contends that since the prior courts concluded that the offending vehicle was not \"uninsured,\u201d the Watnicks are not entitled to underinsured protection until they each have \"exhausted by payment\u201d the insurance for pain and suffering afforded under the QAIA. Relying on <em>Matter of Valente v Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(77 NY2d 894), the Watnicks argue that a $20,000 \"setoff\u201d would make Federal whole and eliminate the need for the \"exhaustion] by payment\u201d requirement in the subject policy. Furthermore, the Watnicks contend, breach of the contractual duty to exhaust by payment gives rise only to a claim for damages, not vitiation of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The underinsured motorist endorsement in the Watnicks\u2019 motor vehicle insurance policy with Federal, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\"We will pay under this coverage only after the limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been <em>exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2), which requires insurers to provide, at the option of the insured, supplementary uninsured (underinsured) motorist insurance for bodily injury liability up to the limits of the insured\u2019s own bodily injury liability policy, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\"As a <em>condition precedent </em>to the obligation of the insurer to pay under the supplementary uninsured motorists insurance coverage, the limits of liability of all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident shall be <em>exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The clear language of the policy and statute requires the Watnicks to \"exhaust * * * by payment\u201d the limits of all applicable bodily injury insurance policies before Federal is required to pay pursuant to the underinsurance endorsement. Thus, the statutory scheme requires primary insurers to pay every last dollar, and requires plaintiffs to accept no less, prior to the initiation of an underinsurance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">The Regie awarded Jay Watnick $82.12, out of a possible $20,000, for the injuries he sustained in the automobile accident. The R\u00e9gie denied Marianna Watnick\u2019s claim, finding her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>100% at fault for the accident. Neither Jay Watnick nor Marianna Watnick has \"exhausted by payment\u201d the limits of all applicable bodily insurance policies as required by the statute and the subject policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Matter of Valente v Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(77 NY2d 894, <em>supra) </em>provides no assistance to the Watnicks. In that case, the petitioner sustained serious bodily injuries when he was struck by an uninsured motor vehicle while on the job. The petitioner, an insured person, sought to recover for his bodily injuries pursuant to the supplementary uninsured motorist endorsement in the insurance policy issued by the insurer to the petitioner\u2019s father. The policy provided supplementary uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $100,000 and stated that the amount payable thereunder would be reduced by any amount paid or payable under workers\u2019 compensation. The insurer contended that the amount payable under the supplementary uninsured motorist endorsement must be reduced by any workers\u2019 compensation award. In allowing the insurer to reduce the petitioner\u2019s recovery for pain and suffering by the amount payable under workers\u2019 compensation, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\"The contract between the parties contains a standard clause which expressly provides for [the] \u2019offset,\u2019 and the contract has been approved by the Commissioner of Insurance * * * Under these circumstances there is no basis for holding the contractual offset unenforceable with respect to the supplemental coverage * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\"In the absence of * * * a statutory restriction, the court is bound to enforce the contract as written\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 895-896).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Here, too, the underinsured motorist endorsement allowed Federal to reduce the limit of bodily injury coverage by all sums paid or payable under workers\u2019 compensation. However, the endorsement allowed Federal to reduce the limit of bodily injury coverage only by all sums paid by or on behalf of persons or organizations who may be legally responsible. The endorsement did not permit Federal to reduce the limit of bodily injury coverage by the amount payable under any applicable bodily injury insurance policy. Any agreement regarding a setoff of applicable injury insurance could have been included in the policy endorsement, as it was with workers\u2019 compensation. None existing, the Appellate Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>has rewritten the endorsement by allowing Federal to \"set off\u201d the maximum amount recoverable by Jay Watnick under the QAIA pending a determination by the R\u00e9gie. The Watnicks did not \"exhaust * * * by payment\u201d the limits of the QAIA policy before seeking compensation from Federal, as required by the policy and the Insurance Law. Thus, they are not permitted to arbitrate their underinsured endorsement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to petitioner, by reversing so much thereof as denied Federal\u2019s application to permanently stay arbitration of the Watnick\u2019s underinsured motorist claim and granting that application and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Acting Chief Judge Simons and Judges Kaye, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Order modified, with costs to petitioner, by reversing so much of the Appellate Division order as pertains to proceeding No. 2 and reinstating the order of Supreme Court, Nassau County, in proceeding No. 2 and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> There is a reference to cumulative payments to Jay Watnick of $4,321.86 <em>(see, </em>record, at 224). These payments apparently include sums in addition to those for suffering and loss of enjoyment of life.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
