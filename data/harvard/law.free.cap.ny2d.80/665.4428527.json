Measured by Court of Appeals case law criteria, the People\u2019s proof at trial did not justify defendant\u2019s conviction for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. <em>People v Howard, </em>74 NY2d 943; <em>People v Lawrence, </em>74 NY2d 732; <em>People v Butler, </em>58 NY2d 1056; <em>People v Cona, </em>49 NY2d 26; <em>People v Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d 174; <em>People v Warren, </em>66 NY2d 831.) II. The court\u2019s prolonged closure of the courtroom violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial and mandates reversal of his judgment of conviction. <em>People v Clemons, </em>78 NY2d 48; <em>People v Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54; <em>Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US 39; <em>People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71.) III. Given the People\u2019s opening statement and the trial testimony, the failure of the court to properly charge the multiple conspiracy concept espoused in <em>People v Leisner </em>(73 NY2d 140, 148-152) requires a trial de nova on the conspiracy count of the indictment.

A new trial should be ordered due to the improper admission of critical identification testimony that should have been suppressed due to lack of CPL 710.30 notice and the refusal of the court to follow a suggested procedure which might have insured its reliability. <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>79 NY2d 445; <em>People v New-ball, </em>76 NY2d 587; <em>United States v Archibald, </em>734 F2d 938; <em>People v Evans, </em>147 Misc 2d 811.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b728-5\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">A person who, with intent to possess cocaine, orders from a supplier, admits a courier into his or her home, examines the drugs and ultimately rejects them because of perceived defects in quality, has attempted to possess cocaine within the meaning of the Penal Law. As the evidence was legally sufficient to establish this sequence of events, we reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">By jury verdict, defendant was convicted of conspiracy and attempted possession of cocaine. The latter charge \u2014 the only one at issue on this appeal \u2014 centers on the events of March 21, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Evidence at trial revealed that, commencing in November 1986, officers of the Manhattan North Narcotics Division began investigating the activities of defendant, his brother Miguel and others. Their investigation techniques included the use of an undercover officer to infiltrate the organization, stakeouts and court-authorized wiretaps. In July 1987 the undercover met with Miguel at a Manhattan apartment and purchased cocaine. At that time, Miguel introduced defendant to the officer, telling her that they \"work together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">A wiretap on defendant\u2019s telephone at his Bronx apartment revealed that for several days prior to March 21, 1988, he was negotiating with Luis Rojas to purchase kilogram quantities of cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 21, at 11:37 a.m., Rojas called defendant and asked, \"are you ready?\u201d Defendant replied \"come by here\u201d and Rojas responded, \"I\u2019m going over.\u201d At 11:42, defendant called \"Frank,\u201d an associate, and told him that he \"spoke to the man\u201d who would be \"coming over here * * *. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">About a half hour later, around 12:15 p.m., officers staking out defendant\u2019s six-floor apartment building saw a man pull up in a car, remove a black and white plastic bag from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>trunk, and enter the building. The bag\u2019s handles were stretched, indicating that the contents were heavy. At 12:30, the man emerged from the building, carrying the same plastic bag which still appeared to be heavy. He placed the bag back in the trunk and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Minutes later, at 12:37 p.m., defendant called Frank, stating that he \"saw the man\u201d but \"those tickets * * * were no good; they weren\u2019t good for the game man.\u201d Frank wondered whether \"they got more expensive, the seats\u201d and defendant explained that they were the \"same price and all\u201d but they were \"not the same seats * * * some seats real bad, very bad, very bad.\u201d Defendant elaborated: \"two pass tickets together on the outside stuck together, like a thing, like a ticket falsified. Then I told him to take it away, no, I don\u2019t want any problems and anything you see.\u201d Frank asked if defendant was told when the tickets would arrive, and defendant responded \"No because who came was someone, somebody else, the guy, the messenger.\u201d Defendant acknowledged that he \"want[s] to participate in the game but if you can\u2019t see it, you\u2019re going to come out upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">At 12:50 p.m., Rojas called defendant and said something inaudible about \"my friend.\u201d Defendant responded, \"Oh yes, but he left because (inaudible) it doesn\u2019t fit me. * * * You told me it was the same thing, same ticket.\u201d Rojas rejoined, \"No. We\u2019ll see each other at six.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Finally, at 1:26 p.m., defendant telephoned Hector Vargas, who wanted to know \"what happened?\u201d Defendant said, \"Nothing. I saw something there, what you wanted, but I returned it because it was a shit there.\u201d Hector wanted to know, \"like how?\u201d but defendant simply responded, \"No, no, a weird shit there.\u201d Vargas suggested that he might be able to obtain something \"white and good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The following day, defendant again called Vargas to discuss \"the thing you told me about, you know what I\u2019m referring to\u201d. Defendant recommended that Vargas \"go talk to him, talk to him personally and check it out.\u201d Defendant thought that \"it would be better if you took the tickets, at least one or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">At trial, in motions before and after the verdict, defendant argued that the foregoing evidence was insufficient to establish that he attempted to possess cocaine on March 21. The trial court rejected those arguments and sentenced defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>upon the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, to a prison term of 25 years to life, the maximum permitted by law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">On appeal, a sharply divided Appellate Division reversed and vacated the attempted possession conviction, the majority concluding that \"[e]yen were we to accept [the] attenuated inference that the visitor actually reached defendant\u2019s apartment and offered his contraband to him, the remaining evidence shows defendant\u2019s flat rejection of that offer, and thus total abandonment of the criminal enterprise with respect to this particular quantity of cocaine.\u201d (172 AD2d 103, 105-106.) One of the dissenting Justices granted the People leave to appeal, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">A person knowingly and unlawfully possessing a substance weighing at least four ounces and containing a narcotic drug is guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.21 [1]). Under the Penal Law, \"[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, he [or she] engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime.\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 110.00.) While the statutory formulation of attempt would seem to cover a broad range of conduct \u2014 anything \"tend[ing] to effect\u201d a crime \u2014 case law requires a closer nexus between defendant\u2019s acts and the completed crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In <em>People v Rizzo </em>(246 NY 334, 337), we observed that in demarcating punishable attempts from mere preparation to commit a crime, a \"line has been drawn between those acts which are remote and those which are proximate and near to the consummation.\u201d In <em>Rizzo, </em>this Court drew that line at acts \"very near to the accomplishment of the intended crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 337.) Though apparently more stringent than the Model Penal Code \"substantial step\u201d test (Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01 [1] [c]) \u2014 a test adopted by some Federal courts <em>(see, e.g., United States v Jackson, </em>560 F2d 112 [2d Cir], <em>cert denied </em>434 US 941) \u2014in this State we have adhered to <em>Rizzo\u2019s </em>\"very near\u201d or \"dangerously near\u201d requirement, despite the later enactment of Penal Law \u00a7 110.00 <em>(see, People v Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d 174, 191; <em>People v Warren, </em>66 NY2d 831, 833; <em>People v Di Stefano, </em>38 NY2d 640, 652).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>A person who orders illegal narcotics from a supplier, admits a courier into his or her home and examines the quality of the goods has unquestionably passed beyond mere preparation and come \"very near\u201d to possessing those drugs. Indeed, the only remaining step between the attempt and the completed crime is the person\u2019s acceptance of the proffered merchandise, an act entirely within his or her control <em>(see, People v Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d, at 192, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Our decision in <em>People v Warren </em>(66 NY2d 831) is thus readily distinguishable, as Justice Asch, dissenting at the Appellate Division, recognized. In that case, an informant and an undercover officer posing as a cocaine seller met defendants in a hotel room and reached an agreement for the sale of about half a pound. The actual exchange, however, was to occur hours later, in another part of town, after repackaging and testing. Moreover, when defendants were arrested at that meeting, the sellers had insufficient cocaine on hand and defendants had insufficient funds. We concluded that since \"several contingencies stood between the agreement in the hotel room and the contemplated purchase,\u201d defendants did not come \"very near\u201d to accomplishment of the intended crime (66 NY2d, at 833). The same cannot be said here.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Significantly, neither the Appellate Division nor the dissent in this Court disputes the proposition that a person who arranges for the delivery of drugs and actually examines them has come sufficiently close to the completed crime to qualify as an attempt. Rather, the Appellate Division relies on two other grounds for reversal: (i) the evidence was insufficient to establish that defendant in fact met with a drug courier and examined his wares; and (ii) in any event, defendant\u2019s ultimate rejection of the drugs constituted an abandonment of the criminal enterprise, vitiating the attempt. (The dissent in this Court is limited to the first ground.) Neither ground is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">A jury, of course, concluded from the evidence presented that defendant attempted to possess cocaine on March 21, 1988. In examining the record for legal sufficiency, \"the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the People * * * to determine whether there is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational jury could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(People v Steinberg, </em>79 NY2d 673, 681-682). This deferential standard is employed because the courts\u2019 role on legal sufficiency review is simply to determine whether enough evidence has been presented so that the resulting verdict was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Appellate Division is also empowered to review the record to determine whether the verdict is against the <em>weight </em>of the evidence (CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495). In so doing, the Appellate Division may draw inferences contrary to those implicitly drawn by the jury, and conclude that while legally valid, the verdict should nevertheless be set aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.20 [5]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d, at 495, <em>supra). </em>In this case, the Appellate Division did not use its weight-of-the-evidence review powers, but vacated defendant\u2019s conviction for legal insufficiency (172 AD2d, at 106, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, this Court may review the Appellate Division\u2019s determination <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [4] [b]; 450.90 [2] [a]; <em>see also, People v Acosta, </em>79 NY2d 971 [denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss appeal]). When we reverse in this procedural posture, however, the case is remitted to enable the Appellate Division to weigh the evidence (CPL 470.40 [2] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Applying these governing standards, we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that defendant met with a drug courier in his home on March 21. About a half-hour after defendant\u2019s supplier, Rojas, told defendant that he would be coming over, the police saw a man enter the apartment building with a weighted-down plastic bag and emerge 15 minutes later with the same heavy bag. Contemporaneously with the unidentified man\u2019s departure, defendant reported to an associate that he met with a messenger but that he rejected the offer because the \"seats\u201d were \"very bad\u201d and the \"tickets\u201d looked \"falsified.\u201d When Rojas immediately called defendant asking about his \"friend,\u201d defendant explained that \"he left\u201d and complained that Rojas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>misrepresented that the \"same ticket\u201d would be brought. And shortly thereafter, defendant called Vargas and told him that he \"saw something there, what you wanted, but I returned it because it was a shit there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">On the evidence presented, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, with the intent to possess more than four ounces of a controlled substance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> met with Rojas\u2019 courier and examined cocaine, but rejected it because he was dissatisfied with the quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The dissent\u2019s contrary conclusion is reachable only by arbitrarily fragmenting the evidence. The dissent contends that the stakeout officers\u2019 observations of the man carrying the bag amount to \"no material evidence at all\u201d because the man was not stopped by the police or seen approaching defendant\u2019s apartment (dissenting opn, at 677). Then, having erased this evidence from the case, the dissent claims that the \"sole basis\u201d for defendant\u2019s guilt was a wiretapped conversation in which he told an individual that he had just rejected tickets (dissenting opn, at 677).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The law, however, did not oblige the jury to take such an artificial view of the evidence. Rather, the jury function was to evaluate the trial evidence as a whole, to consider how the individualized bits of evidence fit together, including inferences from the evidence that rational individuals were entitled to draw. As background, the jury knew from defendant\u2019s many earlier conversations about \"tickets\u201d and his meeting with the undercover that he was involved with drugs. Further, the jury knew that in the days immediately preceding March 21 defendant was negotiating with Rojas to buy kilos of cocaine and that on March 21 Rojas said that he was coming over. The unidentified man\u2019s visit to the apartment building with the parcel \u2014 coinciding to the minute with defendant\u2019s conversations \u2014 was fully consistent with defendant\u2019s several later admissions that he had met with a courier but rejected his merchandise. While the dissent would ignore the totality of this evidence, the jury most assuredly was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Rejection as Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">We similarly disagree with the Appellate Division\u2019s suggestion that defendant\u2019s \"flat rejection\u201d of the drugs vitiated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>attempt. Penal Law \u00a7 40.10 (3) provides an affirmative defense to an attempt charge \"under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of [the] criminal purpose\u201d. To qualify for this defense, \"the abandonment must be permanent, not temporary or contingent, not simply a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until another time\u201d <em>(People v Taylor, </em>80 NY2d 1, 13-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">An abandonment theory is inapposite here. First, abandonment is an affirmative defense (Penal Law \u00a7 40.10 [3]; <em>People v Taylor, </em>80 NY2d, at 15, <em>supra), </em>meaning that defendant has the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence (Penal Law \u00a7 25.00 [2]; <em>People v Butts, </em>72 NY2d 746, 749, n 1). At trial, however, defendant never sought to present a renunciation defense. Second, and even more fundamentally, the evidence revealed that even after rejecting the March 21 offer, defendant continued making efforts to obtain cocaine. Thus, while it may be true that there was an abandonment \"with respect to [that] particular quantity of cocaine\u201d (172 AD2d, at 106, <em>supra), </em>this is immaterial for purposes of the statutory renunciation defense. Rather, there must be an abandonment of over-all criminal enterprise <em>(see, People v Taylor, </em>80 NY2d, at 14, <em>supra), </em>which on this record plainly was not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">On this appeal, defendant raises several other arguments which were summarily rejected by the Appellate Division. Inasmuch as the relief he seeks \u2014 a new trial \u2014 goes beyond mere affirmance of the Appellate Division order and thus constitutes a request for affirmative relief, defendant was required to obtain leave to appeal <em>(see, People v Carpenito, </em>80 NY2d 65, 68). Defendant in fact sought leave to appeal from a Judge of this Court, but his application was denied (79 NY2d 971). Thus, we are precluded from reviewing defendant\u2019s alternative contentions seeking a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">We note, however, that although the Appellate Division rejected defendant\u2019s \"other\u201d claims, by reversing the attempted possession conviction and vacating the resultant sentence that court necessarily did not pass on defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Therefore, on remittal, should the Appellate Division uphold the attempted possession conviction upon exercise of its factual review power, that court should consider defendant\u2019s excessive sentence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, the conviction for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree reinstated, and the case remitted to that court for consideration of the facts (CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-12\">. These conversations were routinely conducted in code words such as \"tickets\u201d or \"tires\u201d which the prosecution expert testified represented kilos of cocaine. Many such conversations were recorded in the weeks leading up to defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. Defendant was sentenced to a concurrent term of <em>8\u2153 </em>to 25 years on the conspiracy charge, also the maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-10\">. Indeed, the statute interpreted in <em>Rizzo, </em>former Penal Law \u00a72, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>similar to the present version. The repealed statute provided: \"An act, done with intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its commission, is 'an attempt to commit that crime.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Under the revised Penal Law, all attempts were initially classified for sentencing purposes at a lower grade than the completed crime <em>(see, </em>L 1965, ch 1030), but subsequent legislation, premised on the belief that certain attempts \u2014 including attempted possession of a controlled substance in the first degree \u2014 were as serious as the completed crime, classified the attempt at the same grade as the consummated crime <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [1]; Donnino, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law \u00a7 110.05, at 427).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\">. A kilogram weighs 35 ounces.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b735-5\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av\">(dissenting). To uphold defendant\u2019s conviction of an attempt, it must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that his acts came \"dangerously close\u201d to committing the substantive crime. That someone got out of a car carrying a bag and entered the apartment building adds nothing to the proof of the attempted crime. There was no proof of who this man was, what was in the bag, where the man went inside the building or who owned the car. Any connection of this proof with defendant would necessarily be based on pure speculation. The critical question, then, is whether defendant\u2019s wiretapped phone calls, standing alone, or even in conjunction with the evidence of a man and his bag, could constitute sufficient evidence for a finding of guilt. Without more, these phone conversations, and other evidence submitted, were insufficient to show that defendant came \"dangerously close\u201d to possessing drugs. I, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The police obtained a court order authorizing a wiretap of defendant\u2019s telephone. The wiretap, in place in 1987 and 1988, revealed that defendant was anticipating a delivery of cocaine on March 21, 1988. Defendant was arrested on June 22, 1988 and charged with conspiracy in the second degree based on his intent to commit the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first and second degrees and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first and second degrees. Defendant was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">A police officer assigned to stakeout defendant\u2019s apartment building testified at trial that shortly after noon on March 21, 1988, he observed a small white four-door vehicle drive up to the front of the six-story apartment building in which defendant lived. The officer also testified that he saw a male Hispanic exit the car, remove a black and white plastic bag with long, completely stretched handles from the trunk, and enter the courtyard leading to the building. No one followed the person into the building to ascertain where he went. The officer testified further that the same man left the building 15 minutes later with the same bag with similarly stretched handles. According to the officer, the man walked to the rear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>of his vehicle, opened the trunk, placed the bag back inside, got into the vehicle, drove a few feet, made a U-turn, and drove back past the police vehicle in which he was seated. The officer testified that he never stopped the driver of the white vehicle or ascertained what was in the bag. This incident, along with overheard conversations of defendant that he had rejected \"tickets\u201d (allegedly cocaine), presented the sole basis for convicting defendant of attempted possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy to possess a controlled substance in the second degree. The Appellate Division modified by dismissing the attempted possession conviction, the majority holding that, with respect to the attempted possession charge, the evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish that defendant\u2019s conduct came \"very near\u201d or \"dangerously near\u201d to completion of the crime under settled New York precedents (172 AD2d 103, 106).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Two Justices dissented <em>(see, id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Penal Law \u00a7 110.00 states that \"[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, [the person] engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime.\u201d This Court has held that Penal Law \u00a7 110.00 requires a showing that defendant \"committed an act or acts that carried the project forward within dangerous proximity to the criminal end to be attained\u201d <em>(People v Warren, </em>66 NY2d 831, 832). A person is guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree when the person knowingly and unlawfully possesses four or more ounces of a narcotic drug <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 220.21 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In <em>Warren (supra), </em>this Court affirmed the dismissal of indictments charging two defendants with attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance where several contingencies stood between an earlier agreement to purchase and the contemplated purchase. The Grand Jury testimony showed that the defendants agreed to purchase cocaine from a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>informant, but the transaction was not consummated because the informant did not have enough cocaine, the defendants did not have enough money, and the cocaine was not properly packaged. The informant agreed to meet the defendants later that evening to test the cocaine and effect the transaction. Before the informant departed, and while defendants were examining one-ounce bags of cocaine, police officers who were secretly watching the transaction entered the room and arrested them. This Court concluded that \"the defendants did not come very near to the accomplishment of the intended crime\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 833).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Here, too, the evidence adduced at trial does not establish that defendant came very near to the accomplishment of the crime of possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. According to the wiretap information, defendant had been anticipating a delivery of \"tickets\u201d from his suppliers for resale to a customer. The police observed an Hispanic male enter and leave the courtyard of the apartment building in which defendant lived carrying a heavy-laden shopping bag. The People assert that the unidentified male brought a supply of cocaine to defendant\u2019s apartment and defendant rejected the supply. However, the stakeout police officer did not stop and question the Hispanic male or ascertain what was in the shopping bag, nor did he observe the male approach or enter defendant\u2019s apartment. Thus, the testimony that an unidentified man entered and exited defendant\u2019s apartment building amounts to no material evidence at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The sole basis for defendant\u2019s guilt was the wiretap conversations in which defendant told another individual that he had just rejected a delivery of \"tickets\u201d as unacceptable because it was \"no good\u201d and \"stuck together.\u201d The evidence adduced simply does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the attempted possession of cocaine by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Acting Chief Judge Simons and Judges Titone and Bellacosa concur with Judge Kaye; Judge Smith dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Hancock, Jr., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> It should be noted that although no objection to it was made by either party, the court erroneously charged the Federal standard on attempt in that a \"substantial step\u201d is required for the completion rather than the New York standard of a requirement that conduct come \"very near\u201d or \"dangerously near\u201d to completion <em>(United States v Jackson, </em>560 F2d 112, <em>cert denied </em>434 US 941).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
