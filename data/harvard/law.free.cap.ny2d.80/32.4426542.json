II. As the de facto owner of the vehicle in question, defendant-appellant Avis is vicariously liable pursuant to section 388 of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law. <em>(O\u2019Connor v LeeHy Paving Corp., </em>579 F2d 194; <em>Boxer v Gottlieb, </em>652 F Supp 1056; <em>Scharfman v National Jewish Hosp. &amp; Research Center, </em>122 AD2d 939; <em>Fogel v Hertz Inti., </em>141 AD2d 375; <em>Matter of Sentry Ins.

Where defendant KalmanofFs medical treatment of his wife, and his special relationship and duty to plaintiffs are at issue, the court below properly denied summary judgment to defendant Kalmanoff. <em>(Eiseman v State of New York, </em>70 NY2d 175; <em>Purdy v Public Adm\u2019r of County of Westchester, 72 </em>NY2d 1.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b96-6\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Plaintiffs in both of these cases seek damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of two unrelated automobile accidents. The common elements are that both accidents occurred on the West Indies island of Jamaica and both involved vehicles that had been leased from Jamaican companies that were licensed, directly or indirectly, by car rental companies operating or based in New York. Each plaintiff contends that the New York rental concerns may be held liable under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388, which makes a vehicle owner liable for the negligence of a person using or operating the vehicle with permission. For the reasons that follow, we reject these contentions and hold that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 is inapplicable in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\n<em>Fried v Seippel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Plaintiffs decedent, Andrew Fried, and defendant Alexander Seippel, both New York residents, had gone on a vacation to Jamaica together. Having secured an \"Avis\u201d travel voucher in New York, Fried had leased an automobile from West Indies Car Rental, Ltd. (WICR), a Jamaican concern licensed by Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc. (Avis), which does business in New York. Fried was killed when the rented vehicle in which he and Seippel were driving crossed onto the other side of the road and hit another vehicle head-on. It is unclear which of the two men was driving at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Fried\u2019s administratrix brought the present action against Seippel, WICR and Avis, alleging that Seippel had been the negligent driver and that Avis was vicariously liable under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 by virtue of its de facto ownership of the vehicle in which the accident had occurred. When Avis moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint against it on the ground that the vehicle was owned by WICR rather than itself, plaintiff countered by arguing that WICR was merely Avis\u2019s alter ego and that Avis rather than WICR should be deemed the vehicle\u2019s true owner. In support of this contention, plaintiff submitted evidence tending to show a close relationship between Avis and WICR.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On the basis of plaintiff\u2019s submissions, the trial court denied Avis\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Appellate Division affirmed this aspect of the trial court\u2019s order, holding that \"issues of fact exist as to whether Avis, although not the owner of the vehicle, is precluded, by virtue of its relationship with * * * WICR, from disclaiming liability\u201d (170 AD2d 303, 304). Both courts below assumed that if Avis were deemed the vehicle\u2019s owner, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 would be applicable. The Appellate Division granted Avis leave to take a further appeal, certifying the following question of law: \"Was the order of this Court, which modified the order of the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\n<em>Berkrot v National Car Rental</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">As in <em>Fried, </em>the injured plaintiff in this case, a New York domiciliary, was involved in an automobile accident while vacationing in Jamaica. At the time of the accident, the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>was driven by the injured plaintiffs friend, Catherine Kalmanoff, who was killed as a result of the car\u2019s head-on collision with a minivan. The automobile in question had been leased by Herbert Kalmanoff, the deceased\u2019s husband, from a Jamaican car rental company, Greenlight Car Rentals and Transport Ltd. (Greenlight). Greenlight was the licensee of National Car Rental System International (NCR-International), which, in turn, was licensed by National Car Rental (NCR), a firm doing business in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Plaintiffs commenced an action against NCR, arguing that the New York-based rental company was liable under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 because its relationship with the Jamaican vehicle owner of record, Greenlight, was such that Green-light should be deemed NCR\u2019s alter ego and Greenlight\u2019s record ownership of the accident vehicle should be attributed to NCR. Plaintiffs also sued the deceased\u2019s husband, Herbert Kalmanoff, both individually and in his capacity as the administrator of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">NCR moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint against it on the ground that it was an improper party and on the additional ground that Jamaica, rather than New York, was the proper forum for this action. Plaintiffs responded to NCR\u2019s improper party argument by relying principally on the provisions of the licensing agreement between Greenlight and NCR-International, which, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, demonstrated that NCR, either directly or through its licensee NCR-International, was the true controlling force behind Greenlight. Kalmanoff also moved for summary judgment, both on the ground of forum non conveniens and on the separate ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The trial court denied the motions for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits, holding that \"an issue of fact is presented as to whether Greenlight is [NCR-International\u2019s] agent and whether the international company is defendant\u2019s agent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the court dismissed the action on forum non conveniens grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">On cross appeals by all parties, the Appellate Division agreed that \"factual issues exist with respect to [NCR\u2019s] relationship with Green Light\u201d and that summary judgment was therefore improper (175 AD2d 80, 82). The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>found that \"factual issues exist as to the possible special relationship and duty owed by defendant Kalmanoff to plaintiffs,\u201d precluding a grant of summary judgment in his favor <em>(id., </em>at 82-83). Finally, the court reversed the dismissal of the action for forum non conveniens, concluding that \"[the] litigation has a substantial nexus to New York.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 82.) The Appellate Division then granted NCR and Kalmanoff leave to appeal to this Court, certifying the following question: \"Was the order of this Court, which modified the order of the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In both of these cases, the parties and the courts below focused principally on whether the New York licensors of the Jamaican auto rental agencies should be deemed the \"owners\u201d of the accident vehicles for purposes of establishing liability under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388. To the extent that the parties have discussed the special problem arising from the fact that these accidents occurred in a foreign jurisdiction, they have concentrated their arguments primarily on conflicts-of-laws principles and, more specifically, on whether New York\u2019s \"interests analysis\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> supports application of New York law in the situations presented here. However, even if New York\u2019s substantive law were held applicable to these lawsuits and even if defendants Avis and NCR were deemed the \"owners\u201d of the accident vehicles within the meaning of section 388 of New York\u2019s Vehicle and Traffic Law, a question would remain as to whether these accidents involving vehicles registered and operated in Jamaica fall within the statute\u2019s coverage. It is to this question that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Section 388 (1) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that \"[e]very owner of a vehicle used or operated in this state shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries * * * resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle * * * by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of such owner.\u201d The statute imposes vicarious liability on vehicle owners for the negligence of anyone using or operating their vehicles with permission. As is evident from the underscored language, however, the literal statutory terms do not impose such liability on owners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>vehicles that are \"used or operated\u201d exclusively outside of this State\u2019s borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It has been suggested that the import of the above-cited limiting language has been modified by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Farber v Smolack </em>(20 NY2d 198), in which we explicitly held for the first time that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 may be applicable even though the accident in question occurred in another State <em>(cf., Macey v Rozbicki, </em>18 NY2d 289 [section 388 applied to Ontario accident without mention of extraterritoriality problem]). The <em>Farber </em>Court, however, did not go so far as to hold that liability under section 388 may be premised on ownership of a vehicle that was neither registered nor ever operated or used in New York. To the contrary, the Court was careful to note that, although the accident had occurred in North Carolina, the accident vehicle had been registered in New York, had been used in New York before the accident and had been on its way back to New York after a brief sojourn to Florida at the time the accident occurred (20 NY2d, at 202, 203). Indeed, the holding in <em>Farber </em>has little bearing on the statutory construction problem presented here, since, by virtue of its prior \"use * * * or operation] in this state,\u201d the accident vehicle in <em>Farber </em>was indisputably within section 388\u2019s substantive coverage and the only question was whether, as a matter of judicially established cdhflicts principles, New York had a sufficient interest in the controversy to apply its own law. Here, in contrast, it is the substantive applicability of section 388 to these particular accident vehicles that is itself in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Inasmuch as neither <em>Farber </em>nor any of the subsequent cases that the parties have cited suggests that section 388\u2019s in-State use-or-operation requirement should be construed other than in accordance with its common or ordinary meaning,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that the vicarious liability imposed by section 388 (1) does not extend to owners of vehicles that have never been registered, used, operated or intended for use within this State. Indeed, a contrary interpretation would make little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sense in light of the over-all legislative scheme governing the protection of automobile accident victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 is part of the legislatively prescribed system for protecting innocent victims of automobile accidents by assuring that there will be a financially responsible party who is available to answer in damages <em>(see, Continental Auto Lease Corp. v Campbell, </em>19 NY2d 350). In addition to making the owner of a vehicle vicariously liable for the negligence of anyone driving it with permission, the statute requires that all vehicle owners procure insurance to cover the liability it creates <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 [1], [4]). This linkage of an owner\u2019s vicarious liability to an owner\u2019s obligation to maintain adequate insurance coverage suggests that the Legislature\u2019s goal was to ensure that owners of vehicles that are subject to regulation in New York \"act responsibly\u201d with regard to those vehicles <em>(Boxer v Gottlieb, </em>652 F Supp 1056, 1065; <em>accord, Johnson v Hertz Corp., </em>315 F Supp 302, 304-305). Such a goal would not be advanced by imposing vicarious liability for vehicles having no connection with New York other than the fortuitous circumstance that their owners may be New York residents <em>(cf., Klippel v U-Haul Co., </em>759 F2d 1176, 1182 [New York \"has little or no legitimate interest in providing additional security for * * * New York residents who are injured in other (jurisdictions) while riding in vehicles having no connection with New York\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>Herzog, <em>Conflict of Laws, </em>27 Syracuse L Rev 17, 29-31 [criticizing <em>Cunningham v McNair </em>(48 AD2d 546) and suggesting that due process would forbid applying New York law in these circumstances]).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Thus, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 does not provide a basis for holding Avis or NCR liable in these cases, since, regardless of any theoretical possibility that Avis and NCR were the de facto owners of the accident vehicles, the vehicles were registered, operated and used exclusively on the island of Jamaica, far from New York\u2019s borders. Consequently, they were beyond the statute\u2019s intended reach. Accordingly, the complaints against Avis and NCR should have been dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We reach a different conclusion with respect to the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>asserted by the <em>Berkrot </em>plaintiffs against defendant Kalmanoff, the lessee of the accident vehicle. In response to his motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs asserted that, as the deceased driver\u2019s husband and physician, Kalmanoff, a medical doctor, should have been aware of certain conditions, notably his wife\u2019s abnormal behavior, inattentiveness and bizarre sleeping patterns, which rendered her unfit to operate a motor vehicle. In light of this knowledge, according to plaintiffs, Kalmanoffs decision to permit the deceased to drive the automobile he had rented was negligent and constituted a breach of a specific duty that he owed to them because they were guests in his Jamaica home and he was aware that the injured plaintiff would be a passenger in the vehicle. Kalmanoff does not dispute that if these allegations were proven to the satisfaction of a fact finder, they would establish his liability for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Instead, he argues only that plaintiffs should not be permitted to prosecute their theory because it was not pleaded in their complaint or detailed in their bill of particulars. However, we conclude that the theory\u2019s omission from prior pleadings should not prevent plaintiffs from proving it at trial, since the pleadings at least gave notice of the transactions or occurrences intended to be proved and Kalmanoff has not demonstrated that he has been in any way prejudiced <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3013; <em>see generally, </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7208 [2d ed]; <em>cf., </em>CPLR 3016, 3026). Hence, KalmanofFs motion for summary judgment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Accordingly, in <em>Fried v Seippel, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, defendant Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment granted and the certified question answered in the negative. In <em>Berkrot v National Car Rental, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to defendant National Car Rental against plaintiffs, by granting National Car Rental\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and, as so modified, affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>with costs to plaintiffs against defendant Kalmanoff; the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In <em>Fried v Seippel: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In <em>Berkrot v National Car Rental: </em>Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\">. The Appellate Division had modified by granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s individual claim. That aspect of its order is not contested here. The court also granted defendant WICR leave to appeal, but that party\u2019s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\">. The court did not explicitly address the merits of defendant Kalmanoff s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">. <em>See, e.g., Schultz v Boy Scouts, </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Babcock v Jackson, </em>12 NY2d 473; <em>Kilberg v Northeast Airlines, </em>9 NY2d 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">. It is true that the <em>Farber </em>Court stated that \"in adding the words 'in this state\u2019 to [the statute], the Legislature was not concerned with extraterritorial effect\u201d (20 NY2d, at 204). However, that comment, when considered in context, cannot fairly be construed as entirely eliminating the in-State use-or-operation requirement. Rather, the Court was merely indicating that the language in question was not intended to foreclose an owner\u2019s liability under section 388 for an out-of-State accident <em>where the statute, by its terms, is otherwise applicable.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. As an alternative to their Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 claim, plaintiffs in <em>Berkrot v National Car Rental </em>sought to hold NCR liable under principles of agency law on the theory that, as Greenlight\u2019s principal, NCR was responsible for Greenlight\u2019s negligence in maintaining the accident vehicle. However, plaintiffs offered no proof in response to NCR\u2019s summary judgment motion either that the accident vehicle had been negligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>maintained or that a mechanical failure was the proximate cause of the accident. Although plaintiffs contend that further discovery could be helpful in obtaining proof to document this alternative ground for recovery, their contention does not furnish an adequate ground for denying NCR summary judgment, since, apart from sheer speculation, plaintiff has offered no reason to believe that further discovery would be fruitful on this issue. The <em>Berkrot </em>plaintiffs\u2019 additional contention that, if proven to be the vehicle\u2019s true owner, NCR could be held vicariously liable under Jamaican law is similarly unavailing because the substance of Jamaican law was not pleaded in their complaint and no subsequent motion to amend the pleadings was made <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3016 [e]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
