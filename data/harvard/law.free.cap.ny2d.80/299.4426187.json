The Court below erred in applying <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>to State supervised foster care cases. <em>(Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d 368; <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543; <em>Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d 374; <em>Matter of Thomas TT., </em>67 AD2d 788; <em>Matter of Jonathan D., </em>62 AD2d 947; <em>Matter of Lamond B, </em>64 AD2d 625; <em>Little Flower Children\u2019s Servs. v Andrew C., </em>144 Misc 2d 671; <em>Matter of Susan, </em>124 Misc 2d 443; <em>Matter of Mehl, </em>114 Misc 2d 55; <em>Matter of Jamie M., </em>63 NY2d 388.) II. The Family Court properly recognized that once a fit parent seeks return of a child in voluntary foster care and a termination proceeding is dismissed, its inquiry is limited to determining parental fitness and grave harm to the child. <em>(Matter of Spence-Chapin Adoption Serv. v Polk, </em>29 NY2d 196; <em>Matter of Male Infant L., </em>61 NY2d 420; <em>Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d 374; <em>Matter of Jabril P., </em>105 Misc 2d 219; <em>Little Flower Children\u2019s Servs. v Andrew C., </em>144 Misc 2d 671.) III. Assuming, arguendo, <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>does apply, the requisite extraordinary circumstances were not established here. <em>(Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543; <em>Matter of Dickson v Lascaris, </em>53 NY2d 204; <em>Matter of Male Infant L., </em>61 NY2d 420; <em>Matter of Ricky Ralph M., </em>56 NY2d 77; <em>Raysor v Gabbey, </em>57 AD2d 437; <em>Matter of Pernice v Cote, </em>116 AD2d 945; <em>Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d 374; <em>Matter of Alfredo S. v Nassau County Dept, of Social Servs., </em>172 AD2d 528; <em>Matter of Jamie M., </em>63 NY2d 388.) IV. The Court below\u2019s disposition was in error since it awarded custody to the foster parents under Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) (b) which has no application here. <em>(Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-5\"><em>Lenore Gittis, </em>New York City <em>(Marcia Egger </em>of counsel), for respondent Law Guardian for Michael B.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKq\">I. The Court below properly required a best interests hearing pursuant to <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>where, following a permanent neglect finding and a suspended judgment, discharge of the 5\u00bd-year-old child to appellant father who had had virtually no contact with his son for the first few years of the child\u2019s life was being contemplated and the child was profoundly attached to the foster parents with whom he had lived from early infancy until the age of five. <em>(Matter of Sheila G, </em>61 NY2d 368; <em>Matter of Ricky Ralph M., </em>56 NY2d 77; <em>Matter of Dickson v Lascaris, </em>53 NY2d 204; <em>Matter of Boedecker-Frey v Boedecker-Frey, </em>176 AD2d 392; <em>David W. v Julia W., </em>158 AD2d 1; <em>Matter of Jamie M., </em>63 NY2d 388; <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>NY2d 543; <em>Matter of Alfredo S. v Nassau County Dept, of Social Servs., </em>172 AD2d 528; <em>Matter of Lillie Mae W., </em>116 AD2d 1026, 67 NY2d 938; <em>Matter of Thomas TT., 67 </em>AD2d 788.) II. Extraordinary circumstances exist because of the protracted period of separation of parent and child for which appellant was primarily responsible and in the child\u2019s deep attachment to his foster parents. <em>(Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d 374; <em>Matter of Sheila G., 61 </em>NY2d 368; <em>Matter of Male Infant L., </em>61 NY2d 420; <em>Matter of Spence-Chapin Adoption Serv. v Polk, </em>29 NY2d 196; <em>Matter of Alfredo S. v Nassau County Dept, of Social Servs., </em>172 AD2d 528; <em>Matter of Fay H., </em>103 AD2d 977.) III. The weight of the credible evidence clearly established that discharge of Michael to appellant was contrary to his best interests under the standards of either (a) a limited inquiry, since appellant\u2019s lack of fitness as a parent and the grievous harm to Michael while in his care were manifest; or (b) a full-scale hearing, where comparing the foster parents\u2019 advantages to Michael\u2019s interest in being raised by his biological father showed that Michael\u2019s best interests would be served by placement with the foster parents. <em>(Roth v Michelson, </em>55 NY2d 278; <em>People v Graham, </em>55 NY2d 144; <em>Matter of Boedecker-Frey v Boedecker-Frey, </em>176 AD2d 392; <em>David W. v Julia W., </em>158 AD2d 1; <em>Matter of Bennett v Marrow, 59 </em>AD2d 492.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-5\"><em>Wattman &amp; Wechsler, P.

The Court below correctly reversed the decision of the Family Court which failed to hold a dispositional hearing on the issue of custody to determine the best interests of Michael B. in light of the extraordinary circumstances presented. <em>(Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d 368; <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543; <em>Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d 374; <em>Matter of Jonathan D., </em>62 AD2d 947, 45 NY2d 706, 97 Misc 2d 859; <em>Matter of Mary H. v Helen P., </em>131 AD2d 571; <em>Matter of Lamond B., </em>64 AD2d 625; <em>Matter of Jean Yvette E., 59 </em>AD2d 907; <em>Matter of Lillie Mae W, </em>116 AD2d 1026, 67 NY2d 938; <em>Matter of Belinda B., </em>114 AD2d 70.) II. The Court below correctly reversed the Family Court decision awarding custody of the infant, Michael B., to appellant, as that decision was against the weight of the credible evidence presented at trial whether utilizing a \"best interest\u201d or \"parental fitness/grave harm\u201d inquiry. <em>(Matter of Bannister v Bannister, </em>81 AD2d 913; <em>People ex rel.

The biological father (appellant) on one side, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and respondent foster parents (joined by respondent Law Guardian) on the other, each contend that a custody determination in their favor is in the best interest of the child, as that term is used in Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6), the statute governing dispositions with respect to children in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The subject of this protracted battle is Michael B., born July 29, 1985 with a positive toxicology for cocaine. Michael was voluntarily placed in foster care from the hospital by his mother, who was unmarried at the time of the birth and listed no father on the birth certificate. Michael\u2019s four siblings were then also in foster care, residing in different homes. At three months, before the identity of his father was known, Michael \u2014needing extraordinary care \u2014 was placed in the home of intervenor Maggie W. L., a foster parent certified by respondent Catholic Child Care Society (the agency), and the child remained with the L.\u2019s for more than five years, until December 1990. It is undisputed that the agency initially assured Mrs. L. this was a \"preadoptive\u201d placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Legal proceedings began in May 1987, after appellant had been identified as Michael\u2019s father. The agency sought to terminate the rights of both biological parents and free the child for adoption, alleging that for more than a year following Michael\u2019s placement the parents had failed to substantially, continuously or repeatedly maintain contact with Michael and plan for his future, although physically and financially able to do so (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7]). Michael\u2019s mother (since deceased) never appeared in the proceeding, and a finding of permanent neglect as to her was made in November 1987. Appellant did appear and in September 1987 consented to a finding of permanent neglect, and to committing custody and guardianship to the agency on condition that the children be placed with their two godmothers. That order was later vacated, on appellant\u2019s application to withdraw his pleas and obtain custody, because the agency had not in fact placed the children with their godmothers. In late 1987, appellant \u2014 a long-time alcohol and substance abuser \u2014 entered an 18-month residential drug rehabilitation program and first began to visit Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In August 1988, appellant, the agency and the Law Guardian agreed to reinstatement of the permanent neglect finding, with judgment suspended for 12 months, on condition that appellant: (1) enroll in a program teaching household management and parenting skills; (2) cooperate by attending and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>complying with the program; (3) remain drug-free, and periodically submit to drug testing, with test results to be delivered to the agency; (4) secure and maintain employment; (5) obtain suitable housing; and (6) submit a plan for the children\u2019s care during his working day <em>(see, </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 631 [b]; \u00a7 633). The order recited that it was without prejudice to the agency recalendaring the case for a de nova hearing on all allegations of the petition should appellant fail to satisfy the conditions, and otherwise said nothing more of the consequences that would follow on appellant\u2019s compliance or noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">As the 12-month period neared expiration, the agency sought a hearing to help \"determine the status and placement of the children.\u201d Although appellant was unemployed (he was on public assistance) and had not submitted to drug testing during the year, Family Court at the hearing held October 24, 1989 was satisfied that \"there seem[ed] to be substantial compliance\u201d with the conditions of the suspended judgment. Because the August 1988 order was unclear as to who had responsibility for initiating the drug tests, the court directed that the agency arrange three successive blood and urine tests, and if the tests proved negative, \"all subject children may be released to father except Jemel [a 'special needs\u2019 child].\u201d The matter was adjourned to December 21, when it was joined with respondents\u2019 application for a dispositional order with respect to Michael, whose long residence with the L.\u2019s, they said, raised special concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On December 21, 1989, the Law Guardian presented a report indicating that Michael might suffer severe psychological damage if removed from his foster home, and argued for a \"best interests\u201d hearing pursuant to <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>(40 NY2d 543), based on Michael\u2019s bonding with the L.\u2019s and, by contrast, his lack of bonding with appellant, who had visited him infrequently. Family Court questioned whether it even had authority for such a hearing, but stayed the order directing Michael\u2019s discharge to appellant pending its determination. Michael\u2019s siblings, then approximately twelve, eight, seven and six years old, were released to appellant in January and July 1990. Litigation continued as to Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In November 1990, Family Court directed Michael\u2019s discharge to appellant, concluding that it was without \"authority or jurisdiction\u201d to rehear the issue of custody based on the child\u2019s best interest, and indeed that Michael had been wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>fully held in foster care. The court noted, additionally, that the Law Guardian\u2019s arguments as to Michael\u2019s best interest went to issues of bonding with his temporary custodians rather than appellant\u2019s insufficiency as a parent \u2014 bonding that had been reinforced by the agency\u2019s failure to ensure sufficient contacts with appellant during the proceedings. Appellant \"should not be denied custody simply because of the actions of the [agency] and the lengthy litigation following final disposition has resulted in the foster parents enjoying a stronger emotional tie to the child than the [appellant].\u201d The court directed that Michael commence immediate weekend visitation with appellant, with a view to transfer within 60 days. Michael was discharged to appellant in December 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The Appellate Division reversed and remitted for a new hearing and new consideration of Michael\u2019s custody, concluding that dismissal of a permanent neglect petition cannot divest Family Court of its continuing jurisdiction over a child until there has been a \"best interests\u201d custody disposition (171 AD2d 790). As for the relevance of bonding, the Appellate Division held that, given the \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d <em>(Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d, at 544, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 referring particularly to Michael\u2019s long residence with his foster parents \u2014 Family Court should have conducted a hearing to consider issues such as the impact on the child of a change in custody. There having been no question of appellant\u2019s fitness, however, the Appellate Division permitted Michael to remain with his father pending the new determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On remittal, Family Court heard extensive testimony \u2014 including testimony from appellant, the foster parents, the agency (having changed its goal to discharge to appellant), and psychological, psychiatric and social work professionals (who overwhelmingly favored continued foster care over discharge to appellant) \u2014 but adhered to its determination that Michael should be released to his father. Family Court found appellant \"fit, available and capable of adequately providing for the health, safety and welfare of the subject child, and * * * it is in the child\u2019s best interest to be returned to his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Again the Appellate Division reversed Family Court\u2019s order, this time itself awarding custody to the foster parents under Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) (b), and remitting the matter to a different Family Court Judge solely to determine appellant\u2019s visitation rights (180 AD2d 792). Exercising its own authority \u2014as broad as that of the hearing court \u2014 to assess the credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ity of witnesses and character and temperament of the parents, the court reviewed the evidence and, while pointing up appellant\u2019s many deficiencies, significantly stopped short of finding him an unfit parent, as it had the power to do. Rather, the court looked to Michael\u2019s lengthy stay and psychological bonding with the foster family, which it felt gave rise to extraordinary circumstances meriting an award of custody to the foster parents. According to the Appellate Division, the evidence \"overwhelmingly demonstrate^] that Michael\u2019s foster parents are better able than his natural father to provide for his physical, emotional, and intellectual needs.\u201d (180 AD2d, at 794.) Since early 1992, Michael has once again resided with the L.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">While prolonged, inconclusive proceedings and seesawing custody of a young child \u2014 all in the name of Michael\u2019s best interest \u2014 could not conceivably serve his interest at all, we granted appellant father\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, and now reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s central holdings. The opinions of Family Court specifying deficiencies of the agency and foster parents, and the opinions of the Appellate Division specifying inadequacies of the biological parent, leave little question that the only blameless person is the child. But rather than assess fault, our review will address the legal standards that have twice divided Family Court and the Appellate Division, hopefully minimizing recurrences, for this child and others, of the tragic scenario now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellant no longer disputes that Family Court retained jurisdiction to consider the child\u2019s best interest in connection with an award of custody even after the finding that he had substantially satisfied the conditions of the suspended judgment. All parties agree with the correctness of the Appellate Division determination that, despite appellant\u2019s apparent compliance with the conditions of the suspended judgment, Family Court retained jurisdiction to consider the best interest of the children in foster care until a final order of disposition (171 AD2d, at 791; Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [6], [9]; <em>Matter of Sheila G, </em>61 NY2d 368, 389).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">What remains the bone of contention in this Court is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>scope of the requisite \"best interest\u201d inquiry under Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6). Appellant urges that in cases of foster care, so long as the biological parent is not found unfit \u2014 and he underscores that neither Family Court nor the Appellate Division found him unfit \u2014 \"best interest of the child\u201d is only a limited inquiry addressed to whether the child will suffer grievous injury if transferred out of foster care to the biological parent. Respondents, by contrast, maintain that extraordinary circumstances \u2014 such as significant bonding with foster parents, after inattention and even admitted neglect by the biological parent \u2014 trigger a full inquiry into the more suitable placement as between the biological and foster parents. Subsidiarily, appellant challenges the Appellate Division\u2019s outright award of custody to the foster parents, claiming that disposition was beyond the Court\u2019s authority under Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We conclude, first, that neither party advances the correct \"best interest\u201d test in the context of temporary foster care placements, but that appellant\u2019s view is more consistent with the statutory scheme than the broad-gouge inquiry advocated by respondents and applied by the Appellate Division. Second, we hold that the award of custody to the foster parents was impermissible as we interpret Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The Foster Care Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">This being a case of voluntary placement in foster care \u2014 a subject controlled by statute \u2014 analysis must begin with the legislative scheme, which defines and balances the parties\u2019 rights and responsibilities. An understanding of how the system is designed to operate \u2014 before the design is complicated, and even subverted, by human actors and practical realities \u2014 is essential to resolving the questions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">New York\u2019s foster care scheme is built around several fundamental social policy choices that have been explicitly declared by the Legislature and are binding on this Court (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1]). Under the statute, operating as written, appellant should have received the active support of both the agency in overcoming his parental deficiencies and the foster parents in solidifying his relationship with Michael, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>and as soon as return to the biological parent proved unrealistic, the child should have been freed for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A biological parent has a right to the care and custody of a child, superior to that of others, unless the parent has abandoned that right or is proven unfit to assume the duties and privileges of parenthood, even though the State perhaps could find \"better\u201d parents (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1] [a] [ii]; <em>Matter of Male Infant L., </em>61 NY2d 420, 426; <em>Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d 374, 382; <em>Matter of Corey L v Martin L, </em>45 NY2d 383, 391). A child is not the parent\u2019s property, but neither is a child the property of the State <em>(Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d, at 382, <em>supra </em>[citing <em>Pierce v Society of Sisters, </em>268 US 510, 535; and <em>Stanley v Illinois, </em>405 US 645]). Looking to the <em>child\u2019s </em>rights as well as the parents\u2019 rights to bring up their own children, the Legislature has found and declared that a child\u2019s need to grow up with a \"normal family life in a permanent home\u201d is ordinarily best met in the child\u2019s \"natural home\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1] [a] [i], [ii]).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Parents in temporary crisis are encouraged to voluntarily place their children in foster care without fear that they will thereby forfeit their parental rights (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-a; <em>Matter of Mehl, </em>114 Misc 2d 55, 60). The State\u2019s first obligation is to help the family with services to prevent its break-up, or to reunite the family if the child is out of the home (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1] [a] [iii]; <em>Santosky v Kramer, </em>455 US 745, 748). While a child is in foster care, the State must use diligent efforts to strengthen the relationship between parent and child, and work with the parent to regain custody (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-a [2] [c] [iv]; <em>Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d, at 385, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Because of the statutory emphasis on the biological family as best serving a child\u2019s long-range needs, the legal rights of foster parents are necessarily limited <em>(see, Smith v Organization of Foster Families, </em>431 US 816, 846). Legal custody of a child in foster care remains with the agency that places the child, not with the foster parents (Social Services Law \u00a7 383 [2]). Foster parents enter into this arrangement with the express understanding that the placement is temporary, and that the agency retains the right to remove the child upon notice at any time <em>(People ex rel. Ninesling v Nassau County Dept, of Social Servs., </em>46 NY2d 382, 387, <em>rearg denied </em>46 NY2d 836). As made clear in <em>Matter of Spence-Chapin Adoption Serv. v Polk </em>(29 NY2d 196), \"foster care custodians must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>deliver on demand not 16 out of 17 times, but every time, or the usefulness of foster care assignments is destroyed. To the ordinary fears in placing a child in foster care should not be added the concern that the better the foster care custodians the greater the risk that they will assert, out of love and affection grown too deep, an inchoate right to adopt.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 205.) Foster parents, moreover, have an affirmative obligation \u2014similar to the obligation of the State \u2014 to attempt to solidify the relationship between biological parent and child. While foster parents may be heard on custody issues <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 383 [3]), they have no standing to seek permanent custody absent termination of parental rights <em>(see, Matter of Rivers v Womack, </em>178 AD2d 532).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Fundamental also to the statutory scheme is the preference for providing children with stable, permanent homes as early as possible <em>(see, Matter of Peter L., </em>59 NY2d 513, 519). \"[W]hen it is clear that the natural parent cannot or will not provide a normal family home for the child and when continued foster care is not an appropriate plan for the child, then a permanent alternative home should be sought\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1] [a] [iv]). Extended foster care is not in the child\u2019s best interest, because it deprives a child of a permanent, nurturing family relationship <em>(see, Matter of Gregory B., </em>74 NY2d 77, 90, <em>rearg denied sub nom. Matter of Willie John B., </em>74 NY2d 880; <em>Matter of Joyce T., </em>65 NY2d 39, 47-48). Where it appears that the child may never be reunited with the biological parents, the responsible agency should institute a proceeding to terminate parental rights and free the child for adoption (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1] [b]; [3] [b]; \u00a7 392 [6] [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Parental rights may be terminated only upon clear and convincing proof of abandonment, inability to care for the child due to mental illness or retardation, permanent neglect, or severe or repeated child abuse (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [3] [g]; [4]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of the permissible dispositions in a termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>proceeding based on permanent neglect <em>(see, </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7631), the Legislature \u2014 consistent with its emphasis on the importance of biological ties, yet mindful of the child\u2019s need for early stability and permanence \u2014 has provided for a suspended judgment, which is a brief grace period designed to prepare the parent to be reunited with the child (Family Ct Act \u00a7633). Parents found to have permanently neglected a child may be given a second chance, where the court determines it is in the child\u2019s best interests (Family Ct Act \u00a7 631), but that opportunity is strictly limited in time. Parents may have up to one year (and a second year only where there are \"exceptional circumstances\u201d) during which they must comply with terms and conditions meant to ameliorate the difficulty <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 205.50 [spelling out terms and conditions]). Noncompliance may lead to revocation of the judgment and termination of parental rights. Compliance may lead to dismissal of the termination petition with the child remaining subject to the jurisdiction of the Family Court until a determination is made as to the child\u2019s disposition pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) <em>(see, Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d, at 390, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Where parental rights have not been terminated, Social Services Law \u00a7 392 promotes the objectives of stability and permanency by requiring periodic review of foster care placements. The agency having custody must first petition for review after a child has been in continuous foster care for 18 months (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [2]), and if no change is made, every 24 months thereafter (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [9]). While foster parents who have been caring for such child for the prior 12 months are entitled to notice (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [4]), and may also petition for review on their own initiative (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [2]), a petition under section 392 (captioned \"Foster care status; periodic family court review\u201d) is not an avenue to permanent custody for foster parents where the child has not been freed for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Upon such review, the court must consider the appropriateness of the agency\u2019s plan for the child, what services have been offered to strengthen and reunite the family, efforts to plan for other modes of care, and other further efforts to promote the child\u2019s welfare <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [5-a]), and in accordance with the best interest of the child, make one of the following dispositions: (1) continue the child in foster care (which may include continuation with the current foster parents) (Social Services Law \u00a7392 [6] [a]); (2) direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that the child \"be returned to the parent, guardian or relative, or [direct] that the child be placed in the custody of a relative or other suitable person or persons\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [6] [b]); or (3) require the agency (or foster parents upon the agency\u2019s default) to institute a parental rights termination proceeding (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [6] [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The key element in the court\u2019s disposition is the best interest of the child (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [6]) \u2014 the statutory term that is at the core of this appeal, and to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\"Best Interest\u201d in the Foster Care Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\"Best interests) of the child\u201d is a term that pervades the law relating to children \u2014 appearing innumerable times in the pertinent statutes, judicial decisions and literature \u2014 yet eludes ready definition. Two interpretations are advanced, each vigorously advocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Appellant would read the best interest standard of Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) narrowly, urging that Family Court should inquire only into whether the biological parent is fit, and whether the child will suffer grievous harm by being returned to the parent. Appellant urges affirmance of the Family Court orders, which (1) defined the contest as one between foster care agency and biological parent, rather than foster parent and biological parent; (2) focused first on \"the ability of the father to care for the subject child,\u201d and then on whether \"the child\u2019s emotional health will be so seriously impaired as to require continuance in foster care;\u201d and (3) concluded that appellant was fit, and that Michael would not suffer irreparable emotional harm if returned to him. Wider inquiry, appellant insists, creates an \"unwinnable beauty contest\u201d the biological parent will inevitably lose where foster placement has continued for any substantial time.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Respondents take a broader view, urging that because of extraordinary circumstances largely attributable to appellant, the Appellate Division correctly compared him with the foster parents in determining Michael\u2019s custody and concluded that the child\u2019s best interest was served by the placement that better provided for his physical, emotional and intellectual needs. Respondents rely on <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>(40 NY2d 543, <em>supra), </em>this Court\u2019s landmark decision recognizing that a child\u2019s prolonged separation from a biological parent may be considered, among other factors, to be extraordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>circumstances permitting the court to inquire into which family situation would be in the child\u2019s best interests <em>(id., </em>at 548, 551).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In that <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>concerned an unsupervised private placement, where there was no directly applicable legislation, that case is immediately distinguishable from the matter before us, which is controlled by a detailed statutory scheme <em>(Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d, at 545, <em>supra). </em>Our analysis must begin at a different point \u2014 not whether there are extraordinary circumstances, but what the Legislature intended by the words \"best interest of the child\u201d in Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Necessarily, we look first to the statute itself. The question is in part answered by Social Services Law \u00a7\u00a7 383 and 384-b, which encourage voluntary placements, with the provision that they will not result in the termination of parental rights so long as the parent is fit. To use the period during which a child lives with a foster family, and emotional ties that naturally eventuate, as a ground for comparing the biological parent with the foster parent undermines the very objective of voluntary foster care as a resource for parents in temporary crisis, who are then at risk of losing their children once a bond arises with the foster families.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Other portions of the statute support this conclusion. Significantly, after an adjudication of permanent neglect, the statute directs the disposition to be made \"solely on the basis of the best interests of the child, <em>and there shall be no presumption that such interests will be promoted by any particular disposition\u201d </em>(Family Ct Act \u00a7 631 [emphasis added]; <em>Matter of Star Leslie W., </em>63 NY2d 136, 147-148). As against this provision, Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) states only that a disposition should be made \"in accordance with the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Absent an explicit legislative directive \u2014 such as that found in Family Court Act \u00a7 631 \u2014 we are not free to overlook the legislative policies that underlie temporary foster care, including the preeminence of the biological family. Indeed, the legislative history of Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (5-a), which specifies factors that must be considered in determining the child\u2019s best interests, states \"this bill clearly advises the Family Court of certain considerations before making an order of disposition. These factors establish a clear policy of exploring all available means of reuniting the child with his family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>before the Court decides to continue his foster care or to direct a permanent adoptive placement.\u201d (Mem Accompanying Comments on Bill, NY State Bd of Social Welfare, A 12801-B, July 9,1976, Governor\u2019s Bill Jacket, L 1976, ch 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We therefore cannot endorse a pure \"best interests\u201d hearing, where biological parent and foster parents stand on equal footing and the child\u2019s interest is the sole consideration <em>(see, Matter of Spence-Chapin Adoption Serv. v Polk, </em>29 NY2d, at 204, <em>supra; People ex rel. Kropp v Shepsky, </em>305 NY 465, 469). In cases controlled by Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6), analysis of the child\u2019s \"best interest\u201d must begin not by measuring biological parent against foster parent but by weighing past and continued foster care against discharge to the biological parent, or other relative or suitable person within Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) (b) <em>(see, Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d, at 389-390, <em>supra; see also, </em>Mem Accompanying Comments on Bills, NY State Dept of Social Servs, A Int 12801-B, July 14,1976, Governor\u2019s Bill Jacket, L 1976, ch 667).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">While the facts of <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>fell outside the statute, and the Court was unrestrained by legislative prescription in defining the scope of the \"best interests\u201d inquiry, principles underlying that decision are also relevant here. It is plainly the case, for example, that a \"child may be so long in the custody of the nonparent that, even though there has been no abandonment or persisting neglect by the parent, the psychological trauma of removal is grave enough to threaten destruction of the child\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 550), and we cannot discount evidence that a child may have bonded with someone other than the biological parent. In such a case, continued foster care may be appropriate although the parent has not been found unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Under Social Services Law \u00a7 392, where a child has not been freed for adoption, the court must determine whether it is nonetheless appropriate to continue foster care temporarily, or whether the child should be permanently discharged to the biological parent (or a relative or \"other suitable person\u201d). In determining the best interest of a child in that situation, the fitness of the biological parent must be a primary factor. The court is also statutorily mandated to consider the agency\u2019s plan for the child, what services have been offered to strengthen and reunite the family, what reasonable efforts have been made to make it possible for the child to return to the natural home, and if return home is not likely, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>efforts have been or should be made to evaluate other options (Social Services Law \u00a7392 [5-a]). Finally, the court should consider the more intangible elements relating to the emotional well-being of the child, among them the impact on the child of immediate discharge versus an additional period of foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">While it is doubtful whether it could be found to be in the child\u2019s best interest to deny the parent\u2019s persistent demands for custody simply because it took so long to obtain it legally <em>(Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>47 NY2d, at 382, <em>supra), </em>neither is a lapse of time necessarily without significance in determining custody. The child\u2019s emotional well-being must be part of the equation, parental rights notwithstanding <em>(Matter of Sheila G., </em>61 NY2d, at 390, <em>supra). </em>However, while emotional well-being may encompass bonding to someone other than the biological parent, it includes as well a recognition that, absent termination of parental rights, the nonparent cannot adopt the child, and a child in continued custody with a nonparent remains in legal \u2014 and often emotional \u2014 limbo <em>(see, Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d, at 551, <em>supra)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Appellate Division, applying an erroneous \"best interest\u201d test, seemingly avoided that result when it awarded legal custody to the foster parents. We next turn to why that disposition was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Award of Legal Custody to Foster Parents</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The Appellate Division awarded legal custody of Michael to the foster parents pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) (b), noting that the statute \"permits a court to enter an order of disposition directing, <em>inter alla, </em>that a child, whose custody and care have temporarily been transferred to an authorized agency, be placed in the custody of a suitable person or persons.\u201d (180 AD2d, at 796.) The Court correctly looked to section 392 as the predicate for determining custody, but erroneously relied on paragraph (b) of subdivision (6) in awarding custody to the foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">As set forth above, there are three possible dispositions after foster care review with respect to a child not freed for adoption: continued foster care; release to a parent, guardian, relative or other suitable person; and institution of parental termination proceedings (Social Services Law \u00a7 392 [6] [a]-[c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">As the first dispositional option, paragraph (a) contemplates the continuation of foster care, with the child remaining in the custody of the authorized agency, and the arrangement remaining subject to periodic review. As a result of 1989 amendments, disposition under paragraph (a) can include an order that the child be placed with (or remain with) a particular foster family until the next review (L 1989, ch 744). Under the statutory scheme, however, foster care is temporary, contractual and supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Paragraph (b), by contrast, contemplates removal of the child from the foster care system by return to \"the parent, guardian or relative, or direction] that the child be placed in the custody of a relative or other suitable person or persons.\u201d The 1989 statutory revision added as a permissible disposition the placement of children with relatives or other suitable persons. The purpose of this amendment was to promote family stability by allowing placement with relatives, extended family members or persons like them, as an alternative to foster care <em>(see, </em>Sponsor\u2019s Mem in Support of Amended Bill, L 1989, ch 744, and 10 Day Bill Budget Report, A 7216-A, Governor\u2019s Bill Jacket; <em>see also, Matter of Peter L., </em>59 NY2d, at 519, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Plainly, the scheme does not envision also including the foster parents \u2014 who were the subject of the amendment to paragraph (a) \u2014 as \"other suitable persons.\u201d Indeed, reading paragraph (b) as the Appellate Division did, to permit removal of the child from foster care and an award of legal custody to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the foster parents, exacerbates the legal limbo status. The child is left without a placement looking to the establishment of a permanent parental relationship through adoption, or the prospect of subsequent review of foster care status with the possibility of adoption placement at that time <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [4]; <em>Matter of Peter L., </em>59 NY2d, at 519, <em>supra), </em>yet has no realistic chance of return to the biological parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The terms of paragraph (c), providing for an order that the agency institute a parental termination proceeding, further buttress the conclusion that foster parents are not included in paragraph (b). Pursuant to paragraph (c), if the court finds reasonable cause to believe there are grounds for termination of parental rights, it may order the responsible agency to institute such proceedings. If the agency fails to do so within 90 days, the foster parents themselves may bring the proceeding, unless the court believes their subsequent petition to adopt would not be approved. Thus, in the statutory scheme the Legislature has provided a means for foster parents to secure a temporary arrangement under paragraph (a) and a permanent arrangement under paragraph (c) \u2014 both of which specifically mention foster parents. They are not also implicitly included in paragraph (b), which addresses different interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We therefore conclude that the Appellate Division erred in interpreting Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) to permit the award of legal custody to respondent foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Need for Further Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">We have no occasion to apply the proper legal test to the facts at hand, as the parties urge. New circumstances require remittal to Family Court for an expedited hearing and determination of whether appellant is a fit parent and entitled to custody of Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The Court has been informed that, during the pendency of the appeal, appellant was charged with \u2014 and admitted \u2014 neglect of the children in his custody (not Michael), and that those children have been removed from his home and are again in the custody of the Commissioner of the Social Services. The neglect petitions allege that appellant abused alcohol and controlled substances including cocaine, and physically abused the children. Orders of fact finding have been entered by Family Court, Queens County, recognizing appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>lant\u2019s admission in open court to \"substance abuse, alcohol and cocaine abuse.\u201d Moreover, an Order of Protection was entered prohibiting appellant from visiting the children while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Appellant\u2019s request that we ignore these new developments and simply grant him custody, because matters outside the record cannot be considered by an appellate court, would exalt the procedural rule \u2014 important though it is \u2014 to a point of absurdity, and \"reflect no credit on the judicial process.\u201d (Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 168, at 640.) Indeed, changed circumstances may have particular significance in child custody matters <em>(see, e.g., Braiman v Braiman, </em>44 NY2d 584, 587, 590; <em>Matter of Angela D., </em>175 AD2d 244, 245; <em>Matter of Kelly Ann M., </em>40 AD2d 546). This Court would therefore take notice of the new facts and allegations to the extent they indicate that the record before us is no longer sufficient for determining appellant\u2019s fitness and right to custody of Michael, and remit the matter to Family Court for a new hearing and determination of those issues. The Appellate Division concluded that the hearing should take place before a different Judge of that court (180 AD2d, at 796), and we see no basis to disturb that determination. Pending the hearing, Michael should physically remain with his current foster parents, but legal custody should be returned to the foster care agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the matter remitted to Family Court, Kings County, for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\">. What is before us is an appeal from foster care review under Social Services Law \u00a7 392. While there should have been an order disposing of the suspended judgment upon its expiration <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 205.50 [d] [4]), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>this case appellant\u2019s \"substantial compliance\u201d with the conditions of the suspended judgment necessarily resolved the permanent neglect issue, since Family Court concluded the hearing by directing release of children to appellant after three negative drug tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Several model statutes would authorize termination of parental rights based on a child\u2019s absence from the biological home for a substantial period, with the period depending on the child\u2019s age. Such provisions were based on the notion, in circulation prior to and during the formulation of our current parental termination statute, that once a child under the age of three has been in the continuous care of the same adult for a year, it is unreasonable to presume that the child\u2019s ties with biological parents are more significant than ties with long-term caretakers <em>(see, </em>Taub, <em>Assessing the Impact of Goldstein, Freud and Solnit\u2019s Proposals: An Introductory Overview, </em>12 NYU Rev L &amp; Soc Change 485, 490). Our Legislature did not recognize prolonged separation as an additional ground for termination of parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. Although the concurrence underscores the extraordinary nature of this case, widely publicized failures of the foster care system indicate that this situation is, regrettably, all too common. To the extent the courts have a role, heartbreak can perhaps be avoided and the statutory goals of early permanence and stability advanced by clear standards and by promptness in addressing child custody matters; no custody determination should be permitted to languish for years. The clear (by no means \"constricting\u201d) standard set forth by the Court, incorporating all of the relevant considerations, helps to assure that these unfortunate cases will not be caught in an endless loop between trial and appellate courts such as we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The concurrence agrees that this case must be reversed on the section 392 (6) (b) ground because \"a contrary interpretation of that key provision, as used by the Appellate Division, would have internally contradictory implications in the field of temporary foster child placement.\u201d (Concurring opn, at 318.) The same is true of the \"best interest\u201d test in that same section, which must be read in the context of our statutory scheme requiring parents and the State to work together toward the preferred goal (so long as it remains realistic) of keeping biological families together. Given that foster parents cannot obtain permanent custody under Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) absent termination of parental rights, the concurrence\u2019s call for even greater \"flexibility,\u201d comparing foster parent to biological parent <em>(see, Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, supra), </em>obviously could not further the objectives of finality and certainty in custody determinations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b378-7\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1W\">(concurring). I agree with Judge Kaye\u2019s opinion for the Court that Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) (b) cannot be used to award permanent custody to foster parents within that statute\u2019s intended operation and integrated structure. I concur in the reversal result in this case solely for that reason, noting additionally that a contrary interpretation of that key provision, as used by the Appellate Division, would have internally contradictory implications in the field of temporary foster child placement. While I prefer an affirmance result because that might more likely conclude the litigation and allow Michael B., the 7\u00bd-year-old subject of this custody battle, to get on with his life in a more settled and constructive way, I can discern no principled route to that desirable result without sacrificing the correct application of legal prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ciples and engendering fundamentally troublesome precedential consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This separate concurrence is necessary to express my difference of degree and analytical progression with respect to the best interests analysis and test, as adopted by the Court, for purposes of the remittal of this case and as the controlling guidance for countless other proceedings in the future. I would not relegate <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>(40 NY2d 543) essentially to general relevance only, would not limit the beginning of the analysis to the statutory setting, and would allow for appropriate flexibility as to the range and manner of exercising discretion in the application of the best interests test by the Family Courts and Appellate Divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">I believe courts, in the fulfillment of the <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility of the State, should, as a general operating principle, have an appropriately broad range of power to act in the best interests of children. We agree that the teachings of <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>(40 NY2d 543, <em>supra) </em>are still excellent and have served the process and the affected subjects and combatants in custody disputes very well. While the common-law origination in <em>Bennett </em>is a distinguishing feature from the instant case, I do not view that aspect as subordinated to or secondary in the use of its wisdom, even in a predominantly statutory setting, where this case originates. I am not persuaded that there is any support or positive authority for the view that the Legislature meant anything different when it adopted the phrase \"best interest of the child\u201d in Social Services Law \u00a7 392 (6) from the meaning of that phrase articulated in <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys (supra). </em>Courts must exercise common-law authority in all these circumstances, and the Legislature has not, as far as I can tell, displaced that uniquely judicial function and plenary role. Since the best of <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys\u2019 </em>best interest analysis enjoys continued vitality therefore, it should serve as a cogent, coequal common-law building block. In my view, it provides helpful understanding for and intertwined supplementation to the Social Services Law provisions as applied in these extraordinary circumstances, defined in one aspect of <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>as \"prolonged separation\u201d of parent and child \"for most of the child\u2019s life\u201d (40 NY2d, at 544, <em>supra). </em>The child in that case was eight years of age and none of the other serious and disquieting features of this case were apparent there.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The nuances, complexity and variations of human situations make the development and application of the general axiom\u2014 best interests of the child \u2014 exceedingly difficult. As a matter of degree and perspective, however, the Court\u2019s test is concededly more limiting than <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys (supra), </em>and therefore I believe it is more narrow than it should be in this case since I discern no compelling authority for the narrower approach. This 7\u00bd-year-old child, born of a long since deceased crack-cocaine mother, has yet to be permanently placed and has suffered a continuing, lengthy, bad trip through the maze of New York\u2019s legal system. His father has an extended history of significant substance addiction and other problems, and the child has spent much of his 7\u00bd years with the same foster parents. These graphic circumstances surely present an exceptionally extraordinary and compelling case requiring significant flexibility by the courts in resolving his best interests <em>(see, Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, supra). </em>On this aspect of the case, therefore, I agree with the Appellate Division in its two decisions in this case, at least with respect to its best interests analysis and handling of this difficult case. On March 18, 1991, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\"In view of the extraordinary circumstances present in this case, the Family Court should have conducted a hearing to consider, among other things, the impact that a change of custody will have on the child in view of the bonding which has occurred between Michael and his foster parents, who have raised him since infancy. It is, therefore, necessary to remit this matter for a hearing and a custody determination to be made in accordance with Michael\u2019s best interests <em>(see, Matter of Sheila G., supra; Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543, 550; <em>Matter of Jonathan D., </em>62 AD2d 947).\u201d (171 AD2d 790, 791.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">After the proper, broad, \"pure\u201d <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys</em>type best interests hearing was held in Family Court, the Appellate Division on February 24, 1992 added in the order now before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\"In light of the lengthy period of time during which Michael resided with and psychologically bonded to his foster parents and given the potential for emotional as well as physical harm to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Michael should permanent custody be awarded to his natural father, we find that the requisite extraordinary circumstances are present <em>(see, Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543, 545), and conclude that the best interests of this child will be served by allowing him to return to his foster parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\"In view of the testimony presented during the best interests hearing, this court concludes that Michael\u2019s natural father is incapable of giving him the emotional support so vital to his well-being <em>(see, Matter of Bennett v Marrow, </em>59 AD2d 492). The testimony presented by Dr. Sullivan and Mr. Falco indicated that an emotional void still existed between Michael and his father despite the eight to nine months during which they resided together prior to the best interests hearing and that this void showed no signs of being bridged.\u201d (180 AD2d 792, 795-796.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In sum, I cannot agree that the important and pervasive legal axiom \"best interests of the child\u201d is or was meant to be as constricted as it is in the Court\u2019s application to this case. The governing phrase and test even in this statutory scheme ought to be as all-encompassing as in <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>(40 NY2d 543, <em>supra), </em>despite the difference in the procedural origin and setting of the two cases. The approach I urge, not unlike that of the Appellate Division in this respect, better serves the objectives of finality and certainty in these matters, more realistically takes into account the widely varying human conditions, and allows the Family Courts to achieve more uniformity and evenness of application of the rules. That is a better way to promote the best interests of this youngster with reasonable finality and the best interests of all others affected by the operation of these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Titone and Hancock, Jr., concur with Judge Kaye; Judge Bellacosa concurs in result in a separate opinion; Judge Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
