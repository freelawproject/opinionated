States the inhabitants of Carondelet claim </em>6,000 <em>arpents of land, by virtue of a grant from Lieutenant-Governor Trudeau, dated December </em>7, 1796. <em>In </em>1812 <em>Congress pass an act confirming such grants, but requiring the boundaries to be officially ascertained, upon which the titles will become complete. In </em>1816, <em>one Hector, a deputy surveyor, makes a survey, and deposits the field-notes in the office of the surveyor-general. In </em>1826 <em>the Government enters and occupies a\\tract, within the commons, under a deed from some of the inhabitants, for a nominal consideration. This tract, consisting of about </em>1,700 <em>aeres, known as Jefferson Barracks, the Government still holds. In </em>1934 <em>the surveyor-general orders one Brown, his deputy, to retrace the lines of Hector\u2019s survey. It then appears that the common con tains about </em>9,000 <em>acres, over </em>10,000 <em>arpents. The surveys of Rector and Brown remain unconfirmed by the Secretary of the Interior, and it is questioned whether </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Carondelet is entitled to the whole tractor only to </em>6,000 <em>arpents. In </em>1854 <em>Ca-rondelet executes a deed of the barracks to the Government for a nominal consideration. The Secretary of the Interior thereupon confirms the surveys and issues a patent. Carondelet now brings suit to set aside the deed, on the ground that it was \u25a0extorted by the Secretary. The court below decide that the Secretary had power in </em>1854 <em>to set aside any particular survey not yet confirmed, and that the deed'made by the town was for the settlement of a doubtful title, and valid.

When the officers of the Land-Office are doing nothing, <em>i. e., </em>refraining from action, and a town desirous of procuring a patent to a tract of which it claims to he the absolute owner, offers to deed a portion thereof to the Government for a nominal consideration, and does so, receiving a patent for the residue, the transaction cannot be impeached for duress.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b378-7\">II. If in 1854 the validity, of a title was not well settled, though well settled now, and the officers of the Land-Office claimed the power of setting aside a public survey and thus destroying the title, and the Government might have filed a bill to set aside the grant growing out of the survey as improvidently made, there existed sufficient elements of doubt to form the basis of a legal compromise whereby the claimant conveyed to the Government a portion of the tract for a nominal consideration and received a patent for the residue. And this where the officers of the Land-Office were not expressly authorized by law to make any such compromise, nor to withhold any portion of the tract then claimed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b378-8\">III.

The suit was of long standing, but jurisdiction was conferred by a special act. (17 Stat. L., p. 621.)

Gamache presented to Don Zenon Trudeau, lieutenant-governor of the western part of Illinois, in the then Spanish province of Upper Louisiana, a petition praying a grant of land to him in the vicinity of the village of Carondelet; and he designated the land which he prayed for <em>11 </em>as the continuation of the lands, (common-fields,) taking for his limits the limit of Mr Constant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>thence to the Mississippi a\u2019 _(q the river Des Peres for limit, coming to the village of 0 .arondelet</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-4\">The exact position of ianq tpas sought by said G-amache does not appear; <em>h1 dt </em>it was north of the river Des Peres, a small stream runnr^ ^astwardly, and emptying into the Mississippi River aboiC,] ^Re mpe an(j a quarter south of the southern end of the vil\u2019^gse of Carondelet as it existed in 1803.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">2.

Reihle and Alvarez. The said inhabitants, in presence of their commandant, have agreed upon causing their line to be drawn from the last bound placed at the extremity of the depth of their lands, which had formerly been surveyed by Mr. Pre. Chouteau, in virtue of an order from the lieutenant-governor. Having taken the bearing course of these same lands, I found that they ran south 28\u00b0 west. I followed this same course 23 arpents 3J poles, at which distance I intersected the river Des Peres. The end of the line on the bank of the same river has been bounded with a stone, having for witness two flint-stones and one flattened lead bullet. The land of Mr. Alvarez must be distant from the said stone bound 21 feet in following the same line parallel.

This land was to be surveyed by Mr. Bartholomew Cousin, who transported himself to the village of Carondelet for that purpose. But at the moment he would set his instrument, he found it out of order and no use to him \u2014 an inconvenience which did prevent the said survey to be then made; and the short space of time that was left to attend to it, again has hindered me from being able to satisfy to the calls made on me by citizens of the settlement of Carondelet.

L., 326, chap. 151,) and Elias Rector was a deputy surveyor under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-13\">8. In that year the said Elias Rector made a survey purporting to be of the out boundary lines of the Carondelet com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>mons; the field-notes of which survey, signed \u201cE. B.,\u201d were deposited in the office of the said surveyor of public lands. It does not appear that said survey was made under the orders of said surveyor, William Eector; nor that it was ever approved by him, or by any of his successors in office; nor that any plat thereof accompanied said field-notes ; nor that any official use was ever made of those notes by any officer of the Government, until Joseph 0. Brown was required to retrace the lines of the Carondelet commons in the year 1834, as hereinafter found. But it does appear that on the 23d of April, 1829, Charles Biddle, who had previously applied to William McCree, then surveyor-general for Illinois and Missouri, for a survey of a tract of land which said Biddle had located under a New Madrid certificate, intended, owing to doubts entertained by said McCree in relation thereto, to submit the matter to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, and, with a view thereto, requested said McCree'to inform him whether there were any documents officially known to him which showed that any claim for commons had ever been made by the people of Caroudelet; and, if so, whether any limits to their claims had ever been designated; and whether said McCree had any other official knowledge on the subject, except what was contained in the act of Congress passed the 13th of June, 1812. The said McCree, on the 25th \u25a0of April, 1829, answered the inquiries of said Biddle in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">\u201cIn reply to these inquiries, I have to state that the only information possessed by this office, and on file at the date of your letter, concerning the Carondelet commons, was the law of the 13th of June, 1812, which confirms them as claimed, and a statement in the \u2018Begister d\u2019Arpentage,\u2019 from which it appears that, by virtue of an order from the lieutenant-governor, a line had been run from the southwest corner of their lands 23 arpen ts 3\u00bf poles to the river Des Peres on course south 28\u00b0 west, parallel to the southeast boundary-line of the claim of Alvarez, and distant from it 24 feet. This line purports to be a boundary to grounds conceded to the inhabitants of Carondelet on the 7th of December, 1796, and is, therefore, an intimation, however indefinite, of their claim in common in lands beyond and south of their village and common-field lots.

Prior to the year 1826 there had never been any military or other post upon the land lying south of the river Des Peres, within said out-boundaries; nor does it appear that before the final decision of the Secretary of the Interior, in 1855, in regard to Brown\u2019s survey, as hereinafter set forth, there ever was any entry or notation of the survey of the Jefferson Barracks tract upon the books of the surveyor-geueral\u2019s office at Saint Louis, or upon the books of the General Land-Office, as a military reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">11.

On application to the surveyor-general at Saint Louis, I have been furnished with the accompanying papers, marked \u2018A, B, and 0,\u2019 which are no doubt correct representations. It seems to be the opinion of General Milburn, the surveyor-general, that the claims of the people of Carondelet are sustained by the acts of Congress of the 13th of June, 1812, and 27th of January, 1831, as expressed in his letter to me of the 1st instant, and which accompanies these papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">\u201cFor possession, we shall have to depend upon a cession of a part of the commons made by the authorities of Carondelet in 1826. The original grant of relinquishment is on file in the office of the Quartermaster-General, at Washington City, to which I beg leave to refer you as to our claim to the use of the grounds as long as the United States wants it for military purposes. The village, however, has been incorporated by an act of the legislature of this State since the grant was made by the authorities to the United States in 1826, and the corporate authorities now say that the authorities that acted in 1826 had no right to make the grant. Hence there is a probability of some difficulty arising as to the claim of the United States to the perpetual use of the ground under the grant made by the authorities in 1826. There will be no difficulty, however, I think, in obtaining a confirmation of the original grant by the present authorities, if the Quartermaster\u2019s Department here were authorized to act in the case; to the propriety of which I call your attention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">\u201cNotwithstanding the opinion of the surveyor-general as to the legality of the claims of the inhabitants of Carondelet to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>commons in question, it is the opinion of many legal gentlemen that their claims are not good, inasmuch as the requirements of the laws of Spain were not complied with by the inhabitants at the time their claims were first set up to the commons lying south of the river Des Peres. It seems that the surveys and returns required by the Spanish laws were not made and filed in the land-offices. I will endeavor to make myself better acquainted with the subject, and communicate further with you upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\">\u201cThe original grant begins on the Mississippi River and runs west with Julien\u2019s line to the Herculaneum road, thence south with that road as far as their claim extended, embracing all the ground between said road and the river. These boundaries include as much land as the Government wants for military purposes at this post, but the limits cannot be curtailed without great inconvenience to the public service, (See the map as to our present boundaries.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">.\u201c With great respect, sir, I have the honor to be your most obedient servant,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">\u201cH.

On the 24th of September, 1839, Commissioner Whit-comb communicated to William Milburn, surveyor-general for Illinois and Missouri, the substance of the said request of the Secretary of War and of the said opinion of Solicitor Burchard, and at the same time gave said Milburn the following instructions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">\u201c Concurring in the views of the solicitor', as stated, I request that you will make a thorough and careful examination into the whole matter, in order to determine the limits of the commons of Carondelet to which the villagers are legally entitled, and that you will cause a survey to be made accordingly; and that such lands as may not be found to be within the limits of the commons aforesaid, or covered by private claims, may be surveyed as public lands, and plats of the same duly returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\">\u201cYou are requested to make a detailed report of all your proceedings, accompanied by copies of all the papers or records that you may be able to find having a bearing on the claim in question, with a diagram exhibiting the limits of the commons according to the evidences of title.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\">19. In compliance with these instructions, Surveyor-General Milburn made an extended report to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, under date of April 15,1840, accompanied by a plat, marked \u201cX,\u201d a copy of which plat is subjoined to this finding of facts; and his conclusions, upon a review of the whole case, were stated as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">\u201c From the facts here presented and the inferences which I have drawn, you will see that my construction of the law is distinctly in favor of the village to the extent of 150 arpents, from the southwest corner of the field-lands, and, were there no controlling circumstances, I would not hesitate to run the west boundary, as represented by the black dotted line <em>c d </em>on the plat X, (see copy of this plat hereto attached,) which is 150 ar-pents, parallel to the general course of the Mississippi; but when I take into consideration the operation of Soulard, in run<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ning the line <em>o e </em>north of the river Des Pbres, and the Spanish Calls for the limits and common of Carondelet, in the claims of Alvarez and Yalle, I am led to believe that it was the intention of the Spanish government to prolong the line c e to a, which is about parallel to the river for some distance; and that, as the act of Congress had in view the carrying out and fulfilling this intention of the Spanish government, as claimed before the board, it ought now to be adhered to, by adopting the line <em>o a.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">\u201cAs no great injury can result from a short delay, I have thought best to submit this statement and the accompanying \u25a0documents before ordering a survey, inasmuch as there seems to be a contrariety of opinion, and you have the controlling power in case of disagreement, and can understand the subject as well in its present condition as if a new survey was actually made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">20. Said Milburn\u2019s report was referred to Solicitor McRob-erts, of the General Land-Office, who, on the 22d of October, 1840, in a communication to Commissioner Whitcomb, submitted the result of his examination thereof, in which he reviewed the whole subject, and expressed his conclusions in the following terms:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">\u201c From a full examination of the subject, I have come to the conclusion that the lands included in the survey (Brown\u2019s) of the commons were not granted by the Spanish government to the inhabitants of Carondelet for the purpose contemplated, nor for any other purpose, and that the indorsement of Lieutenant-Governor Trudeau upon Gamache\u2019s petition was not a grant of the land, and can only be treated as an intention to reserve apart of the lands south of the river; in his own words, \u2018to furnish wood necessary to the village of Carondelet,\u2019 and that the fee-simple of the soil did not and was not intended to pass out of the Spanish Crown ; and that the title to the land was in the Crown at the date of the cession, aud as such passed to the United States. 2d. That the act of Congress of June 13, 1812, did not confirm the land as surveyed by Mr. Rector, nor was it effected by the act of 27th January, 1831. I, however, believe that, in good faith to the citizens of Carondelet, and in fulfillment of what they were led to believe was the intention of the lieutenant-governor to do iu the premises, Congress will make a grant of some portion of the lands for the purpose contemplated. I therefore advise that the tract of land beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>on the Mississippi Eiver at the figure 6, laid down ou plat X, and near the northeast corner of Martigny\u2019s survey, thence with the black dotted line to d; thence with the said line to the river Des Peres, and up the river to the line of Alvarez\u2019s survey, and across the river to e, and said letter <em>e </em>to <em>e, </em>and on to the river with the present survey, be reserved for the future action of Congress.

Within this tract is also situated the Jefferson Barracks, in Missouri.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">\u201c By making this reserve Congress can grant the 6,000 ar-pents, which is all the inhabitants claimed, which is 5,104.20 acres, excluding all private claims, to the village of Oarondelet for a common, or in such manner as may be deemed proper, and can retain of the public lands 1,702 acres as a site for Jefferson Barracks, or for any disposition as may be judged expedient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">\u201cI further advise that the balance of the unappropriated lands without those limits and included in Eector\u2019s and Brown\u2019s surveys, and which amounts to several thousand acres, be surveyed and sold as public land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">21. On the 11th day of November, 1840, the Acting Commissioner of the General Land-Office communicated this decision of the solicitor to the Secretary of War, who, on the 16th of that month, transmitted it to the commanding officer at Jefferson Barracks, with instructions to cause 1,702 acres to be laid off as a site for the barracks and for military purposes connected therewith, and a plat thereof to be made and returned to the War Department as early as practicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">22.

The lands within Rector\u2019s and Brown\u2019s survey are not subject to pre-emption or ordinary entries, as supposed by Mr. Hockaday, they having been reserved to satisfy this claim of the town of Carondelet. This office was not disposed to trouble Congress with the matter, supposing that it would be brought before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>that body by the parties <em>interested; </em>but, as Mr. Hockaday has requested prompt action, I would recommend, in view of all the facts, that the claim of the town of Carondelet to the whole common, as surveyed by Joseph 0.

The answer of Lieutenant-Governor Trudeau is, at the most, merely evidence of an intention or purpose to make a grant, but certainly does not of itself constitute a grant. A proprietor \u25a0may very properly assign, as a reason for not making a particular concession, his purpose to dispose of the property in another way, but the expression of such purpose vests no right or title, legal or equitable, in the party in whose favor this intention has been expressed. The only source from which the village of Carondelet can derive a title in this case is the confirmatory action of Congress. That action was founded on and limited by the claim set up by Carondelet. The confirmation was not intended to extend, and did not extend, beyond the claim asserted, and that claim was for 6,000 arpents, extending in a direction described in the claim as filed. It was not a claim by metes and bounds for an estimated quantity of land, for if it had been, then the boundaries and not the quantity would have governed; but it was a claim for a specified quantity of 6,000 arpents, without regard to the boundaries except on the side next the village, and extending from the boundary of the village as far as might be necessary to embrace the quantity of 6,000 arpents claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">\u201cThis was the claim which was confirmed, and, in my judgment, the village can claim no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\"><em>\u201c </em>If, therefore, that quantity can be had without interfering with the rights of others which had vested prior to the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>confirmation, the village of Carondelet is entitled to have it Md off. \u25a0 *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-4\">\u201cThe Land-Office will cause the necessary orders to be made to give effect to this decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">\u201cA.

In 1839, and again in 1845, the authorities of the town of Carondelet caused the commons south of the river Des Peres, which did not confiietwith the Jefferson Barracks tract or with confirmed private claims, to be laid off in small tracts and leased; and the leases contained a clause that the town would not be responsible in case of a failure of title, and a large number of persons became lessees of said tracts; and the action of the General Land-Office in regard to Brown\u2019s survey caused a doubt in relation to the title of the lands so leased, greatly disturbing the lessees. In 1854 an attorney of one of the lessees was active in urging upon the mayor and members of the city council, of Carondelet that they should cede the Jefferson Barracks tract to the United States; and he represented to them that that was the only condition on which the confirmation of Brown\u2019s survey could be obtained; that that survey had been set aside in 1841, or thereabouts; that without a re-establishment of it, Carondelet could not make out her title' to the common; that, even since that survey had been set aside, Carondelet had been in litigation with trespassers on the common; that Carondelet could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>never get a survey so long as the War Department opposed it, which it would do until Carondelet gave up the barracks tract, but that as soon as Carondelet gave that up, and the Secretary of War was satisfied, the Secretary of the Interior was ready to give a survey. The said attorney had been to Washington City several times to obtain a confirmation of said survey, and he represented to said mayor and members of the city council that he had talked with the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Interior, and knew their views perfectly; and that the former wanted the barracks tract for the War Department, and he would not let the latter approve the survey of the common until that tract was given up to the United States. In consequence \u2022of these representations \u2014 none of which appear to have been made by the authority or with the knowledge of any officer of the Government of the United States \u2014 the city council of Caron-delet passed the aforesaid ordinance of June 27, 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">No money was paid by the United States to the city of Caron-delet as a consideration for the execution of the aforesaid deed of October 25, 1854, nor was any asked or expected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">45. On \u25a0 the 26th of March, 1854, the Commissioner of the General Land-Office addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, asking what disposition should be made of the lands which might be detached by a new survey from Brown\u2019s survey of the Carondelet commons, and which are not included in any other claim; and on the 2d of April, 1854, the Commissioner submitted to the Secretary of the Interior the communication above referred to, dated March 23, 1853, from the surveyor-general at Saint Louis to the Commissioner, asking further instructions in relation to certain points, in order to enable him to carry out the decision of Secretary Stuart above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">46.

I have, therefore, carefully examined it as one of original jurisdiction, and after having given due weight and consideration to all the evidence submitted, and to the arguments presented both for and against the claim of the inhabitants of Carondelet and the action heretofore had by this Department, I am clearly of the opinion that undue importance has been given to the decision had by the supreme court of the State of Missouri in the case of <em>Dent </em>v. Bingham, on which the decision of my predecessor is based, especially as that decision was arrived at through a division of opinion on the part of the three judges sitting in the case; two of those judges having come to the same conclusion on different and opposite grounds, and the third not only dissenting from the opinions expressed by a majority of the court, but also from the decision there made by them; and more especially as the concurrence of Judge Tompkins, one of the two judges above alluded to, was based on an opinion previously given by him 4 that the acts of 1812 and 1831 availed the claimants of village-lots, out-lots, and commons nothing, unless they presented their claims before the recorder of land-titles,\u2019 which view has been subsequently overruled by the same court, and also by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <em>Quitar\u00e1 </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>(16 How., pp. 494 to 513.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-4\">44 Congress, by the act of June 13,1812, confirmed the right, title, and interest of the inhabitants of Carondelet to a common, and designated the principal deputy surveyor as the person who should determine by a survey the extent of that common, and this survey was made in 1816 or 1817, by the proper officer. On the 26th May, 1824, Congress passed another act requiring, among other things, that the surveyor-general should survey and designate the commons belonging to the several villages according to their respective claims and confirmations under the act of 1812, where the same had not already been done. Carondelet commons was \u2018already\u2019 surveyed, and was not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>therefore, affected by the act of 1824. Ou the 27th Jauuary, 1831, Congress relinquished to the inhabitants of the several towns or villages all the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the commons as confirmed to them by the act of 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\">\u201cAs Rector\u2019s survey of 1816 or 1817 was made prior to the survey of the surrounding public lands, it was necessary, under the act of 1831, to connect it with such surrounding lands; and E. T. Langham, the then surveyor-general, by virtue of authority duly vested in him, instructed the deputy surveyor, Joseph 0. Brown, to retrace Rector\u2019s lines of the Oarondelet survey and to connect it with the adjoining surveys by establishing the proper corners at the intersection of the lines thereof. Brown in 1834, under these instructions, retraced the Rector lines, and states in his returns to the surveyor-general that Rector\u2019s corners and his western and southern boundaries were easily found and identified by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">\u201c Under this state of facts the question to be determined appears to me to be, does the act of 1812, the operations had under that act, and the subsequent acts of 1824 and 1831, of themselves constitute a title in Oarondelet to the whole extent of the survey made by Rector in 1816 or 1817, and retraced by -, <em>18341</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">\u201c The Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Strother </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>says: <em>\u2018 </em>A confirmation of a title by act of Congress not only renders it a legal title, but furnishes higher evidence of that fact than any patent, inasmuch as it is a direct grant of the fee by the Government itself, whereas a patent is only the act of its ministerial officers.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">\u201c And in the case of <em>Maehay </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>the same court says: <em>1 </em>The act of Congress of 1812, confirming the claim to commons adjoining and belonging to the town of Saint Louis, did not define the extent and boundaries of these claims, nor adopt the evidence laid before the board of commissioners for that purpose ; the boundaries of the claims thus confirmed were designedly left open to the settlement of the respective claimants by litigation in the courts of justice or otherwise.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">\u201c The act of 1831 was passed with a full knowledge by Congress of all that had been previously done in the case, to wit, the survey of Rector and the reservation of the Jefferson Barracks tract.

The quantity of land embraced within the out-boundary lines of Brown\u2019s survey, as finally approved, was 9,905.29 acres; and, after deducting from that quantity the Jefferson Barracks tract and all private confirmed claims, there remained at Ca-rondelet, as commons, about 6,050 acres, which is nearly 1,000 acres more than was originally claimed in 1808 by the inhabitants of Carondelet, namely, 6,000 arpents, equal to 5,104.20 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">Upon the foregoing facts the conclusions of law are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">1. That the Commissioner of the General Land-Office and the Secretary of the Interior had lawful power to set aside, in part or in whole, Brown\u2019s survey of the Carondelet commons, and did set it aside as to the Jefferson Barracks tract, which they adjudged to belong to the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-11\">2. The deed made by the corporate authorities of Carondelet, to the United States was made with the full knowledge of all the facts of the case and of the previous decisions of the courts as to Oarondelet\u2019s title, and for an advantage to Carondelet, under the existing circumstances, in the settlement of a doubtful title, which constituted a valuable consideration for said deed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Mr. <em>Montgomery Blair </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-5\">I. The first conclusion of law found by the Court of Claims involves three questions: 1. Whether the Land Department had power to set aside the survey ? 2. Whether it did set it aside? 3. Whether it had power \u201c to adjudge the Jefferson Barracks tract to the United States?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-6\">In the discussion of the first question, the Court of Claims considers the survey of Elias Bector, made in 1816 or in 1817, and concludes that it ought to be disregarded because Surveyor-General McOree discusses the location of the commons in a letter dated 21st April, 1829, without referring to this survey, and because it was not shown that William Bector, who was surveyor-general when the survey was made, or any of his successors, had approved it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\">The letter of Surveyor-General McOree, to which the court refers, shows only that, in a personal interview with Messrs. Biddle and Ashley, he had refused to locate a New Madrid claim for them within the reputed limits of the Carondelet commons, and that the documents which he had subsequently received from the recorder of land-titles had confirmed him in the correctness of that decision. No inference can be drawn from this letter prejudicial to the Bector survey. While it may be inferred from it that he decided without examining the records of his own office, and for that reason did not know of the existence of Bector\u2019s survey, it shows clearly that in his judgment the records furnished by the recorder required the survey to be made as Bector had made it; that the commons were not limited to the quantity of 6,000 arpents, but were confirmed according to the metes and bounds indicated by the indorsement of Governor Trudeau upon Gam ache\u2019s petition, were bounded west by a line running parallel to the Mississippi Biver and extending 150 arpents from the point on the river Des Peres which Soulard had reached in the process of making the survey under the Spauish grant. A survey made in accordance with this decision of McOree could not have varied essentially from Bector\u2019s. Indeed, all uncertainty in the grant indicated by Trudeau is removed by the beginning of the survey made by Soulard, which McOree and every surveyor-general since 1812 has adopted. That fixed the point on the river <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Des P\u00e9res from which the west line extended 150 arpents south and parallel to the Mississippi.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-5\">But the discussion of the question of how the survey ought to have been made, into which the Court of Claims enters so largely, can have no legitimate bearing on any question in this case. Since the cases of <em>West </em>v. <em>Ooehran, </em>(17 How., 403,) and <em>Willot </em>v. <em>Sandford, </em>(19 How., 79,) it has been well settled that that is not a judicial question. The only question here is, was Rector\u2019s survey withip the meaning of the act of 1812 ? \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\">It does not appear affirmatively that William Rector, the surveyor-general, approved the survey made by his deputy, Elias Rector. But it is well established that the present usage of the surveyor-general to indorse his approval formally on surveys was not then nor for many years afterward, in force <em>\\ </em>and in the absence of such usage such indorsement would not be required, for the law does not ordinarily require express approval of the act of a deputy to make it valid. Such approval is implied unless the contrary appears. And accordingly, by the thirteenth finding.of the court, it appears that on the 10th of July, 1834, the surveyor-general, Langham, directed his deputy, Brown, to retrace Rector\u2019s survey for the purpose of connecting it with the adjoining public and private surveys. This is conclusive evidence that the Rector survey was complete. An order by the surveyor-general to retrace a survey to connect it with the public and private surveys assumes the authenticity and completeness of the survey, and is record-evidence of the fact which the cases above cited hold to be conclusive on the judicial department of the Government. And it was accepted by the head of the Land Department. Under date of 23d February, 1855, the Secretary of the Interior says: \u201cTliis [the Rector] survey was made in 1816 or 1817, by the proper officer. When the act of 1824 was passed, Carondelet commons was \u2018 already\u2019 surveyed, and was not, therefore,, affected by the act of 1824. This court also passed on this precise point in the case of <em>Oarondelet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis, </em>(1. Black, 190.) \u201cIt is objected,\u201d says the court, \u201c that the field-notes of Rector\u2019s survey were not platted or recorded, and were found in an obscure box in the surveyor-general\u2019s office, and that in fact there never was an approved survey. William Melburn, who was a clerk in the office as early as 1817, and had been surveyor-general, proves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>this objection groundless. * * It was established, as matter of fact and of law, that the survey had been made and the field-notes duly returned, and that Brown re marked the lines in 1834. It also appeared, as matter of fact and of law, from the records of the General Land-Office, by the decisions of the officers there, that the department administering the public lands had settled the question in regard to the regularity of Rector\u2019s survey, its due return, and approval.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\">This-survey is also affirmed in <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Dmmeger, </em>(14 Wall., 313,) where this court holds, citing <em>Menard </em>v. Massey, (5 How., 313,) that \u201c a survey made under the direction of the proper officer designated to have it made, and approved by him, was final and conclusive, unless an appeal was taken to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office.\u201d There being no such appeal here, the court adds: \u201c The survey made by Rector in 1817, retraced by Brown, and approved by the surveyor-general in 1834, is binding on the village, and estops her from claiming any land beyond the town thus established. <em>[Oarondelet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis, </em>1 Black, 179.) And those lines must necessarily be of equal validity as regards those claiming against her.\u201d And the reason given for this in <em>Menard </em>v. <em>Massey </em>is \u201c that the claimant and the United States were parties to the selection of the land; for, as they agreed to the survey, (unless it was appealed from,) they are mutually bound and estopped by it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\">The regularity of Rector\u2019s survey, as matter of fact and of law, having been settled by this court and by the decisions of' the Department administering the public lands, which this court held to be final, and also declared to be \u201c the completion of the title,\u201d it certainly could not be lawful for the Commissioner of the General Land-Office to set that survey aside in 1841, or afterward, more than twenty-four years after it was made, especially when by another act, that of 1831, (4 Stats., p. 435,) passed, as the Secretary of the Interior says, \u201c with a full knowledge of all that had been done,\u201d Congress had vested the inhabitants of Oarondelet \u201cwith full property\u201d in the commons, which their own officer had then ascertained by a regul r survey duly returned in accordance with law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\">Nothing is better settled, therefore, by the decis\u2019 ns court, and of the Land Department itself, than that missioner of the General Land-Office and the \u201c''\"retar,, \u201e\u201e one Interior had not the power to set aside Rector\u2019s survey and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Brown\u2019s re-marking of it; and, hence, it was not set aside in law. And the idea that the Commissioner and Secretary of the Interior \u201c did undertake to set it (the survey) aside\u201d in fact, is a total misconception of the proceedings of those officers. \u2022 The Secretary disclaims all power in his Department to set the survey aside, and an examination of his opinion will show that he did not intend to do so in fact. He undertakes only, as the Court of Claims says, \u201c to adjudge the barracks tract to belong to the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">Having decided that \u201c the survey of 1816 or 1817, as retraced by Joseph C. Brown, in 1834, should be sustained,\u201d he adds the words \u201cexcluding, of course, the 1,702 acres heretofore set apart and reserved for the military post at Jefferson Barracks, and that the parties claiming adversely to Carondelet should not be hindered thereby from establishing their rights before the judicial tribunals of the country.\u201d By this language it was not meant that the 1,702 acres shall be excluded from within the <em>limits </em>of the survey. This was a physical impossibility, as these limits extended beyond the tract on all sides. But the intention is that while the survey of the commons, which inclosed the tract in question on all sides, shall remain in all respects undisturbed, that, nevertheless, it shall be excluded from the legal operation of the survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\">The decision of the Secretary is, therefore, that the act of 1812, the operations under that act, and the subsequent acts of 1824 and 1831 vested the inhabitants with full property in the commons to the whole extent of the survey, except as to the barracks tract, which the Secretary says was then reserved, not expressly, but by implication, from the grant by the act. It is not, therefore, in virtue of any power in his office to make the reservation that he undertakes to exclude it from the operation of the survey, but he adjudges that the reservation had already been made by operation of law, and he cites the case of <em>Mitchell etal. </em>v. <em>The United, States, </em>(15 Peters, 52,) as authority for this decision. Having expressly decided that the survey was beyond his control, and must stand, but that the law which had affirmed it had at the same time excluded from it the military reservation, his decision is that the survey of 1816, as retraced, should be sustained; excluding, of course, the military reservation which the law itself excepted from its operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\">And, accordingly, in executing the order, the surveyor-gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>eral makes no new survey for the commons, excluding the barracks tract, but returns the old one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">But the <em>Act 13th June, </em>1812, (2 Stats., p. 748,) which made it the duty of the surveyor-general \u201cto survey, or cause to be surveyed aud marked, the out-boundary lines of the said several towns or villages, so as to include the out-lots, common-field lots, and commons thereto belonging,\u201d under which this survey was made, did not authorize the surveyor-general,' or any supervising executive officer, to \u201cadjudge\u201d the question of title to any tract of land lying within the out-boundaries which he was required by the act to survey and mark. He had the same right to \u201cadjudge\u201d between Carondelet and the (other) parties claiming (land within the survey) adversely to Caron-delet, which he refers to the courts, as he had to \u201cadjudge\u201d between Carondelet and the United States with respect to the barracks tract, which also lay within these out-boundaries. His authority extended only to the ascertainment of the out-boundaries of the lauds designated in the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-6\">Moreover, the history of the case shows that this was a false pretense, not thought of when the controversy was commenced, and admitted to be a sham when finally adopted by the other steps which were then taken to secure the title from the recognized owner. The Secretary of War began the contest by informing the Land Department that the land claimed as commons south of the river Des Peres was public land, and by requesting him to have it all surveyed and sold as such, except what would be hereafter designated for a military reservation. He admitted that there was no such military reservation as the Land Department afterward invented, and this fact is also stated in the tenth finding, with the addition that there was no military post there till the United States troops entered under Oaronde-let in 1826, and no attempt to make a military reservation there at all till after this decision of the Secretary of the Interior in 1855. There was not only no military post at Jefferson Barracks prior to the grant of commons to Carondelet by the Spanish government, such as there was at Fort Saint Mark\u2019s, the existence of which the court held, in confirming the grant in the ease of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>(7 and 15 Peters,) authorized the court to reserve lands within 1,500 varas from the walls of the fort for military purposes, but if there had ever been a military post on the land, it belonged to the confirming power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>(exercised by the court with respect to Fort Saint Mark\u2019s) and not to the surveyor to make the reservation. Hence the Secretary of War only insisted that the land was public land, and that it might be surveyed as such with a view to the -making of such a reservation at a future time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\">But the record shows that the Secretary who adjudged this reservation to have been made by operation of law had no faith in it himself, for before making it he had taken most extraordinary means to procure an absolute deed from Carondelet, and had sent it to the Secretary of War, saying: \u201cAs your decision as to the sufficiency of this deed for the full protection of the interests of the War Department in the tract in question may have a bearing on a case before this Department, I have most respectfully to request that I may be advised of the result of your deliberations.\u201d Here is a declaration that he would await the decision of the Secretary of War upon \u201cthe sufficiency of this deed for the full protection of the interests of the War Department in the tract in question,\u201d and in effect an avowal that he looked to the deed for the full protection of the Government in the tract in question, and it was not until it was decided that the deed was sufficient in itself for the full protection of the Government in the tract by the Secretary of War and by the Attorney-General that he decided the case before him. Nothing was said in communicating the deed to the Secretary of War or to the Attorney-General about any implied reservation of the tract from the grant to Carondelet. The Attorney-General certifies to the sufficiency of the deed, and thus recognizes the title to be in Carondelet alone, and the whole transaction demonstrates that all of these officers relied upon the deed alone for the title to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-6\">This brings us to the consideration of the second finding of law by the Court of Claims. It concedes that the only consideration for the deed was \u201c the settlement of a doubtful title,\u201d and holds that an agreement between Carondelet and a public officer that the decision which had rendered doubtful the title to the commons generally should be revoked by him was a legal consideration for a conveyance to the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-7\">The fifteenth finding states that \u201c up to the year 1839 no controversy arose in regard to Brown\u2019s survey, but the same was generally regarded as final, and the town of Carondelet laid out and leased lands confirmed within it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>To obtain title to the barracks tract, the Secretary of War, in June, 1839, requested the Commissioner of the General Land-Office to declare all the commons south of the village to be public land. When this was done, and <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 when the action of the Commissioner became known,\u201d says the court, \u201cbut more especially after the decision of the supreme court of Missouri, in 1844, in <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Bingham, </em>(8 Mo., 579) adverse to the title of Carondelet as defined and limited by Brown\u2019s survey, the lessees were greatly disturbed, and without doubt endeavored to influence the authorities of Carondelet to take some action which would settle the dispute about the survey favorably to the title; \u201d and the court then proceeds to state the several offers of Carondelet to procure the re-affirmance of the survey in the years 1851, 1852, and 1854, first, of a deed for the land, with a reversionary clause when the Government ceased to use it for military purposes j and, when that offer failed to effect the settlement, of the deed in fee, which was accepted, and which the court finds was made upon the representations of the agent of Oaron-deletin Washington to the authorities of Carondelet; \u201cthat he had talked with the Secretary of War and with the Secretary of the Interior, and that the former wanted the barracks tract, and he would not let the latter approve the survey of the commons until that tract was given up to the United States.\u201d The finding adds that these representations do not \u201cappear to have been made by the authority or with the knowledge of any officer of the Government of the United States.\u201d But this is not material. The finding of law under consideration, in assuming that the deed was the result of that negotiation, and that its consideration was the settlement of the title of Carondelet to the remaining land of the commons affected by the decision of the Secretary of the Interior on the 23d February, 1855, concedes that these representations were true in substance and effect, and were verified by the result.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-4\">To maintain the power of the Commissioner, the court cites the case of <em>Castro y.llen\u00e1rteles, </em>(23 How., 438,) declaring that the Commissioner \u201c exercised a supervision and control over subordinate officers charged with making surveys.\u201d This is not denied. But is this supervision wholly unregulated <em>% </em>Is there no limit in time or condition upon its exercise? so that a Commissioner can in 1841 abrogate a survey made in 1816, retraced and connected with subsequent adjoining surveys in 1834, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>lands subdivded, leased, &amp;c., and no appeal taken, which of itself, speaking of this survey, in 14 Wall., at p. 313, this court said, made it <em>u final and </em>conclusive.\u201d It was <em>the survey </em>which this court, in 1 Black, <em>(Garondelet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis,) </em>p. 189, held \u201c was the completion of the title,\u201d and which, with the law, the court declared in <em>Les Bois </em>v. <em>Brammell </em>(4 H., p. 464,) <em>\u201c </em>made and located the (commons) title as effectually as a patent would have doneand <em>Chouteau </em>v. <em>Bclchart </em>(2 How., p. 344) is to the same effect. Even where a patent was required to complete the title, the court held, in the case of <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Sawes </em>(2 Black, 557) that the Commissioner could not, in an <em>ex-parte </em>proceeding, set aside a survey so as to affect the incipient title. By a recent decision of the circuit court of the United States for the district of California, decided in the case of <em>Theodore Leroy </em>v. <em>Tolias Jameson and others, </em>Mr. Justice Field presiding, it is held that a title, when completed by patent, is beyond the Commissioner\u2019s power the moment the patent is recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-5\">If the Land-Office had power to set aside the survey, its restoration was not a valid consideration for the deed, because, 1st. The Secretary shows that this restoration was due to Car-ondelet as of right, and his decision proceeds on that ground only; and, 2d. No law authorized the Secretary to restore the survey in consideration of the deed, or upon any other terms of compromise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-6\">In the case of <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>(14 How., 377,) the court held such a settlement by executive officers to be void, saying: \u201c The officers of the Government are the agents of the law. They cannot act beyond its provisions nor make compromises not sanctioned by it.\u201d And this language is quoted and approved in <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Haioes, </em>(2 Black, 558.) But while the Secretary was prohibited by law from making his decision in consideration of the deed of Garondelet, and did in fact make his decision, when it was made, on the legal and proper grounds stated in the decision itself, the evidence shows that he obtained the deed by withholding this decison until the deed had been delivered, and referred to the Secretary of War for his decision upon \u201c its sufficiency for the full protection of the interests of the War Department in the tract in question,\u201d with the avowal that he would await that decision, because it may have a bearing upon his own decision respecting the survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-7\">The Court of Claims upholds this deed only upon the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that the consideration of it was \u201c the settlement of a doubtful title.\u201d It is not pretended that there was any other consideration, or that the deed is valid if the circumstances of the case do not-show it to have been made for the consideration of \u201cthe settlement of a doubtful title; \u201d in other words, a legitimate compromise between conflicting claimants. But \u201c an agreement made on the footing of a compromise of a right as doubtful cannot be supported in favor of the party who knew at the time that it had no existence.\u201d (3 Leading Cases in Eq., 410.) Now, by the findings of fact, it appears the Secretary of the Interior knew and declared at the time the deed was given that Oarondelet\u2019s title to the commons was not a doubtful title. His opinion is explicit. Nor had Carondelet had any doubt about her title. From first to last she maintained that her title was a complete legal title. The transaction was, then, in no sense \u201c the settlement of a doubtful title.\u201d This language applies only when both parties are in doubt, and when there is room for doubt by reason of 'the decision being in the power of some umpire between them, and certainly not when both agree that the title belongs exclusively to one party, while the power to decide rests exclusively with the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-4\">The language and reasoning of the court apply only to parties having an umpire over them in the courts. The books abound in decisions showing;that compromises can take place between private individuals only when the parties are on equal terms. See Adams\u2019s Eq., 183; 2 Kent, 483; note \u201c d\u201d <em>ib., </em>p. 246, as to advantages secured through contracts by persons holding fiduciary relations; also 1 Parsons\u2019s Contracts, 5th ed., p. 86; 2 Bob.

The devisees were not culpable. They had no fraudulent intent or personal interest, but the parties were not on equal terms, the necessities of the heir at law being great, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-6\">Both of the law propositions of the Court of Claims depend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>upon tbe legal power of the Laud Departmeut to set aside the survey. Iu the first, it is only by virtue of this power that the legality of the reservation is claimed at all. And it is equally necessary to the second, for the only consideration claimed for the deed which that proposition upholds is the revocation of the order to set aside the survey. If that was an illegal order, i.ts revocation could not form a valid consideration for a conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-4\">Low, the question as to the power of the Department to set aside the survey is not an open question. The case of <em>Caron-delet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis, </em>a case which has since been repeatedly affirmed by this court, turned upon this precise question, and the court then held \u201c that Lector\u2019s survey and Brown\u2019s re-marking of it concluded the Government, and bound the corporation of Carondelet to the whole extent of the surveyand the reason why the court held both parties to .be bound is that <em>u </em>it was established as matter of fact that the survey had been made and the field-notes duly returned, and that Brown re-marked the lines in 1834. It also appeared as matter of fact and of law, from the records of the General Land-Office, by the decisions of the officers there, that the department administering the public lands had settled the regularity of Lector\u2019s survey, its due return, and approval. And the jury having found that the corporation of Carondelet had in various modes recognized, accepted, and held under Lector\u2019s survey, as identified by Brown in 1834, we are of the opinion that the State court properly rejected the claim.\u201d (1 Black, p. 191.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-5\">This decision is affirmed in the case of <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Dmmeger, </em>(14 Wall., 308.) The question there is exactly the same now presented, viz: whether the survey was ever set aside, and the evidence to prove it is the same presented here, viz: the documents relating to the surveys of Lector and Brown. Dent claimed under a confirmation of 1836, and, in order to get rid of the commons title, offered these documents to show that the survey had been s\u00e9t asid\u00e9. The circuit court excluded the documents, and this court affirmed that decision, saying, \u201c as the right of the village, according to the judgment of this court in <em>Carondelet </em>v. <em>Saint </em>Louis, had been fixed by the survey of Brown in 1834, which was conclusive as regards all adverse individual claims, the testimony was clearly irrelevant and incompetent, and was properly rejected. The acts of 1812 and 1836 were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>applicable to the United States, and did not affect their rights.\u201d The court here applies the estoppel declared in <em>Garondelet </em>y. <em>Saint Louis </em>to adverse individual claims only, and adds that the acts of 1812 aud 1836 were inapplicable to the United States. But there was no question before the court calling for this distinction, and it is not sustained by the case cited, for there it is expressly declared that the Government was itself bound by the survey, and it is inconsistent with a previous part of the decision in 14 Wall., which quotes <em>Menard </em>v. Massey, (8 How., 313,) establishing the conclusiveness of this survey against the Government. The same principle is also asserted in <em>Guitard </em>v. Stoddard, (16 How., 512.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">In the case of <em>Oarondelet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis, </em>Oarondelet lost a large tract of land, now within the city of Saint Louis, of as great value, probably, as the tract here in question, although the proof showed conclusively that it ought to have been embraced in the survey, because the court held that the acceptance of the survey had concluded both the Government and Oarondelet. Besides that the decision expressly holds the Government to be concluded equally with Oarondelet, it is manifest it could not conclude Oarondelet unless it also concluded the Government, the other party to the survey. And the conclusiveness of the survey was the point, and the only point, ruled in the case. And its conclusiveness upon both parties was fixed by the acceptance of the survey by Oarondelet by acts antecedent to 1839, and, therefore, before the proceeding in the Land-Office in 1841, taken at the request of Poinsett, and under which alone title is claimed here for the Government. Hence there is no escape from the reversal of the decision of the Court of Claims in this case, except by the reversal of the case of <em>Garondelet </em>v. <em>Saint </em>Louis, and the series of decisions by this court which that case has governed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-6\">Summary. \u2014 (1.) The survey of the commons of Oarondelet by Beetor in 1816 or in 1817, as retraced by Brown in 1834, was the completion of the title and gave Oarondelet an indefeasible estate therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-7\">(2.) The order of the Secretary of the Interior, of 1855, <em>\u201cadjudging\u201d </em>1,702 acres of said commons to belong to the United States as a military reservation, was illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-8\">(3.) The order of Commissioner Whitcomb, of 1841, directing the surveyor-general to reserve 7,700 acres of said commons to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>enable Congress to satisfy the <em>equitable </em>claim of Carondelet for commons, and to enable him to set off 1,700 acres for a military reservation, and to sectionize the balance for sale as public land, was illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-4\">(4.) The revocation of said order, and thereby settling the disturbance it had caused to the title of the commons, did not constitute a valid or sufficient consideration for the deed given by Carondelet in 1854 to procure said revocation, and said deed ought to be declared inoperative and void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-5\"><em>Mr. Solicitor- General Phillips </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-6\">Looking at the case in the light of justice alone, divested of all technicalities, it appears that the parties who are urging this claim have already received about 1,000 acres more than they were originally entitled to, <em>i. e., </em>1,000 acres more than the United States were under any obligation of justice to convey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"224\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-7\">Upon the other hand, if technicalities may be resorted to, it appears that, as their title to the tract, the United States have a valid deed in fee-simple, executed by the claimants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-8\">In regard to the consideration of the deed, nothing appears to countervail a suggestion that the city of Carondelet, finding, in 1854, that by the survey of 1834 it had acquired a technical interest in some 2,700 acres of land more than it had just claim to, considered it prudent to silence all question as to such rights, as well as to its title to commons at all, by dividing such surplus with the United States, (the questioner,) surrendering to the latter all right to dispute the deed of 1826, and releasing, also, the very contingent reversion therein reserved, in consideration of an acknowledgment of its right to commons, including 1,000 acres of surplus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-9\">In speaking of the quantity of land beyond what Carondelet had just claim to as being only 2,700 acres, I take into consideration the circumstance that, by adverse title in private persons, that city in the end lost about 2,100 acres of the 9,905-acre tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-10\">If the title of Carondelet to the surplus beyond 6,000 arpents were merely technical, depending upon the manner in which the words of a statute had operated upon the laches of certain subordinate officers of the United States, its action, in waiving the technicalities and discharging the United States from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>consequences of sucb laches, cannot be undone. There is no tribunal having power to set up technical defenses once abandoned, or to restore a condition of things in which the efforts of public justice to administer <em>cequum et bonum </em>are obstructed by positive provisions of law, or by ill-advised action or inaction of parties. It is a piece of elementary information that all the tendencies in the administration of law are to the contrary; <em>i. </em>e., to avoid the force of mere technicalities and other things obstructing natural justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-5\">Granting, then, that the effect of the act of 1812 upon the surveys of 1817 and 1834 was as claimed by the learned counsel for Saint Louis, and that it invested Garondelet with title to the 9,905 acres lying within those surveys, would a release by that village to the United States of the 4,800 acres therein, in excess of its just claim as defined byitself in 1808, have presented any feature to justify equity in decreeing the <em>cancellation </em>of that release, or to warrant the relessor in, claiming subsequently that the relessees should pay for the land so released? If, as seems plain, it would not, could any additional equity be imported into the case by showing that the relessor was in some degree quickened to make the conveyance by finding that certain high officials of the United States, when called upon, incidentally or otherwise, to recognize its title to the whole tract, refused to do so, and suggested that it was invalid, and sometimes even threatened to take steps to have it set aside ? If one has done an act (not merely void) which in conscience was proper to be done, will courts scrutinize the actual motives of the party in order to relieve him from its effects, or nicely inquire whether he did it upon collateral or less worthy considerations that turned out to be unfounded, or because of certain potent influences with which he thought it inconvenient to contend ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-6\">And in this connection, when duress is imputed because of relations occupied to a transaction, having the general features of this, by officials of theUnited States, may it not well be replied that the apprehension so excited comes strictly within that <em>suspicio cujuslibet vani et meticulosi hominis </em>to which the law pays no respect ? (Blackstone, 1,131.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-7\">Something more, however, may be suggested in reply to the clear and vigorous argument that has been submitted for the claimant, inasmuch as it does not seem necessary to admit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Carondelet bad a good title to tbe barracks tract at tbe time of tbe execution of tbe deed of 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-5\">In tbis connection, it should be remarked that tbe controversy which arose in 1839 before tbe Commissioner of tbe Land-Office, involving tbe survey of 1834, which, with varying fortunes, continued until 1855, ending in favor of Carondelet, was specifically as t\u00f3 tbe sale of- tbe lands within that survey not included in the barracks tract. It was tbe survey and sale as public lands of tbe land excluded from the barracks tract, or,\u2019 at least, of what was excluded from that tract and tbe 6,000 arpents originally claimed by Carondelet, that tbe Commissioner and Secretaries discussed and decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-6\">It may be that their action upon tbis point is of no importance ; but whether so or not, it is plain that those who favored tbe survey of 1834 gave their decisions expressly reserving the rights of tbe United States to tbe barracks tract. If those decisions are cited for the claimant, they must be cited <em>cum </em>onere, which amounts to tbis: that it was held, as against parties wishing to make entries upon the tract outside of the barracks, that tbe survey of 1834 was valid, saving always to the United States a title to so much as lay inside thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-7\">Laying aside these decisions, therefore, as without effect in favor of tbe claimant, tbe question comes up as to tbe condition of its title at tbe time (1839) when the controversy above mentioned arose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-8\">At that time its title to commons, &amp;c., rested upon tbe act of 1812, as carried into effect by the surveys of 1817 and 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-9\">I submit that the survey of 1834 was neither ordered nor made <em>cum animo probandi, </em>if I may use such an expression. Tbe surveyor at that time took up the old survey of 1816, with tbe purpose of connecting it with the surveys of the public lands, but did not intend or affect to pass upon the propriety of that transaction in connection with the act of 1812. The survey of 1834, therefore, lacks tbe necessary quality of an approval by tbe surveyor-general to give it effect under tbe act of 1S12. He neither approved nor disapproved of it. His mind was not upon that subject. His order to the deputy concerned tbe old lines of 1816 so far as they bore upon exterior tracts, not interior. He took for granted their operation upon what was within. If, however, any action upon bis part were necessary to give effect to that survey, it is submitted that the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>survey was not intended or then understood to give it; and, therefore, that to attribute such an effect is inadmissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-4\">The survey of 1817 is liable to a similar objection. It was never approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-5\">In <em>Garonclelet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis, </em>(1 Black, 179,) parol evidence of such approval seems to have been given, (p. 191.) There was no such fact established in the present case; and its establishment in a case heretofore reported can have no effect here. <em>(Maclcay </em>v. <em>Daston, </em>19 Wall., 619.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-7\">Therefore, although as to all the purposes which were important in <em>Carondelet </em>v. <em>Saint Louis, </em>and the subsequent case of <em>Dent </em>v. <em>JUmmeger, </em>(14 Wall., 308,) (cited and relied upon by the learned counsel for Saint Louis,) the action of the claimant and also of the United States is bound by those surveys, because of subsequent acquiescence by the United States; yet for matters to which that acquiescence did not apply, it is submitted that those cases are no authority. They rely upon the effect of all that was uniformly done and omitted by the United States from 1817 to 1854. There is no such uniformity as to the matter now in hand, or, if there be, none that favors the case of the claimant. The United States are bound by a long course of action to admit that there are no public lands subject to entry within the lines of 1817 and 1834. But as to a military reservation there, the question is, for all that appears in the cases cited, open.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-8\">The language of the deed of 1826 may also be cited to show that the inhabitants of Carondelet did not at that time rely upon the survey of 1817. What the United States then asked for, and what they gave, was a mere quitclaim to a tract described by bounds, and identified further only as u part of a large quantity which the said parties of the first part claim as common,\u201d &amp;c. Here is no reference to the survey of 1817, as would have been natural if it had been known to or relied upon by either party. It seems that, at this time, the higher officers of the United States did not know of the survey of 1817; and this <em>quasi </em>concealment of title by the claimant at a time when it was called upon to assert it is (under the later circumstances of the case) inconsistent with any title to the relief now demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-9\">When speaking of concealment I must be understood as dealing with a suggestion that the inhabitants of Carondelet have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>always, since 1817, relied upon the survey made in that year. If, however, in 1826 the existence of that survey was not known either to those inhabitants or to the United States, such circumstance seems not less significant as to its validity and authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-5\">It seems clear that the doubts as to its title, which were expressed by Carondelet, whether in making leases or in its later dealing with the United States, did not originate, as is suggested by the claimant, in the hostile dealing of Secretary Poinsett and his colleagues and successors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-6\">Upon the whole it is submitted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-7\">I. That in October, 1854, at the date of the deed by the claimant to the United States, the title of the former to the barracks tract (or the reversion therein) was not only honestly doubted by both parties to that deed, but, as matter of fact, was really doubtful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-8\">II. That there is nothing in the original relation between the claimant and the United States as to the land now known as the barracks tract, or in anything that has happened subsequently, to justify the former in claiming to be paid therefor.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b422-9\">Mr. Justice Miller</author>\n<p id=\"Ad8\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The subject of this controversy is the title to the land known as Jefferson Barracks, consisting of about seventeen hundred acres, five miles below the city of Saint Louis. It lies within the lines of a survey of the commons of Carondelet, containing a much larger quantity \u2014 nearly 10,000 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The present suit was instituted in the Court of Claims in 1859 by the city of Carondelet. As the jurisdiction of that court was doubted, Congress, by the act of 1873, (17 Stat., 621,) specially authorized it to entertain jurisdiction of the controversy. The city of Carondelet having become merged in the city of Saint Louis, by an act of the legislature of Missouri, the latter city was substituted as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">A deed conveying the land in controversy to the United States was made by the city of Carondelet on the 25th day of October, 1854, and it is not controverted that the authority under which this was done was sufficient. And if this deed be held to be otherwise valid, it decides the controversy in favor of the United States. Its validity is denied, however, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>tbe part of plaintiff, on the ground that it was without consideration, and that it was improperly coerced from the authorities of Carondelet by the officers of the Government who had charge of the department of public lands, by an unjust and illegal exercise of authority in refusing to confirm, and threatening to set aside, the survey which we have already mentioned, of the Carondelet commons, and exacting this deed as the condition of their acquiescence in that survey. On the other side, the deed is supported as a just and equitable compromise of a long-existing controversy, both as to the correctness of that survey and the right of the Government to the ground known as Jefferson Barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The origin of the claim of Carondelet was a concession of 6,000 arpents of land adjoining the village, made in 1796 by Zenon Trudeau, lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana. An attempt to give locality to this concession was made by Soulard, (who describes himself as a surveyor commissioned by the Government,) in December, 1797, but the first actual- survey was made in 1818, by Elias Eector, who was deputy under his father, William Eector, surveyor of public lands for the Territories of Illinois and Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The Court of Claims finds that, though the field-notes of this survey were filed in the surveyor\u2019s-office, it was never approved by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">But in the year 1834, Elias T. Langham, surveyor-general at Saint Louis, caused J. 0. Brown, one of his deputies, to retrace and re-establish the lines of Sector\u2019s survey, and when the result of the work was returned to his office he approved the survey, and the same was duly filed in the office of recorder of land-titles in Missouri, who thereupon certifies that the title was by him duly confirmed of the village to their claim as commons of 6,000 arpents of land, as shown by that survey. Six thousand arpents are equivalent to 5,104 acres. The survey contained 9,905 acres, and the Court of Claims find that after deducting from that quantity the Jefferson Barracks claim and all private claims, there still remained nearly 1,000 acres more than the 6,000 arpents. There is no evidence that this survey was ever brought to the attention of the Land Department in Washington until June, 1839.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In that year the surveyor-general at Saint Louis seems to have called the attention of the district attorney of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>for Missouri to the survey in connection with the location of Jefferson Barracks, and the letter having been transmitted to the Secretary of War, an investigation of the whole matter was instituted by the Commissioner of Public Lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">This resulted in an order made in 1841, by Commissioner Whitcomb to Surveyor-General Milburn, directing a new survey of these commons, on the principle of reserving 1,702 acres for military purposes at Jefferson Barracks, allowing 6,000 ar-pents to Oarondelet for her commons, and restoring the balance, not covered by private claims, to sale as public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">It may as well be here stated that this order was never carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the year 1826 the military authorities of the United States, desiring to establish at that point a military post, procured from twelve inhabitants of the village of Oarondelet a deed conveying to the United States a described portion of the land which they claimed as part of the commons of the village, with a reversion to the village whenever -the United States should cease to use it for military purposes. From that time the Government has been in continued possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">It appears, by the findings of the court, that certain persons who had purchased lots of the city of Oarondelet, not conflicting with the barracks claim, and other citizens of Oarondelet, becoming uneasy about the condition in which the title to all the commons was left by the order of Commissioner Whitcomb, employed agents to procure a confirmation of the Brown-Bector survey. They appeared at Washington and a negotiation, remonstrance, and correspondence was carried on for several years, and divers opinions and decisions were had from Commissioners of the Land Office and Secretaries of the Treasury and Interior, none of which confirmed the survey as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u25a0 Finally, without any suggestions shown to come from the United States or its officers, the parties interested in the settlement of the title of Carondelet to the remainder of the commons, and the authorities of that city, conceiving that, if the title of the United States to that reservation was made good, the main difficulty in the way of this settlement would be removed, the authorities of the city made the deed we have already mentioned of October, 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">And, accordingly, on the 8th of October, 1855, another survey on the basis of Brown\u2019s, but marking the barracks prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>erty as reserved, and giving its boundaries, was made and confirmed by the Commissioner of the Land-Office as the true survey of the Carondelet commons.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">It is obvious enough from this imperfect sketch of the history of the controversy that the deed of the city to the United States and the subsequent confirmation of the survey were the result of a compromise of a long-pending contest between the parties to it. No fraud is found or suggested. The action of the city of Carondelet cannot be impeached on the ground of duress within any legal or equitable definition of that term as applied to contracts. It was a suggestion originating with Carondelet, designed to secure action which she desired. The officers of the Land Department were doing nothing in the matter. The order for the new survey, made in 1841, had never been executed, and, in 1845, Commissioner Shields had declared that there was no intention to carry that order into effect until further action by Congress, and this was repeated by Commissioner Young, in 1846.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">If, as is now argued, Carondelet had a perfect title to the land in controversy, she had nothing to do but remain quiet or assert her title in the courts of law, which were open to her, for no officer of the Government, from 1841 to the date of this deed, a period of thirteen years, did anything to affect that title or to deprive her&gt; of her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">But the opinion of all the officers of the Land Department was againt the validity of that survey, and of course against her title to any commons at all as being perfect. The supreme court of the State of Missouri had so decided in 1844 in the case of <em>Dent </em>v. Bingham, (8 Mo. R., 579.) It was known that the survey included nearly twice as much land as was originally claimed under the grant of Trudeau.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The Land-Office, while it declined to exercise it, had asserted the right to set aside that survey and order another, and was apparently only awaiting some action of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">How can it be said under these circumstances, after a contest of thirteen years, that Carondelet, in proposing to release her claim to the 1,700 acres of the barracks reservation, in exchange for the quieting and perfecting of her title to the remainder of the commons, acted under duress 1 Or acted unwisely ? Or that the- compromise was as to her inequitable ?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">It is said to be inequitable because it is now the settled law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>that, under the act of 1812, confirming the titles of the villages to their common lands, the title became perfect on the completion of the survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">And we are not disposed to deny the doctrine, that when such a survey was made by the proper officers in 1839, and approved by the surveyor-general, such a survey constituted a title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">But this doctrine was not so completely and fully settled at the date of this compromise as to be free from doubt. And if it were, there still remained the question of the power of the Commissioner of the General Land-Office to set aside a survey so made and order another \u2014 a power which undoubtedly exists as to all surveys made for many years past, however it may have been in 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">But it is important to consider that the Land Department then asserted such a power, and no decision had then settled the law to the contrary. It was, therefore, a proper element of doubt in considering the question of a compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">If, however, the Commissioner had no such power, and conceding that the approval of that survey by the surveyor-general completed the legal title to the land it included, there can be no doubt of the right of the United States, treating the same as if it were a patent, to file a bill in chancery to set it aside as improvidently made, and on the trial of this issue, the excessive quantity of the survey, the .reservation and long possession of the.barracks, and perhaps other circumstances, would have made the result doubtful enough to justify the authorities of Carondelet in compromising the matter in advance of such a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In short, we are of opinion that the deed of Carondelet is valid, as based upon an equitable compromise of a long-pending and doubtful question of title, and that it excludes the plaintiff in this suit from any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The j udgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
