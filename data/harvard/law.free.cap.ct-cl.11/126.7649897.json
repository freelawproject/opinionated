On tlie 26th of October, 1863, a contract in writing was entered into between the claimant and its sureties, parties of the first part, and the Chief of the Bureau of Steam-Engineering, Navy Department, acting in the name of the Secretary of the Navy, for and in behalf of the United States, party of the second part, whereby the parties of the first part covenanted and agreed to build and erect, at their expense and risk, in a secure and finished state, fit in every respect for sea-service, in the United States steamer Pompanoosuc, at the Charlestown navy-yard, all the machinery necessary to the propulsion of the same by a pair of geared screw-engines of 100 inches diameter of cylinder and a stroke of piston of 4 feet, together with boilers, containing, in the aggregate, 1,128 square feet of grate-surface and 28,300 square feet of heating-surface, together with all appurtenances, coal-bunkers, instruments, tools, and spare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>pieces that might be required for proper working, according to the usages of the naval service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">II. On the 13th of November, 1863, a certain other contract in writing was entered into between the same parties, whereby the claimant and its sureties, parties of the first part, covenanted and agreed to build and erect, at their expense and risk, in a secure and finished state, fit in every respect for sea-service, in the United States steamer Illinois, all the machinery necessary to the propulsion of the same by a pair of back-acting engines of 60 inches diameter of cylinder and 3 feet stroke of piston, together with the boilers, containing 546 square feet of grate-surface and two superheating-apparatus, together with all appurtenances, coal-bunkers, instruments, tools, and spare pieces that might be required for proper working, according to the usages of the naval service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">III. Each of said contracts contained, among others, the following stipulations:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">\u201cThe said parties of the first part further agree that the Secretary of the Navy shall have the right to appoint a person to superintend the construction of the machinery, who shall have power to inspect it at all times, and to peremptorily reject, in any stage of its progress, any materials or articles, or any piece or part, which he may consider defective, either in quality of material or of workmanship, or in propriety of detail; and that they will provide the said person suitable and convenient office-room, and afford him satisfactory facilities for superintending the work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-8\">\u201cAnd the said parties of the first part do further agree that the said machinery, appurtenances, coal-bunkers, instruments, tools, and spare pieces, complete in all respects, and ready for continuous sea-service, shall be on board the vessel within twelve (12) months from the date of this contract, provided it be placed at their command within six (6) months from the date of this contract, unless prevented by the act of the Government, or by circumstances beyond the control of the parties of the first part; it being understood that by \u2018circumstances beyond the control of the parties of the first part,\u2019 is meant accidents by fire or water to the machinery on the premises of the parties of the first part, or while being erected in the vessel; but delays by persons furnishing the parties of the first part with stock or material, or caused by loss of castings or forgings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>condemned for any reason whatever, are not within the meaning of the phrase \u2018circumstances beyond the control of the parties of the first part.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-4\">\u201cAnd if the vessel be not placed at the command of the said parties of the first part within the six (6) months aforesaid from the date of this contract, they, the said parties of the first part, do further agree that, within six (6) months from the time that they shall be notified that the vessel is at their command, they will have completed the said machinery, appurtenances, coal-bunkers, and spare pieces, on board, in all respects ready for continuous sea-service, unless prevented by the act of the Government, or by circumstances beyond the control of the parties of the first part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">\u201cAnd it is further agreed and mutually understood that, in case the machinery shall not be completed ready for erection in the vessel at the expiration of the said six (6) months from date of contract, or shall not be fully completed iu the vessel ready for sea-service at the expiration of the said six (6) months after the said parties of the first part are notified that the vessel is at their command, the said party of the second part is authorized to take possession of said machinery, and complete it at the expense of the said parties of the first part.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">IV. The claimant proceeded to construct the engines, boilers, and appurtenances called for by said contracts, and continued therein until stopped by the order from the Navy Department hereinafter set forth under Finding VI. All the work done by the claimant in and about said construction was done under the supervision of an inspector appointed by the Navy Department, who made to the Department detailed reports of the progress of the work; at first semi-monthly, and afterward monthly, beginning on the 15th of June, 1864, and ending on the 1st of March, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">V. On the 30th of March, 1869, the Secretary of the Navy ordered a board, consisting of Capt. J. H. Strong and Chief Engineers B. F. Garvin and Edward Fithian, to examine and estimate upon the unfinished machinery under contract at the several engine establishments, with a view to obtain a release from the contracts, if, in the opinion of the board, such a release would be for the interest of the Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-8\">The board made a report on the 26th of Apiil, 1869, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cNavy-Yard, New York, <em>April </em>26,1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">\u201cSir: In obedience to the order of the honorable Secretary of the Navy of the 30th of March, to examine and estimate upon the unfinished steam-machinery and tools now being constructed at different establishments, with a view of obtaining a release from the contracts, if, in our opinion, such a release .would be for the interest of the Government, we have respectfully to report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">\u201cThe following is a list of the engines and the amounts due on contracts and reservations upon completion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-8\">Daniel McLeod, balance on reservation for one pair 60-inch by 36-inch engines. $30, 000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-10\">John Roach, balance on reservation for three pairs 60-inch by 36-incli engines. 90,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-12\">Corliss Steam-Engine Company\u2019s balance on contract for one pair 60-inch by 36-inch engines... 100, 000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-13\">Extra bills on same. ..- 11,549 15</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-14\">Corliss Steam-Engine Company\u2019s balance due on contract for one pair 100-iuch engines. 140, 000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-16\">Extra bills on same. 7, 068 25</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-17\">378,617 40</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-18\">\u201cIn addition to this amount, there should be added, to complete the contracts, for extra work, in addition to that already charged, which would have to be done on the 100-iuch engines in the course of erection, which, in proportion to those already finished, would amount to twenty-five thousand dollars, ($25,000;) also an extra allowance for transportation to the Corliss Steam-Engine Company of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for the 60-iuck by 30-inch engines, and thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) for the 100-inch engines; making a total of four hundred and forty-nine thousand and sixty-eight dollars and forty cents ($449,068.40) to complete the contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-19\">\u201c We estimate the cost to the contractors to complete the contracts to be the amount now due them, except upon the 60-inch by 36-inch engines at the Corliss Steam-Engine Company, which would cost about fifteen thousand dollars, ($15,000.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-20\">\u201c Should these contracts be completed as far as they can be, with a view to storing them in navy-yards, there would be a deduction on each of the 60-inch by 36-inch engines of about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>fifteen thousand dollars, ($15,000,) and upon the 100-inch engine of about fifty thousand dollars, ($50,000,) making a total reduction of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, ($125,000,) leaving a balance, after deducting the cost of extra work in \u25a0erecting the 100-ineh engine, of two hundred and ninety-nine thousand and sixty-eight dollars and forty cents ($299,068,40) to be paid by the Government for storing them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-3\">\u201c If the Department should decide to dispose of these engines in their present condition, we estimate as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">\u201cThe 60-iuch by 36-inch engines, taking their weight as old material, should bring about thirty-seven thousand dollars, ($37,000.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">\u201c We have received propositions from the different contractors, the best being from Mr. John Eoach, of the Morgan Iron-Works, in New York, who, being engaged in the marine-engine business, would be able at some future time to use some of the smaller detail parts, and he will allow forty thousand dollars ($40,000) for each of them, in addition to the balance due on reservation. We are of the opinion that forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000) could be obtained for each at the establishments in New York and Brooklyn, and for the one at the Corliss Steam-Engine Company\u2019s establishment, being farther away from the market, thirty-five thousand dollars, ($35,000.) In the same proportion by weight, the 100-inch engines should be valued at eighty-two thousand dollars, ($82,000,) making a total of two hundred and ninety-seven thousand dollars ($297,000) paid back to the Government. This, added to the outlay required to complete the engines for storing, amounts to five hundred and ninety-six thousand and sixty-eight dollars and forty cents, ($596,068.40.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">\u201cFrom this amount must be deducted the balance due the Corliss Steam-Engine Company on contract for the 60-inch by 36-inch engine, and the amount of extra bills now pending, less the deduction to be made in case the 60-inch by 36-inch engine should be stored, amounting to one hundred and four thousand and sixty-eight dollars and forty cents, ($104,068.40,) leaving a balance of four hundred and ninety-two thousand dollars ($492,000) retained by the Government by disposing of the engines in their present condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-7\">\u201c We have visited the establishments now having contracts for the building of tools, and respectfully state as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201c At the Providence Steam-Engine Company the tools are in various stages of progression.

The contractor states that the bolt and nut forging machines are patented articles,, and, as he has the right to use them only in navy-yards, they would be of no use to him except as old material, and makes the following off\u00e9r: He will allow for them $5,500, and deduct $8,000 for non-finishing for the machines having the drawings and some of the patterns made; he agrees to cancel the contract for 30 per cent, of the price named for them, making a deduction of $20,307.50. Notwithstanding the very small demand for this kind of tool of this size, and the difficulty in disposing, of them, even should the restrictions of the patent be removed,, we think a better settlement could be obtained upon the following basis, which we respectfully suggest:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-12\">\u201c That he be allowed a profit of 30 per cent, upon the whole contract, and the amount expended on the tools, for which latter amount he shall allow the Government a percentage agreed upon, and retain the tools.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-13\">\u201c Taking into consideration all the unfavorable circumstances, they should be worth 25 per cent, of tfie amount expended.

One lot, amounting to $69,931, are \u25a0finished ready for delivery. Another, amounting to $226,614.67, are more than half completed, there being made for them the \u2022drawings, patterns, and over eight hundred thousand pounds of iron and brass castings and wrought-iron forgings, and to complete them would cost about $72,000, and upon the remainder there have been expended $32,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">\u201c The whole contract amounts to $409,000, being about $24,000 more than is shown by schedule furnished by the Department. This increase is in consequence of alterations being made in size of some of the tools, after the coutract was made, by orders of the Bureau of Steam-Engineering, which was shown. A payment on account of $109,600 has been made. The contractor offers to cancel the contract on the following \u25a0terms :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">\u201c That he should receive a profit of 25 per cent, on the whole \u2022contract, and the amount expended on the tools, and let the Government take them as they are, or he will allow the Government 50 per cent, on the amount expended and retain them, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">Whole amount of contract ...$409,'000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-10\">Profits at 25 per cent.. 102,250 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-11\">Amount expended on tools at 25 per cent.. 182,409 25</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-12\">Fifty per cent, on amount expended . 91,204 61</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-13\">Payment received on contract. 109,500 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-14\">\u201cThis would leave a balance due the contractor of $84,504, \u2022making a difference of about $215,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-15\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that 25 per cent, would be a fair profit, which would reduce the amount due the contractor to about $71,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-16\">\u201cThe tool at the Lowell Machine Company\u2019s establishment is a horizontal boring-lathe, to swing 12 feet diameter, designed for boring cylinders. The contract-price is $15,000, upon which .a payment has been made of $7,500. We estimate that at the date of our visit it would cost about $1,500 to finish it. The contractor would make no proposition for canceling, the contractor stating that it was not a tool that he could sell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-17\">\u201cThe board are of opinion that cylinders of a diameter requiring a tool of this size should be bored in a perpendicular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>position and not horizontally, and consequently useless for the purpose for which it was intended. We therefore recommend it to be disposed of on the most advantageous terms that can be obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\">\u201cThe board, after a careful examination of the engines and tools now being constructed, and considering the probable wants, of the service, have come to the following conclusions, which are respectfully submitted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">\u201cThere are seven pair of these 60-inch by 36-inch engines with boilers stored in the different navy-yards at present, which, sliould they be used, will perhaps be as many as the Government will require for some years to come.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">\u201cThere will doubtless be many improvements made in the-construction of steam-engines before they will be required,, which, combined with their objectionable features, make it reasonable to suppose that they will never be used. Engines can-now be built, as we are informed, developing the same power, the same speed guaranteed, taking up less room, and about one-third less in weight, for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars 5 and as prices are not likely to advance, we are of the opinion that the Government can at any future time have engines built of an improved design on advantageous terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">\u201cThese engines would be unsalable for the merchant-marine service, for the reasons that other plans are being adopted, and on account of their weight and the room they occupy, and for the reason that we are not aware that there is a steamship now being built in the United States that would require engines of' this size.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\">\u201cThe same objections apply to'the 100-inch engines. To complete these engines for storing, and the labor of moving and taking care of them, would cost a larger amount of money, for which, perhaps, no return would ever be realized, as it will no doubt be to the best interest of the Government to encourage any new improvements there may be made. We are of the-opinion that it wpuld be for the best interest of the Government to dispose of them on the most advantageous terms offered ; and taking into consideration the condition of the market, their actual value as old material, and the cost of breaking up and transportation, we think better terms should be obtained from the contractors than from other parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">\u201cWith regard to the tools, we have to say they are tools off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the first; class, being built on the most improved plans that could be obtained from the best establishments in Europe, and would be invaluable to the Government if the wants of the service required them ; but the navy-yard shops are now well supplied for doing any work that may be required for many years, and they would, therefore, particularly the larger class, remain comparatively idle. They would be unsalable, as they are mostly of a class and size that no private establishment in this country has any use for, particularly at the present time, and we dp not think that they would bring now 30 per cent, of their value if sold to other parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">\u201cShould they all be finished and delivered, it would be difficult to find room for them im the present shops of the navy-yards. If the Department decides that these tools are not required, and desire to cancel the contracts, we think the contractors are disposed to deal upon favorable <em>terms; </em>and although there would be some losses sustained, we are of the opinion that in the end they would be overbalanced by purchasing such tools as may be required at any future time, as the market is falling. Any disposition the Department may desire to make can probably be made to a better advantage at the present time, as, owing to the present condition of business, the prices are likely to continue to decline.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">\u201c We are, very respectfully, your obedient servants,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">\u201cJ.

The fact that a certificate was giren to the claimants does not aid their case. The substance of that case is that the Secretary agreed, upon their transporting the engines to Charlestown, to pay them the amount claimed, and that thereupon they complied with the condition imposed. An oral agreement would have been quite as effective, for it seems certain that he had no power to issue any written evidence of debt by the United States that, by being written, would have a greater effect than if oral. (See <em>The Floyd Acceptances, </em>7 Wall., 666.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-12\">The view which we take of this transaction is, that when the United States directed the claimants to stop work upon the engines, the latter became entitled to damages for such breach of contract, which damages were, within a measuring cost, ascertained by well-known principles of law, and that whatever might be true of the inconvenience of disturbing an arrangement varying from the truth by a small percentage only, yet where the court sees that the damages assessed exceed the true \u25a0damages by the difference between #140,000 and <em>$257,000 </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>more than 80 per cent. \u2014 such assessment becomes, as matter of law, invalid. Here the Court of Claims said that if the United States could have proved the assessment made in the report of November, 1869, to be the correct assessment, it would have been immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>To decide whether it would hare been immaterial we must consider what its effect would- hare been had it been shown. To have shown that, would hare been to show that the certificate had awarded the claimants 80 per cent, more than what was due to them. Would that hare been immaterial ? In this connection we submit further, that although in ascertaining damages in such cases an element of fact exists which would; put the assessment to some extent in the hands of a jury, yet that if in a case of mere breach of contract, involving no question of smart-money, a jury were to exceed the probable amount by 80 per cent., the court would feel itself called upon to rule the plaintiff to abate his recovery, or otherwise have the verdict set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">In all this we assume, as we have a right to assume, that the United States could have shown to the satisfaction of the Court of Claims that the true damages in this case were $140,000, or thereabouts. If a jury would not have been allowed to assess such an amount against a defendant, we submit that it is not in the power of an officer of the United States to assess such a rate of damages against them. We admit in this part of the argument that the Secretary could pass upon the element of fact in such cases so far as to fix it within the limits that a jury might have done; but we submit that, beyond these limits, the error renders the settlement illegal, and remits the claimant to his right of suit in the Court of Claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">It must be remembered that in such cases the claimants may be bound by an arrangement which does not <em>per se </em>bind the United States; because the former are personally present,, assenting to the transaction, while the latter are dealing-through an agent of defined powers. If the United States choose to ratify any such arrangement, they can hold the other party bound, while, unless they do, the other party may not be able to enforce it as against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">Again, we submit that by the form of the certificate it appears that the claimants relied for satisfaction upon a fund to be appropriated by Congress, and so that the operation of the act of July 15,1870, is to the effect that no appropriation has been made except for the true damages arising under the rules applicable in all such cases. It is a narrow view of that act to read it as imposing a rule of payment upon the Secretary only. It clearly means that the United States refuse to pay according to the terms of the certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Whatever doubts might be urged in an ordinary case to the applicability of the above doctrines to assessments made by the Secretary, it seems that where, at its next session, Congress has repudiated a particular assessment of that sort, a court will not be disposed to enforce it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-5\">A full presentation of the defense of the United States requires us to suggest, farther, that in all cases where the interests of the public demand that a contract be broken and the other party left to recover such damages as the law awards, it is intended by our system that the matter shall be referred to the Court of Claims for settlement. The present is not a case in which the Secretary and the claimant agreed to substitute one contract for another while the latter remained unbroken. The order to cease work was made without a previous understanding with the contractors. Upon that order being given, the situation of the parties (as we submit) became such as virtually to refer-the matter at once to the tribunal devised by Congress to represent public justice in disputes about money between plaintiff and the United States. The Secretary is not an agent of the United States for matters of this sort and magnitude. At all events, by such intervention he cannot obstruct the processes of the Court of Claims, if it happens (as here) that, after all, the matter remains to be adjudicated there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-6\">If the Secretary actually discharges the amount which he has agreed to pay, nothing may remain tobe said about it; but if he be directed by Congress not to pay it, we submit that the matter naturally goes before the Court of Claims upon the original rights of the parties as they existed at the time when the cause of action arose. In short, his settlement is only preliminary to a payment <em>by </em>him; while, if the payment has to be made through the Court of Claims, they are to settle the terms without embarrassment by what had been done provisionally (as it were) by the Secretary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">In conclusion, we ask the attention of the court to the fact that, under the promise made to them on the 20th of May, 1869, (afterwards embodied in the certificate,) the claimants were not induced to alter, and-did not alter, their conditions under the contract for the worse, or in any respect so as to be the foundation of a suggestion by them that the United States is bound by the arrangement because of considerations arising subsequent to the original contract. There is no consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in what took place after the 20th of May to bind the United States for any amount beyond what they owed under the contract. The claimants suggest in their note of March 11, 1870, that the transportation of the engines to Charlestown was such consideration. But they were bound by the original contract so to transport them. That transportation was part of the value which the United States were to receive for their original promise to pay, and so could not be a ground for the promise by the Secretary to pay more than that. The arrangement between the Secretary and the claimants was one by which he waived a requirement of certain items in the original contract; transportation was one that he did not waive. Of course, a failure to waive that could form no consideration, for a new promise; so that, when the claimant demanded (March 11,1870) to be restored to the <em>statu quo </em>of their contract, they erred in specifying as an item therein a return of the engines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-6\">Nor could the alleged cancellation of the original contract, (which, whatever the claimants meant by that word in the note of March 11, 1870, is not found as a fact.) under the circumstances of this case, be such a consideration. The United States had a legal right (subject to the payment of damages) to stop further progress under the contract. It can hardly be said that a cancellation of the paper which evidenced what was to have been due to the claimants in case the contract had been executed could have then been material to the claimants, in view of all the admissions aud other evidence upon that point to be found in other official papers authorized by the Government, some of them on file in this case. If the paper had been really canceled, (which is not shown,) it had previously become very insignificant, and therefore its defacement cannot be pretended to be a consideration justifying the payment of more than $100,000 to the claimants. Indeed, the allusion to a cancellation is so indirect, and is so probably only metaphorical, that we are not sure that we ought to have combated a suggestion which, perhaps, has not been intended on the other side.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-7\"><em>Mr, Assistant Attorney-General Simons </em>also for the appellants :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">We contend, in the first place, that the Court of Claims misapprehended the legal effect of the alleged agreement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Navy Department, in construing it as intended to bind and as binding the United States absolutely to payment of the amount specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\">That the Department never intended to bind the United States by its action appears, we submit, by the plain reading of the letter of acceptance and of the certificate of December, in each of which payment is declared to be conditional on a subsequent appropriation by Congress of the requisite amount. The claimants were notified that the Department had no means of payment, and that payment would not be made until Congress should provide the means. The Department could not, and of course did not, engage that Congress would, within a certain time or at any time, make the appropriation. Can anything be plainer than that, under an agreement so conditioned, no right to demand the sum therein specified and no right of action therefor could accrue to the claimants until the appropriation should be made1?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">But if the conditional nature of the agreement does not appear to the court so clear on its face as it seems to us, there remains the argument, which seems conclusive, that it is only as conditional that the alleged agreement can (jscape the objection that it is void for want of authority in the Department to make it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-7\">The power of the Secretary of the Navy and his subordinates to bind the United States by their agreement is subject to certain statutory limitations which they cannot exceed, and which all persons dealing with them as contracting agents are bound to know and regard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">The solicitude of Congress on this point was early manifested, and its measures of precaution and restriction have never been relaxed, but always augmented and made more stringent.

The position assumed is that the Secretary of the Navy had' no power or authority to make the settlement and compromise, and that his act in this regard does not bind the United States. That is, that the Secretary of the, Navy, under the law, had full power to make these contracts according to his own unrestricted judgment and discretion; that he could increase, alter, suspend, or extend them at <em>his </em>own will. It is not denied he could wholly stop work under them ; that he could do everything else but determine what was the state of the account between the United States and the contractor. It is true the Navy Department alone furnished the full, necessary, detailed, information to make such a settlement and adjustment. There was neither matter of fact nor of law in dispute between it and the contractor. They were perfectly agreed as to the amount of work done, and the prices agreed upon under the contract. They were agreed that it was for the interest of the United States; that no more expense should be incurred for work theu entirely useless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">If the Government seeks to rescind this agreement, it could only do so by putting the claimants in <em>statu quo. </em>That involves: 1st. The restoration of the contracts given up and canceled; 2d. The return of the machinery delivered over to the United States; 3d. The payment of interest and damages for the loss and delay. <em>(Penn </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, 1 Yesey, sen., 444; <em>Union Banlc of Georgetown </em>v. <em>Geary, 5 </em>Peters, 115; Chitty on Contracts, 9th Am. ed., 42, and notes.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">A compromise or settlement, like an award, must bind both or neither. If the claimant was concluded, so were the United States. This court says, in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>The United States, (7 </em>Wall., p. 195,) \u201cAn arbitrament and award which concludes one party only is certainly an anomaly in the law.\u201d A settlement and compromise which should be obligatory on one party to it, and not on the other, would be equally anomalous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Another position assumed is that upon suspension of the work, before completion of the contracts, it became such an unliquidated matter that it was taken out of the power of the Secretary and became a matter for adjudication by tbe Court of Claims. I know of no law or authority which supports such a postulate. In every such case, under the <em>Act June </em>25, 1868, (15 Stats., p. 75,) the head of a Department may, at his discretion, send any case before him, involving disputed facts or controverted questions of law, to the Court of Claims. That he has a choice of doing so or not shows that he may determine the matter for himself. Besides, this case involved neither disputed facts nor controverted questions of law ; and, as I think I have clearly shown in the former part of this brief, the compromise and settlement was clearly within the prescribed powers of the Secretary of the Navy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">The action of Congress in directing a re-examination of the case, and the deduction of what sum it would have cost to complete the contracts, can have no bearing on the judicial aspects of the case. It may have furnished a rule to the Secretary, but does not bind the claimauts or the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">The stating of the account alters the nature of the debt, and is in the nature of a new promise or undertaking.

There is no dispute about the facts of the case; they are fully and clearly stated in the findings of the Court of Claims. And it would seem that there ought not to be any dispute as to the law applicable to them. The validity of the contracts is not questioned. The work upon them was done under the supervision of an inspector of the Navy Department, and no complaint is made of the manner in which it was done. When in 1869 the Department, upon the recommendation of a board of officers of the Navy, appointed by it, suspended the further progress of the work under the contracts, the claimant made a written proposition, in the alternative, either to take all the machinery and receive $150,000, or to deliver it in its then incomplete condition at the navy-yard at Charlestown, for $259,068, payable on delivery there. The Department accepted the latter proposition, recognizing the amount specified as .the balance due on settlement of the contracts, stating, however, that, in consequence of the very limited appropriations, only a partial payment would be made on delivery of the machinery at the Charlestown navy-yard, and that the balance could not be paid until Congress should make a further appropriation, but that a certificate for the amount due would be given to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The machinery was accordingly delivered at the navy-yard, with the exception of a few articles, for which a deduction from the amount of the settlement was allowed, and the certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>stipulated was given to the claimant. Previous to this, however, the Chief Engineer of the Navy, under direction of the Department, examined the machinery and made a detailed report, by which the Department was fully informed of its condition, the progress made in its construction, and what remained to be done for its completion under the contracts. There is no allegation or suggestion that the claimant was guilty of any fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation on the subject, but, on the contrary, it is clear that every fact was known to both parties, and that the whole transaction, as stated by the court below, was unaffected by any taint or infirmity. If such a settlement, as the Chief-Justice of the Court of Claims very justly observes, accompanied by the giving up by one, and the taking possession by the other, of the property involved, cannot be judicially maintained, it would seem that no settlement by any contractor with the Government could be considered a finality against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The duty of the Secretary of the Navy, by the <em>Act April </em>30, 1798, (1 Stat. L., p. 553,) creating the Navy Department, extends, under the orders of the President, to \u201c the procurement of naval stores and materials, and the construction, armament, equipment, and employment of vessels of war, as well as all other matters connected with the naval establishment of the United States.\u201d The power of the President in such cases is, of course, limited by the legislation of Congress. That legislation existing, the discharge of the duty devolving upon the Secretary necessarily requires him to enter into numerous contracts for the public service, and' the power to suspend work contracted for, whether in the construction, armament, or equipment of vessels of war, when from any cause the public interest requires such suspension, must necessarily rest with him. As in making the original contracts he must agree upon the compensation to be made for their entire performance, it would seem that when those contracts are suspended by him he must be equally authorized to agree upon the compensation for their partial performance. Contracts for the armament and equipment of vessels of war may, and generally do, require numerous modifications in the progress of the work, where that work requires years for its completion. With the improvements constantly made iu ship-building and steam-machinery and in arms, some parts originally contracted for may have to be aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>doned and other parts substituted, and it would be of serious detriment to the public service if the power of the head of the Navy Department did not extend to providing for all such possible contingencies, by modification or suspension of the contracts and settlement with the contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">When a settlement in such a case is made upon a full knowledge of all the facts, without concealment, misrepresentation, or fraud, it must be equally binding upon the Government as upon the contractor. At least such a settlement cannot be disregarded by the Government without restoring to the contractor the property surrendered as a condition of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">But aside from this general authority of the Secretary of the Navy, under the orders of the President, he was, during the rebellion, specially authorized and required by acts of Congress, either in direct terms or by specific appropriations for that purpose, to construct, arm, equip, and employ such vessels of war as might be needed for the efficient prosecution of the war. In the discharge of this duty he made the original contracts with the claimant. The completion of the machinery contracted for having become unnecessary, from the termination of the war, the Secretary, in the exercise of his judgment, under the advice of a board of naval officers, suspended the work. Under these circumstances we are of opinion that he was authorized to agree with the claimant upon the compensation for the partial performance, and that the settlement thus made is binding upon the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
