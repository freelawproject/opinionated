It cannot be extended to officers ordered home at their own request to await orders, for, under the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Williamson\u2019s Case, </em>(10 C. Cls.

The claimant being first lieutenant in the Twenty-first Regiment of United States Infantry, on the 16th August, 1869, at his own request', was ordered home to await orders. On the 1st September, 1869, he accordingly left his post at Camp Reno, Ariz., and, proceeded to his home in Detroit, Mich. From the 30th September, 1869, to the 30th April, 1870, he reported as waiting orders at Detroit. Subsequently he was assigned to duty on recruiting-service at Detroit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-15\">II. The claimant did not apply for quarters or fuel to the quartermaster at Detroit. There were no quarters at that place during the above period, subject to the control of the Quartermaster Department, which could have been assigned to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>The rate allowed by the War Department for commutation of officers\u2019 quarters was $18 a room per month. The rate allowed for commutation of fuel was, on the average, $10.25 a cord.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b702-6\"><em>Mr. JI. H.

Robinson </em>(with whom was the <em>Assistant Attorney- ' </em>General) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b702-8\">Nott, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALW\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The Supreme Court decided in <em>Williamson\u2019s Case </em>(10 C. Cls. R., p. 50) that a military officer ordered to proceed to his home and there await orders is not <em>\u201cabsent from duty with </em>leave\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Act 3d March, </em>1863, (12 Stat. L., p. 731,) though the order was issued at his own request; and, on the contrary, that an officer ordered to a particular place, there to <em>\u201cawait orders,\u201d </em>must remain at that place and continue as much under orders as though assigned to any ordinary military duty, and, hence, that he is entitled to full pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Notwithstanding the comprehensive terms of that decision, several questions are now presented by the Government in this, a kindred case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The first objection raised is that it did not appear in the case before the Supreme Court that an officer thus ordered might designate his home in the first place, and change it at will <em>afterward; in </em>other words, that an officer ordered home to await orders might make his home ambulatory, and, by simply reporting from the places where he chanced to be, might in fact, though not in form, be free to go where he pleased, and be constructively awaiting orders while traveling on business or pleasure. We are not satisfied that any such latitude of duty appears in this case; and, on the contrary, we are inclined to think that such conduct in an officer would be a discreditable evasion of duty and a virtual disobedience of orders; and that a court should not sanction any such improper practice by holding it to be a thing which an officer has a legal right t\u00f3 do.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">The second objection raised by the Government is that, by <em>General Orders of the War Department, </em>(No. 289,1864,) \u201cOfficers serving on courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions or boards, will not be allowed commutation of fuel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>quarters except by special orders of the War Department.\u201d But this order of the Department must be restricted to the duties to which it in terms refers, and those duties it is manifest are both specific and temporary in their nature. To extend the order to the extent now claimed would be to take this part of the compensation of military officers entirely out of the hands of Congress and put it entirely within the control of the War Department. The <em>Aot 28th </em>July, 1866, (14 Stat. L., p. 332, \u00a7 37,) makes the Army Regulations a part of the law of the land, and by the regulations (1080, 1081) commutation was allowed to officers at stations without troops, or where serving without troops at posts where there are no public quarters which they can occupy; and the Supreme Court has decided that an officer thus awaiting orders was serving without troops.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The petition in this case seeks to recover commutation from the time that the officer left his post to proceed to his home, <em>i. e., </em>for the period while he was on the way. We are of the opinion that the recovery must be limited to the time the officer was at the station, as indicated on his arrival by his reporting for orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The judgment of the court is that the claimant recover of the defendants, for commutation of quarters for seven months, $252, and for commutatiou of fuel for the same period, $140; amounting, in the aggregate, to $392.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
