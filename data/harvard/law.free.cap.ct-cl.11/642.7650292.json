Stat., \u00a7 1062,) before relief can be decreed.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-11\"><em>The Reporters\u2019 </em>statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-12\">It should be noted in this case that the paymaster merely sent the package of money by the orderly, taking no steps whatever to verify the assumption that it reached the depository. As it was a package and not an ordinary deposit, no bank-book accompanied it, nor could the receiving-teller have receipted for the amount; but apparently no other receipt was sought, and the paymaster assumed that the package had been duly received until he had occasion to send for it. The following are the facts found by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-13\">1. Oliver Holman, the claimant\u2019s intestate, was an additional paymaster in the United States Army, stationed at Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, in the year 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>2. On the 29th day of July of that year, returning from Gal-lope\u2019s Island, in Boston Harbor, where he had been, in the line of his duty, to pay the Twelfth Massachusetts Battery, he had on hand certain money of the United States, as such paymaster, consisting of current notes of different denominations. These notes he made into a package and intrusted to one Mc-Kenney, who then was, and for two months or more had been, an orderly detailed for service in his office, with directions to go to the Boston National Bank, a designated depository of the United States, where his official deposits were kept, and to deposit said package, with a request to the teller that the same should be kept for him intact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-5\">3. A few days afterward it was discovered that said package had not been deposited at said bank, but had been lost or stolen by said McKenney. On the 7th day of August following, said Holman reported the facts in writing to his superior officer in charge of the pay department of the district, stating therein the contents of said package to be $2,658. Efforts were made to recover the money lost, but without avail. On the 23d of August, 1865, said McKenney was tried before a general court-martial on charge of having failed to deliver, or of stealing or otherwise wrongfully disposing of said package, therein stated to be of the value of about $2,658. On this charge he was found guilty, and sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service of the United States, with loss of pay, allowances, and bounties due or to become due, and confined at hard labor at such place as the comm an ding-general should direct, for the term of five years. This sentence was approved by'the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-6\">\u201cHeadquarters Department oe the East,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-7\">\u201c <em>New </em>YorTe, <em>October 15th, </em>1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-8\">\u201c The proceedings, findings, and sentence in the case of Private William H.

Said paymaster, in. bis official account rendered November, 1865, claimed credit for $2,658 thus reported as stolen from him by or through said McKenney. This claim was not acted upon by the War Department until March, 1872, when the Acting Paymaster-General recommended that credit be allowed Major Holman for the amount ; and on the 14th of March, 1872, this recommendation was disapproved by the Secretary of War. On the 15th of October, 1872, a suit was instituted by the United States in the circuit court for the first circuit, upon the official bond of said paymaster, to recover a balance of $3,220.02, claimed to be due from him, and said suit is still pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-6\">5. Said Oliver Holman had the general reputation of being a careful, prudent, and accurate paymaster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-7\">6. Oliver Holman died February 29, 1872, and the petitioner was appointed administrator on his estate November 20, 1872.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b654-8\"><em>Mr. C.

L., p. 44.) Where the amount lost is known only to thedisbursing-officer, (whose testimony, if he were living, would be inadmissible,) the beneficent purpose of the statute allows and requires that resort should be had to the probabilities made out by other testimony, including that which relates to the good character of the officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-10\"><em>(Whittlesey\u2019s Case, </em>5 O.

L., p. 765) cannot be successfully pleaded in bar in this case. The several provisions of the act of 1863 (including that of limitation in section 10) are to be restricted to those claims in which the petitioner sets up a money demand as due from the Government, and which pass into judgment as prescribed in section 7, act of 1855, and section 7, act of 1863. <em>(Alire's Case, </em>6 Wallace, 573, at 575, 576.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-6\">The statute under which the present cause arises was not enacted for the purpose of enabling an officer to enforce a money claim due from the Government, but to afford relief in the nature of a set-off when the Government should claim money from him. Not to make such relief commensurate, in time, with the claim of the Government, would tend to defeat the beneficent purpose of its enactment. It was intended to be used as a shield in defense; and is, therefore, not subject to the conditions which may be applied to a process of attack, and the time of its use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-7\">The cause of action in this case arose within sis years before the filing of the petition. Such a suit could only be properly brought after a final \u201c statement of differences.\u201d Until that time it could not be determined that the petitioner would be \u201cheld responsible\u201d for the amount of the loss. This statement was made by the accounting-officers of the Government in March, 1872.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-8\"><em>Mr. Joseph K. McCammon </em>(with whom was the <em>Assistant Attorney- General) </em>for the defendants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-9\">There is no proof of the amount of Government funds given to McKenney to deposit, nor is there proof that the package contained any money.

Stats., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>sections 1060,1062, cannot be made. The intrusting of Government funds to an orderly was unnecessary and entirely reprehensible.

These he made into a package and delivered to an orderly detailed for service in his office, with directions to take the same to the Boston National Bank, a designated depository, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>where bis official deposits were kept, and to request the teller to keep the same for him. intact. The package was never received by the bank, but was stolen by or from the orderly, who was tried before a general court-martial for the larceny, convicted, and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment and other punishments therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">A majority of the court are of opinion that the paymaster was at fault and negligent in intrusting so large an amount of money to an orderly in his office, instead of depositing the same at the bank himself, or sending it by his clerk, and, therefore, that the petitioner is not entitled to the relief from responsibility which he prays for.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">But, speaking for myself alone, I think there is another fatal defect in the claimant\u2019s case. He has failed to prove the amount of money contained in the stolen package, and the court has no means of determining the extent of the loss.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The only facts bearing upon that point are these: Immediately after the larceny, Holman, the paymaster, reported the fact to his superior officer, and stated that the package contained $2,658 j and in his next official account, four months later, he claimed credit for the same amount therein alleged to have been thus stolen from him. He also testified to the same amount of loss before the general court-martial by which the orderly was tried upon the charge of having committed the larceny. The court-martial found the orderly guilty of stealing the package, stated in the proceedings to be \u201c of the value of about $2,658and this statement of value, uncertain as it is, was founded only upon the oath of the paymaster himself. The issue tried before that military court was whether or not the orderly had committed the larceny of a package of money of the value of about $2,658, and the exact amount of notes contained therein was not material and was not found by the court. It is true that the commanding general, in approving the findings, recites and approves the conviction of the accused for \u00a3&lt; stealing $2,658 from a United States paymaster,\u201d but in this he assumes what was not proved and what the court did not find.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">All this is wholly incompetent to prove the actual amount of money lost, which it is necessary for this court to determine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>order to grant any relief. The declaration of the original claimant, not made under oath, and his sworn statement before another tribunal, are equally inadmissible in his own favor in a case brought in this court by his administrator for the benefit of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We are left, then, in my opinion, without the slightest legal evidence whatever as to the amount of loss sustained by the petitioner\u2019s intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The unanimous judgment of the court is that the decree prayed for be refused and the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> See, on this point, the decision in <em>Paymaster ClarWs Case, </em>post.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
