To that end Eggleston enters into a contract with a quartermaster and Houston becomes his surety. Subsequently notice is given that Eggleston cannot furnish the forage, and the quartermaster at the post purchases it of Houston at a much higher price than the contract-rate. The defendants refuse to pay the vouchers issued to Houston and he brings suit. The contract on which he is surety provides that if the forage is not f urnished, the receiving officer may \u201c </em>supply the deficiency by purchase and have the contractor charged with the difference.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b773-11\">Where one is nominally surety on a contract but really a partner in the transaction, and the contract provides that in case of default the receiving officer may <em>\u201c supply the deficiency by purchase and have the contractor charged with the difference,\u201d </em>the surety cannot evade the obligations of the contract by selling in his own name to the receiving officer (to supply such a deficiency) at an increased price. In an action to recover such increased price the defendants may avail themselves of his character of partner and restrict his recovery to the original contract-price.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>The Reporters\u2019 </em>statement of tbe ease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-6\">The court found:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-7\">That previous to the letting and making of said contracts,, it was agreed between said Irving Eggleston and the petitioner that said contracts should be obtained and taken in the name-of said Eggleston, and that the petitioner should become one of the sureties on the bonds to be given therefor, and that the expenses of performance and the profits on said contracts should be divided between them as follows, viz: That said Houston, being a merchant, should exchange his goods for corn and hay in quantities sufficiently large to supply the requirements under said contracts, and should be credited for said goods at the ordinary selling price thereof, and the difference between his. bill and the amount of the vouchers given under the contracts should be equally divided between said Eggleston and the petitioner in' monthly settlements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-8\">Under said arrangement hay and corn were supplied by said Houston, and the said contracts so carried on, and vouchers therefor received in the name of said Eggleston from July, 1869, to January 1, 1870, when the said Eggleston left Nacog-doches to reside permanently at Austin, with an understanding with said Houston that he would continue to supply corn and hay under said contracts and receive the vouchers in his name until the post was discontinued, which was then expected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-9\">On the 1st day of February, 1870, the following order was issued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-10\">\u201c It having been officially reported by 2d Lieutenant H.

And the facts found show, also, that when Eggleston left Nacogdoches to go to Austin to remain he agreed with Houston that the latter would make the deliveries required by the contract, and receive under that,-in his own name, the vouchers accruing under it. And of this contract between the parties the United States have, by the rules-in assumpsit, a right to avail themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">As the petitioner was as partner bound to deliver under the \u2022 contract the corn and hay he delivered in February and March, 1870, he was entitled for such deliveries only to the .contract price, amounting to the sum of $2,136.99. He has been paid the sum $1,708.20 for deliveries he was bound to make under the contract, which leave a balance due him of $125.79, for which judgment is rendered in his favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b776-5\">Richardson, J., was absent when this case was determined.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
