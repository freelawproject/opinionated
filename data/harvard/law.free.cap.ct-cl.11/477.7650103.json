The commissioner, under instructions, marshals the assets into distinct funds, and charges them with losses. On the coming in of his report the parties are heard on exceptions filed. Additional-facts where requested are also found by the court. The findings show only the capture of the cotton ; that it went to a landing on the Mississippi in the vicinity of Ficlcsburgh, and toas placed on transports; that these means would naturally carry it into the mass of intermingled cotton at Vicksburgh, theproceds whereof are in the Treaswry. The court below finds the ultimate fact that the prroceeds of the claimants\u2019 cotton are in the Treasury, but the findings state expressly that this is found loithout direct evidence, and upon the circumstances before stated.

A finding of fact, in the nature of a special verdict, that the cotton of a claimant contributed to and forriied part of a mass intermingled and sold by the agents of the Treasury, will he sustained, though not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>upon evidence specifically tracing tlie property, but upon the assumption that amid the circumstances attending its capture all cotton which was started from the place of capture in a manner that would naturally carry it into the mass must be presumed to have gone there unless shown to have been lost or shipped to some other point.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b488-3\">II. Each contributor to a common fund becomes interested in the fund in proportion to his contribution. Hence each owner of captured property intermingled with other property of the same kind and value, stored in a common mass, becomes the owner of an interest in the mass proportionate to his contribution.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b488-4\">III. Where the property of different owners was intermingled in a common mass after capture, and there appeared to the court below a likelihood of there being a deficiency in the fund, it was proper for the court to briDg all the claimants together and conduct the suits in such a manner as to compel them to litigate with each other, to the end that they might share proportionately in the losses attending the fund.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b488-5\">IV. The fact that cotton was used after caxrture for military purposes, does not exclude the Court of Claims from jurisdiction as to such of it as was subsequently turned over to the Treasury agents and sold under the provisions of the <em>Abandoned or captured property Act.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b488-6\">V. The Court of Claims may use such machinery as courts of more general jurisdiction employ amid similar circumstances to aid investigation; such as to refer cases to a commissioner to state accounts, marshal assets, and adjust losses; provided that the judgment finally rendered is the result of the deliberation of the court, and not that of the commissioner alone.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b488-8\">VI.

On being satisfied of their loyalty, the Secretary of the Treasury would direct the supervising special agents to release to the applicant the proceeds of a specified number of bales, deducting therefrom the custom-house fees and internal-revenue tax. The special agent would thereupon pay to the applicant out of the moneys subject to his draft, as before stated, the amount which he supposed represented the avails of the applicant\u2019s cotton, deducting, however, the customhouse fees and internal-revenue tax. But in making these esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>mates the special agent did not take into account the losses to which the mass of cotton had been subjected before it came into-his hands. Consequently, while he nominally released the proceeds of a given number of bales, less the custom-house fees, and internal-revenue tax, he really released the proceeds of a much larger number. Therefore, after the custom-house fees and internal-revenue tax had been deducted, there was released, as representing 1,497 bales, the sum of $407,6S8.07, as above-shown, giving an average of $272.33 per bale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">\u201cTo arrange the cotton referred to, and the corresponding proceeds into funds, is a task of no little delicacy. There is so much uncertainty connected with the facts, and the various lots are so confused and intermingled,, that it is only possible to approximate, and we are compelled to grope in the dark and separate the cotton into funds with such imperfect lights as we have before us. I have divided the cotton captured in Mississippi into eight' separate funds, and iu so doing have taken the cotton- remaining on hand only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">\u201cThe cotton paid out for collecting, burned or lost, and released in kind or in net proceeds, has been excluded from the various funds 5 but the cotton disposed of by the. court has been included iu the fund, except the cotton in controversy in the case of Woodruff, Bouchard &amp;Elgee, and the funds arising therefrom. This case being undecided on appeal, the property has been excluded from the fuuds. - \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">\u201c In cases where the net proceeds of cotton were released by the Treasury agents to persons claiming to own them, the amounts assessed for custom-house fees and internal-revenue-taxes were always retained by the Government. In this report such sums, so retained, have been considered and counted as a part of the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\">\u201cThe most o-f the cotton included iu this report was captured in the vicinity of Vicksburgh, Miss., and was transported to that city. From there it was shipped generally to Memphis, Tenn., and thence to Saint Louis and Cincinnati, for sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-9\">\u201cThe collection of cotton in that locality began in June, 1863, about the time the Army surrounded the city of Vicks-burgh, and continued, until about July, 1865. A very large quantity of captured cotton was used by the Army of the United States for defensive purposes in the vicinity of Vicks-burgh. After the surrender of Vicksburgh, this cotton, or as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>much of it as could be saved, was collected and transported to Vicksburgh. The work of gathering cotton from the defenses around Vicksburgh continued until about the 1st of November, 1863, and after that date small quantities were received, and even as late as March, 1864, a few bales were dug out and brought in from those defenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-4\">\u201cThe testimony shows that, during the strife in the counties surrounding Vicksburgh, the people were in the habit of coii-cealing their cotton in swamps and forests to protect it from the torches of the confederates, and also from the hands of the Union Army. During the latter part of the year 1863, and during tiie year 1864, milch of this concealed cotton was discovered by the military forces of the United States, and by the Treasury officials, and was seized and conveyed by them to Vicksburgh and to Natchez.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-5\">\u201cNeither the records of the Department, nor the depositions of witnesses filed in the various cases, enable me to determine how long the various lots of cotton remained in Vicksburgh before shipment to the North for sale. But I find that large masses of cotton were stored in warehouses and piled up on wharves in Vicksburgh for indefinite periods of time, and I am led to the belief that large quantities of cotton were retained in Vicksburgh many mouths before shipment to Memphis, Saint Louis, and Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">\u201c I find that a large quantity of cotton was, immediately after seizure, sent to Natchez, but the greater part,' if not all, of such cotton was reshipped, sooner or later, to Vicksburgh; at this point it was intermingled with the mass of cotton accumulated in that city, except as to lot 121, hereinafter mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-7\">\u201c I have, therefore, arranged the cotton shipped from Vicks-burgh and Natchez during the years 1863 and 1864 into one fund, and have called it the first fund, to answer to claims for-cotton seized and sent to those two points during those'two years. Two expeditions were sent up the Yazoo River, one in. 1863, under General Herron\u2019s command, and the other in 1864, under the command of Colonel Coates. Both of these expeditions captured cotton, which was shipped down the Yazoo. River to Vicksburgh, and I have, therefore, included it in the fund under consideration. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-8\">\u201cA small lot of cotton, consisting of fifteen bales, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>brought to Memphis by a steamboat in August, 18G3; of these, twelve bales were saved from burning at Perkins\u2019s Landing, and three picked up in the Yazoo River. This cotton undoubtedly was the property of the people residing in the vicinity of Yicksburgh, who contributed to cotton which forms the first fund, and I have therefore assigned the lot to said fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">\u201cSome of the cotton captured in the vicinity of the railroad-bridge over the Big Black River, in June, 1863, was conveyed on wagon-trains to Haines\u2019s Bluff ; such cotton, I think, eventually went into Yicksburgh, and I have therefore included it in the first fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-6\">\u201cIn every case where the evidence shows the seizure of cotton and the shipment thereof to Yicksburgh or Natchez, during the years 1863 and 1864,1 have recommended the payment of the allowance out of this fund. All of the cotton allowed to claimants out of this fund, except in two cases, was captured on and before the 1st day of March, 1864. In the two cases so excepted, the cotton was captured in July and September, 1864. In view of the great uncertainty as to the time of shipment from Yicksburgh, and the impossibility of tracing the cotton of the various claimants into specified lots, I deem this to be the only just method of distributing the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-7\">\u201cI have prepared and filed herewith a paper, marked 'Exhibit No. 2,\u2019 showing the lots of cotton put into the first fund, the date of shipment, the judgments of the court, and the number of bales remaining available, to which reference is made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-8\">\u201cAfter'deducting the amounts recovered in judgments of the court heretofore rendered, and the amount released by the Treasury, there will remain a balance in the Treasury derived from cotton which has been segregated as belonging to the first fund, amounting to $948,313.30, and this is designated for the purposes of tliis report as the first fund.

The counsel for the Government not having taken steps to consolidate suits where the parties were seeking to recover the proceeds of their property out of a common fund, the court would have been compelled to try the cases separately, and render judgment in each without charging each with a conjectural proportion of the general losses to which the fund might have been subjected. It appearing to the court that, at the rate claimants have been recovering, the funds would be exhausted before all of the judgments likely to be recovered were satisfied, and that the resulting consequence would be either that the later judgments would remain unsatisfied or that the Government would be required to satisfy them from other sources, the court was warranted, for the ultimate protection of the Government and of such later claimants, in suspending proceedings in all of the cases before it, and sending them to a commissioner, who, as an accountant, would marshal the assets of the property and charge it with the proper losses, so that equal and exact justice should be done to all. As to the title of the claimants and their rights to the proceeds, the court has determined them upon the evidence, irrespective of the commissioner\u2019s report, wherever requested so to do by either the claimant or the defendants. The first exception of the defendants to the reference of these cases to a commissioner is therefore overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">\u201c 2. As to the Natchez and Yicksburgh cotton, it appears from the evidence that the parcels of different owners were intermingled before shipment, and that some of the shipments from the two points were subsequently intermingled. It being im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>possible to trace the specific property of each owner, and likewise impossible to determine whether his cotton remained in a shipment from the original point of shipment, or went into the intermingled shipments from different points, the whole must be thrown into a common mass, and the average thereof be the measure of damages for all who contributed thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\">\u201c3.

It is not specifically traced by the evidence to the official custody of the Treasury agent at Yicksburgh nor to the official custody of any military officer; and, from the circumstances attending its seizure and shipment, it cannot be so traced by the claimant. But the Treasury agent at Yicksburgh, about the same time, received large quantities of cotton from unknown sources, belonging to unknown persons, add from various places of capture and shipment, and this cotton might, and amid the circumstances of the case naturally would, have gone into the mass at Yicks-burgh, and constitute a part of the cotton received by the Treasury agent at that place, and neither its loss nor its shipment to any other point is shown by the defendants. The Court of Claims, upon these facts and the presumptions therefrom arising, finds, though without there being direct proof of the ultimate fact, that the cotton owned by the claimant\u2019s assignor constituted a part of the cotton received by the Treasury agent at Yicksburgh, and contributed to the fund set forth in the commissioner\u2019s report, which forms part of the previous findings of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-9\">\u201c Second.

And in response to the instructions of the Supreme Court to find \u00a3 whether the proceeds of the sales of the cotton .owned by and seized from the claimant in this case do or do not constitute a part of the fund found to be in the Treasury of the United States accruing from the sales of the said intermingled mass of cotton so shipped from Yicksburgh, Miss., during said years 1863 and 1864, and which was sold at Cincinnati and Saint Louis for and on behalf of the United States,\u2019 the Court of Claims finds as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">\u201c There is no direct evidence <em>to </em>show that the claimant\u2019s cotton continued in or was separated from the mass of intermingled cotton at Yicksburgh, but the whole of said mass was shipped from there, and was sold at Saint Louis and Cincinnati, less certain losses of unidentified cotton, with which the fund has beei#duly charged; and on these facts, and the presumption therefrom arising, but without direct proof of the ultimate fact, the court finds that the proceeds of the sales of the claimant\u2019s cotton do constitute a part of the fund found to be in the Treasury accruing from the sales of the intermingled mass of cotton so shipped from Yicksburgh and sold at Saint Louis and Cincinnati, more particularly set forth and described in the report of the commissioner, which forms a part of the previous findings of this court.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Mr. Solicitor-General Phillips </em>(wit'll whom was <em>Mr. Assistant Attorney-General </em>Smith) for the appellants : '</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">Taking- <em>RaymoncVs Case </em>precisely as it stands when placed in tbe light most favorable for the claimant, he is not entitled to recover. This court has never allowed a recovery unless the plaintiff clearly traced his cotton to the hands of some officer directly charged with the duty of caring for it and seeing that its proceeds did reach the Treasury. <em>(OrusseWs Case, </em>14 Wall., 1.) This cotton was taken solely and expressly for a military use. If any of it escaped, that was not because it ivas not subjected to all the hazards of the situation, and of the purpose for which it was seized. The Court of Claims has no jurisdiction as to such property. <em>(Act July Alh </em>18(14, 13 Stat. L., 381.) It was taken not simply as cotton, but as a suitable material from which to construct defensive works. Its appropriation by the .Army was to purposes purely military. <em>(Mlor\u2019s Case, </em>9 Wall, 48.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">At least, it is not incumbent on the Government-in such cases to prove that any or how much escaped. If entitled to recover at all, the claimant should show this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-7\">Of course, if the proposition that the cotton must be specifically traced is sound, there can be ,no occasion for forming a fund. If the doctrine of confusion of goods is applicable at all, only those parcels should be treated as a mass which were in fact mingled. Different aggregations known to have been seized, shipped, and sold at places and times far apart, ought not to be thrown together, so as to make confusion worse confounded. For instance, cotton known to have been^put into the fortifications at Vicksburgh should only claim a <em>pro </em>rata. share of cotton known to have been taken from those fortifications, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">If the court could create a fund from the proceeds of intermingled cotton, that formed in this case is evidently erroneous, and not accordant with the principles of law nor with the requirements of natural justice. It swept into one common mass cotton taken from various places throughout the whole State of Mississippi; though the commissioner reports that \u201cthe most of it\u201d \u201cwas captured in the vicinity of Vicksburgh,\u201d and transported to and shipped from that city. But detailed Exhibit No. 2 shows that certain small quantities were shipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>from Haines\u2019s Bluff, Perkins\u2019s Landing, &amp;c.; and that very large amounts were skipped direct from Natchez. Upon what conceivable theory should a man whose cotton went to and from Natchez contribute to pay for that dug up or captured at Yicks-burgh ? Take the last item in that exhibit: lot 74, one hundred and eighty bailes, shipped from Chickasaw Bayou to Memphis in June, 1863 j value, $40,668.93. Why should this cotton, forwarded in the month before Yicksburgh surrendered, be deemed part of the mass obtained there ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-4\">Time as well as space was disregarded in creating this fund. Cotton shipped from Yicksburgh and other places in 1863, at dates from July to December of that year, enters into it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\">Cotton specifically traced was thrown into this mass. That which is followed direct from Natchez to its place of salein Cincinnati is subjected to the losses and risks of Yicksburgh. How much was obtained on the Yazoo River expeditions could be known. It was put in with the Yicksburgh cotton because shipped from there. That is, because it happened to go North from that port, after it became as peaceful as Saint Louis, it must be subjected in law to those risks and losses of the siege which in fact it confessedly escaped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">Though by the Revised Statutes, pp. 197, 198, \u00a7\u00a7 1070,1075, the Court of Claims can appoint acommissioner to take testimony, he has no authority to report inferences or conclusions from the testimony, nor can the court act upon such conclusions. Certainly they cannot delegate to another their judicial powers, and refer to him the very issue raised by the pleadings. <em>(Lunsford </em>v. <em>Bostion, </em>1 Dev.\u2019s Eq., (No. Car.,) 483.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">The claim in <em>KidcVs Case </em>is charged upon the first fund aforesaid. \u201cThe proof shows that the claimant owned and had in possession on his plantation,in Hinds County, Mississippi, in <em>May, </em>1863, five hundred bales of cotton, and that the same was taken by the United States Army to General Osterhaus\u2019s headquarters, and hauled the next month in Army wagons, in charge of United States soldiers, toward Yicksburgh.\u201d The claimant only called for 480 bales in his petition, and judgment was rendered in his favor for that number, at the specified rate of the cotton in that \u201cfund,\u201d $177.55 a bale.

It lay immediately in the line of the march of General Osterhaus\u2019s division of General Grant\u2019s army in its march on Yicksburgh, in May, 1863. The railroad-bridge over the Big Black Eiver is eleven or twelve miles east of Yicksburgh, in the direction of Jackson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>This division encamped for some time at this railroad-bridge, while other divisions of the army were getting into positions to prosecute the siege. While lying there, the officers and soldiers of General Osterhaus\u2019s division seized a large amount of cotton, and it was piled up in long rows near his headquarters. Among the rest, he seized 500 bales from the claimant, Kidd, which he had raised, gathered, ginned, and baled on his plantation; and it was hauled to headquarters and piled up, intermingling with the other cotton taken from various other persons. In June, 1803, when General Osterhaus was ordered to advance, all the cotton gathered there was loaded on United States wagous, and carried forward with the advance of the division toward Yicksburgh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\">Most of this cotton was used as breast and counter works in prosecuting the siege, and it was there still further intermingled. The city surrendered on the 4th of July, 1863. On the 14th of the same month, General McPherson, who was put in command of the city and its environs, issued an order directing the cotton used in the siege, on both sides, to be gathered up and delivered over to the Treasury agent at Yicksburgh. Some 2,700 bales were brought in from these works and delivered to the agent, and by him forwarded and sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-6\">But this cotton, not only in its seizure, but in its use, its reclamation, and delivery to the agent, was intermingled. Its exposure to the weather and its contact with the earth necessarily obliterated the marks, so that it could not be distinguished. Five thousand and seventy-eight and a quarter bales of cotton were received by the agent at Yicksburgh during the remainder of 1803, after the surrender, and 1864. Out of this number, but 617 were specifically traced, and <em>572 </em>of these were the Elgee cotton, recently decided by this court, and it was only traced because the owner followed it up from place to place until it was sold at Saint Louis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-7\">The schedule on pages 14 and 15 of the record shows the receipt, shipment, &amp;c., of the various lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"224\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">These figures show a large deficit, both in bales and net proceeds. It is accounted for by table No. 1. It appears from that and the other evidence in the case that the then Secretary of the , Treasury and his agents usurped the functions and powers of the courts, and .proceeded to adjudicate upon this captured and abandoned property and its proceeds. The evidence shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that out of this Yicksburgh cotton 846 bales in kind were released.

To obviate the necessity for this, and to compensate for it, Congress has provided that at any time within two years from the final disposition of a cause the United States may move for a new trial in the Court of Claims, upon evidence, cumulative or other, that shows that any fraud, wrong, or injustice has been done to the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"265\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">Your honors required the Court of Claims to certify whether the cotton owned by these claimants did or did not constitute a part of the cotton delivered to and received by the Treasury agent at Vicksburgh, during the year 1863; and the court answers positively that it did constitute, a part of the cotton so received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"266\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">Whether or not it was there intermingled with other cotton, and its identity lost and destroyed, the court responds, it was so intermingled and its identity destroyed; and all of it so confused that it was necessary to throw it into a common mass or hotch-pot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"267\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">Whether the proceeds of the various claimants\u2019 cotton do or not constitute a part of the fund found to be in the Treasury, accruing from the sale of the mass of the cotton with which theirs had been intermingled, the court positively finds and affirms that the proceeds of the sales of claimant\u2019s cotton do constitute a part of the fund found to be in the Treasury, arising from the sales of this intermingled mass of Yicksburgh cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"268\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-8\">This case bears little more resemblance to the case of <em>Crus-sell, </em>(17 Wall.,) or that of <em>Silvej/, </em>(7 O. 0., 278,) than it does to Shelley\u2019s case. There, especially in the Silvey case, the ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>mate facts found failed to trace the property into the hands <em>of' </em>a Treasury agent, or any one whose duty it was to turn it oyer to such an agent. But here we show seizure by the military; then the cotton in the hands of a Treasury agent; th,en its shipment and sale; and, finally, the proceeds are actually traced into' the Treasury of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"269\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">But, I submit again, that in order to raise the presumption of the Orussell and Silvey cases it. was not necessary that it should be traced into the hands or custody of a-quartermaster. Any and every other officer and soldier was justas much bound to turn it over to the Treasury agent as a quartermaster. The sixth section, act of March 12, 1863-, provides\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"270\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">\u201c That it shall be the duty of every officer or private of the regular or volunteer forces of the United States, or any officer, sailor, or marine in the naval service of the United States, upon the inland waters of the United States, who may take or receive any such abandoned property, or cotton, sugar, rice, or tobacco, from persons in such insurrectionary districts, or have it under his control, to turn the same over to an agent appointed as aforesaid, who shall give a receipt therefor; and in case he shall refuse or neglect so to do, he shall be tried by a court-martial, and shall be dismissed from the service, or, if an officer, reduced to the ranks, or suffer such other punishment as said court shall order, with the approval of the President of the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"271\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">If the United States desire to contest the authority and right of the Court of Claims to confer certain powers upon the commissioner, they should have produced the order for his appointment. If this had been done, it would appear that the appointment had been made to ascertain facts and report them to the court, leaving either party the right to dispute or controvert those facts, and so have them retried by thecpurt as if no such report had been made. Besides, it appeared in several cases that great injustice would be done both to the Government and claimants by trying each of these causes separately,, for each claimant would prove his whole case and be entitled to recover the full value of all so proved; while the fact was apparent to the court that, through inevitable losses, releases, and great frauds and embezzlements, th\u00e9 funds in the Treasury were insufficient to pay all in full. They did, therefore, what this court expressly sanctioned in the <em>Slgoe </em>Case. They marshaled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>different funds, and made tbe different and respective claimants come in and make their claim upon those funds, leaving tbe United ,States to resist any claim, and each of the claimants to contest that of any other to participate in these funds. The United State's, has gained largely in this way.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"272\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-5\"><em>Mr. </em>P. <em>Phillips </em>for Maybin\u2019s assignee in bankruptcy:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"273\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">The motion made to substitute A. F. Gardner, assignee in bankruptcy of R. G. Johnson, as appellee is met with the suggestion of opposing counsel that the case falls within the 5057th section Revised Statutes, which provides a limitation of two&gt; years for suits between an assignee and a person claiming an adverse interest. It needs no argument to show that this has no application to the present motion. In the first place, this is not a suit commenced by the assi gnee, but the continuance of a proceeding already in existence. Again, the application is not to assert \u201cadverse interest,\u201d but to represent by the proper party the bankrupt\u2019s own interest, which by operation of law is vested in his assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"274\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">We now proceed to the in quiry whether the judgment rendered in favor of the claimant is erroneous. In other words, whether the facts found by the court justify the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"275\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-8\">The facts found are conclusive of the case, without it can be maintained that the court was not authorized to find a fact without \u201c direct proof.\u201d The court had its judgment satisfied from all the circumstances of the case, though they say this was \u201c without direct proof.\u201d Does the insertion of these words destroy the validity of their finding ? The conscience of the court acting as a jury must be guided by satisfactory evidence. This is sometimes termed sufficient evidence, that is, the amount of proof which ordinarily satisfies an unprejudiced miud beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstances which will amount to this degree of proof can never be previously defined. The only legal test of which they are susceptible is their sufficiency to satisfy the mind and conscience of a common man, and so to convince him that he would venture to act upon that conviction in matters of the highest concern to his own interest. In trials of fact the <em>factum pr\u00f3bandum </em>is either directly attested by those who speak from personal knowledge, or is to be inferred from other facts satisfactorily proved. The facts proved are in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>eases directly attested. In the former case the proof applies immediately to <em>the-facttim probandum, </em>without any intervening-process, and is therefore called direct or positive testimony. In the latter case, as the proof applies immediately to collateral facts supposed to have a connection near or remote with the fact in controversy, it is termed circumstantial, and sometimes, but not with entire accuracy, presumptive. (1 Greenleaf Ev.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"276\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-5\">We are not now dealing with the question respecting the competency or admissibility of evidence. This is entirely distinct from the question of sufficiency or effect. The former belongs to the court exclusively; the latter as exclusively to the jury. As the jury in this case has found the fact, their verdict is conclusive, though it is stated it was found \u201c without direct evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"277\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-6\">An objection has been much urged against what has been stigmatized as the \u201cmachinery\u201d used by the court to aid its determination of the controversy arising out of the many claimants to this fund, and much criticism has been made on the statement by the court that \u201c the title of the claimants and their right to the proceeds have been determined upon evidence irrespective of the commissioner\u2019s report whenever requested so to do by either the claimant or defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"278\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-7\">We must apply the ordinary rules which govern in the trial of cases in all other courts. The Government is represented fully in the Court of Claims. The commissioner was employed to collate the evidence and to make report. He did so by reporting the facts as shown by the evidence. Now, if the facts as reported by him were not justified by the evidence, this constituted a just ground of - exception to the confirmation of the report, and it was the duty of the Government to make it. If the report is justified by the evidence, there is no ground to object that the truth cannot be acted on because a commissioner was authorized to ascertain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"279\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-8\">The right to appoint this aid to the court is one which has been used time out of mind. It is said to sustain the objection that the representative of the Government could not by silence or consent give the court jurisdiction. Grant this, and yet we do not see its application. If a claimant below should offer secondary evidence of a fact, and the Attorney-General should agree that the court should receive it, we do not suppose that this could here be assigned for error on the ground that con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sent could not confer jurisdiction, nor indeed on any other ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"280\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-5\">In conclusion, we may say that the law, in allowing\u2019 the Court of Claims finally to pass upon the facts of a case, places the interest of the Government in no jeopardy. This is a statutory court sitting under the eye of Congress, and the most reasonable objection to its creation was founded on the apprehension that in its decisions it would be strongly influenced by the power that created it, and on which it depended for its existence. Whether this apprehension was well founded or not, certain it is that there is no interest or influence exerted on the court in behalf of claimants. For ourselves, we believe that the court has held the scales of justice with a steady hand, and that it will continue to increase the confidence which it has already inspired.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"281\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\"> See the foot-note to <em>Hose\u2019s Case </em>(ante) for the distinction between this conclusion of fact and a presumption of law drawn from the same circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b516-6\">Mr. Chief-Justice Waite</author>\n<p id=\"ALmm\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The facts in these cases, as shown by the records and the findings of the Court of Claims, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">During the years 1863,1864, and 1865 large quantities of cotton were captured by the military forces of the United States and taken from the owners in the State of Mississippi. The identity of the several parcels so captured was destroyed, and the property of each owner could not be traced. A very large quantity was used by the Army of the United States for defensive purposes in the vicinity of Vicksburgh. Much of it was stolen, destroyed, or otherwise lost. \u2022 After the surrender of Yicksburgh, such as could be found and saved was collected at that place and at Natchez, and afterwards intermingled and stored in a common mass. Subsequently it was sent forward and sold by the Treasury agents in the same intermingled condition. The proceeds were paid into the Treasury as a common fund produced from the sale of this common mass of unidentified cotton, shipped and received under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The Court of Claims found as a fact that the cotton of each of these several plaintiffs contributed to and formed part of this mass so intermingled and sold. This finding was not based upon evidence specifically tracing the property of each claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ant, but upon the assumption that, under the circumstanees attending\u2019 these collections, all cotton started from the place of capture, on the way to Vicksburgh or Natchez, in a manner that would naturally carry it into the mass, must be presumed to have gone there, unless it was shown to have been lost or shipped to some other point.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The court upon this finding ascertained the amount of the fund remaining in the Treasury, after deducting- payments theretofore made to other claimants; the number of bales sold to create the fund for which payment had not already been made, and the number of bales contributed by each of these plaintiffs to the common mass. It then gave j udgment in favor of the plaintiff in each case for a sum which bore the same proportion to the whole fund still on hand that the number of his bales did to the whole number then represented by the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">From these judgments the United States have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It is difficult to see how the United States can complain of the judgments that have been rendered in these cases upon the facts as found. The aggregate of the whole is no more than the amount of money in the Treasury to the credit of the fund, and which, as we have often decided, is a trust for the benefit of such as should establish their claim to it under the provisions of the <em>Abandoned and captured property Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Each contributor to a common fund becomes interested in the fund in proportion to his contribution. Each owner of property intermingled with other property of the same kind and value, and stored in a common mass, becomes the owner as tenant in common of an interest in the mass proportionate to his contribution. If loss occurs while the common ownership continues, each owner must sustain his proportionate share.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Here the property of different owners was intermingled in a common mass. There was, therefore, an ownership in common. The Court of Claims ascertaining that there was likely to be a deficiency in the fund, very properly brought all the several claimants together and conducted the suits in such a manner as to compel them to litigate with each other. The judgments rendered represent the resfilt of this litigation. The several claimants are satisfied. The time has elapsed within which new claims can be presented against the fund, and, so. far as we can discover, substantial justice has been done. The United States have only been made liable for cotton the proceeds of which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>been clearly traced into the Treasury, and these judgments discharge them from further responsibility on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">A portion of the cotton was, after its capture, used for military purposes, but the United States are now charged only with that which was afterward sold under the provisions of the <em>Abandoned and captured property Act, </em>the proceeds being in the Treasury, and constituting the fund now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The Court of Claims cannot delegate its judicial powers. It must itself hear and determine all causes which come before it for adjudication, but we see no reason why it may not use such machinery as courts of more general jurisdiction are accustomed to employ, under similar circumstances, to aid in their investigations. In these cases complicated accounts and complicated facts were to be passed upon. The court referred them to a special commissioner to state the accounts, marshal the assets, and adjust the losses, \u201cso that equal and exact justice should be done to all.\u201d The report of the commissioner, when made, was considered by the court, and, after due deliberation, approved. The court determined the title of the several claimants and their rights to the proceeds upon evidence irrespective of the commissioner\u2019s report, whenever requested to do so by the claimant or the defendants. We see no error in this. The judgments rendered are the result of the deliberation of the court, and not that of the commissioner alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The judgment in each of the cases is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
