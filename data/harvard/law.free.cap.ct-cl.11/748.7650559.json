The claimant submits his invention.for a self-canceling stamp. About the same time the Chief of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing devises a somewhat similar stamp, and offers it gratuitously to the Government. It is adopted and largely used. Both the claimant and the chief of the bureau apply for letters-patent. The claimant is declared to be the original and true inventor, and a patent is issued to him and refused to the other. The claimanibrings his suitin this court on the implied'contract arising from the advertisement of the Commissioner, the submission of his design by the claimant, and the adoption and use thereof by the Government. This court re-examines the question of originality. The /invention of the claimant is for an adhesive stamp perforated and underlaid with tissue or bibulous paper ; the invention of the chief is for a perforated stamp underlaid with any paper of less tenacity, such as rice-paper. The stamp used by the Government is not underlaid with </em>bibulous, <em>but with calendered paper.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>I.

But it was not shown that any comparison was made of the device of the petitioner with other devices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b760-6\">In 1864-\u201965, Spencer M. Oiark invented a revenue-stamp, composed of two pieces of paper, one thicker th.an the other, and perforated, and the perforation covered with the thinner paper. And in his experiments therewith at his house he experimented with different kinds of thin paper to be used in covering the perforation, such as tissue-paper, India proof-paper, rice-paper, and other thin papers, some bibulous and some not, and wafers. And he continued these experiments till February, 1868, when he filed the caveat a copy of which is annexed. After that, the said Clark continued his experiments at the Currency Bureau, using various kinds of thin paper to cover the perforation of the thicker paper, until July, 1868, when, for the paid whisky-stamp hereinafter referred to, he adopted, as a cover for the perforation, Belgium paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b760-7\">After the enactment of the statute of July, 1868, chapter 186, conferences were had between the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in relation to stamps to be employed under said act, and among others in relation to the tax-paid spirit-stamp. And the said S. M. Clark, then having charge of the Rote-Printing Bureau of the Treasury Department, printed and submitted to said committee and Commissioner the revenue-stamp invented by him, which was approved and adopted by said committee and Commissioner, and was subsequently used by the defendants as the tax-paid spirit-stamp from September 15,1868, to Eovember, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b760-8\">All the tax-paid spirit-stamps employed by the United States were made in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, formerly called the Currency Bureau, of which said Clark was chief from 1861 to March, 1869, and he expressly waived all compensation for the use of his invention by the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b760-9\">All the tax-paid spirit-stamps employed by the United States were made of bank-note paper and Belgium paper, which is made partly of linen and partly of cotton stock, and had some sizing in it, and is calendered. It is less absorbent than tissue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>paper, less liable to shrinkage when wet, and can be written on with a pen, while tissue-paper cannot be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-4\">The tax-paid spirit-stamp employed by the United States was of value to the United States; by its means the revenue was more efficiently collected, and the removal and reuse of the stamps was rendered difficult, though not impossible. From 15th September, 1868, to 1st November, 1871, 4,451,400 stamps were used by the defendants, and their use was finally abandoned because of the increase of cost in cutting the hole in or perforating the stamp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-5\">Upon the application of said petitioner for a patent, August 10, 1868, it was considered in the Patent-Office that the application of the petitioner and said Clark and others interfered, and a hearing was ordered and had, and the Commissioner decided in favor of said Clark. And an appeal from said decision was taken by the petitioner to the supreme court of the District of Columbia, and on said appeal letters-patent were awarded to the petitioner, and were granted to him April 5, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-6\">No. 101604.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-7\">The United States of America to all to whom these letters-patent shall come:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-8\">Whereas Addison C.

Fletcher, of the city, county, and State of New York, have invented a new and useful improvement in adhesive stamps applicable for postal, internal-revenue, and other purposes, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description, reference being had to the accompanying drawing forming part of this specification, in which\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-16\">Figure 1 represents a face-view of a series of adhesive stamps made in accordance with my improvement, and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-17\">Figure 2, a section of the same, taken as indicated by the line <em>x x </em>in Fig. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-18\">Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-19\">My improvement in postage, internal-revenue, and other adhesive stamps involves or includes a new method of canceling them, whereby in any attempt to remove them from the documents or surfaces to which they have been applied, they are so effectually mutilated and destroyed as to make it an impossibility to use them a second time without a detection of the fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-20\">My invention consists in constructing the stamps with a hole or holes through the body of them, and covering or backing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the same with thin tissue or other bibulous paper, made to firmly adhere to the stamp, and the rear surface of the stamp, with its bibulous-paper covering to the hole coated or backed with mucilage or other adhesive substance, while the front surface or face of the stamp, together with the bibulous paper seen through the opening therein, has any suitable figure or vignette printed thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-5\">Thus constructed, the stamp cannot be removed from the surface to which it has been stuck without the destruction or tearing of the tissue or bibulous portion of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-6\">The following further description, referring to the accompanying drawing, will suffice to explain how this, my invention, is or may be carried out:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-7\">Thus, I take a sheet of stamps, A, and punch through the body-portions of each stamp one or more perforations, <em>a, </em>after which the backs of the stamps are covered by a sheet of tissue or any thin bibulous paper, B, firmly cemented thereto by mucilage, or otherwise, so as to cover the holes <em>a </em>in the stamps, and subsequently, mucilage or other suitable adhesive substance applied to the exterior surface of the tissue-paper and backs of the stamps, to secure the adhesion of the stamps, by moistening them on their backs, or otherwise moistening the surfaces to which said stamps are designed to be applied. The stamps A have any suitable vignette or figure engraved or printed on them, as also has the tissue or bibulous paper B, covering the perforations <em>a </em>in them. This printing on the two surfaces or portions A and B of the stamps may either be done separately and before applying the bibulous paper to the backs of the stamps, or it may be done after the bibulous paper has been secured thereto, the perforation <em>a </em>in the stamp admitting of such a general and simultaneous impression of the two surfaces or portions A and B.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-8\">When a stamp, as thus constructed, has been applied to a sheet of paper or other article or surface, it not simply becomes adherent thereon throughout or over its entire surface, but more especially or tenaciously so on that part of its surface or back covering the perforations <em>a </em>in the stamp, by reason of its thinner construction at that part, as produced by the tissue- or bibulous-paper covering to the perforations <em>a, </em>so that and by reason of the delicate and peculiar character or property of said paper, any attempt to remove said stamp without defacing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>it by first moistening it will be useless, for the bibulous paper covering the opening <em>a </em>will be so washed or torn, as that, in the endeavor to remove the stamp, it will have its design more or less destroyed or defaced, and thus prevent a second use of the stamp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-5\">What is here claimed, and desired to be secured by letters-patent, is\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-6\">An adhesive stamp, made up of a thick portion or body, A, having a perforation or perforations, <em>a, </em>through the face of it, and thinner portion, B, composed of tissue or any suitable bibulous paper, and applied as a covering to said perforation or perforations, both portions being securely connected or incorporated to make up the complete stamp, and the latter being suitably engraved or printed on its face and having adhesive material applied to its back, substantially as specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-7\">ADDISON 0.

Then I cover this hole on one side or the other of the paper with any preparation or paper which has less tenacity than the original sheet \u2014 either with rice-paper, tissue-paper, wafer, or any similar or suitable material \u2014 in such a manner that the area by which it is attached to the paper is less than the area which will be attached to the instrument, article, or envelope after the stamp is put to its proper use. I then print the stamp, a portion of the printing being necessarily on the material with which the hole is filled. When the stamp thus printed is attached for use, the portion fitting the hole cannot be removed for reuse by wetting, as it will adhere to the surface to which it is attached more than it does to the surface of the stamp, and the stamp being soaked or peeled off will have a hole in the face, preventing reuse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-12\">S.

This device was tendered to and accepted by the Government long before claimant had procured or taken any steps to procure a patent. This invention or device thus tendered was accepted and adopted by an officer who had authority to bind the Government by contract for that purpose. (See Act of Congress, June 30,1864; 2 Brightley\u2019s Dig., 289; Act March 3,1865, \u00a7 174; Act July 20, 1868, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 25, 26, 103,157.) These considerations distinguish this case from <em>Pitchers (Jase, </em>1N. &amp; H., 37; <em>Node\u2019s Case, </em>1.0. Gis.

It is the person who actually performs the service, in whose favor the law raises the promise to pay. <em>(Lewis Trieleey, </em>20 Barbour, (N. Y.,) 387.) Even though the advertisement of December 24, 1867\u2019, did not amount to a request in this case, still if the defendant accepted and knowingly availed itself of services donefor it by the claimant without its authority or request, and continued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>use of claimant\u2019s device for two years and upward after notice of his ownership, the claimaint would be entitled to reasonable compensation, the law implying both a request and a promise to pay. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>7 Gr., (Me.,) 118; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>24 Me., 374; <em>Salomon\u2019s Case, </em>supra; <em>Lin\u00fcsley\u2019s Case, </em>4 C.

Clark were original inventors of the same mechanical contrivance in the form of a stamp. But their several inventions were distinct things, for they had different origins, and grew to their completion under different experiments and circumstances, and had different ownerships, for each invention was the property in possession of its inventor, who could use it himself and contract in relation to its use, till a patent was issued vesting exclusive rights in the patentee; and we think it clear on the facts stated that the paid whisky-stamp used by the Government was the invention and property of Clark, for which,, in September, 1868, no patent existed, and which he was free to deal with at his pleasure, and which then, by express agreement with the officers of the Interior Department, he licensed the United States to use without cost; and as all the use of the Government was under this express contract with Clark for his invention, it was not under the implied contract with the petitioner, which he founds on the advertisement for a design and his submission of one and the use of it by the United States. On this part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>tbe case, which excludes all reference to a patent and its effects, we think an implied contract at the common law is not made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The'second point of the learned counsel for the petitioner is thus stated in their brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201c The invention was the property of the plaintiff, as well before as after he had received his patent, and the Government had no more right to use his invention without compensation than any private individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">But the petitioner had no exclusive rights in his invention till he had obtained his patent; and if any rights accruing to him by that have been infringed, the remedy is not within our jurisdiction. 1</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
