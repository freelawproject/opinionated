The parcels had been zoned agricultural for decades prior to the GMA. The landowners, however, had not farmed the land for many years. The proper definition of the statutory term of art \u201cagricultural lands\u201d pits the Legislature\u2019s stated goal of maintaining and enhancing agricultural lands near urban areas against encroaching urbanization.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Because we do not believe the landowners\u2019 current or intended use of the land is conclusive under the GMA\u2019s definition of \u201cagricultural lands,\u201d and given the significance afforded preservation of agricultural lands under the GMA and the nature of the land use planning process the GMA envisions, we overrule the Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board\u2019s (the Board) interpretation of the definition of \u201cagricultural lands.\u201d However, because the City failed to have a transfer or purchase of development rights (TDR) program in place when it designated the subject \u201cagricultural lands\u201d under the GMA, the City\u2019s designation of the parcels as agricultural fails. We remand the case to the Board for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">1. Is the owner\u2019s current or intended use of land a conclusive factor in determining if property is \u201cagricultural land\u201d under RCW 36.70A.030(2), which requires the property be \u201cprimarily devoted\u201d to commercial agricultural use and have \u201clong-term significance for agricultural production\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">2. As the subject parcels in this case are within the City\u2019s UGA, and RCW 36.70A.060(4) requires the City to enact \u201ca program authorizing transfer or purchase of development rights\u201d in order to designate lands within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>UGA as agricultural, did the City satisfy the statutory requirement?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The City, a suburban city located in the Sammamish Valley between Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish, has grown rapidly in recent decades and is Washington\u2019s 14th largest city. The Sammamish Valley is an area of great beauty. The Sammamish River meanders through the Valley, the soils of which are lush and fertile, and denominated \u201cprime agricultural soils\u201d by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. King County\u2019s agricultural lands preservation effort in the 1970s resulted in the purchase of development rights in significant portions of the Valley\u2019s acreage. Urban growth, however, has encroached upon the Valley and the agricultural activities within it. At present, approximately 47 percent of the Valley is in urban/commercial use, 33 percent is agricultural, and about 20 percent of the land lies fallow.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Growth Management Act of 1990 was designed to address many questions, such as the ones this case involves. As required by the GMA, the City issued its comprehensive plan on July 18, 1995. In its plan, the City designated the portion of the Sammamish Valley within City limits as agricultural land. This designation encompassed a 32-acre parcel owned by the Benaroya Shareholders Trust (Benaroya), and another 20-acre parcel owned by the Universal Holdings Ltd. Partnership II and Cosmos Development and Administration Corporation (collectively, Cosmos).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Benaroya and Cosmos did not like the agricultural designation because both had purchased their land expect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ing to develop it for more intensive (and potentially more lucrative) uses. Benaroya acquired its land in 1969. At the time of acquisition, the land had been zoned agricultural for two years. It has been zoned agricultural ever since. Benaroya acquired this agricultural land \u201cwith the intention of developing it for industrial use.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The prior history of the Cosmos parcel is not set forth in the record. The Board noted \u201cthere is no mention in the record regarding the subject of whether the Cosmos property is presently or has been devoted to commercial agricultural production.\u201d Final Determination &amp; Order at 1759. Cosmos acquired its 74 acres for a master-planned mixed-use development. The City designated the 20 acres of Cosmos\u2019s 74 acres lying in the Sammamish Valley floor as agricultural.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Both landowners petitioned the Board for review of the City\u2019s designation, and the Board consolidated the two petitions. Benaroya\u2019s petition related solely to the agricultural designation. Cosmos\u2019s petition related both to the agricultural designation and to a housing density designation that depended on the agricultural designation. Both also argued the City\u2019s designation was improper because the City did not have a TDR program in place at the time of the designation, as required by RCW 36.70A.060(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The Board found for Benaroya and Cosmos, holding the City\u2019s agricultural designation was not in compliance with the GMA because the properties had not been primarily devoted to commercial agricultural production, finding the owners\u2019 current or intended use to be conclusive. It also held the City was without authority to designate agricultural land within its UGA because it did not have a program in place for transfer or purchase of development rights. With respect to Cosmos\u2019s housing density issue, the Board held the Cosmos development would fall below the four dwelling unit per acre density required by the Board for urban development. The Board remanded the agricultural designations to the City with instructions to redesig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>nate the land \u201cconsistent with the Act,\u201d and with instructions for the City to \u201cbring the average net density of the [Cosmos] property within urban densities.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The City appealed to the superior court under RCW 36.70A.300(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without discussion, the superior court entered a judgment affirming the Board\u2019s decision on November 1, 1996. The City then appealed to the Court of Appeals, Division One, which certified the case to us. We accepted certification. RCW 2.06.030; RAP 4.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">RCW 36.70A.295(1) provides for judicial review of Board decisions in superior court. Appeals from final decisions of the superior court proceed as all other civil appeals. RCW 36.70A.295(3). We apply the standards of RCW 34.05 directly to the record before the agency, sitting in the same position as the superior court. <em>Tapper v. Employment Security Dep\u2019t, </em>122 Wn.2d 397, 402, 858 P.2d 494 (1993). Under the judicial review statute of the Administrative Procedure Act, the \u201cburden of demonstrating the invalidity of agency action is on the party asserting invalidity.\u201d RCW 34.05.570(1)(a). Thus, the burden was on the City. Because the City asserts the invalidity of an agency order resulting from an adjudicative proceeding, RCW 34.05.570(3) applies. That subsection sets forth nine standards for granting relief from the Board\u2019s decision, of which the City asserts three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">(d) The agency has erroneously interpreted or applied the law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">(e) The order is not supported by evidence that is substantial when viewed in light of the whole record before the court, which includes the agency record for judicial review, supplemented by any additional evidence received by the court under this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>(1) The order is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In reviewing agency findings under RCW 34.05.570(3)(e), substantial evidence is \u201ca sufficient quantity of evidence to persuade a fair-minded person of the truth or correctness of the order.\u201d <em>Callecod v. State Patrol, </em>84 Wn. App. 663, 673, 929 P.2d 510, <em>review denied, </em>132 Wn.2d 1004, 939 P.2d 215 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">With respect to issues of law under RCW 34.05.570(3)(d), we essentially review such questions de novo. We accord deference to an agency interpretation of the law where the agency has specialized expertise in dealing with such issues, but we are not bound by an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. As we stated in <em>Overton v. State Econ. Assistance Auth., </em>96 Wn.2d 552, 555, 637 P.2d 652 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">Where an administrative agency is charged with administering a special field of law and endowed with quasi-judicial functions because of its expertise in that field, the agency\u2019s construction of statutory wurds and phrases and legislative intent should he accorded substantial weight when undergoing judicial review. . . . We also recognize the countervailing principle that it is ultimately for the court to determine the purpose and meaning of statutes, even when the court\u2019s interpretation is contrary to that of the agency charged with carrying out the law</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u201cConcerning conclusions of state law this court is the final arbiter, and conclusions of state law entered by an administrative agency or court below are not binding on this court.\u201d <em>Leschi Improvement Council v. State Highway Comm\u2019n, </em>84 Wn.2d 271, 286, 525 P.2d 774, 804 P.2d 1 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Finally, as to \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d agency action for purposes of RCW 34.05.570(3)(i), we mean \u201c \u2018willful and unreasoning action, taken without regard to or consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the action. Where there is room for two opinions, an action taken after due consideration is not arbitrary and capricious even though a reviewing court may believe it to be erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kendall v. Douglas, Grant, Lincoln &amp; Okanogan Counties Pub. Hosp. Dist. No. 6, </em>118 Wn.2d 1, 14, 820 P.2d 497 (1991) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>Abbenhaus v. City of Yakima, </em>89 Wn.2d 855, 858, 576 P.2d 888 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">A. GMA Policy on Agricultural Land</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In seeking to address the problem of growth management in our state, the Legislature paid particular attention to agricultural lands. One of the 13 planning goals of the GMA addresses natural resource industries: \u201cMaintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive timber, agricultural, and fisheries industries. Encourage the conservation of productive forest lands and productive agricultural lands, and discourage incompatible uses.\u201d RCW 36.70A.020(8). The purpose is to \u201cassure the conservation\u201d of these lands. RCW 36.70A.060(1). A more recent indication of the Legislature\u2019s concern for preserving agricultural lands is a new section the Legislature added in its 1997 amendments to the GMA, RCW 36.70A.177, which urges employment of \u201cinnovative zoning techniques\u201d to conserve agricultural lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The GMA set aside special land it refers to as \u201cnatural resource lands,\u201d which include agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands. \u201cNatural resource lands are protected not for the sake of their ecological role but to ensure the viability of the resource-based industries that depend on them. Allowing conversion of resource lands to other uses or allowing incompatible uses nearby impairs the viability of the resource industry.\u201d Richard L. Settle &amp; Charles G. Gavigan, <em>The Growth Management Revolution in Washington: Past, Present, and Future, </em>16 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 867, 907 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The significance of agricultural land preservation in the GMA can be seen in the very timing of key actions mandated in the statute. RCW 36.70A.170(1)(a) requires designation of agricultural lands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>(1) On or before September 1, 1991, each county, and each city, shall designate where appropriate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">(a) Agricultural lands that are not already characterized by urban growth[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and that have long-term significance for the commercial production of food or other agricultural products!!]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Thus, GMA required municipalities to designate agricultural lands for preservation even <em>before </em>those municipalities were obliged to declare their UGAs and adopt comprehensive plans in compliance with GMA. The \u201cdesignation and interim protection of such areas [are] the first formal step in growth management implementation ... to preclude urban growth area status for areas unsuited to urban development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also, requiring designation of natural resource lands at the outset of the GMA planning process prevents the irreversible loss of those lands to development and preserves land management options until completion of the comprehensive planning process. Gary Pivo, <em>Is the Growth Management Act Working? A Survey of Resource Lands and Critical Areas Development Regulations, </em>16 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 1141, 1145 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>B. Definition of \u201cAgricultural Lands\u201d Under GMA</p>\n<p id=\"Ass\">In accordance with the GMA mandate, the City\u2019s comprehensive plan designated the Benaroya parcel and the portion of the Cosmos parcel on the Sammamish Valley floor as agricultural lands. GMA defines \u201cagricultural lands\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">land primarily devoted to the commercial production of horticultural, viticultural, floricultural, dairy, apiary, vegetable, or animal products or of berries, grain, hay, straw, turf, seed, Christmas trees not subject to the excise tax imposed by RCW 84.33.100 through 84.33.140, finfish in upland hatcheries, or livestock, and that has long-term commercial significance for agricultural production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">RCW 36.70A.030(2). \u201cLong-term commercial significance\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">includes the growing capacity, productivity, and soil composition of the land for long-term commercial production, in consideration with the land\u2019s proximity to population areas, and the possibility of more intense uses of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">RCW 36.70A.030(10). At issue in this case is the definition of \u201cagricultural land.\u201d Benaroya and Cosmos argue the phrase \u201cprimarily devoted to\u201d means in actual commercial production, and because their land has lain fallow for many years it cannot fit within the statutory definition. The City argues the phrase \u201cprimarily devoted to\u201d means set apart for a specific purpose or use. The Board agreed with Benaroya and Cosmos.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The proper definition is purely a question of law, and the Court reviews it de novo under the \u201cerror of law\u201d standard of RCW 34.05.570(3)(d). The Board held that in order for land to be designated as agricultural, it must be in actual agricultural use at the time of designation. Having found the Benaroya property to have lain fallow for 25 years, the Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">The record shows that the Benaroya property has not been primarily devoted to commercial agricultural production for many years. <em>See </em>Finding of Fact No. 7. Although these lands are not already characterized by urban growth, in order to be designated as agricultural lands under the GMA, they must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>both be primarily devoted to agricultural uses <em>and </em>have long-term significance for the commercial production of food or other agricultural products. The record does not reveal either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Clerk\u2019s Papers at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Board based this conclusion on a statement it had made in an earlier case concerning the proper definition of \u201cforest land.\u201d In that case, land owners petitioned the Board after Snohomish County had designated their land as forest land under the GMA. They argued their land was not productive forest land because they had no intention to use it as such. They wanted to develop it. In its decision in that case, the Board contrasted the statutory definition of forest lands with the statutory definition of agricultural lands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">While RCW 36.70A.030(8) defines forest land as \u201cland primarily useful for growing trees,\u201d RCW 36.70A.030(2) defines agricultural land as \u201cland primarily devoted to the commercial production of horticultural. . . products.\u201d The latter terminology includes the landowner\u2019s intent: if the land is not currently being utilized for the commercial production of agricultural products, it cannot be designated agricultural land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\"><em>Twin Falls, Inc. v. Snohomish </em>County, 1993 WL 839715, *22 (Wash. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hrgs. Bd., Sept. 7, 1993). The Board relied on this statement of the definition of agricultural lands in the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the definition of agricultural land was not before the Board in the <em>Twin Falls </em>case; the Board engaged in no analysis, statutory or otherwise, in concluding the statutory definition of agricultural land includes the landowner\u2019s intent. Nor did the Board in this case engage in any analysis; instead, it simply relied on its conclusory dictum in <em>Twin Falls.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The Board believes, and Benaroya and Cosmos argue, the legislative reaction to the <em>Twin Falls </em>decision supports its position: the Legislature changed the definition of \u201cforest land\u201d from \u201cprimarily useful for growing trees\u201d to \u201cprimarily devoted to growing trees.\u201d Laws of 1994, ch. 307, \u00a7 2(8). The Legislature indicated the purpose of this change was \u201cto clarify legislative intent regarding the designation of forest lands.\u201d Laws of 1994, ch. 307, \u00a7 1. Benaroya and Cosmos assert that by adopting the \u201cdevoted to\u201d language from the definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d and applying it to the definition of \u201cforest land,\u201d the Legislature acquiesced in the Board\u2019s interpretation, reading landowner intent into the definition. Br. of Resp\u2019ts at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Even assuming the Legislature was reacting to the <em>Twin Falls </em>decision\u2014nothing in the legislative history or record on appeal establishes it was\u2014the new definition of \u201cforest land\u201d falls short of establishing current use of the land or landowner intent as a criterion for designation of \u201cforest land.\u201d Benaroya and Cosmos fail to point out the amended definition includes four factors to be considered in designating \u201cforest land,\u201d no one of which relates to current use or landowner intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">In determining whether forest land is primarily devoted to growing trees for long-term commercial timber production on land that can be economically and practically managed for such production, the following factors shall be considered: (a) The proximity of the land to urban, suburban, and rural settlements; (b) surrounding parcel size and the compatibility and intensity of adjacent and nearby land uses; (c) long-term local economic conditions that affect the ability t\u00f3 manage for timber production; and (d) the availability of public facilities and services conducive to conversion of forest land to other uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">RCW 36.70A.030(8). Contrary to the Board\u2019s conclusion and Benaroya and Cosmos\u2019s assertions, the Legislature\u2019s <em>exclusion </em>of current use or landowner intent from this new list of factors is a strong argument for the proposition the Legislature <em>rejected Twin Falls\u2019 </em>conclusion that the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cdevoted to\u201d encompasses current use or landowner intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Aside from what may or may not be inferred from the Legislature\u2019s change in the definition of \u201cforest land,\u201d there are compelling reasons against concluding the Legislature intended current use or landowner intent to control the designation of natural resource lands under the GMA. First, if current use were a criterion, GMA comprehensive plans would not be plans at all, but mere inventories of current land use. The GMA goal of maintaining and enhancing natural resource lands would have no force; it would be subordinate to each individual landowner\u2019s current use of the land.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Legislature intended the land use planning process of GMA to be area-wide in scope when it required development of specific plans for natural resource lands and, later, comprehensive plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Second, if landowner intent were the controlling factor, local jurisdictions would be powerless to preserve natural resource lands. Presumably, in the case of agricultural land, it will always be financially more lucrative to develop such land for uses more intense than agriculture. Although some owners of agricultural land may wish to preserve it as such for personal reasons, most, like Benaroya and Cosmos, will seek to develop their land to maximize their return. If the designation of such land as agricultural depends on the intent of the landowner as to how he or she wishes to use it, the GMA is powerless to prevent the loss of natural resource land. All a land speculator would have to do is buy agricultural land, take it out of production, and ask the controlling jurisdiction to amend its comprehensive plan to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>remove the \u201cagricultural land\u201d designation. Under the Board\u2019s interpretation, the controlling jurisdiction would have no choice but to do so, because the land is no longer being used for agricultural purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">A cardinal rule of statutory construction is to give effect to legislative intent. <em>Timberline Air Serv., Inc. v. Bell Helicopter-Textron, Inc., </em>125 Wn.2d 305, 312, 884 P.2d 920 (1994). A stated legislative intent of the GMA is to maintain and enhance agricultural land. RCW 36.70A.020(8). One cannot credibly maintain that interpreting the definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d in a way that allows landowners to control its designation gives effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent to maintain, enhance, and conserve such land. Indeed, the Board\u2019s interpretation is likely to have exactly the opposite effect. We decline to interpret the GMA definition in a way that vitiates the stated intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We hold land is \u201cdevoted to\u201d agricultural use under RCW 36.70A.030 if it is in an area where the land is actually used or capable of being used for agricultural production. Indeed, support for this definition of \u201cdevoted to\u201d is found in dictionary treatment of the term. One of the primary meanings of \u201cdevote\u201d is to \u201cset apart or dedicate by a solemn or formal act.\u201d Random House Unabridged Dictionary 544 (2d ed. 1993). The land in this case was set apart for agricultural use by longstanding zoning. While the land use on the particular parcel and the owner\u2019s intended use for the land may be considered along with other factors in the determination of whether a parcel is in an area primarily devoted to commercial agricultural production, neither current use nor landowner intent of a particular parcel is conclusive for purposes of this element of the statutory definition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">With regard to the proper definition of \u201cagricultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>land,\u201d we note the Legislature specifically provided for two elements to the definition of \u201cagricultural lands\u201d under GMA. The Board\u2019s decision focused on the element of whether the land was \u201cprimarily devoted to\u201d agricultural purposes, and decided the petition solely on that element. Thus, it did not address the issue of \u201clong-term commercial significance for agricultural production.\u201d Under the statutory definition of this second element, the Board must evaluate growing capacity, productivity, and soil composition, proximity to population areas, and the possibility of more intense uses of the land in question before the area could be designated \u201cagricultural land.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In addition to the statutory factors enumerated in RCW 36.70A.030(10), in WAC 365-190-050, the State Department of Community Trade and Economic Development, the agency charged by RCW 36.70A.170(2) with providing guidelines cities must consult in designating natural resource lands, provides 10 factors for \u201cclassifying agricultural lands of long-term significance for the production of food or other agricultural products.\u201d WAC 365-190-050 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">(1) In classifying agricultural lands of long-term significance for the production of food or other agricultural products, counties and cities shall use the land-capability classification system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service as defined in Agriculture Handbook No. 210. These eight classes are incorporated by the United States Department of Agriculture into map units described in published soil surveys. These categories incorporate consideration of the growing capacity, productivity and soil composition of the land.

Transfer of Development Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\"> In adopting the definition of agricultural lands under GMA, the Legislature was also aware of the need for development within UGAs. For property like that at issue here, the Legislature balanced the need for urban growth within specified boundaries with agricultural land preservation. RCW 36.70A.060(4) contains the following legislative imperative: \u201cForest land and agricultural land located within urban growth areas shall not be designated by a county or city as forest land or agricultural land of long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170 unless the city or county has enacted a program authorizing transfer or purchase of development rights.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board found the City had not enacted such a program at the time it made the agricultural designation of the Benaroya and Cosmos land, and thus held \u201cthe City was without authority to make any agricultural lands designations within a UGA prior to its enactment of a program authorizing a transfer or purchase of development rights pursuant to RCW 36.70A.060(4).\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 19. The City assigned error to this holding, but offers no specific argument as to what is defective about it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The obvious purpose of the statute, which requires the City to establish a program for the transfer or purchase development rights if the land is within the UGA, is to provide reimbursement to the owners of land when the uses of the land become frozen at a low level of intensity as a result of the City\u2019s designation. Here, the City made the agricultural designation without having a TDR program in effect, as the statute requires. As a result, the Board properly invalidated the designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>In summary, we uphold the Board\u2019s invalidation of the designation of the subject properties as agricultural because of the City\u2019s failure to enact a TDR program prior to the designation. RCW 36.70A.060(4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">As a final issue in the case, Cosmos contends the improper designation of 20 acres of its 74 acre parcel as \u201cagricultural\u201d renders the City\u2019s calculation of housing density for its entire project erroneous, affecting whether or not the project is consistent with GMA-mandated urban densities. Both sides agree the density determination will abide a final decision on the designation of the subject land. Because we do not know the effect of the City\u2019s designation of the 20 acres of the Cosmos property as \u201curban recreation,\u201d we remand this issue to the Board for further consideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">This is not a case where a local jurisdiction has capriciously slammed the door in the face of hapless developers by arbitrarily designating obviously urban land as agricultural. Neither Benaroya nor Cosmos suggest as much. Both knew the land was zoned agricultural at the time they bought it. Both hoped that at some future time, the City would agree to upzone the land for more intensive development. In the normal course, as economic conditions changed with the growth of the City, they might have reaped the rewards of developing their land. But the GMA changed the normal course. The GMA sought to control and regulate growth, and specifically emphasized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>protection of natural resource lands, including agricultural land. The Legislature hoped to preserve agricultural land near our urban centers so that freshly grown food would be readily available to urban residents and the next generation could see food production and be disabused of the notion that food grows on supermarket shelves.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In light of a study that the soils of the Sammamish Valley displayed excellent suitability for agriculture, the City simply designated as \u201cagricultural land\u201d under the GMA land within its boundaries that was both currently zoned agricultural and suitable by soil type for agricultural uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The Board\u2019s interpretation of the GMA definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d is wrong. Allowing current use or landowner intent to control the definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d would frustrate the stated purpose of the GMA to maintain and enhance natural resource lands. If the Legislature wanted current use or landowner intent to control, it would have said so explicitly. It has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">However, for agricultural lands within UGAs where more intensive growth was envisioned and encouraged, the GMA required some effort at compensation to owners for agricultural land preservation. Because the City did not have a TDR program in place when the designations were made, RCW 36.70A.060(4) invalidates the City\u2019s designation of the subject properties as agricultural lands. We remand this case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Durham, C.J., and Dolliver, Smith, Guy, Johnson, and Alexander, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Madsen, J, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The concurrence asserts the City engaged \u201cin a massive downzone while limiting land not actually used for agriculture to an agricultural use, or no use at all.\u201d Concurrence at 59. This is erroneous. Nobody has alleged, and the Board has not found, that the City\u2019s comprehensive plan does not accommodate its GMA-mandated share of growth.

The subject property was zoned agricultural for more than 30 years and no party nor the Board itself has indicated the agricultural designation was pretextual.

The record does not show Benaroya ever communicated an intent to the City to use the land for other purposes prior to the initiation of the present action. Indeed, in the absence of the GMA, in order for Benaroya to develop its agricultural land for industrial use, it would have to persuade the Redmond City Council to upzone the land from agricultural to the appropriate industrial designation. This would likely prove to be a frustrating endeavor. Benaroya certainly cannot claim any vested right to develop the land for any use other than agricultural. Thus, rather than hindering Benaroya\u2019s development of its land, the GMA\u2019s ambiguous definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d provides a potential avenue for upzoning that might not have been otherwise available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The concurrence asserts the majority opinion\u2019s definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d is dictum because we have decided the case on other grounds.

Benaroya and Cosmos likewise assert, also without reference to the record, \u201cThe City has since designated all of the former \u2018agriculture\u2019 lands \u2018Urban Recreation,\u2019 thus presumably making them unavailable for transfer of development rights.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019ts at 44 n.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">If the City has designated the properties \u201curban recreational,\u201d we note the Board found only that the City was required \u201cto designate said parcels for an urban non-agricultural land use\u201d and was not obliged to acquire the lands if it desired to set them aside for open space, in the event the agricultural designation was erroneous. Final Determination &amp; Order at 1760. Neither Benaroya nor Cosmos assigned error to this aspect of the Board\u2019s decision and it is a verity for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Moreover, this opinion does not foreclose the City from employing any procedures that may be available to it to seek a rehearing as to the agricultural designation of the subject lands once a TDR program is in place. <em>See, e.g., </em>RCW 36.70A.215 (review and evaluation of comprehensive plan).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b96-9\">Sanders, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2o\">(concurring) \u2014 I also agree with the decision of the Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board (GMHB) which invalidated the agricultural designation of the subject properties due to the City of Redmond\u2019s failure to enact a transfer of development rights (TDR) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>program. However the majority\u2019s dicta corrupt the Legislature\u2019s definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d incorporated within the Growth Management Act (GMA), taking a giant step toward rendering this legislation unworkable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion effectively defeats the GMA by attributing a false purpose to reserve land within urban growth areas (UGAs), such as the land here, as open space, under an agricultural pretext. <em>See </em>Majority at 42. In-depth scholarly analysis of the Act discerns the intent of the GMA, and other similar acts, is to identify and separate urbanizable land from rural land and to designate areas (i.e., UGAs) as places where development is to be allowed and encouraged. Keith W. Dearborn &amp; Ann M. Gygi, <em>Planner\u2019s Panacea or Pandora\u2019s Box: A Realistic Assessment of the Role of Urban Growth Areas in Achieving Growth Management Goals, </em>16 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 975, 976-77 (1993). The legislative intent is to concentrate public and private investment within the designated urban areas. <em>Id. </em>at 1006. This intent is realized by allowing someone who owns land within an urban growth area, not actually and productively used for agriculture, to devote it to increased urban use. Such reduces urban sprawl by efficiently allowing for increased development within the UGA. <em>See </em>RCW 36.70A.020(1) (Urban growth) and (2) (Reduce sprawl).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">However in juxtaposition to the purposes of the GMA, Redmond did precisely the opposite: it curtailed the municipality\u2019s ability to accommodate urbanized growth by engaging in a massive downzone while limiting land not actually used for agriculture to an agricultural use, or no use at all.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>THE QUESTION OF DEVOTION</p>\n<p id=\"AjG\">Accordingly this agricultural zoning must be viewed in the context of the larger goal of the GMA to concentrate urban growth within urban growth boundaries. Given that our population must live somewhere, unchecked local efforts to discourage urban growth within urban areas defeat the GMA by making it unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Viewed in this light the Legislature has narrowly defined agricultural land:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201cAgricultural land\u201d means land primarily devoted to the commercial production of horticultural, viticultural, floricultural, dairy, apiary, vegetable, or animal products or of berries, grain, hay, straw, turf, seed, Christmas trees . . . finfish in upland hatcheries, or livestock, and that has long-term commercial significance for agricultural production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">RCW 36.70A.030(2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That is, \u201cagricultural land\u201d has two attributes: (1) land primarily <em>devoted </em>to commercial agricultural production; and (2) land that has <em>long-term commercial significance </em>for continued agricultural production. The majority writes \u201cland is \u2018devoted to\u2019 agricultural use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>under RCW 36.70A.030 if it is in an area where the land is actually used <em>or </em>capable of being used for agricultural production.\u201d Majority at 53 (emphasis added). Thus, according to the majority, it is possible that land upon which a crop has not grown for 25 years may nevertheless be land \u201cdevoted to\u201d agriculture. This conclusion is contrary to the plain meaning of the statutory text and leads to an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The starting point of all statutory construction must be the language of the statute itself. The meaning of the statute must be derived from the language if the language is unambiguous. <em>Harmon v. Department of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>134 Wn.2d 523, 530, 951 P.2d 770 (1998); <em>Freitag v. McGhie, </em>133 Wn.2d 816, 825-26, 947 P.2d 1186 (1997) (Sanders, J., dissenting). Words must be given their ordinary meaning. <em>Department of Revenue v. Hoppe, </em>82 Wn.2d 549, 552, 512 P.2d 1094 (1973). We are proscribed from making an absurd interpretation of a statute to reach a result, no matter how much the majority may desire to do so. <em>Cooper\u2019s Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Simmons, </em>94 Wn.2d 321, 326, 617 P.2d 415 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Furthermore, this court must give deference to the Growth Management Hearings Board\u2019s interpretation of the GMA. \u201cIt is well settled that deference is appropriate where an administrative agency\u2019s construction of statutes is within the agency\u2019s field of expertise.\u201d <em>Chrysler Motors Corp. v. Flowers, </em>116 Wn.2d 208, 216, 803 P.2d 314 (1991); <em>Green River Community College v. Higher Educ. Personnel Bd., </em>107 Wn.2d 427, 438, 730 P.2d 653 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">But the majority prefers an obscure dictionary definition of the word \u201cdevote\u201d (\u201cto \u2018set apart or dedicate by a solemn or formal act\u2019 \u201d) and applies it by claiming land which has lain fallow for 25 years is land nonetheless \u201cdevoted to\u201d agriculture. Majority at 53 (quoting Random House Unabridged Dictionary 544 (2d ed. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">While this definition, in the abstract, may be consistent with the word when used in other contexts, I am at a loss to think of a single common or literary usage of the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cdevoted to\u201d that fits the majority\u2019s usage. The Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford) devotes five full columns to the word \u201cdevote\u201d and its various derivations, yet not one of its many quotations, from such as the Bible, Shakespeare, J.T. Fowler, and the correspondence of laymen, fits within the majority\u2019s definition. III Oxford 293-95 (1933). Specifically, Oxford offers seven examples of the use of the word \u201cdevote\u201d within the context of the definition advocated by the majority. But not a single one supports the majority\u2019s application; rather each concerns <em>actual </em>gifts or declarations of love and lifelong devotion, <em>id. </em>at 294\u2014hardly the usage employed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Consider the result of the majority\u2019s reasoning. Actually doing or not doing the activity for which one may have \u201cdevoted\u201d his time or his land, by the majority\u2019s definition, is not determinative.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rather, it is only setting aside, not doing or using, that truly matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We also assume that the Legislature is aware of the definitions that this court has attached to words and phrases. <em>Price v. Kitsap Transit, </em>125 Wn.2d 456, 463-64, 886 P.2d 556 (1994). That which has been \u201cdevoted to\u201d a specific use has often been addressed by this court. We have repeatedly held whether land is \u201cdevoted to\u201d a particular use or not is determined by \u201cthe use to which the property is applied ...\u201d <em>State ex rel. Milwaukee Terminal Ry. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>54 Wash. 365, 375, 103 P. 469 (1909). It is use, not \u201czoning,\u201d that has consistently been the court\u2019s focus to determine whether or not land has been \u201cdevoted to\u201d a specific use. <em>See, e.g., Albee v. Town of Yarrow Point, </em>74 Wn.2d 453, 454-58, 445 P.2d 340 (1968) (street widened to allow access by traffic to Lake Washington is devoted to public use); <em>Anderson v. Port of Seattle, </em>49 Wn.2d 528, 530, 304 P.2d 705 (1956) (municipal airport operated by Eort of Seattle is property devoted to public use); <em>State ex rel. Eastvold v. Superior Court, </em>44 Wn.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>607, 608, 269 P.2d 560 (1954) (state highway operated by a municipal corporation is a property devoted to public use); <em>State ex rel. York v. Board of Comm\u2019rs, </em>28 Wn.2d 891, 897, 184 P.2d 577, 172 A.L.R. 1001 (1947) (a highway is land devoted to public use).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We are also commanded to interpret statutes in a manner that avoids illogical or absurd results. <em>Blondheim v. State, </em>84 Wn.2d 874, 879, 529 P.2d 1096 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">But the majority\u2019s circular reasoning achieves exactly the absurd outcome we are constrained to avoid. According to the majority one of the key questions a city should ask before determining whether land is to be designated agricultural under the GMA is: \u201cHave we (the City) already zoned the land agricultural?\u201d If it has, so reasons the majority, it satisfies the \u201cdevotion\u201d test. However, if the land were not zoned agricultural, why else would anyone seek to challenge the determination as inconsistent with the statute? A self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The majority also defines \u201cdevoted to\u201d to mean land \u201cactually used <em>or </em>capable of being used for agricultural production.\u201d Majority at 53 (emphasis added). This definition is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s. The Legislature joins \u201cprimarily devoted\u201d <em>and </em>\u201clong term commercial significance\u201d whereas the majority virtually eliminates the first in favor of the second as land incapable of agricultural use cannot, by definition, be actually used for agricultural production. All that is left is land capable of being used for agriculture, which can\u2019t refer to the actual use.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Therefore, by the majority\u2019s definition, what the GMA tests is <em>only </em>whether or not the alleged agricultural land has \u201clong-term commercial significance,\u201d notwithstanding the statutory requirement that such land have <em>both </em>devotion <em>and </em>long-term capability. \u201cIt is of course the rule that the courts are obliged to interpret a statute, if possible, so that no portion of it is superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Snow\u2019s Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Morgan, </em>80 Wn.2d 283, 288, 494 P.2d 216 (1972) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Giving preference to a city\u2019s zoning designation is also illogical in the context of the statutory definition. Agricultural land, by the statute\u2019s definition, is land \u201cprimarily devoted\u201d to the commercial production of a variety of vegetable and animal products. RCW 36.70A.030(2). However, before land can be \u201cprimarily devoted\u201d to the commercial production of such products it has to be agriculturally zoned; although just because it is so zoned does not mean it will be so used. The Legislature has codified an extensive list of possible uses within agriculturally zoned land to instruct Growth Management Hearing Boards, and this court, on the criteria which must apply to determine if land has been \u201cdevoted\u201d to agriculture. Again, the majority\u2019s reasoning is circular.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Finally, I am at a loss to understand how a zoning designation can be an indicator of land being \u201cprimarily devoted to\u201d commercial agricultural production when in fact there is no commercial agricultural production and, by free market standards, will not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">THE QUESTION OF INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">As the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no need to engage in the always-dangerous practice of divining the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even if we were to accept (which I do not) that the Legislature\u2019s intent <em>did not require </em>the outcome of its clear words, this court would nonetheless be bound by the statute. <em>Hoppe, </em>82 Wn.2d at 552 (\u201cWords of a statute . . . must be given their usual and ordinary meaning. This is true regardless of the policy of enacting the law or the seeming confusion that may follow its enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ment.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>State v. Miller, </em>72 Wash. 154, 158, 129 P. 1100 (1913) (\u201cIt is a very well-settled rule that so long as the language used is unambiguous a departure from its natural meaning is not justified by any consideration of its consequences, or of public policy. . . .\u201d) (quoting 36 Cyc. 1114).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">However, let us for a moment humor the majority by somehow assuming the statute\u2019s meaning is not plain\u2014 statutory definitions and all\u2014therefore forcing us to interpret the statute in a manner that gives effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent not fully expressed by the words actually employed. <em>See, e.g., State v. Coffey, </em>77 Wn.2d 630, 637, 465 P.2d 665 (1970).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The majority writes, \u201c[a] stated legislative intent of the GMA is to maintain and enhance agricultural land.\u201d Majority at 53 (citing RCW 36.70A.020(8)). The actual language of the statute is subtly, but perhaps importantly, different. Section .020 outlines the \u201cgoals\u201d of the act. Among these goals is to \u201cMaintain and enhance . . . <em>productive . </em>. . agricultural. . . industries [and ejncourage the conservation of . . . <em>productive </em>agricultural lands . . . .\u201d RCW 36.70A.020(8) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Among the other goals of the GMA, not cited by the majority, are those that: \u201c[ejncourage development in urban areas . . . .\u201d, RCW 36.70A.020(1); protect the property rights of landowners, RCW 36.70A.020(6); and \u201c[ejncourage the involvement of citizens in the planning process . . . .,\u201d RCW 36.70A.020(11). All of <em>these </em>stated intents of the GMA are, of course, best served by the conclusion reached by the GMHB, which is to encourage growth within urban growth boundaries, not defeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">If the Act\u2019s goals require us to describe the language as \u201cambiguous,\u201d we must apply the maxim which requires us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to apply zoning regulations with more than one reasonable construction in the manner least restrictive to the landowner. 3A Norman J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 75.07 (5th ed. 1992); <em>Mall, Inc. v. City of Seattle, </em>108 Wn.2d 369, 378, 739 P.2d 668 (1987). This, of course, is decidedly neither the interpretation the majority selects, nor the one which avoids putting the Act\u2019s goals in conflict with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">A further indication that \u201cdevoted to\u201d means current use is found in <em>Twin Falls </em>where the GMHB held \u201cdevoted to\u201d means current use. <em>Twin Falls, Inc. v. Snohomish County, </em>1993 WL 839715 (Wash. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt Hr\u2019gs Bd., Sept. 7, 1993). After <em>Twin Falls </em>the Legislature amended the GMA in 1994, and specifically the section defining agricultural land, yet it did not amend the phrase \u201cdevoted to.\u201d The Legislature is presumed to be aware of how a statute has been construed. <em>Hazel v. Van Beek, </em>135 Wn.2d 45, 58, 954 P.2d 1301, 1307 (1998). Reenactment of a statute without material change after it has been construed by an authority entrusted with its interpretation implies acquiescence by the Legislature to the construction given the statute. <em>Longview Fibre Co. v.

However, even if such a program were enacted I would affirm the GMHB\u2019s logical, consistent, and clear reading of the GMA, to hold land which is not in actual productive agricultural use is not \u201cdevoted to\u201d such use.</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The majority\u2019s definition, not being required, is dicta and therefore not binding in future cases. <em>See Burkhart v.

Land is devoted to the listed agricultural activities when land is used for one or more of those purposes. <em>See Benaroya v.
