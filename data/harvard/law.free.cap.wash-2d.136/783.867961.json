In this case, we conclude the superior court cannot, and reverse the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The controversy surrounds 25 acres of property zoned agricultural in King County, outside the Kent city limits, but inside Kent\u2019s annexation area. The property had been zoned agricultural since 1941, but Torrance acquired the property in the 1960s in the hope of eventual industrial or commercial development.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">In 1992, pursuant to the Growth Management Act (GMA), RCW 36.70A, King County designated the Torrance property agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance. The adoption of the comprehensive plan on November 18, 1994 did not change the property\u2019s agricultural zoning, and Torrance did not appeal the designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In January 1995, King County enacted an ordinance adopting zoning, zoning maps, and development conditions to implement the 1994 comprehensive plan. Although still designated agricultural, the Torrance property received \u201cP-suffix\u201d zoning conditions. Under the terms of \u201cP-suffix\u201d conditions, the property retained its agricultural zoning, but the property-specific \u201cP-suffix\u201d zoning conditions allowed Torrance to use the property for \u201cretail nursery operations, garden store, food gourmet stores, specialty food stores, university agricultural programs, restaurants, microbrewery and winery.\u201d King County Ordinance No. 11653. Torrance did not challenge the application of the \u201cP-suffix\u201d zoning conditions to his property, but alleges he had no reason to do so because the permitted uses satisfied his needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The compatibility of \u201cP-suffix\u201d zoning conditions to the purposes of the GMA were challenged by other parties. In September 1995, the Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board (Board) held the \u201cP-suffix\u201d zoning conditions were not in compliance with the GMA. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 146; <em>see Alberg v. King County, </em>No. 95-3-0041, 1995 WL 903142, at 15 (Central Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hr\u2019gs Bd. Final Dec. and Order Sept. 13, 1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to the <em>Alberg </em>decision, King County enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Ordinance No. 12061 in December 1995, which removed the \u201cP-suffix\u201d conditions from the 1994 comprehensive plan and from the Torrance property. The removal of the \u201cP-suffix\u201d conditions did not alter the underlying agricultural zoning of the property, and Torrance did not appeal King County\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In 1996, Torrance requested removal of the Torrance property from agricultural designation. This request was included in an amendment to proposed Ordinance No. 96-496 and would have rezoned the property from \u201cthe Agricultural Production district and Agriculture Land Use Designations to Industrial.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 147. The proposed amendments were considered, but were rejected and deleted before that ordinance was adopted because the King County Council decided not to change the property\u2019s agricultural designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Torrance petitioned the Board to review King County\u2019s decision not to reclassify the property. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 124-25; <em>see </em>RCW 36.70A.280-.290. On March 31, 1997, the Board made two decisions. First, the Board determined Torrance was time barred from challenging King County\u2019s agricultural designation of the property because more than 60 days had passed since the County\u2019s 1994 and 1995 GMA actions. Second, the Board found King County in compliance with the GMA because the County\u2019s decision not to adopt Torrance\u2019s proposed amendments was not an illegal action under RCW 36.70A.130. Clerk\u2019s Papers at 149-50. Despite the availability of judicial review in superior court, Torrance did not appeal the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>RCW 34.05.510; RCW 36.70A.300.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Instead, Torrance pursued a lawsuit filed December 13, 1996 (prior to the Board\u2019s decision) in King County Superior Court. The lawsuit challenged King County\u2019s 1996 decision not to adopt Torrance\u2019s proposed amendments changing the agricultural designation of Torrance\u2019s property. Torrance\u2019s complaint included a cause of action under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Washington\u2019s Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), RCW 36.70C, arguing the decision not to adopt the proposed amendments was a land use decision subject to (1) judicial review; (2) a claim for damages under RCW 64.40; (3) a taking claim; and (4) a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of Torrance\u2019s constitutional right to substantive due process. Torrance later amended the complaint to include a request for a constitutional writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Following briefing and argument by the parties, the superior court determined the constitutional writ of certiorari would issue. The superior court found Torrance\u2019s property was not agricultural land under the GMA and King County\u2019s decision not to change the agricultural designation in 1996 was illegal. The superior court also found King County\u2019s failure to change the designation of Torrance\u2019s property following the <em>Alberg </em>decision arbitrary and capricious. The superior court ordered King County to adopt legislation changing the designation of Torrance\u2019s property from agricultural to either commercial or industrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">King County filed a petition for discretionary review of the superior court decision in the Court of Appeals. Torrance moved for transfer to this court. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We must determine whether the superior court erred in granting the constitutional writ of certiorari. We review this issue de novo. <em>Thomsen v. King County, </em>39 Wn. App. 505, 514-15, 694 P.2d 40 (1985) (appellate court should conduct de novo review of superior court\u2019s writ decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">A constitutional writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, but discretionary with the court. <em>Saldin Sec., Inc. v. Snohomish County, </em>134 Wn.2d 288, 304, 949 P.2d 370 (1998). The law is well established that discretion can be exercised when no other adequate remedy at law is avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>able and when the decision below is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. <em>Saldin Sec., </em>134 Wn.2d at 292-93; <em>Williams v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>97 Wn.2d 215, 221, 643 P.2d 426 (1982). If either a statutory writ of review or direct appeal of the decision is available, discretion to issue a constitutional writ of certiorari generally does not exist. <em>Saldin Sec., </em>134 Wn.2d at 292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The critical inquiry in this case is whether an adequate remedy at law existed and was available to the landowner. While many zoning decisions have been made in this case, for purposes of this opinion we examine whether the superior court can exercise its discretion and issue a constitutional writ of certiorari after the Board\u2019s March 31, 1997 decision. To do so, we must examine what potential remedies were available to the landowner after the Board\u2019s decision was made and determine whether the potential remedies provided the opportunity for adequate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The GMA establishes an administrative review process designed to resolve allegations that a local government failed to comply with the GMA\u2019s requirements. <em>See </em>RCW 36.70A.250-.345. The GMA requires that any person making such a challenge file a petition with a growth management hearings board (GMHB). RCW 36.70A.280.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A petition for review must be filed within 60 days of the date the local government took the challenged action. RCW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>36.70A.290(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The GMHB shall issue a final order finding the state agency, county, or city in compliance with the GMA, or not. RCW 36.70A.300.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If a GMHB determines there is noncompliance, it shall remand the matter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>state agency, county, or city which must then correct the error and comply with the requirements of the GMA. RCW 36.70A.300(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Any aggrieved party may appeal a GMHB decision to superior court within 30 days of the final order of a GMHB. RCW 36.70A.300(5). A county zoning decision and a GMHB determination that the county\u2019s decision was legal are decisions that may be appealed to superior court because compliance with GMA directives are involved. Washington\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (APA), RCW 34.05, governs judicial review of GMHB decisions, and the party asserting the invalidity of the agency decision carries the burden of proof. <em>See generally </em>RCW 36.70A; RCW 34.05.570(1)(a). A superior court can grant relief if the action substantially prejudiced the party appealing the GMHB\u2019s decision. RCW 34.05.570(1)(d). Additionally, a superior court can also grant relief if: the order is in violation of a constitutional provision; the order is outside the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; an agency engaged in an unlawful decision-making process or failed to follow its prescribed procedure; an agency has erroneously interpreted or applied the law; the order is not supported by the evidence; an agency has not decided all issues requiring resolution by the agency; a motion for disqualification was made and improperly denied; the order is inconsistent with a rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>the agency; or the order is arbitrary or capricious. RCW 34.05.570(3)(a)-(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The writ of certiorari is unavailable unless the remedies available under RCW 34.05.570 are inadequate for full and complete relief. If an opportunity for full and complete relief is available, the general rule that the existence of a statutory appeals process bars a court from exercising discretion and issuing a constitutional writ of certiorari must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We find that statutory review was available for Torrance to seek relief. In 1996, the King County Council decided not to adopt Torrance\u2019s proposed amendments. The King County Council had the authority and jurisdiction to determine whether amendments or revisions to the comprehensive plan were necessary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As permitted by statute, Torrance sought review of the County Council\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>sion by a GMHB. RCW 36.70A.280-.300. The Board determined it did not have jurisdiction to decide whether the 1994 or 1995 decisions complied with the GMA, but found King County had the authority not to adopt Torrance\u2019s proposed amendments. Torrance did not wait to appeal the Board\u2019s decision as permitted by RCW 36.70A.300(5), but chose instead to immediately proceed with a lawsuit filed December 13, 1996 in superior court (amended to include the constitutional writ of certiorari). The decision to forgo an available appeal and to instead seek a remedy by means of a constitutional writ of certiorari is fatal to Torrance\u2019s case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Judicial review of a GMHB decision under RCW 36.70A.300(5) and RCW 34.05.570 provides an aggrieved party the opportunity for adequate and complete relief from a GMHB decision. In this case, an appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to superior court would have provided Torrance with an opportunity to pursue the remedy he desired. Torrance argued the decision not to rezone the property was arbitrary, capricious, and illegal because, under the GMA, the property was not agricultural. Under the statutory appeals process, a superior court could provide a remedy if Torrance were correct. Torrance failed to avail himself to this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We hold the constitutional writ of certiorari is legally unavailable where a right to appeal exists and the failure to appeal is not excused. In this case, the superior court erroneously exercised its discretion by issuing the constitutional writ of certiorari because the opportunity for an adequate remedy was available and any final decision of a GMHB is appealable. Torrance\u2019s excuse that an appeal was not necessary or required because the Board\u2019s decision was not on the merits is incorrect. The only statutory requirement for appeal is that the Board\u2019s decision be final, which the decision here was.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The superior court is not a zoning review superauthority permitted to substitute its judgment for that of the legislative authority under the guise of a constitutional writ of certiorari. Such a result is inconsistent with the purpose of the constitutional writ of certiorari. A writ of certiorari is an extraordinary remedy granted at the discretion of the court, but it is not available when a party has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>avail itself to other procedures that would have afforded the opportunity for an adequate remedy. For these reasons, we reverse the decision of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Durham, C.J., Dolliver, Smith, Guy, Madsen, and Talmadge, JJ., and Baker, J. Pro Tern., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Torrance did not participate in the <em>Alberg </em>case because Torrance argues King County did not notify him the appeal was pending and because the Puget Sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Trust (plaintiffs in the <em>Alberg </em>case) did not join Torrance as an indispensable party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The LUPA claims were dismissed by court order on April 24, 1997 because the superior court found King County took no action subject to challenge under LUPA. Torrance did not appeal the dismissal of the LUPA claims. Still pending in the superior court is a trial on damages Torrance may have suffered due to King County\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> 36.70A.280 (1996).

Examining neither the merits of their claim nor the propriety of the council\u2019s action, the majority claims the Torrances cannot be heard because the constitutional writ of certiorari is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">This triumph of form over substance is only possible because the majority abrogates the Torrances\u2019 constitutional right to a writ of certiorari. While the constitutional right is not absolute, we have held it is nonetheless vested in the trial court\u2019s discretion and may only be set aside on review where there is no \u201ctenable reason\u201d for its exercise. <em>See Bridle Trails Community Club v. City of Bellevue\", </em>45 Wn. App. 248, 252, 724 P.2d 1110 (1986). In fact, this is exactly the case which demands the issuance of the writ because here the superior court, in proper exercise of its discretion, reviewed the actions of King County and found good cause to grant Torrances the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The Torrances own a 25-acre parcel which has been paralyzed in an agricultural zone for at least five and a half decades. Today the land lies in the heart of south King County\u2019s industrial and commercial area, surrounded by thoroughfares and mainline railroad tracks. Directly to the east is Central Avenue, which carries an estimated 25,000 vehicles a day, while just south of the land is South 277th Street which, after its planned widening to five lanes, will be carrying about 32,500 cars each day. In point of fact all the properties bordering Central Avenue between downtown Kent and downtown Auburn are either commercial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>industrial zoned or, alternatively, have had their development rights purchased by King County <em>except </em>this one parcel. It is an island of disuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Over the course of their ownership of said parcels, which began in the 1960s, the Torrances have paid about $130,000 in property taxes. But during like period the Torrances managed to earn only about $5,000 by allowing cattle to graze on the land.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But now even this limited source of agricultural income is no longer available as their last tenant determined the land is not suitable for grazing. And, in the opinion of both the professional farmers who have used it and King County itself, the parcel is too small for any other agricultural purposes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Torrances\u2019 attempts to interest commercial agricultural farms in the land have likewise been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Despite the economic hardship, illogic, and probable legal invalidity of the county\u2019s agricultural designation of their land, the Torrances have attempted to cooperate and compromise with governing authorities. Apparently this was their fatal error because it was only after repeated unsuccessful attempts to achieve a use designation consistent with the GMA that the Torrances finally brought the lawsuit which this court now summarily dismisses as untimely notwithstanding its obvious merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Article IV section 6, of the Washington State Constitution expressly vests the superior court with judicial power to review administrative decisions for illegal or manifestly arbitrary acts. <em>Saldin Sec., Inc. v. Snohomish County, </em>134 Wn.2d 288, 292, 949 P.2d 370 (1998). No additional \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances are required to justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>writ\u2019s issuance. <em>Id. </em>at 294. As we have noted, the broad language of the constitution\u2019s grant of power to issue writs of certiorari \u201cis self-executing and needs no legislation to vest this power in the superior courts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Hogan, </em>49 Wn.2d 457, 461, 303 P.2d 290 (1956). In fact, we have held the power to review illegal actions always lies with the court and may not be limited by the legislature. <em>See Saldin Sec., Inc., </em>134 Wn.2d at 295-96; <em>Pierce County Sheriff v. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>98 Wn.2d 690, 693-94, 658 P.2d 648 (1983); <em>State ex rel. Cosmopolis Consol. Sch. Dist. v. Bruno, </em>59 Wn.2d 366, 369, 367 P.2d 995 (1962). Zoning regulations are certainly subject to such review. <em>Pierce v. King County, </em>62 Wn.2d 324, 332, 382 P.2d 628 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The writ is proper so long as tenable reasons support the discretionary ruling of the superior court. <em>Bridle Trails Community Club, </em>45 Wn. App. at 252.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also State ex rel. Cawley v. Town of Bremerton, </em>32 Wash. 508, 511, 73 P. 477 (1903) (noting rule that it is within the discretion of the court to issue constitutional writs); <em>Birch Bay Trailer Sales, Inc. v. Whatcom County, </em>65 Wn. App. 739, 746, 829 P.2d 1109 (1992) (citing trial judge\u2019s statement that a matter did not rise to a constitutional action to support appellate court\u2019s conclusion the trial court did not abuse its discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The majority, however, does not address whether the trial court abused its discretion. Instead, the majority draws its entire analysis from the mere existence of a right to appeal a final determination of an administrative agency pursuant to the Administrative Frocedure Act (AFA). Majority at 790-91. Thus, the majority opines, the decision to \u201cseek a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>remedy by means of a constitutional writ of certiorari is fatal to Torrance\u2019s case.\u201d Majority at 792.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">A superior court\u2019s grant of the constitutional writ has never been subject to the kind of complacent\u2014in fact nonexistent\u2014review in which the majority here engages. Specifically, we have recently expressly stated the mere existence of a statutory appeal is insufficient grounds to reverse the grant of a writ: To justify dismissal, the available appeal must truly offer an effective remedy to the petitioner. <em>Saldin Sec., Inc., </em>134 Wn.2d at 295. The APA appeal procedure offered no such remedy for the Torrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Procedurally the GMA provides for review, under the APA, of final decisions of a growth management hearings board (GMHB). RCW 36.70A.300(5). But here the only decision of the GMHB arguably subject to appeal was that it had no jurisdiction to hear the Torrance claim in the first place. Although the APA generally allows review of incorrect agency orders (RCW 34.05.570(3)), the APA does not offer the Torrances an adequate remedy at law since the merits of their claim were not subject to the GMHB\u2019s jurisdiction, as the board correctly concluded. As the GMHB decision subject to appeal under the APA did not relate to the merits, such an appeal would have accomplished nothing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">As the administrative board noted, its jurisdiction is limited. The board has consistently interpreted its jurisdiction narrowly, having found, for example, that it has no power to consider constitutional, common law, or equitable questions. <em>Alberg v. King County, </em>No. 95-3-0041, Central Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hrg\u2019s Bd. Decision and Order 1109 (Sept. 13, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The GMA grants the board limited jurisdiction to declare plans invalid, but only if a petition is filed within 60 days of publication of the comprehensive plan. RCW 36.70A-.290(2). The board found that the last action taken by King County was outside this time line, correctly concluding it simply had no jurisdiction to hear the merits of the Torrance claim. Consequently the Torrances had no administrative remedy, at least at the time they commenced this writ action.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Such is precisely the situation which invites a constitutional writ of certiorari, for the Torrances had no recourse but the writ. That the Torrances did not appeal to the GMHB earlier does not necessarily bar the writ insofar as a trial court has tenable reasons for granting it, especially as zoning regulations by nature are ongoing. In law we have adhered to the clear rule that compliance with a statute of limitations is specifically <em>not required </em>when the writ of certiorari is sought to review a zoning regulation. <em>Pierce v. King </em>County, 62 Wn.2d at 333. Although it is true that failure to comply with a statute of limitations or administrative appeal period might provide the superior court with a discretionary basis to deny the writ, here, considering the totality of the facts, the superior court found good cause to justify the exercise of its discretion to grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Even assuming an ongoing unlawful zoning designation may be barred, under any circumstances, from challenge by the mere passage of time, at most the trial court need only find the delay was for \u201cgood cause\u201d to entertain the writ on the merits. <em>See Saldin Sec., Inc., </em>134 Wn.2d at 293. And we must give the trial court maximum deference in its determination, seeking only a \u201ctenable reason\u201d to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Here there were many \u201ctenable reasons\u201d which justified the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion to grant the writ. The Torrances did not appeal King County\u2019s January 1995 designation of its land as \u201cP-suffix\u201d agricultural because that designation allowed sufficient commercial use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>land.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Later in that year, the GMHB abolished the P-suffix condition, and once again King County designated the Torrance property agricultural. Again, Torrance did not appeal but only because of implied promises by the county that if they could just find other suitable land that could be designated agricultural, the county would give the subject acreage an industrial designation. Only after a futile year and an investment of over 1,000 hours of time did the Torrances finally give up this quest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But when they again petitioned the county to redesignate the land in compliance with state law, the county once again refused, well after the GMA administrative appeal period had run, leaving the Torrances with no administrative avenue of appeal. Thus, the learned trial judge was precisely correct when he noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">It is fundamentally troublesome to the Court that the petitioners are without the ability to have anyone re-examine the fundamental, legally erroneous determination that this was agricultural property; and I think that\u2019s the precise purpose for the existence of the writ certiorari.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Tr. of Oral Argument Re: Property Designation, before the Honorable Philip G. Hubbard (July 21, 1997) <em>(Torrance v. King County, </em>No. 96-2-21775-1) at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">There is nothing in the facts of this case nor in the majority opinion that demonstrates the superior court\u2019s grant of the writ \u201cwas untenable.\u201d To the contrary, the facts amply support the superior court\u2019s conclusion that the Torrances had been harmed by King County\u2019s designation of their land in an unlawful manner prohibited by the GMA. Moreover, the county\u2019s designation in violation of state statute is an affront to the public welfare and lawful order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>as whatever police power interest justified the legislation is defeated by its violation. Indeed superior court\u2019s conclusion that this harm would continue unless relief was granted is obviously beyond contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Finally, I emphatically disagree with the majority\u2019s bold assertion that allowing the Torrances to proceed under the constitutional writ would turn the superior court into a \u201czoning review superauthority permitted to substitute its judgment for that of the legislative authority . . . .\u201d Majority at 793. In fact, it is the county which has usurped the legislative authority, while it is the court which guards the state legislature\u2019s prerogative to set forth, and limit, county zoning authority through the GMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The majority allows an unlawful county zoning designation to continue with no redress by vacating the Torrances\u2019 constitutional writ of certiorari to which they are entitled. The superior court\u2019s exercise of its discretion was proper and its decision on the law and the facts was correct. Its holding should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In actuality, the Torrance agricultural \u201cincome\u201d has been a net loss of $1,000, since they spent $6,000 on a crop of winter wheat that they were subsequently unable to sell.
