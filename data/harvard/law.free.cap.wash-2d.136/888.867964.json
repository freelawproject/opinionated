An action was commenced before the winner was sworn in for the term of office to which he had been elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We decide the petitioner lacked standing to bring the private quo warranto action, which asserted entitlement to the constitutional office of superior court judge, having failed to plead a special interest or entitlement to the office as required by numerous Washington quo warranto cases. We also decide the action was premature, having been commenced before the term of office at issue. We affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action and imposition of attorney fees under CR 11 and RCW 4.84.185.

The information also sought a judgment for damages based on Judge Arthur Verharen\u2019s (Verharen) usurpation of the office. Verharen\u2019s term of office, as a result of the 1996 election, commenced on January 13, 1997, and has continued through to the present time. Verharen filed an answer raising affirmative defenses to Quick-Ruben\u2019s action including premature filing of the information, lack of standing and an assertion residency within Pierce County was not a requirement to hold the office of superior court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Verharen moved to dismiss Quick-Ruben\u2019s action, which the trial court granted because Quick-Ruben\u2019s action was premature and lacked standing; the trial court also granted an undetermined amount of attorney fees against Quick-Ruben on the basis of CR ll.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court subsequently signed orders awarding attorney fees to Verharen against Quick-Ruben pursuant to CR 11 in the amount of $8,732.50, and pursuant to RCW 4.84.185 in the amount of $6,632.50, and ordered payment to be made within 45 days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">A. Quo Warranto Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Quo warranto actions have their roots in the English common law tradition; the writ of quo warranto was designed to challenge the entitlement of a person to hold office. <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Mills, </em>2 Wash. 566, 568-69, 27 P. 560 (1891); <em>see also </em>74 C.J.S. <em>Quo Warranto </em>\u00a7 1, at 174-75 (1951); 65 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Quo Warranto </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-3, at 230-32 (1972), at 49 (Supp. 1998). In Washington, actions for quo warranto are also part of our legal tradition. The Washington Constitution, article iy section 4 confers original jurisdiction upon this Court over quo warranto as to all state officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Quo warranto actions are also recognized in statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">The [quo warranto] information may be filed by the prosecuting attorney in the superior court of the proper county, upon his own relation, whenever he shall deem it his duty to do so, or shall be directed by the court or other competent authority, or by any other person on his own relation, whenever he claims an interest in the office, franchise or corporation which is the subject of the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">RCW 7.56.020. Indeed, we have determined quo warranto is the proper and exclusive method of determining the right to public office. <em>Green Mountain Sch. Dist. No. 103 v. Durkee, </em>56 Wn.2d 154, 159, 351 P.2d 525 (1960) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Shortly after the adoption of our state constitution, we addressed the standing of parties to pursue quo warranto actions in <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Mills, </em>2 Wash. 566, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>571-75, 27 P. 560 (1891), where we first set forth guidelines for quo warranto actions which have been followed for more than 100 years. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-5\">if the injury is one that is peculiar to the individual he has his right of action, but if it affects the whole community alike, the remedy is by proceedings by the state through its appointed agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-6\"><em>Mills, </em>2 Wash. at 575. We also discussed standing and procedure in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-7\">The common law on [quo warranto] has been supplanted by the statute\u2014the state has legislated on the subject\u2014and it is to the statute we must look, not only for the practice of the court, but for the qualifications of the relator .... The statutes specify those who have the legal right to invoke this remedy. If the relator has a standing here, it must be under \u00a7 703, which is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-8\">\u201cSec. 703. The information may be filed by the prosecuting attorney in the district court of the proper county, upon his own relation, whenever he shall deem it his duty to do so, or shall be directed by the court or other competent authority, or by any other person, on his own relation, whenever he claims an interest in the office, franchise or corporation which is the subject of the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">The legislature has looked out for the interests of the public by providing that the information shall be filed by the prosecuting attorney, either on his own relation, or when directed by the court or other competent authority; and private interests are provided for in the latter part of the section by the words, \u201cor by any other person on his own relation.\u201d When? When he \u201cclaims an interest in the office, franchise or corporation which is the subject of the information.\u201d What interest is meant? Surely not an interest in common with other citizens, for the protection of that interest is already provided for in the first part of the section. If the statute is to be construed as having any meaning at all, and if words are to be given their ordinary meaning, and the ordinary grammatical construction is given to the language and sentences, it must mean that the interest must be a special interest, not common with the interests of the community ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>. . . [The quo warranto statutes] all convey the idea that where the relator is other than the prosecuting attorney he must show his interest, and will be entitled to damage if he prevail, showing conclusively that his interest must be a special interest, and that his damage would be equally distinct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><em>Mills, </em>2 Wash. at 571-73. <em>See also State ex rel. Brown v. Warnock, </em>12 Wn.2d 478, 481-83, 122 P.2d 472 (1942) (town mayor, having no interest in the office of town attorney, proceeded correctly in petitioning the court to require the prosecuting attorney to show cause why he should not be compelled under the quo warranto statute to file an information in quo warranto to determine the right of the incumbent town attorney who allegedly held such office unlawfully). In <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Lally, </em>59 Wn.2d 849, 370 P.2d 971 (1962), the petitioner (or relator) asked the superior court to compel the prosecutor to bring an action of quo warranto against a nonprofit corporation; we upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of mandamus, and set forth the appropriate procedures for a public quo warranto action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-5\">The relator does not claim an interest in the corporation. However, we have held that a taxpayer who has no special interest in the subject matter of the information may apply to the court for an order of mandamus where the prosecutor has refused to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">Where the court is asked to take such action by one claiming no interest in the corporation, however, the burden is upon him to make a plain showing that facts exist which would justify the prosecutor in maintaining the quo warranto proceeding. Final discretion rests in the trial court as to whether the prosecuting attorney should be directed to institute such a proceeding; and unless it plainly appears that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to order the prosecuting attorney to file an information, this court will affirm its action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>59 Wn.2d at 850-51 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Thus, we have established two types of quo warranto actions under RCW 7.56.020: a public quo warranto action brought by the prosecutor, and a private quo warranto action available only where the petitioner can assert and prove a special interest in the office. Quick-Ruben did not seek a public quo warranto action<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we now turn to whether he properly asserted a <em>private </em>quo warranto action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">B. Quick-Ruben Failed To Meet His Burden in a Private Quo Warranto Action</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In order to sustain a private quo warranto action, the petitioner must plead and prove a special interest in the office which is the subject of the action. In <em>State ex rel. Dore v. Superior Court for King County, </em>167 Wash. 655, 9 P.2d 1087 (1932), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a quo warranto action by the mayor-elect of Seattle to unseat the interim mayor because the mayor-elect lacked standing to maintain the action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-7\">It seems essential that the relator should plead some right or title in himself to the unexpired term, in order to be heard. Unless he has some interest, he can not maintain the action under the statute. It is no doubt true that, when the sovereign, the state or its proper officer, brings an action in the nature of <em>quo warranto, </em>alleging that one is wrongfully usurping an office which belongs to another, the common law rule places the burden on the respondent to show his title to the office. But <em>when a private individual seeks to recover an office in his own right, we think he must plead and prove title thereto in himself</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-8\">The language of the statute, \u201cwhenever he claims an interest in the office,\u201d would seem to demonstrate the necessity for pleading title in the one bringing the action and seeking relief. We know of no reason why an individual plaintiff in actions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>this kind, . . . should not assume the burden of showing his title to that which he seeks to recover. A mere citizen, a voter or a taxpayer has no right to maintain such an action. It must be brought under the statute officially by the prosecuting attorney, or it must he brought by a person who claims an interest in the office; and the relator, having failed to allege facts showing that he was elected to fill the unexpired term of Mayor Edwards, has failed to show an interest in the office which he seeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-5\">He, as mayor-elect for the regular term to begin on the first Monday of June, 1932, has no right to question the title of Mayor Harlin to the office of mayor in the interim. That can only be done by the prosecuting attorney or by some one who asserts an interest in the particular term now enjoyed by Mayor Harlin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-6\"><em>Dore, </em>167 Wash. 657-59 (some emphasis ours). Thus, Quick-Ruben had to prove a <em>present special interest </em>in the Pierce County Superior Court Department 1 position to which he claimed title in order to sustain a <em>private </em>quo warranto action.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">The basis of Quick-Ruben\u2019s asserted title to the superior court position is his claim that he is \u201cconstitutionally entitled to the office\u201d under the following rationale: At the time of filing for the office of superior court judge, Quick-Ruben was a qualified candidate for the superior court and Verharen was not because he was not a resident of Pierce County; as no election is required under Const. art. IV \u00a7 29, for a race with only one qualified judicial candidate,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he is entitled to the office without an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Quick-Ruben\u2019s assertion of title in the superior court position is as illusory as his analysis is confused. In his reply brief to this Court and in oral argument, Quick-Ruben <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>appears to suggest that the gravamen of his case is that Verharen was <em>ineligible to file </em>for the office of superior court judge because he was not a Pierce County resident. Quick-Ruben contends he never challenged Verharen\u2019s right to complete his existing term of office, and notes his right to challenge Verharen\u2019s eligibility to run under RCW 29.65.010. Quick-Ruben\u2019s attempt to transmute a private quo warranto action into a statutory challenge under RCW 29.65.010 plainly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">RCW 29.65.010 allows any registered voter to contest the right of a person declared elected to an office to receive the certificate of election. Presumably, Quick-Ruben bases his argument on RCW 29.65.010(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">Because the person whose right is being contested was not at the time he was declared elected eligible to that office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Contests under RCW 29.65.010 are governed by the procedures of RCW 29.04.030. RCW 29.04.030(6) requires that for a challenge to the issuance of a certificate of election due to error or omission, an affidavit of an elector must be filed with the court no later than 10 days following the issuance of the election certificate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Verharen apparently received a certificate of election to the office of superior court judge. There is no evidence whatsoever in this record Quick-Ruben invoked the provisions of RCW 29.65.010 or RCW 29.04.030 below, or timely complied with the statutory procedures. We decline to treat this action as one challenging Verharen\u2019s eligibility to seek the office of judge, as Quick-Ruben would belatedly have us do.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">In fact, had Quick-Ruben successfully challenged Verharen\u2019s eligibility to file for the superior court, it would have also affected Verharen\u2019s entitlement to serve the remainder of his term in office. If Quick-Ruben were correct that Verharen was no longer a Pierce County resident and such residency was constitutionally mandated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>result of such disqualification would be a vacancy in the office at the time Verharen ceased to be a Pierce County resident. <em>See </em>RCW 42.12.010(4) (providing that an elective office shall become vacant upon the incumbent ceasing to be a legally registered voter of the county from which he or she shall have been elected). Wash. Const. art. IV \u00a7 5, provides that such vacancy on the superior court shall be filled until the next general election by appointment by the governor, not by allowing the election loser to assume such office. <em>See also </em>RCW 2.08.120. <em>Cf. State ex rel. Forstell v. Otis, </em>131 Wash. 455, 459-60, 230 P. 414 (1924) (noting the removal of a councilman from the ward for which he was elected creates a vacancy in such office).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">Quick-Ruben points to no authority which would confer the office on an opponent who was defeated in the prior election by a candidate who failed to meet constitutional eligibility standards. Instead, Quick-Ruben\u2019s electoral defeat actually deprived him of any argument he had a special interest in the office. In <em>People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, </em>294 N.C. 713, 242 S.E.2d 796 (1978), the North Carolina Supreme Court rejected the same \u201centitlement to office\u201d theory advanced by Quick-Ruben here, and held the result of the vote favoring the petitioner\u2019s opponent, while not effective to give the opponent legal entitlement to the office due to his age ineligibility, was nonetheless legally effective in excluding the petitioner from entitlement to that office; noting the one clear result of the election was that the voters rejected the petitioner. Having thus been defeated in the election, the petitioner had no legal right to assume office by virtue of the election. <em>Duncan, </em>294 N.C. at 716-21, 242 S.E.2d at 798-801. <em>See also </em>29 C.J.S. <em>Elections </em>\u00a7 243, at 676-77 (1965 &amp; Supp. 1997) (collecting cases at n.93) (noting when a majority or plurality of votes are cast for an ineligible candidate, the fact that the winning candidate is ineligible and not qualified to take office does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>not entitle the runner-up to be declared elected to the contested office).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Quick-Ruben failed to show any <em>special interest </em>in the office of Pierce County superior court judge. Having failed to establish such special interest, he has thus failed to meet his burden to sustain the private quo warranto action he chose to pursue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">C. Premature Filing</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">An additional, and equally compelling, reason for dismissal of Quick-Ruben\u2019s private quo warranto action is that it was prematurely filed in December 1996 <em>before </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>term of office in which Quick-Ruben was interested commenced. Quick-Ruben was advised of this problem by opposing counsel and given the opportunity to dismiss the action, refile it after Verharen\u2019s term commenced, and serve process on opposing counsel. He declined. In order to sustain a private quo warranto action he had to plead and prove a present special interest in the public office in question. In <em>Dore, </em>we held Seattle\u2019s mayor-elect had no right to question the title of the interim mayor to that office before the mayor-elect\u2019s term began, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">That can only be done by the prosecuting attorney or by some one who asserts an interest in the particular term now enjoyed by [the interim mayor].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\"><em>Dore, </em>167 Wash. at 659. Under Quick-Ruben\u2019s own theoiy, his alleged special interest in the office did not accrue until the commencement of the term for which he ran as a candidate. <em>Accord State ex rel. Tennent v. Tollefson, 4 </em>Wn.2d 194, 198, 103 P.2d 36 (1940) (recognizing that a suit to try title to a publicly elected office of mayor would fail if pursued before the term in question commenced). Because he filed his private quo warranto action on December 23, 1996, prior to the January 13, 1997 commencement of the judicial position\u2019s term, he had no <em>present </em>special interest to assert when the action was filed and the trial court properly dismissed Quick-Ruben\u2019s action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">In light of our disposition of the foregoing issues, we do not reach the issue of whether residency in a county is a qualification for the office of superior court judge. While we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>note (1) the record suggests Verharen was indeed a resident of Pierce County,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (2) such residency may not even be required for a superior court judicial candidate,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we make no ruling on these issues because they were not decided by the trial court and are not ripe for review. <em>Department of Ecology v. Acquavella, </em>131 Wn.2d 746, 759-60, 935 P.2d 595 (1997) (where the trial court made no finding whether an irrigation district had forfeited a portion of its water rights, that issue was not ripe for review).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>D. Sanctions and Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Quick-Ruben challenges the trial court\u2019s award of fees under RCW 4.84.185<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and sanctions under CR 11,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> urging us to engage in de novo review of the trial court\u2019s decision of this issue. However, the appropriate standard of review regarding sanctions under the statute or rule is abuse of discretion. <em>Tiger Oil Corp. v. Department of Licensing, </em>88 Wn. App. 925, 937-39, 946 P.2d 1235 (1997); <em>Fluke Capital &amp; Management Servs. Co. v. Richmond, </em>106 Wn.2d 614, 625, 724 P.2d 356 (1986); <em>Biggs v. Vail, </em>124 Wn.2d 193, 197, 876 P.2d 448 (1994) <em>(Biggs </em>II). In <em>Biggs v. Vail, </em>119 Wn.2d 129, 830 P.2d 350 (1992) <em>(Biggs </em>I), we noted RCW 4.84.185, was intended to apply to \u201cactions which, <em>as a whole, </em>were spite, nuisance or harassment suits[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 135, but went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-6\">[T]he language and the history of the frivolous lawsuit statute (RCW 4.84.185) are clear. The lawsuit, as a whole, that is in its entirety, must be determined to be frivolous and to have been advanced without reasonable cause before an award of attorneys\u2019 fees may be made under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 137. In <em>Biggs </em>I, we reversed the trial court\u2019s award of fees under RCW 4.84.185 because the trial court found only three of four claims asserted by Biggs to be frivolous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Because the fourth claim advanced to trial, the suit could not be considered frivolous in its entirety. Thus, fees under RCW 4.84.185 were not appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 137. Under <em>Biggs </em>I, if any claims advance to trial, a trial court\u2019s award of fees under RCW 4.84.185 cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">With respect to an award under CR 11, we noted in <em>Biggs </em>II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-6\">[I]n imposing CR 11 sanctions, it is incumbent upon the court to specify the sanctionable conduct in its order. The court must make a finding that either the claim is <em>not </em>grounded in fact or law and the attorney or party failed to make a reasonable inquiry into the law or facts, <em>or </em>the paper was filed for an improper purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-7\"><em>Biggs </em>II, 124 Wn.2d at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Here, although the trial court\u2019s May 15, 1997 order did not rule on all five of the motions before it, the order clearly dismissed the case based on Quick-Ruben\u2019s lack of standing and premature filing. Unlike <em>Biggs </em>I, no claim survived to trial. Furthermore, in its June 13, 1997 order regarding fees pursuant to RCW 4.84.185 and CR 11, the trial court specifically found Quick-Ruben\u2019s theory of the case \u201cunfounded and not based on any reasonable theory of the law.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 373. The trial court also found \u201c[h]aving standing is fundamental to being able to bring an action. Mr. Quick-Ruben did not have standing, which reasonable inquiry would have shown him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-9\">2. The evidence before the court at the time of the motion establishes that Mr. Quick-Ruben\u2019s position on standing was untenable. When he filed an action in which he either knew or should have known that he lacked standing, his action was frivolous and was advanced without reasonable cause. An award of attorney fees is appropriate under RCW 4.84.185.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-10\">3. Reasonable inquiry by Mr. Quick-Ruben and his counsel would have shown that the theory that Mr. Quick-Ruben had standing, advanced in the summons and complaint and in subsequent pleadings, was not well grounded in fact nor was it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law. Mr. Quick-Ruben and his counsel violated CR 11 and sanctions are warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">Clerk\u2019s Papers at 373-74. As the trial court met the requirements of <em>Biggs </em>I and II, its award of fees and sanctions under RCW 4.84.185 and CR 11 cannot be said to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In a separate section of his brief, Judge Verharen requests an award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to RAP 18.9(a) which provides an appellate court may order a party who \u201cfiles a frivolous appeal\u201d to \u201cpay terms or compensatory damages\u201d to any party harmed by its actions. We have repeatedly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-6\">An appeal is frivolous if there are no debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ and it is so totally devoid of merit that there [is] no reasonable possibility of reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-7\"><em>Presidential Estates Apartment Assocs. v. Barrett, </em>129 Wn.2d 320, 330, 917 P.2d 100 (1996) (quoting <em>Fay v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>115 Wn.2d 194, 200-01, 796 P.2d 412 (1990)); <em>State v. Rolax, </em>104 Wn.2d 129, 136, 702 P.2d 1185 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">While we are reluctant to assess fees lest we be viewed as \u201cprotecting one of our own,\u201d Quick-Ruben had no standing to pursue this private quo warranto action, and he actually filed the action prematurely. Quick-Ruben\u2019s continuation of a meritless claim through appeal entitles Verharen to attorney fees on appeal. RAP 18.9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">The trial court properly dismissed Quick-Ruben\u2019s private quo warranto action because he lacked standing. Quick-Ruben failed to plead and prove a special interest in the Pierce County superior court judge position, an essential predicate to a private quo warranto action. Moreover, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>action for quo warranto was prematurely filed and he was aware the action was premature. The trial court\u2019s award of fees under RCW 4.85.185 and CR 11 did not constitute an abuse of discretion and is affirmed. Attorney fees on appeal under RAP 18.9(a) are granted to Verharen.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Durham, C.J., and Dolliver, Smith, Guy, and Johnson, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The trial court did not rule on Quick-Ruben\u2019s partial summary judgment motion to strike Verharen\u2019s affirmative defenses except for residency, nor did it rule on Verharen\u2019s cross-motion for dismissal on the basis that residency is not a requirement for the office of superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Quick-Ruben did not pay within 45 days. In an August 3, 1997 letter, Verharen\u2019s attorney notified Quick-Ruben\u2019s attorney that if the trial court\u2019s prior orders were not complied with by August 20, 1997, he would seek to force compliance. Quick-Ruben then noted a final judgment for presentation. Verharen filed a motion to enforce by contempt the court\u2019s previous orders to pay sanctions. The trial court considered both motions, declined Quick-Ruben\u2019s request to enter a final judgment and granted Verharen\u2019s contempt motion. In so doing, the trial court acted within its discretion. <em>See In re Marriage of Mathews, </em>70 Wn. App. 116, 126, 853 P.2d 462 (coercive sanctions imposed for contempt are within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion), <em>review denied, </em>122 Wn.2d 1021, 863 P.2d 1353 (1993); <em>Moreman v.

Waldt, </em>81 Wn.2d 1, 5, 499 P.2d 206 (1972). Quick-Ruben then purged the contempt by making full payment as ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Quick-Ruben asserted in oral argument that the scope of the constitutional quo warranto action has not been interpreted by case law. We note, however, the statutory quo warranto action in RCW 7.56 at issue in this case is broader than the constitutional action, which applies to \u201call state officers.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Const. art. IV \u00a7 4 <em>with </em>RCW 7.56.010 <em>and </em>.020. Moreover, Quick-Ruben did not seek to invoke our original jurisdiction pursuant to Const. art. IV \u00a7 4. We decline to specify the parameters of the constitutional quo warranto action here when the parties have not appropriately raised it. <em>See </em>RAP 12.1(a); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>119 Wn.2d 167, 170-71, 829 P.2d 1082 (1992) (argument raised for first time at oral argument is not properly before the court and need not be considered).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Quick-Ruben did not file an action for mandamus to compel the Pierce County Prosecutor to act.

Verharen lived with his first wife in a house in Tacoma until his 1989 divorce, then moved into a Tacoma apartment. In May 1990, he bought a 37-foot sloop with functional galley, head, living and sleeping spaces; moved out of his apartment and onto his boat and has lived there ever since. At the time of said purchase, he reported the boat as his new address to the IRS. He pays a monthly live-aboard fee at the Tacoma Yacht Club where the boat is moored. Although in August 1992 Verharen married Judge Karen Conoley, who resides in Kitsap County, both have maintained their separate residences. Verharen spends two nights a week at his boat, two nights at his wife\u2019s house and splits the weekends between the two. Verharen continues to receive his mail at his boat address; his driver\u2019s license, car registration and bank checks reflect his boat address; he remains a registered voter in Pierce County, maintains all his bank accounts in Pierce County, and pays all living expenses from same. His banker, doctors, dentist, dry cleaners and insurance agent are all in Pierce County.

Just because underlying claims are weak is not to say they are frivolous. <em>Citizens for Clean Air v. City of Spokane, </em>114 Wn.2d 20, 39-40, 785 P.2d 447 (1990) (upholding summary judgment dismissal of appellants\u2019 argument, relying upon well-established Washington case law, but nonetheless refusing to award attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The trial judge in the case at hand predicated his attorney fee award upon finding that Quick-Ruben did not have standing to bring this action, and the \u201cfact\u201d that \u201c[a]ny reasonable amount of research\u201d would have established this. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 373.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">But Quick-Ruben raised a constitutional question of first impression regarding his right to succeed to the office of superior court judge if his opponent were disqualified. He argued he was the only \u201cqualified\u201d candidate in the electoral contest with Judge Verharen and would necessarily succeed to Judge Verharen\u2019s seat by the operation of law. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13 (citing Wash. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 29). As he had the right to electorally contest the seat, he asserts he has standing to compel it if the winner in a two-man race is disqualified. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. The argument has a certain logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Moreover the argument is of constitutional magnitude, debatable, and a matter of first impression for this state, and thus could not be \u201cfrivolous\u201d as that term has been previously defined. <em>See Moorman v. Walker, </em>54 Wn. App. 461, 466, 773 P.2d 887 (1989).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Admittedly his argument, as the majority correctly perceives, was unpersuasive, majority at 898, as today we adopt the analysis of the North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Carolina Supreme Court which rejected an argument much like Quick-Ruben\u2019s. Majority at 899 (citing <em>People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, </em>294 N.C. 713, 242 S.E.2d 796, 798-801 (1978)). And I also find comfort in the result because, as the majority notes, the same is supported by a host of citations from other jurisdictions. Majority at 899-900 (citing 29 C.J.S. <em>Elections </em>\u00a7 243, at 676-77 (1965 &amp; Supp. 1997) (collecting cases at note 93)). But it is precisely because this authority is merely persuasive and not controlling which makes Quick-Ruben\u2019s assertion of standing\u2014while mistaken\u2014legitimate, and not frivolous. Certainly the fact that other jurisdictions with other case law and other constitutional or statutory imperatives have rejected Quick-Ruben\u2019s argument does not make it frivolous as we are not bound by this precedent but must start afresh.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">More importantly, I am troubled by the implication of a finding of fact that \u201cany reasonable amount of research\u201d would have established Quick-Ruben\u2019s lack of standing. It is simply untenable to conclude an attorney in Washington is obligated to find, consider, and then conclude our court is necessarily bound by any analogy to nonbinding decisions in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The point is illustrated by a comparison of the North Carolina <em>Duncan </em>case to the case at bar. The plaintiff-relator in <em>Duncan </em>brought his argument under state statute, not the state constitution. <em>Duncan, </em>242 S.E.2d at 798. Additionally, the North Carolina Supreme Court, unlike this court, was constrained by the binding precedent of earlier state case law holding that a person receiving less votes in an election is not entitled to office upon determination that the winner of the election was unqualified. <em>Id. </em>at 799. These are distinguishing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Moreover Quick-Ruben properly addressed the standing question under the plain language of our constitution. Under such circumstances the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law that the action was frivolous was untenable and an error of law requiring reversal. <em>See State ex rel. Carroll v. Junker, </em>79 Wn.2d 12, 26, 482 P.2d 775 (1971) (noting when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>trial court\u2019s action is untenable it is an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">The trial court\u2019s award of sanctions under CR 11 was also predicated on the problematic assertion that \u201cReasonable inquiry by Mr. Quick-Ruben and his counsel\u201d would have shown that his theory of standing was not well grounded in fact nor warranted by existing law. CP at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">This, of course, is the same justification considered above and must fail for the same reasons. The distinction of the trial court between an award for a frivolous lawsuit and the sanctions awarded under CR 11 is without a difference as a debatable issue of first impression raising a constitutional question is no more a violation of CR 11 than it is a violation of RCW 4.84.185. <em>See Hicks v. Edwards, </em>75 Wn. App. 156, 163, 876 P.2d 953 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">CR 11 sanctions are meant to deter frivolous pleadings, <em>Biggs v. Vail, </em>124 Wn.2d 193, 197, 876 P.2d 448 (1994) <em>(Biggs </em>II), not \u201cchill an attorney\u2019s enthusiasm or creativity in pursuing factual or legal theories.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Joseph Tree, Inc., </em>119 Wn.2d 210, 219, 829 P.2d 1099 (1992) (citation omitted). The opinion announced today lays to rest any question as to the validity of Quick-Ruben\u2019s theory of standing, but we must judge the reasonableness of a pleading not with the benefits of self-fulfilling hindsight but by examining what was known at the time the pleading was submitted. <em>Id. </em>at 220. The bottom line is that before today Washington had not squarely rejected Quick-Ruben\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Finally, our decision to impose fees on appeal must also fail for the same reason. <em>See Cary v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>130 Wn.2d 335, 347-48, 922 P.2d 1335 (1996) (declining to award fees on appeal where case of first impression raised debatable issue of substantial public impression).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Any inquiry about whether an appeal is only frivolous is guided by five considerations: (1) A civil appellant has a right to appeal; (2) all doubts as to the frivolity of an appeal are resolved in favor of the appellant; (3) the record should be considered as a whole; (4) an affirmation based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>on the rejected arguments does not render the appeal frivolous; (5) an appeal is frivolous if there are no debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ, and every claim is so totally devoid of merit that there was no reasonable possibility of reversal. <em>Green River Community College Dist. No. 10 v. Higher Educ. Personnel Bd., </em>107 Wn.2d 427, 442-43, 730 P.2d 653 (1986) (quoting <em>Streater v. White, </em>26 Wn. App. 430, 434-35, 613 P.2d 187 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">In <em>Green River </em>we denied a request for attorney fees despite the fact that the appeal culminated over 10 years of conflict involving two appearances before this court and before the Higher Education Fersonnel Board over a dispute involving less than 20 working hours for three employees, an excess of effort we described as \u201c[s]uch an obdurate course of behavior [that it] is directly at odds with the best interests of the employees, the college, and the public.\u201d <em>Green River Community College Dist., </em>107 Wn.2d at 443. But we chose not to award fees because, in the midst of the tumult, a meritorious argument on an issue unresolved by this court was raised and \u201c[w]e cannot say that there were \u2018no debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boyles v.

While I otherwise agree with the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion, I am constrained to refrain from asserting others might not reasonably differ.
