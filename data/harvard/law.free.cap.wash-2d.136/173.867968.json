Ivie and Steve Taylor. Because both had been previously punished in a \u201ccaptain\u2019s mast\u201d proceeding before their naval commanding officer, the district court dismissed pending charges pursuant to RCW 10.43.040 which bars a criminal prosecution in Washington if another sovereign has already prosecuted the defendant for the same offense. The State, however, appealed to the superior court which reversed the dismissal. But we reverse the superior court, affirm the district court, and dismiss these redundant prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Defendant Ivie. In 1996, defendant Ivie was an enlisted sailor in the United States Navy. On February 27, 1996 he was stopped by a Kitsap County sheriffs deputy and cited for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI) in violation of RCW 46.61.502, and for driving with a suspended license in violation of RCW 46.20.342. He submitted to a breath test which indicated he was legally intoxicated. Prior to his first appearance in district court, however, defendant Ivie was brought before his commanding officer in an Article 15 nonjudicial punishment proceeding (called a captain\u2019s mast in the Navy) and was charged with drunken operation of a vehicle in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. His commander reduced his pay grade to the next inferior rank, suspended that order, and docked him one-half pay for two months. Thereafter, he was brought before the Kitsap County District Court to answer the DUI charge and the suspended license charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>once again in state court. On his motion the district court dismissed, concluding defendant Ivie had been subjected to nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, and therefore subsequent prosecution in state court was barred by Washington statute RCW 10.43.040. The State appealed to the Superior Court which reinstated the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Defendant Tavlor. In 1996, defendant Taylor was also enlisted in the United States Navy. On April 3, 1996, he was stopped by a Washington State Patrol Trooper in Kit-sap County and was cited for DUI in violation of RCW 46.61.502. He submitted to a breath test which indicated he was legally intoxicated. Shortly thereafter the Navy conducted a captain\u2019s mast where defendant Taylor was charged with violation of Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 111, drunken or reckless driving. The record before us does not indicate what, if any, punishment was imposed by defendant Taylor\u2019s commanding officer. As was the case in <em>Ivie, </em>Taylor was brought before Kitsap County District Court which dismissed the criminal charge. The State appealed to the superior court where the charges were reinstated on consolidated review.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The issue is whether RCW 10.43.040 provides a defense to military personnel who have faced \u201cnonjudicial punishment\u201d under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, from state prosecution for a crime committed in the State of Washington. We conclude it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">RCW 10.43.040 prohibits a Washington prosecution if the defendant has already been prosecuted for the same offense by the federal government or another state or country. As these defendants have already been nonjudicially punished by the United States military for the same offense that they are now prosecuted for in state court, state prosecution is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The single issue is whether \u201cnonjudicial punishment\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>imposed by the military against these defendants for drunk driving amounts to a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d as referenced in RCW 10.43.040. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Whenever, upon the trial of any person for a crime, . . . the defendant has already been acquitted or convicted upon the merits, <em>upon a criminal prosecution </em>under the laws of [another] state or country, founded upon the act or omission with respect to which he is upon trial, such former acquittal or conviction is a sufficient defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">RCW 10.43.040 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">It is undisputed that the United States military qualifies as the equivalent of another state or country for purposes of this statute. <em>See State v. Caliguri, </em>99 Wn.2d 501, 512, 664 P.2d 466 (1983). It is also undisputed that Washington would now try defendants for the identical act for which they were already punished by the military.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only question remaining therefore is whether a military proceeding for \u201cnonjudicial punishment\u201d is equivalent to a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d for purposes of this statute. If so, the present state prosecution is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Defining \u201cCriminal Prosecution\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> \u201cCriminal prosecution\u201d is not defined in the statute. Black\u2019s defines prosecution as \u201c[a] criminal action; a proceeding instituted and carried on by due course of law, before a competent tribunal, for the purpose of determining the guilt or innocence of a person charged with crime.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1221 (6th ed. 1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The meaning of \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d must further be determined from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the statutory context in which it is used. RCW 10.43.040 is a double jeopardy statute and \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d is used therein to mean a proceeding sufficient to constitute jeopardy under double jeopardy jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"> An understanding of RCW 10.43.040 requires brief discussion of dual sovereignty. Pursuant to the doctrine of dual sovereignty neither constitutional double jeopardy clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is offended by successive punishments at the hands of separate sovereigns so long as each sovereign punishes the defendant but once. <em>See State v. Kenney, </em>83 Wash. 441, 145 P. 450 (1915) (citing <em>State v. Coss, </em>12 Wash. 673, 42 P. 127 (1895)); <em>Bartkus v. Illinois, </em>359 U.S. 121, 136-38, 79 S. Ct. 676, 3 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1959). However, states may override the doctrine by either state constitution or statute by providing they will not prosecute a defendant who has already been prosecuted for the same offense elsewhere. <em>Caliguri, </em>99 Wn.2d at 512; Annotation, <em>Conviction or acquittal in federal court as bar to prosecution in state courts for state offense based on same facts\u2014modern view, </em>6 A.L.R.4th 802, 816-24 (1981). Our statute abrogates dual sovereignty in this jurisdiction. <em>Caliguri, </em>99 Wn.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In 1909 our Legislature replaced the doctrine of dual sovereignty by statutorily extending double jeopardy protection to prohibit prosecution of a defendant who has already been prosecuted for the same offense elsewhere by a separate sovereign. Laws of 1909, ch. 249, \u00a7 20 (codified at RCW 10.43.040). Thereafter we have repeatedly characterized this statute as a guard against double jeopardy by separate sovereigns. <em>See, e.g., Caliguri, </em>99 Wn.2d at 511 (Washington \u201crejected the dual sovereignty doctrine . . . by statute.\u201d) (construing RCW 10.43.040); <em>State v. Rudy, </em>105 Wn.2d 921, 924, 719 P.2d 550 (1986) (RCW 10.43.040 provides \u201cgreater protection against double jeopardy.\u201d); <em>State v. Duncan, </em>111 Wn.2d 859, 868, 765 P.2d 1300 (1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(RCW 10.43.040 is statutory \u201cprotection against double jeopardy in multiple jurisdictions.\u201d); <em>In re Personal Restraint of Cook, </em>114 Wn.2d 802, 814, 792 P.2d 506 (1990) (citations omitted) (RCW 10.43.040 provides \u201cstatutory double jeopardy protection\u201d); <em>State v. Mathers, </em>77 Wn. App. 487, 489-90, 891 P.2d 738 (\u201cThis state, however, provides greater protection against double jeopardy by statute.\u201d) (citing RCW 10.43.040), <em>review denied, </em>128 Wn.2d 1002, 907 P.2d 297 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In the leading case of <em>Caliguri, </em>99 Wn.2d at 512-13, this court unanimously recognized RCW 10.43.040 statutorily extends double jeopardy protection to bar Washington prosecutions which follow prosecutions by other sovereigns. The issue in <em>Caliguri </em>was whether the Washington prosecution for conspiracy to commit arson was for the same \u201cact or omission\u201d under RCW 10.43.040 as a prior federal prosecution for racketeering based on similar acts. <em>Caliguri, </em>99 Wn.2d at 512. Acknowledging the phrase \u201cact or omission\u201d is undefined in the statute, we noted the statute pertains to double jeopardy and turned to double jeopardy jurisprudence to define the term. <em>Id. </em>at 512-14. We should do the same today.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Turning back to RCW 10.43.040 the text provides Washington will not criminally prosecute if a defendant has already been criminally prosecuted elsewhere for the same offense. Because RCW 10.43.040 simply extends double jeopardy protections we read it to mean Washington will not place a defendant in jeopardy if he has already been placed in jeopardy elsewhere. \u201cCriminal prosecution\u201d therefore means a proceeding sufficient to invoke jeopardy under double jeopardy jurisprudence. Referencing double jeopardy jurisprudence, we note the clause prohibits \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d 355, 362, 945 P.2d 700 (1997) (citations omitted). Thus the double jeopardy aspect of our statute focuses on whether the prior proceeding amounts to \u201cpunishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Meshing the dictionary definition of \u201ccriminal prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tion\u201d with its double jeopardy basis we understand \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d to include a proceeding instituted under the rules of law to determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused of committing a criminal act where such proceeding threatens \u201cpunishment\u201d under double jeopardy jurisprudence. We then test \u201cnonjudicial punishment\u201d by this standard to see if it is a \u201ccriminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Nature of Nonjudicial Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The military undoubtedly occupies its own unique position within our constitutional structure. Congress, pursuant to its power to regulate the military, enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice (U.C.M.J.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All military personnel are subject thereto. The U.C.M.J., under the section titled \u201cPunitive Articles,\u201d makes criminal a long list of offenses including purely military ones such as mutiny and desertion, as well as general criminal offenses including murder, robbery, sodomy, and drunk driving. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 885-922 (U.C.M.J. art. 85-122). The U.C.M.J. empowers the military authorities to impose a wide range of punishments on its service members for commission of crimes under the punitive articles including the death penalty, years of hard labor, confinement on bread and water, dishonorable discharge, and forfeiture of pay. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 856 tbl. (U.C.M.J. art. 56).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">When a member of the military allegedly commits an offense under the punitive articles of the U.C.M.J., whether on-base or off, military authorities may proceed against the service member in one of four ways: First is the general court-martial which is the most serious and includes a full blown military trial and may result in imposition of the death penalty; second is the special court-martial which is a slightly less formal military trial; third is the summary court-martial, the least-formal trial; and fourth, and the one relevant in this case, is nonjudicial punishment. 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 815 (U.C.M.J. art. 15). The military authorities will select one of the four methods depending on the nature of the offense and identity of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Nonjudicial punishment is available only for \u201cminor offenses\u201d which are those carrying a maximum penalty of one year or less confinement and which cannot result in dishonorable discharge. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815(b) (U.C.M.J. art. 15(b)); Manual for Courts-Martial United States (1995) (MCM),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pt. V, \u00b6 le.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonjudicial punishment may be imposed only by a commander on a member of his command.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">While nonjudicial punishment is not a court-martial, precise procedure must still be followed. The accused service member must be delivered a statement of the charges with reference to the provision of the U.C.M.J. allegedly violated, a summary of the information upon which the charge is based, and a statement of rights. MCM, pt. <em>V, </em>\u00b6 4a. (2), (3). Once charges for nonjudicial punishment are delivered, the service member may demand a court-martial rather than face nonjudicial punishment for the offense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815(a) (U.C.M.J. art. 15(a)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At this point the service member may defend on the grounds he has already been punished for the same offense in state or federal court as a state prosecution is a total bar to subsequent nonjudicial punishment under military law. MCM, pt. <em>V, </em>\u00b6 If. (5). This indicates military law regards a state prosecution and nonjudicial punishment as equally final dispositions of the criminal offense so that one will bar the other.</p>\n<p id=\"Acv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>At the nonjudicial proceeding itself the accused has the right to appear in person, be \u201caccompanied by a spokesperson\u201d (who may be a civilian lawyer), examine all documents and physical evidence, present a defense, and present available witnesses in an open proceeding. MCM, pt. <em>V, </em>\u00b6 4c. (1). To impose nonjudicial punishment the commander must find the accused service member guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Charles A. Shanor &amp; L. Lynn Hogue, Military Law in a Nutshell 109 (2d ed. 1996). A commander may impose a variety of sanctions as nonjudicial punishment including a reduction in rank, 30 days\u2019 correctional custody, 3 days\u2019 confinement on bread and water, 60 days of restricted movement, 45 days of extra duties, forfeiture of future pay, and a formal military admonition or reprimand. MCM, pt. V, \u00b6 5b.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">After a finding of guilt the service member may appeal, in writing, to a superior authority. MCM, pt. V, \u00b6 7. The superior authority must then refer the case to a judge advocate for legal review. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7e.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The ultimate finding of guilt and imposition of punishment remains with the service member and may be used to justify subsequent discharge and to enhance a sentence at an unrelated future court-martial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> William R. Salisbury, Comment, <em>Nonjudicial Punishment Under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice: Congressional Precept and Military Practice, </em>19 San Diego L. Rev. 839, 861-62 (1982); <em>United States v. Mack, </em>9 M.J. 300, 319 (C.M.A. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Under military law nonjudicial punishment is final. A service member nonjudicially punished for a minor offense may not be tried again for the same offense whether by nonjudicial punishment or by court-martial. The MCM provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\"><em>Double punishment prohibited. </em>When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense, punishment may not again be imposed for the same offense under Article 15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>MCM, pt. V, \u00b6 1f.(1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In sum, nonjudicial punishment is a formalized procedure to fully and finally adjudicate and dispose of minor offenses in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Application</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> Returning to the definition of \u201ccriminal prosecution,\u201d it is evident that nonjudicial punishment is indeed a final adjudication of guilt or innocence for a criminal violation with attendant punishment administered by competent authorities. Thus, nonjudicial punishment necessarily constitutes criminal prosecution under our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Under double jeopardy jurisprudence we consider whether Congress affixed a criminal/punitive or civil/ remedial label to the proceeding. <em>Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d at 365 (citing <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248, 100 S. Ct. 2636, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1980))- If Congress gave a punitive label then the proceeding invokes jeopardy. Here Congress denominated the entire proceeding \u201cnonjudicial <em>punishment\u201d </em>quite unambiguously, indicating the proceeding is \u201cpunishment.\u201d This should end the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">But going even further we note Congress specified nonjudicial punishment is used only for offenses \u201cunder the punitive articles\u201d of the U.C.M.J. MCM, pt. V, \u00b6 1e. The punitive articles of the U.C.M.J. all proscribe criminal conduct<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and every offense under the punitive articles is punishable by a term of confinement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The fact that \u201c \u2018the behavior to which [the sanction] applies is already a crime\u2019 \u201d further indicates the proceeding constitutes jeop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ardy. <em>In re Personal Restraint of Young, </em>122 Wn.2d 1, 21, 857 P.2d 989 (1993) (citations omitted). Funishment which may be imposed nonjudicially includes confinement, confinement on bread and water, restricted movement, a formal reprimand or admonition which Congress provides is \u201cconsidered to be punitive\u201d (MCM, pt. <em>V, </em>\u00b6 5c.(l)), and 45 days\u2019 extra duties which is \u201cassigned as punishment,\u201d (MCM, pt. <em>V, </em>\u00b6 5c. (6)). Any proceeding which threatens<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to impose imprisonment for a criminal violation surely constitutes jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We reject the suggestion that even if double jeopardy principles apply here nonjudicial punishment would not qualify as jeopardy because some might characterize nonjudicial punishment as a civil proceeding, not a punitive criminal one.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Unless double jeopardy has lost all meaning a proceeding which threatens to impose imprisonment for a criminal violation certainly places the defendant in jeopardy. If going to jail for a criminal violation is not punishment, what is? By all indicia nonjudicial punishment constitutes a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d for purposes of our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The State relies primarily on <em>Middendorf v. Henry, </em>425 U.S. 25, 96 S. Ct. 1281, 47 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1976). There the defendant service member was subject to, and actually sentenced to, confinement at hard labor pursuant to a summary court-martial for a violation of the U.C.M.J. On appeal defendant challenged his conviction arguing he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>denied the right to counsel at the proceeding. The issue was whether he was entitled to counsel. The Supreme Court held he was not. The Court understood the military\u2019s mission often necessitates that commanders be able to impose swift punishment<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to dispose of minor offenses and to maintain unit discipline.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the intervention of lawyers in every such proceeding would disrupt the military mission. However, the general rule is that counsel must be provided in every criminal prosecution where confinement of any duration is imposed. <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 373, 99 S. Ct. 1158, 59 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1979); <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1972). The Court sidestepped this requirement by declaring that a summary court-martial or nonjudicial punishment is not a criminal conviction for <em>right to counsel </em>purposes. <em>Middendorf, </em>425 U.S. at 42, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Thus, <em>Middendorf </em>and its progeny are good authority for the proposition that those in the military may not be entitled to counsel and other procedural rights which would be constitutionally indispensable in a nonmilitary setting. <em>See Middendorf, </em>425 U.S. at 46 (\u201c \u2018[Mjilitary tribunals have not been and probably never can be constituted in such way that they can have the same kind of qualifications that the Constitution has deemed essential to fair trials of civilians in federal courts.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 17, 76 S. Ct. 1, 100 L. Ed. 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(1955)). However this line of cases does not stand for the proposition that nonjudicial punishment is not a form of criminal punishment. Simply put, the military affords its members less procedure than civilians are afforded under the federal and state constitutions. Yet this diminution of trial rights hardly means military personnel are not \u201cpunished\u201d nonjudicially\u2014they are just punished more quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">RCW 10.43.040 focuses on whether the defendant was punished for the same offense elsewhere. One may contrast this with RCW 9.94A.030(9) as interpreted in <em>State v. Morley, </em>134 Wn.2d 588, 952 P.2d 167 (1998). There the issue was procedure, not punishment, specifically whether a prior military court-martial conviction was sufficiently trustworthy from a procedural perspective to count as a valid conviction for purposes of enhancing a current Washington prosecution. <em>Morley, </em>134 Wn.2d at 616. <em>Cf. State v. Chervenell, </em>99 Wn.2d 309, 311, 662 P.2d 836 (1983) (constitutionally invalid prior convictions may not be counted in determining habitual criminal status). In <em>Morley </em>the majority discussed the procedure afforded by the U.C.M.J., holding despite procedural differences between a court martial and a Washington trial a court martial conviction is sufficiently trustworthy. <em>Morley, </em>134 Wn.2d at 617-18. The <em>Morley </em>dissent agreed that court martial convictions may be trustworthy but argued a higher standard was statutorily required if the conviction was to be used to enhance a criminal sentence in Washington, 134 Wn.2d at 622 (Johnson, J., dissenting), relying on RCW 9.94A.030(9) which mandates the prior conviction comport with the procedural requirements set out in Title 10 RCW, the Washington code of criminal procedure, before it may be considered. <em>Morley, </em>134 Wn.2d at 624. Neither the majority nor dissenting position in <em>Morley </em>conflicts with the approach taken by this opinion today.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The MCM notes that in cases where a state and the United States military both can exercise jurisdiction over punishing the same criminal acts, \u201cthe determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>which agency shall exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultation or prior agreement between appropriate military officials and civilian authorities.\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial 201(d), discussion.

Instead of looking to congressional intent and federal law to determine whether an Article 15 nonjudicial punishment proceeding is a criminal prosecution, the majority looks to the dictionary. The majority ignores all relevant law and changes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>question from whether the military proceeding is a criminal prosecution to whether the proceeding allows a commanding officer to impose punishment. This is faulty analysis, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The issue before us is whether a military Article 15 proceeding is \u201ca criminal prosecution\u201d within the meaning of our state statute. The parties all agree that double jeopardy does not bar subsequent prosecution and that the defendants\u2019 only potential defense lies in RCW 10.43.040, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Whenever, upon the trial of any person for a crime, it appears that the offense was committed in another state or country, under such circumstances that the courts of this state had jurisdiction thereof, and that <em>the defendant has already been acquitted or convicted upon the merits, upon a criminal prosecution under the laws of such state or country, </em>founded upon the act or omission with respect to which he is upon trial, such former acquittal or conviction is a sufficient defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The words of our statute are clear; only a former \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d under the laws of another jurisdiction serves as a defense to a subsequent prosecution. The state prosecutions for driving while intoxicated in these cases are therefore barred only if the captain\u2019s masts were criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In order to determine if an Article 15 military proceeding is a \u201ccriminal prosecution,\u201d I would look to congressional intent and to federal law on the subject. The Constitution expressly authorized Congress to make the rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Middendorf v. Henry, </em>425 U.S. 25, 43, 96 S. Ct. 1281, 47 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1976). Scrutiny of United States Supreme Court authority, other federal court precedent, and the congressional history accompanying the enactment of the current Article 15, all lead me to conclude that nonjudicial punishment imposed by a commanding officer under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Justice was not intended to, and does not, constitute \u201ccriminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, there are four ways of dealing with offenses committed by military personnel. The general court martial under Article 18 (10 U.S.C \u00a7 818) and the special court martial under Article 19 (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 819) are formal, adversarial criminal proceedings. However, the summary court martial under Article 20 (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 820) and nonjudicial punishment by a commanding officer under Article 15 (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815) are non-adversarial proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Zellers v. United States, </em>682 A.2d 1118, 1122 (D.C. 1996). The summary court martial and the Article 15 nonjudicial punishment are regarded as noncriminal in nature. <em>E.g., Fairchild v. Lehman, </em>814 F.2d 1555, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201cArticle 15 punishment, conducted personally by the accused\u2019s commanding officer, is an administrative method of dealing with the most minor offenses.\u201d <em>Middendorf, </em>425 U.S. at 31-32; <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 750, 94 S. Ct. 2547, 41 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1974). In <em>Middendorf, </em>military personnel brought an action challenging the authority of the military to try them and sentence them to confinement after a summary court martial without providing the assistance of counsel. The Court held that the fact that confinement can be imposed in a military environment after a summary court martial did not make it a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d and concluded that the summary court martial is not a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d for purposes of the Fifth or Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Middendorf, </em>425 U.S. at 42, 48. The Supreme Court held that the fact that a proceeding may result in the loss of liberty does not necessarily mean the proceeding is a criminal prosecution. <em>Middendorf, </em>425 U.S. at 37. Even the dissent, which would have held that a summary court martial is a criminal proceeding, agreed that the less serious Article 15 nonjudicial punishment is not a criminal conviction. The dissenters noted that Article 15 nonjudicial punishment can be speedily imposed by a commander and does not carry with it the stigma of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>conviction. <em>Middendorf, </em>425 U.S. at 58 n.9, 64 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The fundamental character of an Article 15 nonjudicial proceeding is that it is not a trial by court martial. <em>Dumas v. United States, </em>620 F.2d 247, 250 (Ct. Cl. 1980); <em>Jamison v. United States, </em>5 Cl. Ct. 747, 750 (1984), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>765 F.2d 159 (1985). Numerous federal cases have held that an Article 15 nonjudicial punishment proceeding is not a criminal prosecution. <em>E.g., United States v. Marshall, </em>45 M.J. 268, 271 (C.A.A.F. 1996); <em>Fairchild, </em>814 F.2d at 1558; <em>Varn v. United States, </em>13 Cl. Ct. 391, 396 (1987); <em>Dumas, </em>620 F.2d at 251; <em>Bowes v. United States, </em>645 F.2d 961 (Ct. Cl. 1981); <em>Cole v. United States, </em>228 Ct. Cl. 890 (1981); <em>Jamison, </em>5 Cl. Ct. at 750; <em>Cochran v. United States, </em>1 Cl. Ct. 759, 764 (1983), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>732 F.2d 168 (1984); <em>Cappella v. United States, </em>624 F.2d 976, 980 (Ct. Cl. 1980). No cases have been cited or located which hold to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The legislative history accompanying 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815 states that Article 15 nonjudicial punishment is noncriminal in character. S. Rep. No. 87-1911, at 2-4 (1962), <em>reprinted in </em>1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2379. The legislative history explains the purpose of the 1962 amendments to Article 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">The purpose of the proposed legislation is to amend article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to give increased authority to designated commanders in the Armed Forces to impose nonjudicial punishment. Such increased authority will enable them to deal with minor disciplinary problems and offenses without resort to trial by court-martial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2380.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The history further explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">Under existing law, <em>article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides a means whereby military commanders deal with minor infractions of discipline without resorting to criminal law processes. </em>Under this article commanding officers can impose specified limited punishments for minor offenses and infractions of discipline. This punishment is referred to as \u201cnonjudicial\u201d punishment. <em>Since the punish</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>ment is nonjudicial, it is not considered as a conviction of a crime and in this sense has no connection with the military court-martial system.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">... It has been acknowledged over a long period that military commanders should have the authority to impose nonjudicial punishment as an essential part of their responsibilities to preserve discipline and maintain an effective armed force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2380-81 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The legislative history also describes the need for additional Article 15 powers and highlights Congress\u2019 intent to make Article 15 a noncriminal proceeding for the protection of service people:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">The Department of Defense has stated that problems adversely affecting morale and discipline have been created in the Armed Forces because of the inadequate powers of commanding officers to deal with minor behavioral infractions without resorting to the processes of the military court-martial system. The limited nonjudicial punishment authority has proved unsatisfactory to commanders in the field. The alternative solution has been to impose a trial by summary or special court-martial. In most cases, a court-martial results in a serious impairment of the services of an officer or enlisted man. Such a conviction stigmatizes a person with a criminal conviction on his record, which not only remains throughout his military career, but follows him into civilian life. It may well interfere with his civilian job opportunities, as for example, when he is required to show on a questionnaire whether he has ever been convicted, and it may adversely reflect on him if he is involved in difficulty with civilian law-enforcement agencies. The bill, by providing increased authority for nonjudicial punishment, will enable commanders to deal promptly and efficiently with problems of discipline. At the same time, the increased nonjudicial authority should permit the services to reduce substantially the number of court-martials for minor offenses, which result in stigmatizing and impairing the efficiency and morale of the person concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>A number of courts have relied on this congressional history to conclude that Article 15 nonjudicial punishment is not a criminal prosecution. <em>See Dumas, </em>620 F.2d at 251; <em>Cochran, </em>1 Cl. Ct. at 764; <em>Jamison, </em>5 Cl. Ct. at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In light of this clear intention on the part of Congress that Article 15 proceedings be noncriminal in nature, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a subsequent prosecution is barred by double jeopardy under this Court\u2019s previous case law. A majority of this Court in <em>In re Personal Restraint of Young, </em>122 Wn.2d 1, 857 P.2d 989 (1993), explained that the categorization of a particular statute as civil or criminal is largely a matter of statutory construction. The first inquiry is whether Congress, <em>in establishing the penalizing mechanism, </em>indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for the civil or criminal label. We recognized that there would be a \u201cpenalizing mechanism\u201d but not all punishment is criminal for purposes of double jeopardy. The fact that Congress labeled Article 15 nonjudicial punishment does not address the issue; the inquiry is whether Congress intended it be \u201ccriminal.\u201d It is clear that Congress did not intend Article 15 proceedings to be criminal. Therefore, I believe the majority opinion is at odds with this Court\u2019s and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s articulation of the test for double jeopardy. <em>See In re Young, </em>122 Wn.2d at 18-19; <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361-62, 117 S. Ct. 2072, 2081-82, 138 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1997) (the categorization of a particular proceeding as civil or criminal is first of all a question of statutory construction; the legislature\u2019s manifest intent will be rejected only where a party challenging the statute provides the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the legislative intention to deem it civil); <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 118 S. Ct. 488, 139 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1997) (disavowing the double jeopardy method of analysis used in <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1989) and reaffirming that the first inquiry is whether Congress intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the proceeding to be civil or criminal in nature). The majority ignores the clear statement by Congress that it intended Article 15 proceedings to be noncriminal in character. <em>See </em>Majority at 183. This is in sharp contrast to this Court\u2019s approach in <em>In re Young, </em>122 Wn.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I find the majority\u2019s discussion of the double jeopardy bar created by an Article 15 proceeding under military law to be incomplete. The majority states that \u201cUnder military law nonjudicial punishment is final\u201d and \u201c[n]or may a second punishment be imposed by court-martial following a nonjudicial punishment for the same offense.\u201d Majority at 182 &amp; 183 n.9. These statements are much too broad and are misleading. They are true only if the prior punishment was for a minor offense. What the majority fails to point out is that nonjudicial punishment does not always preclude subsequent court-martial of a servicemember. The federal court has explained that Congress did not intend for imposition of nonjudicial punishment to preclude the subsequent court-martial of a servicemember accused of a serious offense. <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>27 M.J. 367, 368 (C.A.A.F. 1989); <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>45 M.J. 268, 271 (C.A.A.F. 1996); <em>United States v. Dire, </em>46 M.J. 804 (C.A.A.F. 1997). A servicemember would be given credit for any nonjudicial punishment suffered if he had been subject to Article 15 punishment and subsequently court-martialed for the same offense. However, the nonjudicial punishment is not, as the majority claims, \u201cfinal under military law\u201d and the statement of the majority that a second punishment may not be imposed by court-martial following a nonjudicial punishment for the same offense is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The purpose of Article 15 nonjudicial punishment is to maintain discipline in the armed forces and to avoid bringing criminal charges against a servicemember when the less serious Article 15 proceeding by the commanding officer can achieve the result of maintaining the discipline necessary in a fighting force. Congress did not intend Article 15 proceedings to be criminal prosecutions, and the federal courts have construed them to be noncriminal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>character. Therefore, I would conclude that the defendants were not previously criminally prosecuted when they received nonjudicial punishment from their commanding officers. Military commanders have the responsibility to maintain good order and discipline in their commands. They should be able to impose the flexible punishment available at a captain\u2019s mast without affecting the right of this State to call citizens to answer for crimes committed in the state of Washington. I do not believe RCW 10.43.040 was intended to provide a defense against prosecution after such a proceeding. I do not read that statute to immunize a military person from civilian criminal prosecution because of the imposition of Article 15 nonjudicial punishment by his or her commanding officer!</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">I also find the majority opinion in this case somewhat at odds with our conclusion in <em>State v. Morley, </em>134 Wn.2d 588, 952 P.2d 167 (1998). A majority of this Court rejected the position of the dissent in <em>Morley </em>which would have held that a prior general military court-martial conviction could not be used as a part of a defendant\u2019s criminal history when a judge sentences a criminal defendant in Washington. The majority in this case now holds that a military proceeding is a criminal prosecution which bars a subsequent criminal prosecution by the State. I find it incongruent that military proceedings cannot be used as criminal history for purposes of sentencing criminal defendants, but they are criminal proceedings for the purpose of barring a subsequent criminal prosecution by the State of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">I perceive the majority opinion to be both legally unsound and to have unfortunate practical results. Under the majority, any Article 15 discipline imposed on a servicemember by his or her commanding officer will bar criminal prosecution for a crime committed off of the military base against the citizens of Washington. In Mr. Ivie\u2019s case, he was docked one-half pay for two months, and even though he was endangering Washington citizens by driving off the military base with a suspended driver\u2019s license while intoxicated, the State is absolutely barred from prosecuting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>him for these crimes. I do not think this is what was intended by our Legislature in barring prosecution after a prior criminal prosecution. In light of this Court\u2019s majority decision, legislators should exercise their power to further clarify what I believe was their original intent: that only prior criminal prosecutions, which do not include Article 15 military proceedings, will bar a subsequent criminal prosecution in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Dolliver, Smith, and Talmadge, JJ., concur with Guy, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
