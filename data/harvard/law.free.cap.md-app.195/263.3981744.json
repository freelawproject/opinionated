(\u201cMayavision\u201d), a Spanish language tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>vision station. On July 29, 2008, Mayavision recorded the foreign judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On December 19, 2008, appellants moved to vacate the foreign judgment, arguing that the Louisiana court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. The circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Appellants noted an appeal and present two questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">1. Did the circuit court err in denying appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the entry of the foreign judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">2. Did the circuit court err when it failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether appellants had minimum contacts with Louisiana?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Mr. Lieberman, a Maryland resident and a licensed engineer, owns Lieberman &amp; Walisko, a consulting engineering firm located in Silver Spring, Maryland. Mr. Lieberman\u2019s firm provides consulting engineering services to the telecommunications industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">On May 19, 2005, Ernesto Schweikert, President of Crocodile Broadcasting Corporation, hired Mr. Lieberman and his firm to perform services relating to the operation of a radio station in New Orleans, Louisiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Lieberman sent a letter to Mr. Schweikert, stating: \u201cThis letter will confirm your retention of our firm to represent your group, and any other telecommunications entities owned by your group or you but not specifically named in this agreement in connection with various telecommunications engineering matters as you may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Mr. Schweikert subsequently became President of Mayavision, which was incorporated on February 2, 2006. He then \u201cbegan exploring the opportunity of obtaining a broadcasting license and becoming the first all-Spanish-speaking television channel in Louisiana.\u201d Mr. Lieberman performed services in connection with this venture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The exact scope of Mr. Lieberman\u2019s services to Mayavision is a matter of dispute. Mr. Lieberman contends that he was hired \u201cto provide consulting engineering services,\u201d and that, although he traveled to Louisiana, it was merely to review the \u201cefforts of Mayavision\u2019s local telecommunications engineer ... to get Mayavision\u2019s television station operating and on the air.\u201d Mayavision, on the other hand, asserts that Mr. Lieberman was responsible for the design, acquisition, and installation of a new transmitter and antenna for the television station. It asserts that Mr. Lieberman came up with a plan to remove the old antenna from the station Mayavision acquired and install a new one using a \u201crisky helicopter-based plan.\u201d Mayavision contends that the antenna and transmitter installation was \u201ca complete failure,\u201d which resulted in \u201cgross delays, escalated costs, and exposed Mayavision to substantial liability to other parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">An equipment seller sued Mayavision in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans in Louisiana, alleging breach of contract based on Mayavision\u2019s failure to pay for a \u201cradio transmission system\u201d and other \u201ctransmission equipment.\u201d Mayavision filed an answer and a cross-claim against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In early 2008, Mr. Lieberman \u201creceived a complaint which [Mayavision] filed in Orleans Parish, Louisiana against [him] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and Lieberman &amp; Walisko.\u201d Mr. Lieberman did not respond to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">On May 14, 2008, the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana entered a default judgment against appellants. On May 23, 2008, the court confirmed the judgment in favor of Mayavision against appellants for $313,552 as a result of \u201ctheir breach of contract, negligent performance, and failure to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On July 29, 2008, Mayavision filed a Motion to Enroll Foreign Judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, requesting that the court enroll the Louisiana judgment in Maryland. That same day, the clerk of the circuit court issued a Notice of Foreign Judgment, which certified that the foreign judgment was recorded in the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT2\">CERTIFIED COPY OF JUDGMENT FROM CIVIL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE PARISH OF ORLEANS, STATE OF LOUISIANA, DIV. \u201cG-ll\u201d FILED ON MAY 23, 2008 IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF MAYAVISION, INC[.] AND AGAINST DEFENDANTS MELVYN LIEBERMAN AND LIEBERMAN &amp; WALISKO IN THE AMOUNT OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($313,552.00), ENTERED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On August 27, 2008, appellants filed a Motion to Vacate Entry of Foreign Judgment and Request for the Court to Refuse to Recognize and Enforce Said Judgment. Appellants argued that \u201cthe Louisiana court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants\u201d because appellants did \u201cnot do business in Louisiana and physical \u2018contacts\u2019 with Louisiana are nonexistent.\u201d They asserted that \u201cMr. Lieberman went to Louisiana only at the specific request of plaintiff, otherwise he would have remained in Maryland. In short, they have not had purposeful physical contacts with the forum.\u201d Appellants requested a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On December 19, 2008, Mayavision filed an Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Vacate Entry of Foreign Judgment and Related Relief. Mayavision argued that \u201cthe Louisiana Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>properly exercised \u2018specific\u2019 or \u2018special\u2019 jurisdiction over\u201d appellants. It asserted that, in the course of providing consulting services to Mayavision, Mr. Lieberman \u201c \u2018purposely availed himself of the benefits of doing business in Louisiana and established sufficient \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 \u201d with Louisiana. Mayavision appended seven monthly bills issued by appellants for consulting services from October 4, 2006, through May 30, 2007. These bills indicated that Mr. Lieberman made regular contact with persons in Louisiana by phone and email, and he traveled to Louisiana at least two times to work on the project.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On January 12, 2009, a hearing was held on appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the foreign judgment. Counsel for appellants contended that \u201cthe Louisiana Court lacked personal jurisdiction over Mr. Lieberman for any purpose.\u201d Counsel noted that general jurisdiction requires \u201csubstantial, continuous, and systematic contact between the party ... and the state of Louisiana,\u201d arguing that this was \u201cclearly missing here.\u201d He further argued that Louisiana lacked special jurisdiction over appellant, asserting that \u201cfortuitous contacts\u201d or \u201csingle transaction contacts just don\u2019t cut it.\u201d Counsel stated that \u201ctwo trips down to Louisiana by Mr. Lieberman at the request of his client to come look at some particular thing does not subject him to the jurisdiction of [the] Louisiana Court,\u201d but \u201ceven if it does, the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Court is limited to the purpose of the visit there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Counsel for Mayavision argued that \u201cthis is your classic civil procedure <em>International </em>Shoe[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] minimum contacts argument,\u201d and \u201cthe bottom line is ... defendant purposely availed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>itself of the privilege of conducting business in Louisiana.\u201d Counsel asserted that appellants \u201ccontracted with the plaintiffs in this case for the installation of an antenna and a transmitter for a television station,\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of that project, that business contract ... [Mr. Lieberman] traveled to Louisiana on at least two occasions\u201d and made \u201cnumerous teleconferences, mailings, et cetera back and forth in furtherance of the project.\u201d In counsel\u2019s view, \u201cthere are more than sufficient contacts] that were made between Mr. Lieberman, his company and the State of Louisiana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The court denied appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the judgment, finding that appellants had minimum contacts with Louisiana. The court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">This is an <em>International Shoe </em>minimum contacts due process consideration. Did, in fact, Melvyn Lieberman have sufficient contacts with the State of Louisiana that, whereby he would be put on not[ice], would he be taking advantage of the laws of Louisiana with a project? And would he also be available to be knowing that he would be hailed into court for possible suit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">This was not just a consult over the phone of what [do] you guys think we should do if we\u2019re going to put up a tower. This was a hands on, ongoing representation of the plaintiff on dealing with this tower. That is, Mr. Lieberman was very involved in this for a long period of time dealing with a lot of telephone conferences, dealing with the specs, and dealing with a structure. A structure that was put[ ] up regardless of whether it was put up well or not well, it was a structure that was put up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">But when he has an ongoing teleconference with the people in New Orleans, when he\u2019s taking on more of a role than a consultant, and is actually he is involved in the process of setting it up and how they\u2019re going to move it and what they\u2019re going to do. And he makes trips to the soil of Louisiana on a minimum of two occasions. And we\u2019ll say no more than two occasions. And he\u2019s putting up a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>structure or he\u2019s involved in a structure being put up. He knows full well and he should know well and he\u2019s on notice that if that structure falls and hits somebody, that suit[\u2019s] going to be in New Orleans or in Louisiana. If there\u2019s a suit on the contract or in the installation or the design of anything, that\u2019s going to be in the state of Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">The only saving grace that he had is that the laws of Maryland wouldn\u2019t apply. However, under due process and looking at the laws of Maryland on <em>International Shoe </em>and all the other cases that have been decided by our Court of Appeals, I clearly find that he had minimum contacts in the State of Louisiana. That he would be on notice that he\u2019d be hailed into court on a lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">He also took advantage of the rights and privileges of doing business in Louisiana. He had minimum contacts. Considering all the factors and looking at all the bills, this Court will deny the motion to vacate the entry of foreign judgment [from] the State of Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On January 16, 2009, the circuit court entered an order denying appellants\u2019 motion. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in denying their motion to vacate the recorded judgment. They argue that the Louisiana court lacked personal jurisdiction over them, asserting that they did not have \u201csufficient minimum contacts\u201d with Louisiana to give Louisiana personal jurisdiction over them. Appellants further contend that the assertion of personal jurisdiction by Louisiana did not comport with concerns of \u201creasonableness\u201d and \u201cfairness,\u201d arguing that Maryland was the appropriate forum for litigating the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Mayavision argues that the circuit court properly determined that appellants \u201c \u2018purposefully availed\u2019 himself/themselves of the benefits of doing business in Louisiana.\u201d It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>argues that \u201cLieberman\u2019s connection with Louisiana is sufficient to satisfy the \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 test.\u201d In support, Mayavision lists the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">A. Mayavision retained Lieberman to provide advice and consulting services, and to assist in setting up contacts with third parties to facilitate the installation of the broadcasting antennae that was to be installed in Louisiana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">B. Lieberman regularly invoiced Mayavision for work performed from October 2006 through November 2007. These invoices describe, in detail, the work performed by Lieberman in Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">C. Lieberman regularly communicated with various parties located in Louisiana, including Schweikert, Ernest Harvey (Schweikert\u2019s engineer), Entergy of Louisiana, and Mayavision\u2019s attorney, Romualdo Gonzalez. All of these communications were related to work on the antennae and transmitter that would be installed in Louisiana. Specifically, there are references throughout the invoices relative to various locations being considered for the installation of a broadcasting tower. Locations referenced included New Orleans, Kenner, Chalmette or Gretna \u2014 all of which are located in South Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">D. Lieberman took at least two trips to New Orleans, in direct contradiction to this sworn affidavit that he only went to Louisiana once \u201cat the Plaintiffs request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Mayavision further argues that \u201cthe trial court properly determined that the exercise of jurisdiction by the Louisiana court was fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Article IV, \u00a7 1 of the United States Constitution provides, in part, that \u201c[f]ull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has held that, in order \u201cto fulfill this constitutional mandate, \u2018the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>in the state where it was pronounced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Imperial Hotel, Inc. v. Bell Atl. Tri-Con Leasing Corp., </em>91 Md.App. 266, 270, 603 A.2d 1371 (1992) (quoting <em>Underwriters Nat\u2019l Assurance Co. v. North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Ins. Guar. Assoc, et al, </em>455 U.S. 691, 704, 102 S.Ct. 1357, 71 L.Ed.2d 558 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">There are limits, however, on this provision. \u201c[B]efore one state court is bound by a judgment rendered by a court in another state, it may inquire into the propriety of a foreign court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. If the foreign court did not have jurisdiction, full faith and credit need not be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 603 A.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Maryland\u2019s Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cprovides the mechanism by which a judgment creditor or the attorney of a judgment creditor may enforce a foreign judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272, 603 A.2d 1371. \u201c[W]hen a properly authenticated copy of a foreign judgment is presented for recording and enforcement, the burden is on a resisting party to establish that the rendering court lacked either subject matter or personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Legum v. Brown, </em>395 Md. 135, 145-46, 909 A.2d 672 (2006). Jurisdiction is \u201c \u2018presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence or by the record itself.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 909 A.2d 672 (quoting <em>Adam v. Saenger, 303 </em>U.S. 59, 62, 58 S.Ct. 454, 82 L.Ed. 649 (1938)). When a person offers \u201csome competent evidence\u201d to support an attack on jurisdiction, \u201cthe forum court must make an inquiry and determine from the evidence whether jurisdiction existed. It cannot give full faith and credit to the judgment based solely on the presumption of regularity once competent and persuasive evidence is presented that is facially sufficient to rebut the presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 909 A.2d 672. <em>Accord Oxendine v. SLM Capital Corp., </em>172 Md.App. 478, 485-86, 915 A.2d 1030 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In determining whether another state properly exercised personal jurisdiction over a Maryland resident, the court typically begins with a two-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">First, \u201cthe trial court must determine whether the [foreign state] purports to authorize the assertion of personal jurisdiction ... to the full limits allowed by constitutional due process.\u201d Second, the Maryland court must determine \u201cwhether the exercise of jurisdiction permitted by the [foreign] statute violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Oxendine, </em>172 Md.App. at 486, 915 A.2d 1030 (quoting <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of Stanislaus, Family Support Div. ex rel Jones v. Ricketts, </em>153 Md.App. 281, 332, 836 A.2d 707 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In Louisiana, however, the Supreme Court of Louisiana has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">[T]he sole inquiry into jurisdiction over a nonresident is a one-step analysis of the constitutional due process requirements. If the assertion of jurisdiction meets the constitutional requirements of due process, the assertion of jurisdiction is authorized under the long-arm statute. The limits of Louisiana\u2019s long-arm statute and the limits of constitutional due process are now coextensive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\"><em>Superior Supply Co. v. Assoc. Pipe &amp; Supply Co., </em>515 So.2d 790, 792 (La.1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Thus, our sole inquiry is whether the Louisiana court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in this case was proper under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. To satisfy due process, \u201c \u2018the exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant requires that the defendant have established minimum contacts with the forum state and that to hale him or her into court in the forum state would comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>CSR, Ltd. v. Taylor, </em>411 Md. 457, 476, 983 A.2d 492 (2009) (quoting <em>Bond v. Messerman, </em>391 Md. 706, 722, 895 A.2d 990 (2006)). <em>Accord Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"> The type of contacts required for a State to exercise personal jurisdiction depends on \u201c \u2018the nature of the action brought and the nexus of the contacts to the subject matter of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>CSR, Ltd., </em>411 Md. at 477, 983 A.2d 492 (quoting <em>Camelback Ski Corp. v. Behning, </em>312 Md. 330, 338, 539 A.2d 1107 (1988)). For general jurisdiction, the cause of action can be unrelated to the defendant\u2019s contact with the forum state, <em>Miserandino v. Resort Props., Inc., </em>345 Md. 43, 50, 691 A.2d 208, <em>cert, denied, </em>522 U.S. 953, 118 S.Ct. 376, 139 L.Ed.2d 292, <em>cert, denied, </em>522 U.S. 963, 118 S.Ct. 397, 139 L.Ed.2d 310 (1997), but the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state must be \u201ccontinuous and systematic.\u201d <em>CSR, Ltd., </em>411 Md. at 477, 983 A.2d 492. By contrast, \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d arises \u201cwhere the cause of action arises out of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state.\u201d <em>Miserandino, </em>345 Md. at 50, 691 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Here, the parties agree that the issue involves whether there was specific jurisdiction over appellants. In determining whether specific personal jurisdiction satisfies due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">[W]e consider (1) the extent to which the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the State; (2) whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise out of those activities directed at the State; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>CSR, Ltd., </em>411 Md. at 477, 983 A.2d 492 (quoting <em>Beyond Sys. v.

Appellants challenge the first and third criteria, whether Mr. Lieberman purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the State and whether the exercise of jurisdiction by the Louisiana court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201cit is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rud-zewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (quotation omitted). It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">T[he] \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of \u201crandom,\u201d \u201cfortuitous,\u201d or \u201cattenuated\u201d contacts, or of the \u201cunilateral activity of another party or a third person.\u201d Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant <em>himself </em>that create a \u201csubstantial connection\u201d with the forum State. Thus where the defendant \u201cdeliberately\u201d has engaged in significant activities within a State, or has created \u201ccontinuing obligations\u201d between himself and residents of the forum, he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by \u201cthe benefits and protections\u201d of the forum\u2019s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (citations and footnotes omitted). <em>Accord CSR, Ltd., </em>411 Md. at 479-80, 983 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 464, 105 S.Ct. 2174, the Court held that a Florida court had jurisdiction over a Michigan resident who breached a franchise agreement with a Florida corporation by failing to make payments to the Florida office. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Although the franchisee had not traveled to Florida, the Court explained that jurisdiction \u201cmay not be avoided merely because the defendant did not <em>physically </em>enter the forum State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174.

Upon approval, he entered into a carefully structured 20-year relationship that envisioned continuing and wide-reaching contacts with Burger King in Florida. In light of Rudzewicz\u2019 voluntary acceptance of the long-term and exacting regulation of his business from Burger King\u2019s Miami headquarters, the \u201cquality and nature\u201d of his relationship to the company in Florida can in no sense be viewed as \u201crandom,\u201d \u201cfortuitous,\u201d or \u201cattenuated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 479-80, 105 S.Ct. 2174. The Court concluded that \u201cRudzewicz\u2019 refusal to make the contractually required payments in Miami, and his continued use of Burger King\u2019s trademarks and confidential business information after his termination, caused foreseeable injuries to the corporation in Florida,\u201d making it \u201cpresumptively reasonable for Rudzewicz to be called to account\u201d for such injuries in Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 105 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Similarly, in <em>Hagan v. Stone, </em>742 So.2d 101 (La.Ct.App.1999), the Court of Appeal of Louisiana determined that a Louisiana court had personal jurisdiction over a non-resident who entered into a business relationship with a Louisiana resident. Stone operated a computer training business in Mississippi, and Hagan, a Louisiana resident, sought to open a similar business in Louisiana. <em>Id. </em>at 103. Hagan traveled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Mississippi, and they entered into a contract that would allow Hagan to use Stone\u2019s training materials and business name, in exchange for Stone receiving a percentage of Hagan\u2019s sales. <em>Id. </em>The contract also included a choice of laws provision, indicating that the contract would be enforced \u201cunder the laws of Mississippi.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When disputes arose regarding the quality of the training materials, Hagan filed a breach of contract action against Stone in Louisiana. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The Court of Appeal held that Louisiana had personal jurisdiction over Stone. <em>Id. </em>at 103. It stated that \u201cStone should have reasonably anticipated being haled into a Louisiana court\u201d based upon her \u201cactivities in carrying out the contractual provisions and the long-term economic relationship created by the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa6\">Even despite the fact that the contract was executed in Mississippi, Stone knowingly negotiated and entered into an agreement with two Louisiana businesswomen. Moreover, she was aware that the products she sold to Hagan, and the services for which she trained them, would be utilized in this forum. In fulfillment of agreement terms, Stone communicated frequently with Hagan, sometimes by her own initiation, from 1994 through early 1997, via phone, mail, fax, and courier service. She traveled to Hagan\u2019s facilities on two occasions. For the second meeting, referred to as \u201c1st Quarterly Pow Wow,\u201d Stone prepared an agenda and discussed with and advised Hagan regarding the contract terms, i.e., the quality of the manuals and the quarterly fee, as well as marketing and hiring strategies and other business-related issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Id. </em>The court concluded that Stone\u2019s activities were not \u201cfortuitous\u201d or \u201cattenuated,\u201d but rather, they constituted \u201ca \u2018reaching out\u2019 beyond Mississippi through the creation of a continuing economic relationship with Louisiana citizens sufficient to show that Stone \u2018purposefully availed\u2019 [herself] of the benefits and protections of Louisiana\u2019s laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Applying the above analysis, we conclude that appellants established minimum contacts with Louisiana. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>\u201cpurposefully avail \\ed </em>] [themselves] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quotation omitted). The billing records submitted to the circuit court establish that, from October 2006 until May 2007, appellants billed Mayavision $19,210.74 for its services. The invoices show that Mr. Lieberman communicated with individuals in Louisiana on a regular basis, and he traveled to Louisiana on two occasions, in March and May of 2007, to work on this project.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no question that Mr. Lieberman\u2019s services involved, at the least, consultation regarding the installation of a television antenna and transmitter in Louisiana. The record established that Mr. Lieberman purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in Louisiana, and the minimum contacts test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u201cOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with \u2018fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting <em>Int'l Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 320, 66 S.Ct. 154). Thus, the second part of the due process test concerns the fairness of the exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980), the Supreme Court identified several factors to consider in making this determination: (1) \u201cthe forum State\u2019s interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>adjudicating the dispute\u201d; (2) \u201cthe plaintiffs interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief\u2019; (3) \u201cthe interstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies\u201d; and (4) the \u201cshared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\u201d A litigant seeking to defeat jurisdiction must present a \u201ccompelling case\u201d that \u201cwould render jurisdiction unreasonable.\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Appellants contend that the assertion of personal jurisdiction by Louisiana was not reasonable. They argue: (1) \u201ca greater burden would be placed on Lieberman in litigating this action in Louisiana than would be placed on plaintiff in litigating this action in Maryland\u201d; (2) \u201csince Lieberman resides and conducts business in Maryland, that jurisdiction has a stronger interest than Louisiana in adjudicating this lawsuit\u201d; and (3) \u201cMaryland is a more convenient forum for appellants than Louisiana is for appellee because appellee is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., and is regularly in appearance in legal matters in this area while Lieberman has no operations and does no business in Louisiana.\u201d They further argue that, based on the choice of law provision in the contract, appellants had a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that \u201cthey could only be sued in Maryland,\u201d and that \u201cshould be considered as one more factor directing against a finding of personal jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Mayavision contends that the circuit court \u201ccorrectly determined that Lieberman did not present persuasive evidence to overcome the presumption that the Louisiana courts had jurisdiction to render the original judgment.\u201d It argues that, \u201c[gjiven the locus of the events giving rise to the litigation (Louisiana), and the fact that Lieberman did not consider it a burden to perform services for a Louisiana resident on [a] Louisiana project, Lieberman cannot now conveniently complain that it is unfair to defend\u201d the lawsuit in Louisiana. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>further argues that \u201cLouisiana has a greater interest than Maryland in this litigation\u201d because the project, the documentation, and the majority of the witnesses were in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">With respect to the choice of law provision in the contract, Mayavision asserts that the letter referred to by appellants as the contract predated the incorporation of Mayavision, and the work was for \u201cservices relative to a radio station,\u201d making it \u201centirely irrelevant to this litigation.\u201d Even if relevant, May-avision asserts that the contract \u201cdid not designate, restrict, or define jurisdiction or venue,\u201d and a \u201cLouisiana Court would have had no difficulty applying substantive Maryland law if the letter was found to be relevant to this dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We hold that appellants failed to present a compelling case that jurisdiction in Louisiana was unreasonable. With respect to Louisiana\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute, Louisiana had an interest in the litigation involving a failed effort to install a television transmitter and antenna on a tower in Louisiana, owned by a Louisiana company. <em>See Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 473, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (\u201cA State generally has a \u2018manifest interest\u2019 in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">With respect to the convenience to the parties, the Supreme Court has explained that burden and inconvenience that would render a forum constitutionally unreasonable occurs only in limited circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">Due process limits on jurisdiction do not protect a defendant from all inconvenience of travel, and it would not be sensible to make the constitutional rule turn solely on the number of miles the defendant must travel to the courtroom. Instead, the constitutionally significant \u201cburden\u201d to be analyzed relates to the mobility of the defendant\u2019s defense. For instance, if having to travel to a foreign forum would hamper the defense because witnesses or evidence or the defendant himself were immobile, or if there were a disproportionately large number of witnesses or amount of evidence that would have to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>transported at the defendant\u2019s expense, or if being away from home for the duration of the trial would work some special hardship on the defendant, then the Constitution would require special consideration for the defendant\u2019s interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 559 (citation and footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Here, as Mayavision points out, \u201cbecause the Project was located in Louisiana, most necessary documentation and the majority of witnesses were located there.\u201d Appellants have failed to assert any argument that traveling to Louisiana to defend Mayavision\u2019s lawsuit would have compromised their ability to assert a defense. As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9x\">[T]he Due Process Clause may not readily be wielded as a territorial shield to avoid interstate obligations that have been voluntarily assumed. And because \u201cmodern transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity,\u201d it usually will not be unfair to subject him to the burdens of litigating in another forum for disputes relating to such activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\"><em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting <em>McGee, </em>355 U.S. at 223, 78 S.Ct. 199).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">Finally, appellants point to the choice of law provision in the contract as \u201cone more factor directing against a finding of personal jurisdiction.\u201d As previously discussed, Mayavision disputes the assertion that the contract between appellants and Crocodile Broadcasting applied to the services rendered to Mayavision. Even if the contract did apply, however, \u201cchoice-of-law analysis ... is distinct from minimum-contacts jurisdictional analysis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 481, 105 S.Ct. 2174, and the provision does not preclude a finding that Louisiana had personal jurisdiction over appellants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Under the circumstances here, the exercise of personal jurisdiction by Louisiana comported with \u201c \u2018fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Shoe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>326 U.S. at 320, 66 S.Ct. 154). The circuit court properly denied appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the recorded judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We turn next to appellants\u2019 contention that the court erred when it failed to hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion to vacate entry of the foreign judgment. As appellants note, in <em>Oxendine, </em>172 Md.App. at 485, 915 A.2d 1030, this Court stated that, \u201cwhen a colorable challenge to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is raised, the Maryland court is required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the foreign court had jurisdiction to render the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred when it did not hold an evidentiary hearing regarding the claim that appellants did not have minimum contacts with Louisiana to support Louisiana\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction. Mayavision contends that there was no error entitling appellants to relief, for either of two reasons. First, Mayavision argues that this issue is not preserved because appellants did not object to \u201cthe nature of the proceeding\u201d below. Second, Mayavision argues that the hearing \u201cwas clearly evidentiary,\u201d asserting that \u201cLieberman and Mayavision each submitted a number of exhibits,\u201d including affidavits by both parties and invoices for the work that Mr. Lieberman performed for Mayavision.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Initially, we address Mayavision\u2019s assertion that this claim is not preserved for our review. The appellate courts have held that a litigant may waive an argument regarding the failure of a court to hold an evidentiary hearing by failing to raise the argument in the circuit court. <em>See, e.g., Agurs v. State, </em>415 Md. 62, 75 n. 8, 998 A.2d 868 (2010) (\u201cBy failing to request an evidentiary hearing, the State waived that right.\u201d); <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 376, 749 A.2d 174 (argument that court erred in failing to hold evidentiary hearing to determine whether doctors were joint tortfeasors was waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>because not raised below), <em>cert, denied, </em>359 Md. 669, 755 A.2d 1140 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Here, as appellants note, counsel advised the court at the beginning of the hearing that a party challenging jurisdiction \u201cis entitled to a hearing on the issue of whether there was jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction in the Court down in Louisiana.\u201d At no time, however, did appellants request an evidentiary hearing, request to present evidence to the circuit court other than the exhibits attached to the motion, or assert that they were entitled to a hearing other than that which occurred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 contention on appeal that the hearing afforded was insufficient, therefore, is not preserved for our review. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 211, 946 A.2d 456 (2008) (issues raised for first time on appeal are not preserved for appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Even if preserved, we would find appellants\u2019 contention to be without merit. An evidentiary hearing is a \u201chearing at which evidence is presented, as opposed to a hearing at which only legal argument is presented.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 789 (9th ed.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Here, both parties presented exhibits to the court, including affidavits and copies of invoices from appellants for services rendered to Mayavision. Counsel discussed the exhibits in detail, and the court relied on the exhibits in denying appellants\u2019 motion. In short, the hearing was tantamount to an evidentiary hearing. Even if preserved, appellants\u2019 claim of error is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-12\">.
