Following a trial in May 2008, the court issued a Memorandum and Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>dated May 23, 2008, granting appellee the following: an absolute divorce under \u00a7\u00a7 7 \u2014 103(a)(7) and (8) of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d) of the Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a monetary award in the amount of $215,000; attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $12,500; and the transfer to appellee of title to the parties\u2019 residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On appeal, appellant presents four issues, which we quote but have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">1. Whether, under Family Law Article \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii), the Divorce Court lacked authority to transfer a jointly-owned former marital home the parties agreed was to be treated as non-marital, given that the statute provides that the transfer must be ordered \u201cas an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">2. Whether the value set by the Divorce Court for the entity called Stone Development, LLC, jointly-owned by the parties, solely based upon an interrogatory answer by husband reciting that a Wall Street Journal Online website estimated the value of an LLC Property at $259,621, should be set aside as clearly erroneous and not reasonably representative of the value of the parties\u2019 interest in the LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">3. Whether the Divorce Court abused its discretion and/or erred as a matter of law by granting a monetary award to wife in excess of the value of the marital property the Divorce Court itself determined was titled in the name of husband, resulting in wife\u2019s receiving more than what the court determined was the value of all of the parties\u2019 marital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">4. Whether the Divorce Court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid by a jobless, virtually penniless husband, to a cardiologist wife the Divorce Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>found possessed non-marital property in excess of $1,000,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The parties were married on June 1, 1999. Appellee is a cardiologist and appellant is an attorney licensed to practice law in Texas. No children were born to the union. The parties separated on or about May 19, 2007. On June 6, 2007, appellee filed a Complaint for Absolute Divorce. As of the trial in May 2008, appellant was fifty-four years old and appellee was fifty years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The court issued a Scheduling Order on August 28, 2007, establishing a discovery completion date of December 21, 2007. On October 26, 2007, appellee noticed appellant\u2019s deposition for December 12, 2007. Appellant moved for a protective order as to his deposition, which appellee opposed. On December 6, 2007, the court (Harrington, J.) issued an Order denying appellant\u2019s motion, ordering him to attend his deposition and to provide appellee with all requested discovery within three days. Nevertheless, appellant failed to appear for his deposition or produce the requested discovery. Consequently, appellee filed a Motion for Sanctions and Request for Default Judgment on January 17, 2008, which appellant opposed. On February 29, 2008, the court entered an Order that \u201cprohibited [appellant] from introducing into evidence or referring to any document which was requested by Plaintiff,\u201d and from \u201cmaking a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, alimony, or a monetary award.\u201d It also awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to appellee, in \u201ca sum to be determined at the merits hearing after Defendant has the opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Pursuant to Maryland Rule 9-207, on May 1, 2008, the parties filed a Joint Proposed Statement Concerning Marital and Non-Marital Property (\u201cJoint Statement\u201d or \u201c9-207 Statement\u201d). The parties\u2019 residence, located at 15009 Notley Road in Silver Spring, was owned as tenants by the entirety (\u201cTBE\u201d) but was listed on the 9-207 Statement as \u201cnon-marital.\u201d The parties agreed, however, that title was \u201cJoint.\u201d We shall discuss the 9-207 Statement in more detail, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Trial commenced on May 7, 2008 (Rubin, J.). Appellant did not appear because, according to his lawyer, he was incarcerated on \u201can outstanding warrant stemming from [an earlier] domestic violence incident.\u201d Appellant\u2019s lawyer indicated that he was \u201cwaiving\u201d appellant\u2019s \u201cappearance\u201d and \u201cready to move forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Appellee testified that she is a physician and was the sole financial contributor to the marriage. Describing appellant as \u201cextremely abusive,\u201d Dr. Brown stated that, \u201cthroughout the marriage, Samuel J. Brown abused me physically, mentally, verbally and emotionally,\u201d and asserted that \u201c[t]he incidents are too numerous to mention.\u201d According to appellee, appellant repeatedly \u201chumiliated\u201d her in \u201cpublic places\u201d and \u201ccriticized and denigrated [her] in the presence of others.\u201d She also stated that \u201cevery single day\u201d the parties had \u201can argument about something. He would get ticked off about something ----he would get mad at me at the drop of a hat.... It was like a daily thing.\u201d Therefore, when the parties separated, she \u201cfelt like a weight had been lifted ... off [her] shoulders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Appellee described in detail numerous incidents of physical and verbal abuse during the marriage, which \u201cdestroyed her spirit.\u201d She said: \u201cI was just existing____He destroyed my happiness, and there was no joy in my life.\u201d For example, appellee recounted<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>We were at the hotel [in August 1999] and we had an argument, and during the argument, he backhand slapped me across my face and he split my lower lip, and I tried to get to the phone and, again, he prevented me from making a call. And he prevented me from leaving the hotel room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Appellee also recalled an episode of domestic violence that occurred in November 1999:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">I was sitting on the sofa and I was watching television and he asked me to come to bed and I told him that once that show was over that I would come up. It was only about 15 minutes and he said, come to bed now. And I said I\u2019d be up, you know, after this is over. I just wanted to see the end of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">And then he grabbed my arm, and I fell to the floor and he dragged me from the family room, across the kitchen floor, into the hallway at the foyer and he threw my body up against the wall and he demanded that I get up. And I was afraid to get up because I thought he would just push me again. So I stayed there and then he went and got a pitcher of water and he dumped it on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">With respect to an incident in 2000, appellee testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">I was sitting down on the sofa with my laptop doing some work and he came into the room and he was talking to me and I continued to look at the laptop. And he yelled at the top of his voice, why I would not look at him when he was talking, and he came over and he slammed the computer top down, and it almost caught my fingers. But I jumped back in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">And I had some papers beside me and he took those papers and he just flung them across the room. And then I got up to get the papers and he pushed me and I fell backwards. And I had my glasses on. He grabbed the glasses off of my face and he flung them.... And he prevented me from making a phone call.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Dr. Brown also described an incident that occurred on June 24, 2004, when appellant became \u201cenraged\u201d about a bill. Appellee claimed that appellant repeatedly pushed her, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>fell, and he prevented her from calling 9-1-1. As a result of that incident, appellee obtained a temporary protective order on June 25, 2004.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In addition, appellee testified to an incident on May 19, 2007, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">He attacked me in the exercise room. We had had, he had started this bizarre argument about the smoke detector battery. He had changed it and the battery that he removed from it was different from the one that he had placed in it before, so he asked me had another man come into the house and replaced it.... And then he got into my face and he was saying, shut your big fat mouth____And then he just lost control. He shoved me so hard that I went backwards into the Bowflex machine and then he yelled at me to get up and then when I got up, he started strangling me. And I screamed and he had come to sit down. I sat on a bench and he pushed me off the bench and when I was on the floor, I felt pain in my back and so I went and looked in the mirror and I saw a lot of bruises on my back and I saw that my finger was cut.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Appellee was examined at Holy Cross Hospital on the same date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She obtained a final protective order against appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>on June 21, 2007.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">According to appellee, appellant \u201ccontributed nothing\u201d to the marriage, monetary or non-monetary. She asserted: \u201cThe sole contributor was myself.\u201d Appellee explained that, since the marriage in 1999, she paid all of the mortgage payments for the parties\u2019 home from her salary, in the amount of $2,089.89 per month, as well as all of the real estate taxes. Appellee also paid all of the mortgage payments after the parties separated. In addition, appellee claimed that she \u201cdid all of the laundry____Some cooking. General upkeep of the house,\u201d while appellant only cooked \u201csporadically.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Because appellant is not licensed to practice law in Maryland, appellee \u201csuggested [to appellant] that he could do the medical billing for [her] medical practice.\u201d She stated: \u201cHe did the medical billing for [her] cardiology practice sporadically from 2000 to 2004,\u201d as well as \u201cthe first couple of months of 2005.\u201d She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">That stopped because I found out that he wasn\u2019t doing it properly. He was not following-up on denials from the insurance companies. And he was not billing the patients for their portions of the bills and the income, the thing that made me look at that was that the income for my practice, I do private practice and all of a sudden the income was very low. And I looked into it and found out that he was not doing it appropriately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>And I brought that to his attention and he told me I should do the billing, and so then I hired a professional billing company which took over in 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">According to appellant, there \u201cwas a dramatic increase in [her] salary after the professional billing company took over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Appellee testified that she and appellant are joint owners of Stone Development, LLC (\u201cStone Development\u201d), a \u201ccompany that [appellant] started.\u201d The parties agreed in their 9-207 Statement that Stone Development was a marital asset. Ap-pellee testified that the purpose of the business \u201cwas to purchase foreclosure properties and then to sell them at a profit.\u201d According to appellee, appellant \u201chad some plans to build on the land and sell.\u201d She claimed that appellant used $50,000 from their Vanguard account, to which she solely contributed, and purchased \u201c[f]ive parcels of land in Michigan.\u201d In addition, she claimed that appellant purchased a house and a vacant lot in Indianapolis, after she \u201cloaned\u201d appellant $25,610.00 for the down payment. Further, appellee claimed that appellant obtained a home equity loan against the Notley Road house for $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Appellee introduced into evidence Mr. Brown\u2019s Supplemental Answers To Plaintiffs Interrogatories, produced by appellant on October 25, 2007. In response to appellee\u2019s Interrogatory 9, which sought information regarding property owned by either or both parties, appellant said that he owns \u201ca home at 15009 Notley Road, Silver Spring jointly with [appellee]. The fair market value estimated from the Wall Street Journal website ... is $782,348.00.\u201d Further, appellant stated that he and appellee \u201cown ... Stone Development, LLC, 2112 North Park Ave. Indianapolis, Indiana, which owns a house and contiguous lot. The fair market value estimated from [the] Wall Street Journal web site [is] $259,621.\u201d Appellant continued: \u201cHowever, this property is subject to a lawsuit, entitled Samuel J. Brown, Stone Development, LLC v. Samuel Standard, et al. Marion Superior Court No. 49D11-0609-PL-37775.\u201d Appellant also stated: \u201cThe purpose of the [lawsuit] is to obtain complete ownership from Samuel Standard be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cause he committed construction and loan fraud using the 25k home equity loan for purchase and home remodeling in 2006.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoM\">In addition, appellant averred in his interrogatory answer: Beginning in August 2004, I purchased auction property to develop as Stone Development, LLC. The LLC owns 5 vacant pieces of Michigan properties for development with another party. My job in August 2004 was to purchase property to develop in Michigan but property value fell due to bad economic times in the Detroit area so I didn\u2019t proceed with [the] development project because that would have cost my family money. The contractor that I set my plans with was sued in Indianapolis in September 2006 for fraud on Stone Development. My wife abused me verbally for these failures, as she does in this divorce, stating that I never worked, and that I never did anything. It is not true that I did no work. I was working my head off. However, the income was prevented by crime and fraud of others as Bernice knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">I do not know the current fair market value of these properties. Parcel lots of vacant land are difficult to value. I have produced appraisals of three of these properties. The LLC owns the deed of these properties with Samuel J. Standard. The purpose of the law suit is to obtain complete ownership from Samuel Standard because he committed construction and loan fraud using the 25k home equity loan for purchase and home remodeling in 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">At trial, appellee ascribed \u201c[a]bout the same value\u201d to Stone Development as did appellant in his answer to Interrogatory 9. She explained that the value was based on the \u201cassessments that we received.\u201d In addition, appellee opined that the Notley Road home was valued at $720,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Appellee testified that the parties own a 2002 Lexus, which was in appellant\u2019s possession. According to appellee, she was paying $635 per month for the car, which she valued at $28,000, and which had an outstanding loan balance of $22,192.84. In addition, appellee testified about a joint Vanguard account, which she valued at approximately $32,000 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of March 31, 2008. Appellee and appellant also owned an E-trade account, which appellee valued at $38,746.12 as of March 31, 2008; a Janus IRA account titled to appellant, which appellee valued at $9,916.05 as of July 27, 2007; and a TIAA-CREF account titled to appellant, which appellee valued at $32,805.17 as of July 27, 2008. While appellee acknowledged that the Janus and TIAA-CREF accounts were marital property, she indicated that the contributions toward those accounts came from her salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In their Joint Statement, the parties listed nineteen items as marital property, including Stone Development and appellee\u2019s medical practice. Appellant claimed a total fair market value of $1,199,519 for the marital property, while appellee claimed a value of $510,675.33. Appellant asserted that Stone Development was titled to him, while appellee asserted it was jointly titled. Appellant represented that Stone Development had a fair market value of zero, while appellee claimed it had a fair market value of $294,600. Appellant valued his wife\u2019s medical practice at $1,000,000; appellee valued it at zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">With respect to the eight items that the parties agreed were titled to appellant, Mr. Brown represented that they had a combined fair market value of zero. In contrast, appellee assigned the items a value of $66,670.92.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The 9-207 Statement also included many items that the parties agreed were not marital property, including the Notley Road home. The parties agreed that all of these items were titled to appellee, with the exception of the Notley Road home, which they designated as \u201cJoint.\u201d Appellant assigned a total fair market value of $1,344,073.60 for the non-marital property, while appellee valued it at $1,991,003.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Appellee testified that the items classified as \u201cnon-marital\u201d were so designated because \u201c[she] purchased all those before [she] got married.\u201d In addition, the 9-207 Statement included a column that was titled \u201cReason Why Non-Marital.\u201d The word \u201cPre-Marital\u201d was used for each of the non-marital items. However, as we discuss in more detail, <em>infra, </em>with respect to the Notley Road property, the printed word \u201cPre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Marital\u201d was crossed out by Joel R. Zuckerman, one of appellant\u2019s attorneys; he handwrote \u201cBy Agreement\u201d in the same box, along with his initials, \u201cJRZ.\u201d Directly below those initials are the handwritten initials \u201cDR/By JRZ,\u201d indicating that Zuckerman signed for Darin Rumer, one of appellee\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Appellee purchased the home on Notley Road in 1994 for $444,000, with a mortgage of $399,600. At the time of the marriage on June 1, 1999, the mortgage balance was $345,079.30. According to appellee, on February 27, 2002, she signed a quitclaim deed, a copy of which was introduced, changing title to the home from her name alone to both parties, as tenants by the entirety. Appellee claimed that appellant insisted that she add his name to the title. In the Joint Statement, the parties agreed that the mortgage balance on the home was $350,539.41, which included a \u201c2nd Trust of $53,000,\u201d i.e., a home equity loan. Appellee explained that, at the time she added appellant\u2019s name to the title, there was no home equity loan drawn on the property. Appellee testified that appellant used $25,000 of the home equity loan proceeds to purchase an investment property for Stone Development, and $3,000 represented interest, late fees, and penalties. But, she did not know what appellant did with the remaining $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">As to the parties\u2019 Notley Road residence, the following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Was there ever any agreement between the two of you that this would was [sic] considered non-marital property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Dr. Brown, at the time of the refinance, at the time that you put your husband\u2019s name on the mortgage, on the deed as tenants by the entireties. Did the two of you sign any kind of an agreement relating to the home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did the two have any verbal agreements relating to the character or the nature of the ownership, marital or not, of the home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">[APPELLEE]: No. We did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: At any time since the tenancy by the entirety was established, did you and your husband sign any agreement relating to the nature of marital versus non-marital interest in the home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And sitting here today, is there any agreement that you\u2019re aware of with regard to the home being not marital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And, in fact, from the time that you married Mr. Brown in 1999, how were the mortgage payments paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">[APPELLEE]: The mortgage payments were paid from my salary. The sole contributor was myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Any agreements that your salary was not going to be marital property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Appellee testified that she was asking the court to transfer title of the Notley Road home to her. Further, she indicated that she wanted the court to grant a monetary award to her, in recognition of her non-marital interest in the home, prior to the marriage. She also claimed that she was seeking a monetary award because she made all of the mortgage payments and the tax payments for the parties\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">In addition, appellee testified that, in connection with the divorce proceedings, she incurred attorney\u2019s fees of $26,442.97. She claimed that she incurred additional charges because appellant \u201cfailed to produce documents that were requested and extra work had to be done to obtain those documents,\u201d and because appellant sought to avoid his deposition and then failed to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Richard Owens, a real estate appraiser, was called by appellee. He opined that the value of the Notley Road home was $720,000 as of May 3, 2008.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> His appraisal report was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on May 23, 2008 (entered June 4, 2008). The trial court granted appellee an absolute divorce based on appellant\u2019s \u201ccruelty and excessively vicious conduct.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">Bernice testified exhaustively about the nature of the mental and physical abuse perpetrated on her by Samuel throughout the course of the marriage. She testified as well that there is no reasonable expectation of reconciliation. There is no need to recount the many instances of physical and mental violence she suffered at the hands of her husband. The court finds as a first level fact that Bernice is a credible witness and an accurate reporter of events. Her testimony on the issue of cruelty and excessively vicious conduct by Samuel was corroborated by two police officers, as well as documentary evidence.[ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Notably, the court determined that the Notley Road home was not marital property, based on the parties\u2019 Joint Statement. Nevertheless, the court ordered that \u201ctitle to the Notley Road property be transferred to Bernice under \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii)(l) of the Family Law Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Further, the court found that the total current value of all marital property, less marital debt, was $408,334.38.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Of that sum, the court valued Stone Development at $259,621, and then deducted debt of $25,000, leaving a net value of $234,621. In assigning that value, the court relied on appellant\u2019s answer to appellee\u2019s Interrogatory 9, stating: \u201cThis answer is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>admission and is substantive evidence of the fact admitted.... It also is a proper opinion of value by an owner of property who was active in its acquisition and development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">With respect to appellee\u2019s request for a monetary award, the court considered all of the statutory factors enumerated in F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and granted appellee a monetary award of $215,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It reasoned, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>Factor 1:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The credible evidence of record is manifest that [appellee] contributed nearly all of the monetary contributions from the inception of the marriage. Although [appellant] is well educated, and a licensed attorney, there is no explanation in the record as to why he did not work during the marriage except for a brief period in Bernice\u2019s office as a billing assistant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">The credible evidence of record shows that although [appellant] was capable of gainful employment, [appellant] has been content to live off of the earning capacity of his wife even though he is highly educated and skilled.... Although Samuel created Stone Development LLC, he borrowed against the value of Notley Road to do so, and there is no credible evidence that he ever earned a dime for the family from the venture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">There also is no credible evidence that Samuel made any significant non-monetary contributions to the family.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the contrary, the credible evidence shows that Bernice made nearly all of the monetary and non-monetary contributions during the marriage. This factor weighs heavily in favor of Bernice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>Factor 2:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">Both principle [sic] non-cash assets (Notley Road and Stone Development) are jointly owned. Notley Road has a fair market value of $720,000, with a first trust of $850,539.41 and a second trust of $53,000. Stone Development LLC has a fair market value of $259,621. Known debt on this venture is $25,000, leaving a net value of $234,621. As set forth in section 2 of the Rule 9-207 statement, each party has no insignificant marital cash assets. The value of all real property and marital property interests of the parties is roughly equivalent. Bernice does have non-marital case [sic] equivalent assets, described in detail in section 3 of the Rule 9-207 statement, in excess of $1,158,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\n<em>Factor 3:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">Bernice has her ongoing salary ($150,000) from her medical practice. There is no cogent evidence of record as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>why Samuel cannot currently make an equivalent living or why he has not made any significant earnings for the last ten years. Although Bernice has significant premarital cash assets (primarily retirement accounts), there is no competent evidence that Samuel contributed to the growth of these accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Factor W-</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">Manifestly, Samuel caused the breakup of the marriage. Here, \u201cthe fault determination is obvious.\u201d <em>Simonds v. Simonds, </em>165 Md.App. 591 at 622 [886 A.2d 158] (2005) (Adkins, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Factor 8:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">In this case, Bernice made all material economic contributions to the Notley Road property. Each party made separate contributions to their retirement accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\n<em>Factor 9:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">In this case, Bernice made all material economic contributions to her own retirement account acquired before the marriage. The record is silent on who contributed to Samuel\u2019s retirement accounts. As noted earlier, Bernice contributed the down payment for the Notley Road property, and made each and every mortgage payment on the property since its purchase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\n<em>Factor 11:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">The court finds that the equities of this case militate strongly in favor of transferring title to the Notley Road property to Bernice.[] She acquired the property in 1994, made the down payment for its acquisition, and made every mortgage payment before and during the marriage. Samuel \u201cinvested\u201d $25,000 from the equity in this property in Stone Development LLC, but Bernice made each payment due on the home equity line. In addition, Samuel took $25,000 from the equity line for his personal living expenses and, because he made no payments on the equity line, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>bank imposed $3,000 in late charges and interest. The evidence discloses that Samuel had not paid a penny towards the home equity loan. . . . [<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The court also awarded legal fees to appellee of $12,500, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">The credible record evidence relating to the statutory factors under \u00a7\u00a7 7-107 and 8-214, of the Family Law Article supports some award of attorneys\u2019 fees to [appellee]. <em>See Richards v. Richards, </em>166 Md.App. 263, 283-85, 888 A.2d 364 (2005). [Appellant] offered essentially no defense to [appellee\u2019s] request for a divorce or the issues regarding marital property (apart from whether Notley Road was marital or non-marital).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">His refusal to cooperate in the discovery process lead [sic] the Administrative Judge to issue a preclusion order as a discovery sanction and leave to the trial judge the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees under Maryland Rule 2-433(c). In this case, [appellant\u2019s] failure to appear for deposition and to produce documents was willful and in bad faith. [Appellant\u2019s] conduct during discovery was not substantially justified and, charitably, can be characterized as deliberately obstructive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">The court has carefully reviewed the detailed time entries submitted by [appellee\u2019s] counsel. Having reviewed counsel\u2019s bills, and having made an independent assessment, the court will award [appellee] legal fees of $12,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">Appellant challenges the court\u2019s transfer of title to the Notley Road home to appellee. Before addressing the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>contentions, it is helpful to review in more detail what transpired below.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Appellant initially characterized the Notley Road home as marital property on his proposed 9-207 Statement, filed on February 14, 2008. Appellee introduced that statement into evidence. However, at trial appellant\u2019s attorney contended that the parties\u2019 counsel ultimately entered into a binding agreement, contained in the final Rule 9-207 Statement, filed May 1, 2008, to the effect that the marital residence was non-marital, notwithstanding that the parties held title as tenants by the entirety. Appellee\u2019s counsel disagreed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This dispute consumed a great deal of the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">THE COURT: ... Well, let me just ask counsel, why would Section 8-201(e)(2) of the Family Law Article, which defines marital property. It says, \u201cMarital property includes any interest in real property, held by the parties as tenants by the entirety unless the real property is excluded by valid agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">Why would that statutory section not be largely, if not completely, dispositive of the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Because there is a valid agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">THE COURT: And the valid agreement is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The 9-207 statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">THE COURT: All right. So your position ... is the marital property statement.... That\u2019s the valid agreement that you\u2019re referencing to take this real estate out of the general rule of 8-201(e)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>THE COURT: And you say that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not what you agreed to. And you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not the kind of valid agreement referred to in the statute, etcetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. And assuming they think that there is an agreement, there was no meeting of the minds, so there is no agreement. That is our position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The court initially indicated that it was not bound by the parties\u2019 characterizations of property on the 9-207 Statement, noting that \u201cthe court has to decide whether something is marital or non-marital.\u201d But, appellant\u2019s counsel insisted that the court is \u201cstuck\u201d with the parties\u2019 agreement as reflected on the 9-207 Statement. He posited: \u201cThe reason for the 9-207 is to narrow the issues for the Court, which is what we believe we were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Appellee\u2019s counsel disputed that the 9-207 Statement was \u201cbinding\u201d on the court. Moreover, she referred to her proposed 9-207 Statement, sent to appellant\u2019s counsel about a week before trial, in which she listed the home as \u201cdisputed,\u201d and \u201c[n]ot as non-marital,\u201d and recalled that appellant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201c \u201cWe\u2019re going to stipulate that we have no claim to it and it\u2019s not marital and we\u2019re not asking for anything.\u2019\u201d The court said: \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is it\u2019s not marital and because it\u2019s not marital and he\u2019s agreeing it\u2019s not marital, the Court can\u2019t put it in the pot, if you will, as part of the determination of whether and the extent to which to make a monetary award.\u201d Appellee\u2019s counsel answered: \u201cIt\u2019s marital.\u201d But, she also asserted that, at the very least, 21.57% of the asset was not marital, because the home was acquired by appellee before the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... You have heard absolutely no evidence that the marital home is not marital property. You heard Dr. Brown testify, she transferred as tenants by the entirety, that there were never any agreements written or oral, nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>So now what [appellant\u2019s counsel] wants to do is he wants to say that the 9-207 statement, which we don\u2019t agree what it means, means that the house is not marital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9W\">THE COURT: You\u2019re saying that notwithstanding the passing of all the various papers, etcetera, that at the end of the day there\u2019s not sufficient credible evidence for the Court to conclude there was mutual assent and a meeting of the minds and consequently there was no contract and therefore there is no valid agreement under the statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ah-dedup-0\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Correct. And no stipulation either. Because there was a dispute between counsel about what this means. * * * And there is no valid agreement. And this is real property. We need something in writing. I don\u2019t think the 9-207 statement, which nobody seems to agree what it means is going to rise to the level of saying that the marital home is not marital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">A couple of things about the house, Your Honor. Maryland follows the objective law [of] contract. It is from an objective point of view, looking at that 9-207 statement, it\u2019s clear that the parties\u2019 intention was to exclude that property.... I don\u2019t think that the Court can do anything. It\u2019s not marital property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Referring again to the 9-207 Statement, the court inquired: \u201cAnd what it says, it\u2019s ambiguous, is it not? On page four, description of property, Notley Road, and then it says, by agreement. It doesn\u2019t say what the agreement is. It doesn\u2019t say anything. It just says, by agreement. By agreement what?\u201d According to Zuckerman, appellee\u2019s counsel \u201cacquiesced\u201d to characterizing the home as non-marital, and therefore the court lacked \u201cthe power\u201d to transfer title to appellee. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">I called them up and I said, we wanted to put by agreement underneath it and they said fine. Go ahead and do that. And I did. I spoke with Mr. Rumer that day and it wasn\u2019t because we were giving up an interest in the home. We can\u2019t give up his interest. It\u2019s tenants by an entirety. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>he can\u2019t just walk away from that. The house to be re-titled as tenants [in] common upon divorce and that would be, the parties would have this asset together moving forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">Mr. Maxwell elaborated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">The first point is that the joint statement is not an attempt by the parties to proffer to the Court their characterization of property under one or the other. It is actually an agreement, they reach agreement in some respects, whether they\u2019re right or wrong, with respect to the category of non-marital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">The statute itself permits parties to agree that property which otherwise would be marital without any question to be treated as non-marital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">Parties have a right to exclude property from consideration as marital property....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">The issue here is not whether we have properly characterized it and therefore placed it into category two. The issue is whether we have agreed, not an issue, we did agree the operative instrument is this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">Our position just succinctly put is that attorneys, as agents of principals acting within the scope of their authority, as required by rule, using the language that the rule requires, enter into an agreement, stipulation, call it what you want.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The court asked: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s more than an admission. It\u2019s a binding contract and unless there are good and valid reasons under [the] law of contracts.... \u201d Mr. Maxwell answered, \u201cYes. I would say that \u2014 .\u201d He added: \u201c[T]here was a deed to them as tenants by the entirety____ Under the law, under this particular section, the definition of marital property under 8-201 provides that property of tenants by the entirety is marital property, unless excluded by valid agreement like this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Appellee\u2019s counsel again insisted: \u201cIt\u2019s marital property.\u201d Moreover, she claimed that the 9-207 Statement was \u201c[a]bso-lutely\u201d ambiguous, was \u201cnot a binding agreement\u201d or a stipulation, and was, instead, \u201ca roadmap to help the Court.\u201d Asserting that appellant\u2019s counsel had assured her he was \u201cgoing to waive any claim\u201d to the Notley Road home, Ms. Haspel argued: \u201cI guess it\u2019s a factual issue. Because I will tell you that the[r]e was no agreement that this was not marital property....\u201d In addition, she claimed that the handwritten words \u201cBy agreement\u201d were added by appellant\u2019s counsel without her approval. Appellee\u2019s lawyer also claimed that, under F.L. \u00a7 8-205, the court could transfer ownership in a jointly titled principal residence, even if it is not marital.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">The following exchange is pertinent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Now, we still believe that the Notley Road property titled tenants by the entirety under statute is marital property and we still\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">THE COURT: Unless excluded by a valid agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abj\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And we contend there is no valid agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">THE COURT: ... So, there\u2019s no debate as I see it as to the, but for a valid agreement, you\u2019d be in the marital property hopper and we would go along our merry way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">But now it appears that there was an agreement, so the question is, was there an agreement? It is a valid agreement? And if so, what are the terms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, it appears that our understanding was that he was giving up the claim to the house because it was very clear that the majority of the money came from her and from the pre-marital interest and all the money that she earned during the marriage____ That\u2019s what we understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">THE COURT: And I need to decide it. I don\u2019t have the factual record to decide it. We\u2019ll have to schedule some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>thing and we\u2019ll do it soon. Was there an agreement? If so, what are its terms? Because what will flow, flows from there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And as you heard from testimony from the plaintiff, no agreement; she\u2019s not aware of any agreement; there was no agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">THE COURT: I heard what she said, but I also have to, I can\u2019t ignore the writing that\u2019s staring at me. It says agreement. All the lawyers signed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, actually, we didn\u2019t sign those. Mr. Zuckerman initialed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">THE COURT: Well, but if he signed it with assent, I mean, you know, we frequently as a courtesy, we\u2019re given permission by opposing counsel to sign their name and we sign their name, we put a slash and put the initials so nobody thinks we\u2019re trying to snucker anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: The assent to this, such as it was, was predicated on the understanding that he was not going to be pursuing this asset. That this was now recognized as our client\u2019s asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">The court determined to hold an evidentiary hearing so that it could \u201cfind facts.\u201d The court explained: \u201cI can\u2019t do it just based on you say, they say, because what you\u2019re saying is so different that you both can\u2019t be right.\u201d Accordingly, the court held an evidentiary hearing on May 13, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Cosma Spassiani, a paralegal in the office of appellee\u2019s attorneys, testified that what he regarded as the final version of the Joint Statement was hand delivered on May 1, 2008, \u201cfor Mr. Zuckerman\u2019s signature.\u201d He then received a phone call from Zuckerman, who asked to speak to Rumer. Spassia-ni explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">Mr. Zuckerman indicated that in our previous conversation, he had requested edits and he forgot to request an additional addition to the 9-207 statement. He apologized and said it had slipped his mind, and said that he wanted the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cby agreement\u201d to be added to the 9-207 statement with reference to the marital home or the home of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMO\">Spassiani told Zuckerman that \u201cRumer was with a client\u201d and that Zuckerman would have to \u201cspeak to Mr. Rumer and get his approval.\u201d When asked if Zuckerman said anything to him \u201cabout striking the word \u2018premarital\u2019 [on the 9-207 Statement] and replacing it with any other words,\u201d Spassiani replied: \u201cNo, he indicated that he wanted to make an addition, a replacement or a redaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Spassiani relayed Zuckerman\u2019s message to Rumer, who instructed Spassiani to inform Zuckerman \u201cthat the term \u2018by agreement\u2019 could be added as long as it was added as a footnote to that portion of the 9-207 statement.\u201d Spassiani \u201cconveyed\u201d that information to Zuckerman, who told him that \u201che wasn\u2019t going to write it in a footnote, but just write it in the box to make it quicker.\u201d According to Spassiani, there was no communication between counsel \u201cafter the 9-207 statement left our office.\u201d Spassiani was asked: \u201cDid Mr. Zucker-man ever speak to Mr. Rumer and get his authority, as far as you know, to strike \u2018premarital\u2019 and replace it with the word \u2018by agreement\u2019?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Monica Rager testified that she was the person who delivered the 9-207 Statement to Zuckerman on May 1, 2008, and there were \u201cno handwritten marking or initials\u201d on the document. She recalled that Zuckerman told her he needed to speak to Rumer, but Rumer was with a client. After Zucker-man received a call from Spassiani, Zuckerman \u201csigned the paper.\u201d Thereafter, she and Zuckerman\u2019s legal assistant filed the 9-207 Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Linda Linden, another paralegal employed by appellee\u2019s attorneys, agreed that she was \u201cpart of the creation of the last version [of the 9-207 Statement] that then got delivered to Mr. Zuckerman\u2019s office.\u201d She indicated that Rumer received a letter from Zuckerman, dated April 25, 2008, \u201cattaching what is titled \u2018Plaintiffs Proposed Statement Concerning Marital and Non-marital Property\u2019 in which Mr. Zuckerman made some handwritten modifications to that statement, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>had originally sent over to him a day or two prior.\u201d That version of the 9-207 Statement was also admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Notley Road property initially appeared on that 9-207 Statement as non-marital property; it was deemed \u201cPreMarital.\u201d Linden noticed that Zuckerman had inserted a handwritten footnote on the bottom of the page, concerning stock, mutual funds, and retirement accounts. Because \u201cit appeared that there was a dispute based on the footnote\u201d added by Zuckerman, Linden \u201cmoved all of the items in No. 2 [non-marital] into \u2018Disputed Property\u2019\u201d [Section 3]. Linden faxed it to appellant\u2019s counsel at 11:56 a.m. on May 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">According to Linden, she was then \u201cinstructed to move the items that were in Section 3 [disputed] back up to Section 2 [non-marital],\u201d because she \u201cunderstood that Mr. Zuckerman wanted all of the assets moved back up to the premarital section.\u201d It was her \u201cunderstanding [that] there was an agreement that those were Dr. Brown\u2019s premarital assets,\u201d which included the Notley Road property. When asked if Zuckerman spoke to her on May 1, 2008, with respect to the Notley Road property, \u201cregarding crossing out the word \u2018premarital\u2019 and changing it to \u2018by agreement,\u2019 \u201d Linden answered: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Darin Rumer testified that, as of the morning of May 1, 2008, the Notley Road property was listed as \u201cdisputed\u201d on the Joint Statement. Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel called Rumer and \u201csaid something to the effect of \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you trying to pull something? Everything [on the 9-207] is in Category 3 [disputed]?\u2019 \u201d Rumer replied: \u201c \u2018Yes it\u2019s disputed. Your client is claiming a monetary award for these items.\u2019 \u201d According to Rumer, Brown\u2019s attorney responded: \u201c \u2018We\u2019re not disputing that it\u2019s your client\u2019s premarital property, move it all back to 2 [non-marital].\u2019 \u201d Rumer explained that the request of appellant\u2019s counsel \u201cmade sense [because appellant] could no longer receive a monetary award [due to the discovery sanction], his only claim was of marital interest, so, you know, it just seemed to make sense to move it all back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>premarital.\u201d Linden then moved the house to non-marital property and faxed the revised version to appellant\u2019s counsel. Rumer added that the house was listed as \u201cnon-marital\u201d because it \u201cwas acquired by one party before the marriage,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not marital by virtue of being a premarital asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Sometime later on May 1, Rumer\u2019s paralegal notified him that Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel had called and \u201cwanted to make a change.\u201d Rumer testified that he instructed his paralegal to have Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel \u201cput [the change] in a footnote.\u201d However, Rumer claimed that appellant\u2019s counsel changed the final Rule 9-207 Statement, without permission. Although the Notley Road property was in the \u201cnon-marital\u201d category, it had been designated as \u201cPre Marital\u201d; Zuckerman struck the word \u201cpremarital\u201d and added the words \u201cby agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Nevertheless, Rumer agreed that appellee had designated the property as non-marital in her earlier proposed Rule 9-207 Statement, which she filed on February 11, 2008. But, he claimed: \u201cIt\u2019s a marital asset by virtue of being T-by-E, tenant\u2019s [sic] by the entirety. Our client\u2019s claim is to how it should be divided as though it\u2019s premarital.\u201d According to Rumer, \u201c[appellee\u2019s] position has been the same throughout, even in her pleadings, that she had a premarital interest in the home.\u201d Further, Rumer testified that he and appellant\u2019s counsel \u201chad a meeting of the minds, it was premarital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The following exchange is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">THE COURT: Your position was that the Notley Road property was premarital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">[MR. RUMER]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">THE COURT: That was your position. Right, wrong or indifferent, that was your position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">[MR. RUMER]: T-by-E, but she had a premarital interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af2\">THE COURT: I understand. You sent it over to Mr. Zuckerman\u2019s. He looked at it. He talked to your paralegal. Your response to whatever it was that Mr. Zuckerman said was \u201cStick it in a footnote.\u201d Is that fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">[MR. RUMER]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>THE COURT: Did you and Mr. Zuckerman have an agreement as to the status of the Notley Road property? Did you have a meeting of the minds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">[MR. RUMER]: When we \u2014 yes. When we had a meeting of the minds, it was premarital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As noted, in its Memorandum and Order of May 23, 2008, the court found that the Notley Road property was not marital property. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">The principal item in dispute is the parties\u2019 marital home, located at 15009 Notley Road, Silver Spring, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">When the General Assembly amended the Marital Property Act in 1994 (after <em>Grant v. Zich, </em>300 Md. 256 [477 A.2d 1163] (1984) and <em>Watson v. Watson, </em>77 Md.App. 622 [551 A.2d 505] (1989)), it expressly provided that any real estate held as tenants by the entirety during the marriage is marital property, as long as the property was so owned by the parties after the effect date, October 1, 1994____Hence, the residence is marital property unless it has been excluded by a valid agreement under \u00a7 8-201(e)(2) of the Family Law Article. <em>See Golden v. Golden, </em>116 Md.App. 190, 202-02 [695 A.2d 1231] (1997); <em>Falise v. Falise, </em>63 Md.App. 574, 581 [493 A.2d 385] (1985).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">At trial, Samuel (through counsel), in response to a question from the court, agreed that the marital residence is marital property as defined by \u00a7 8-201(e)(2) of the Family Law Article unless \u201cexcluded by valid agreement.\u201d[] This concession, made in open court, is binding on Samuel. <em>Prince Georges Properties, Inc. v. Rogers, </em>275 Md. 582, 587-88 [341 A.2d 804] (1975). <em>See also Cloverfields Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Seabreeze Properties, Inc., </em>280 Md. 382, 403-04 [373 A.2d 935] (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">The focus of Samuel\u2019s argument that the marital residence is not marital property is the parties\u2019 final Rule 9-207 statement____[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] This statement lists the marital residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>in section 2 of the Rule 9-207 statement, which says: \u201cThe parties agree that the following property is not marital property ...\u201d The first item listed in section 2 is the Notley Road property. Although he had initially characterized the marital residence as marital property in an earlier filing ... Samuel contended at trial that counsel for both parties ultimately agreed in the final Rule 9-207 statement, filed with the court on May 1, 2008, that the subject real estate was non-marital. According to Samuel, the final Rule 9-207 statement is a \u201cvalid agreement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8-201(e)(2) of the Family Law Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">Bernice disagrees for several reasons. First, Bernice notes that she testified at trial that the residence was marital property, pointing to the quit claim deed to Samuel during the marriage in 2002, which changed title from fee simple to tenants by the entirety. Second[,] Bernice\u2019s counsel and paralegals testified (at the May 13, 2008 proceeding) that they listed the property on the Rule 9-207 statement as non-marital for the reason that the house was \u201cpre-marital.\u201d That is, because the house initially was acquired (and paid for) by Bernice before the marriage. Bernice\u2019s characterization of the reason why the property was non-marital was not accepted by Samuel\u2019s counsel, who inserted the words \u201cby agreement\u201d on the Rule 9-207 statement without the consent of Bernice\u2019s counsel. Bernice\u2019s counsel testified that although he gave Samuel\u2019s counsel permission to place a footnote on the statement, he did not agree that the Notley Road property was non-marital by reason of an \u201cagreement\u201d between the parties. Samuel\u2019s counsel did not testify regarding his \u201camendment\u201d of the Rule 9-207 statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The parties (actually their counsel) certainly have muddied the waters and have presented the court with a dilemma. In one sense, Bernice has amply demonstrated[] that the Notley Road [property] was marital because it was held by the parties as tenants by the entirety during the marriage on the date of trial.... But the parties\u2019 joint Rule 9-207 statement specifically classified the Notley Road property as non-marital. Although the parties disagree as to the reasons why each characterized Notley Road as non-marital, this is a distinction without legal significance.[] As a matter of contract construction, the Rule 9-207 statement is not ambiguous. Consequently, \u201cwe give effect to its plain meaning and do not contemplate what the parties may have subjectively intended by certain terms at the time of formation.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16 [919 A.2d 700] (2007) (footnote omitted). <em>See also Painewebber [Paine-Webber</em>] <em>Inc., v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 414 [768 A.2d 1029] (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Moreover, the Rule 9-207 statement filed in this case is a stipulation of fact by the parties through their counsel. <em>See Beck v. Beck, </em>112 Md.App. 197, 205-08 [684 A.2d 878] (1996), \u201cThe actions of an attorney within the scope of his employment are binding upon his client under ordinary principles of agency.\u201d <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Board of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 45 [300 A.2d 367] (1973).[]...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">In summary, because of the joint Rule 9-207 statement filed in this case, the court cannot regard Notley Road as marital property because it has been excluded by a valid agreement.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Nevertheless, the court relied, <em>inter alia, </em>on F.L. \u00a7 8-205, which was amended in 2006 by Senate Bill 353, as well as the Fiscal and Policy Note explaining Senate Bill 353, to conclude that \u201cthe court has the authority to transfer title\u201d to real property jointly owned by the parties and used as the principal residence of the parties during the marriage, \u201cregardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>of whether the realty is marital or non-marital property.\u201d It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">In 2006, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 8-205(b) of the Family Law Article to permit the court to transfer title to \u201creal property jointly owned by the parties and used as the principle [sic] residence of the parties when they lived together.\u201d Chapter 431, Acts 2006. The Fiscal Note, which explains Senate Bill 353, makes it clear that the court has the authority to transfer title regardless of whether the realty is marital or non-marital property. This is confirmed by \u00a7 8-205(a) of the Family Law Article, which permits the court to transfer an ownership interest in the property specified in subsection (b), \u201cgrant a monetary award, or both....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As we have seen, the court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">The court finds that the equities of this case militate strongly in favor of transferring title to the Notley Road property to Bernice.\u201d She acquired the property in 1994, made the down payment for its acquisition, and made every mortgage payment before and during the marriage. Samuel \u201cinvested\u201d $25,000 from the equity in this property in Stone Development LLC, but Bernice made each payment due on the home equity line. In addition, Samuel took $25,000 from the equity line for his personal living expenses and, because he made no payments on the equity line, the bank imposed $3,000 in late charges and interest. The evidence discloses that Samuel had not paid a penny towards the home equity loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Turning to the parties\u2019 contentions, appellant maintains that, given the trial court\u2019s finding that the home was not marital property, the trial court lacked authority under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii) to transfer title to the parties\u2019 home to appellee. He notes that, under F.L. \u00a7 8 \u2014 201 (e)(3)(iii), marital property does not include property \u201cexcluded by valid agreement,\u201d and insists that F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a) permits a transfer of title only as to marital property, in order to accomplish the statutory objective of \u201can adjustment of the equities and right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>of the parties concerning marital property.\u201d Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">Where, as here, divorcing parties specifically agree that their former marital home, although owned as tenants by the entirety, is not to be treated as marital property, that home is immunized against an ordered Family Law Article \u00a7 8 \u2014 205(a)(2) (iii) transfer, the clear and express language of which limits it [sic] application to transactions contemplated \u201cas an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">The statutory language here in question is entirely contained within a section of the Family Law Article itself entitled \u201c \u00a7 8-205. Marital Property \u2014 Award.\u201d, and appears to exist for the sole purpose of applying the equitable distribution schema set forth in Title 8, Subtitle 2, of the Family Law Article, which requires the adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties <em>concerning marital property.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Urging us to uphold the trial court\u2019s decision, which was based on \u201c \u2018[t]he equities,\u2019 \u201d appellee points out that appellant \u201ccites no law to support his position.\u201d Further, she observes that \u201cthe Trial Court found that Notley Road would have been marital property pursuant to Family Law Article Section 8-201(e)(2), [but] determined that the parties\u2019 Rule 9-207 Statement constituted a valid agreement which excluded the Notley Road home from being marital property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">As our factual summary reflects, in the proceedings below appellee took various positions as to the Notley Road home. She initially sought to characterize the home as premarital, explaining that she bought it years before the marriage and appellant never contributed to the mortgage or expenses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> She also maintained that appellee\u2019s counsel had agreed that the home belonged to her. However, she also testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the home was marital property, and disputed that the parties agreed in the 9-207 Statement that the home was non-marital. Notably, appellee does not contend on appeal that the court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding that, pursuant to the 9-207 Statement, the parties agreed the home was non-marital. Therefore, that finding is not in issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Given the court\u2019s finding that the Notley Road property was rendered non-marital by agreement of the parties in their 9-207 Statement, we must determine whether the court erred in transferring title to the home from appellant to appellee, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 8-205. The parties present conflicting interpretations as to the meaning of the statute, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKI\">\u00a7 8-205. Marital property \u2014 Award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">(a) <em>Grant of award. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, after the court determines which property is marital property, and the value of the marital property, the court may transfer ownership of an interest in property described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, grant a monetary award, or both, as an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property, whether or not alimony is awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">(2) The court may transfer ownership of an interest in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(i) a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, from one party to either or both parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">(ii) subject to the consent of any lienholders, family use personal property, from one or both parties to either or both parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">(iii) subject to the terms of any lien, real property jointly owned by the parties and used as the principal residence of the parties when they lived together, by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">1. ordering the transfer of ownership of the real property or any interest of one of the parties in the real property to the other party if the party to whom the real property is transferred obtains the release of the other party from any lien against the real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">2. authorizing one party to purchase the interest of the other party in the real property, in accordance with the terms and conditions ordered by the court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">3. both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">As indicated, appellant claims that the court lacked authority to transfer title to the home because, by virtue of the parties\u2019 agreement in the 9-207 Statement, they excluded it from the pool of marital property, thereby eliminating it from the scope of F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii)(l). Conversely, appellee argues that the reach of F.L. \u00a7 8 \u2014 205(a)(2)(iii)(1) extends to the parties\u2019 principal residence, owned TBE, even if the parties characterized the home as non-marital on their 9-207 Statement. Neither side cites any authority to support their respective positions, nor have we uncovered any reported appellate case addressing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">We begin our analysis with a review of Title 8, Subtitle 2 of the Family Law Article, which governs property disposition in divorce proceedings. Marital property is defined as \u201cproperty, however titled, acquired by 1 or both parties during the marriage.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 8-201(e)(l). Pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 8-201(e)(2), marital property \u201cincludes any interest in real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety unless the real property is excluded by valid agreement.\u201d Under F.L. \u00a7 8-201(e)(3), marital property does not include property: (i) acquired before the marriage;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>(ii) acquired by inheritance or gift from a third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">(iii) <em>excluded by valid agreement; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">(iv) directly traceable to any of these sources. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">When the division of <em>marital </em>property by title is inequitable, the chancellor may adjust the equities by granting a monetary award. <em>Flanagan v. Flanagan, </em>181 Md.App. 492, 534-35, 956 A.2d 829 (2008); <em>see Long v. Long, </em>129 Md.App. 554, 579, 743 A.2d 281 (2000) (recognizing that the judge has \u201call the discretion and flexibility he needs to reach a truly equitable outcome\u201d). In <em>Ward v. Ward, </em>52 Md.App. 336, 339-40, 449 A.2d 443 (1982), we elucidated the concept of the monetary award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">The monetary award is ... an addition to and not a substitution for a legal division of the property accumulated during marriage, according to title. It is \u201cintended to compensate a spouse who holds title to less than an equitable portion\u201d of that property----What triggers operation of the statute is the claim that a division of the parties\u2019 property according to its title would create an inequity which would be overcome through a monetary award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7i\">(Citation omitted) (Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">If a party petitions for a monetary award, the trial court must undertake \u201ca three-step process which may culminate in a monetary award.\u201d <em>Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 499, 629 A.2d 70 (1993); <em>see </em>F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 8-203 to 8-205; <em>see also Gordon v. Gordon, </em>174 Md.App. 583, 623-24, 923 A.2d 149 (2007); <em>Ware v. Ware, </em>131 Md.App. 207, 213, 748 A.2d 1031 (2000). First, for each disputed item of property, the court must determine whether it is marital or nonmarital. F.L. \u00a7 \u00a7 8-201(e)(l), 8-203, 8-205(a)(l); <em>Flanagan, </em>181 Md.App. at 519, 956 A.2d 829. Second, the court must determine the value of all <em>marital </em>property. F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 8-204, 8 \u2014 205(a)(1); <em>Flanagan, </em>181 Md.App. at 519, 956 A.2d 829. Third, the court must decide <em>if the division of marital property </em>according to title would be unfair. If so, the chancellor may make a monetary award to rectify any inequity \u201c \u2018created by the way in which property acquired during marriage happened to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>titled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 956 A.2d 829 (quoting <em>Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 349, 664 A.2d 453 (1995)); <em>see </em>F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a); <em>Long, </em>129 Md.App. at 578-79, 743 A.2d 281.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">To be sure, the statutory scheme reflects that title is not controlling in terms of a monetary award. But, it is only <em>marital property </em>that is subject to equitable distribution by way of a monetary award. The Notley Road home is titled TBE. Real property that is owned TBE is generally marital property. However, F.L. \u00a7 8-201(e)(2) expressly provides that real property held TBE is marital, \u201cunless ... excluded by valid agreement.\u201d And, the court below found such an agreement in the 9-207 Statement. Therefore, the home was classified as non-marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">F.L. \u00a7 8-205 was amended in 2006 by Chapter 431, Acts of 2006; the General Assembly added \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii) to the Family Law Article, effective October 1, 2006. The text of F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a) does not specifically say that title to jointly held real property may be transferred only if it is marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The court below found authority for the transfer of title in a portion of the Fiscal and Policy Note (Revised) for Senate Bill (\u201cS.B.353\u201d). It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>This bill provides that in a divorce or annulment proceeding, a court may transfer, subject to the terms of any lien, <em>ownership of an interest in real property jointly owned by the parties, </em>and used as the principal residence of the parties when they lived together, by: (1) ordering the transfer of ownership of the real property or any interest of one of the parties in the real property to the other party if the party to whom the real property is transferred obtains the release of the other party from any lien against the real property; (2) authorizing one party to purchase the interest of the other party in the real property, in accordance with the terms and conditions ordered by the court; or (3) both. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Although not cited by the lower court, we also regard as relevant an additional portion of the Fiscal and Policy Note:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Analysis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">Current Law: In an action for annulment or divorce, after the court determines which property is marital property and the value of that property, the court may transfer an ownership interest in specified types of marital property and/or grant a monetary award. The transfer or grant is an adjustment of the equity of the parties regarding the marital property, regardless of an alimony award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">Generally, the court may not transfer the ownership of personal or real property from one party to the other. However, the court is authorized to transfer ownership of an interest in a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan from one party to either or both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Background: Some jurisdictions in the region allow a court to transfer real property or the interest in real property from one party to another in a divorce or annulment action.

The Bill Summary was virtually identical to the text of the Fiscal and Policy Note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">As we have seen, like F.L. \u00a7 8-205, neither the Floor Report nor the Fiscal and Policy Note expressly stated that the ability to transfer title was limited to marital property. Both referred only to jointly owned property. Nevertheless, based on the well honed principles of statutory construction, we conclude that the parties\u2019 residence, owned TBE, but deemed non-marital by their agreement, was outside the scope of F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henriquez v.

Jaigobin, </em>413 Md. 191, 197-98, 991 A.2d 1251 (2010). As the Court has recognized, \u201c \u2018in the interest of completeness\u2019 we may, and sometimes do, explore the legislative history of the statute under review.\u201d <em>Mayor of Balt. v.

State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49 (1977) (\u201c[A] court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">As we have seen, the principles elucidated above make clear that we must consider as a whole the statutory scheme concerning the disposition of property in divorce proceedings, and we must avoid a construction of the statute that is at odds with logic and common sense. Here, only marital property is subject to equitable distribution for a monetary award, and the provision at issue here is part of F.L. \u00a7 8-205, concerning disposition of marital property. Therefore, it seems logical that the court\u2019s ability to transfer title to real property would extend only to real property that is itself marital property.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In looking to the statutory text, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(l) states that the court may transfer ownership of an interest in property set forth in (a)(2), which includes the parties\u2019 principal residence, but it may do so only <em>\u201cafter\u201d </em>it determines which property is marital and its value. (Emphasis added.) Applying common sense, it is not happenstance that the statute requires the court to identify the marital property. While F.L. \u00a7 8 \u2014 205(a)(2)(iii) expressly permits a court to transfer ownership of an interest in jointly owned real property, it may do so under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(l) only \u201cas an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties <em>concerning marital property\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In its ruling, the court below omitted any reference to the clause highlighted above, which clearly limits any transfer of title for the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>home to those instances that are for the purpose of adjusting the equities <em>as to marital property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">If \u201c \u2018reasonably possible\u2019 \u201d we read a statute \u201c \u2018so that no word, phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless,\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 469, 499, 997 A.2d 912 (2010) (quoting <em>Del Marr v. Montgomery County, </em>169 Md.App. 187, 207, 900 A.2d 243 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>397 Md. 308, 916 A.2d 1002 (2007)), or \u201csuperfluous or redundant.\u201d <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002); <em>see Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 691, 861 A.2d 727 (2004); <em>Mayor of Rockville v. Rylyns Enters., Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 551, 814 A.2d 469 (2002). The clause highlighted above is central to the interpretation of the provision; it cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We conclude that, under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(iii), a trial court may not order the transfer of title as to the marital home, owned TBE, when, as here, the home is deemed non-marital property by agreement. Therefore, we must vacate the order for transfer of title and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In light of our disposition, we shall also vacate the entire monetary award, without addressing appellant\u2019s challenges as to the propriety of the size of the award. This is because, on remand, the court must consider the entirety of the parties\u2019 economic circumstances, which includes the Notley Road home, the parties\u2019 most valuable asset, which they continue to own jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We are mindful that, even if the parties\u2019 Rule 9-207 Statement excluded certain assets as marital property, this \u201cdoes not mean that the court may not consider such non-marital property as a factor in its equitable distribution of the remaining marital property.\u201d <em>Flanagan, </em>181 Md.App. at 532, 956 A.2d 829. F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) instructs the trial court to \u201cdetermine the amount and the method of payment of a monetary award, <em>or the terms of the transfer of the interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, </em>or both, after <em>considering </em>... (2) the value of <em>all property interests </em>of each party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We explained in <em>Flanagan, id. </em>at 532, 534-35, 956 A.2d 829: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>As we discuss <em>infra, </em>however, the fact that property may be excluded from the marital property \u201cpool,\u201d by agreement of the parties in a Rule 9-207 joint statement, does not mean that the court may not consider such non-marital property as a factor in its equitable distribution of the remaining marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">With respect to the <em>amount </em>of a monetary award, that provision instructs the court to consider \u201cthe value of <em>all property interests of each party </em>\u201d (emphasis added), which includes non-marital property. Unlike F.L. \u00a7 8-204(a), which governs what property is subject to distribution by the court, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(2) requires that, in evaluating the equities between the parties, the court must consider all of the property of each party, both marital and non-marital. That would necessarily include marital property that becomes non-marital by virtue of the parties\u2019 agreement in a Rule 9-207 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">For the benefit of the court and the parties on remand, we shall address appellant\u2019s claim that the court was clearly erroneous in valuing Stone Development at $259,621. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s valuation was not clearly erroneous and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">According to appellant, there was insufficient evidence and \u201cscant information\u201d in the record to assign any value to that entity. Noting that appellee had the burden of producing evidence as to the value of Stone Development, he argues that appellee failed to produce credible evidence as to its value. Appellant asserts: \u201cThe sole \u2018evidence\u2019 of value in the record appears to be Husband\u2019s vague and inconsistent answer to an interrogatory regarding the value of marital property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Further, appellant maintains that his interrogatory answer \u201cdid not rise to the level of an admission by a party opponent.\u201d Rather, he claims that he was \u201cmerely reporting what the Wall Street Journal\u2019s web site reflected as the value of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>property held by the LLC, not the LLC itself, and without any cognizance of the LLC\u2019s liabilities, or of any premium or discount added or subtracted because the parties own the LLC and not the property directly.\u201d Referring to his statement in his interrogatory answer about pending litigation concerning Stone Development, appellant asserts: \u201cThere is no information of what the litigation was about, or how great or small the LLC\u2019s liabilities may be, or, for that matter, whether the LLC generates income or losses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Appellee counters that the court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of the value of Stone Development was supported by the evidence presented and was not clearly erroneous.\u201d In particular, she contends that appellant\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 9 \u201cwas both an admission by a party and an owner\u2019s assertion of property value.\u201d In addition, she relies on her own testimony as to value. Appellee asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">Appellant had the opportunity to present evidence to contradict Appellee\u2019s testimony and to establish what he contended to be the correct current value of Stone Development based on the evidence presented, Appellee\u2019s testimony and Appellant\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 9. Based on that evidence, the Court found that Stone Development had a fair market value of $259,621.00 less marital debt of $25,000.00 to account for the home equity loan, resulting in a total value of $234,621.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In his reply brief, appellant explains: \u201cStone Development shared title on each property, in an unknown percentage, with a partner named Samuel Standard, and was then in the midst of sorting out both property ownership percentage and fraud claims with Mr. Standard.\u201d He asserts: \u201cDespite knowing that Appellant and Appellee co-owned Stone Development, a value for the LLC could not be ascertained without knowing what percentage of the underlying properties Stone held, after properly valuing the properties themselves.\u201d In addition, appellant complains that the trial court \u201csimply extrapolated a fair market value of Stone Development LLC, without having any idea of what portion of the assets in question Stone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Development LLC actually owned (as opposed to Mr. Standard).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The parties\u2019 9-207 Statement reflected that appellee and appellant agreed that Stone Development LLC was a marital asset.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The value of each item of marital property is a question of fact. <em>Flanagan, </em>181 Md.App. at 521, 956 A.2d 829. We review the court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-421 (d), \u201canswers to interrogatories may be used for any purpose to the extent permitted by the Rules of Evidence.\u201d <em>Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 96, 854 A.2d 1180 (2004). Under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(1), appellant\u2019s interrogatory answer was an admission of a party opponent and, having been admitted into evidence, it constituted substantive evidence that the court could consider. <em>See Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Kuhl, </em>296 Md. 446, 455, 463 A.2d 822 (1983) (\u201cAdmissions are \u2018the words or acts of a party-opponent, or of his predecessor or representative, offered as evidence against him.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Moreover, appellee testified as to the value of Stone Development. \u201cThe owner of property is presumed to be familiar with its value so that his opinion of its value is admissible as evidence.\u201d <em>Hale v. Hale, </em>74 Md.App. 555, 567, 539 A.2d 247, <em>cert, denied, </em>313 Md. 30, 542 A.2d 857 (1988); <em>see also Stickell v.

That was not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Appellee testified that she believed that the value of Stone Development was \u201c[a]bout the same\u201d as the value assigned by appellant. She based her opinion on \u201cassessments\u201d that she received. She explained that \u201cthe initial money for the land in Michigan came from the $50,000 that [appellant] took from the Vanguard account,\u201d that the $25,610 for the down payments for the house and lot in Indianapolis came from her salary, and that she gave appellant \u201can additional $25,000 for renovations.\u201d Thus, the evidence showed that appellee, a co-owner, was familiar with Stone Development and was in a position to render an opinion as to value. \u201c \u2018The trier of fact may believe or disbelieve, accredit or disregard, any evidence introduced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flanagan, </em>181 MdApp. at 535, 956 A.2d 829 (citations omitted). The burden shifted to appellant to contradict the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Appellant stated in his answer to Interrogatory No. 9 that he and appellee own \u201cStone Development, LLC, 2112 North Park Ave. Indianapolis, Indiana, which owns a house and contiguous lot. The fair market value estimated from [the] Wall Street Journal web site [is] $259,621.\u201d Appellant also stated in his interrogatory answer that the \u201cLLC owns 5 vacant pieces of Michigan properties for development with another party.\u201d However, appellant did not assign a value to these properties, claiming that he did \u201cnot know the fair market value of these properties. Parcel lots of vacant land are difficult to value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s valuation of $259,621 applied solely to the Indianapolis properties. In other words, appellant gave a value as to just one of several lots owned by Stone Development. As the trial court recognized in its colloquy with counsel, the various vacant lots surely had at least some value. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Therefore, the total of the properties held by Stone Development would have exceeded the value of just the one lot in Indiana, for which appellant provided a value in his answer to Interrogatory 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Furthermore, the court did not have to credit appellant\u2019s speculative and unsubstantiated assertion in his interrogatory answer that pending litigation adversely affected the value of the properties. <em>See Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 191, 857 A.2d 1109 (2004) (finding that \u201cclaimed tax liabilities associated with an uncompelled, premature liquidation of a retirement account\u201d were not \u201cimmediate and specific\u201d and were too \u201cspeculative\u201d to be considered \u201cfor purposes of distributing a marital property award\u201d). Indeed, appellant indicated he was attempting to obtain sole ownership of the properties held by Stone Development. If successful, this could result in an increase in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Appellant argues that \u201cthe divorce court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid by a jobless, virtually penniless husband, to a cardiologist wife the divorce court found possessed non-marital property in excess of $1,000,000.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, \u201chis inability to testify and/or present evidence concerning the circumstances which led to his inability to fully comply with discovery during the pre-trial stage of the proceeding, as well as to his present financial circumstances, precluded a fair and equitable decision regarding the attorneys\u2019 fees assessed, and the same should be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Appellee counters that, \u201c[i]n making its award of attorney\u2019s fees the Court found, and the record clearly shows, that Appellant \u2018offered essentially no defense to [appellee\u2019s] request for a divorce or the issues regarding marital property\u2019 and that Appellant\u2019s conduct in discovery, by failing to appear for deposition and produce documents was not substantially justified, was willful, in bad faith and \u2018deliberately obstructive.\u2019 \u201d Further, appellee asserts that she \u201cclearly met her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>burden in presenting evidence regarding the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees bills.\u201d As the award of attorney\u2019s fees of $12,500 \u201cwas clearly supported by the evidence presented,\u201d appellee insists that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Because we have vacated the monetary award, the award of attorney\u2019s fees must necessarily be vacated and reconsidered on remand as well. This is because \u201c[t]he factors underlying alimony, a monetary award, and counsel fees are so interrelated that, when a trial court considers a claim for any one of them, it must weigh the award of any other.\u201d <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>147 Md.App. 350, 400, 809 A.2d 18 (2002); <em>see also Flanagan, </em>181 Md.App. at 544, 956 A.2d 829; <em>Doser v.

The amount was to be determined at trial. In awarding attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court found that appellant \u201coffered essentially no defense to [Appellee\u2019s] request for a divorce or the issues regarding marital property\u201d and that his failure to cooperate in the discovery process was \u201cwillful and in bad faith.\u201d The record fully supports the findings of both judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In Maryland, \u201c[a] party seeking reimbursement of fees bears the burden to present evidence concerning their reasonableness.\u201d <em>Sczudlo v.
