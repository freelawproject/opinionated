In a cross-appeal, DSS alternatively argues that the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss Mr. B.\u2019s petition for judicial review, because it was filed two days after the thirty day deadline. Although Mr. B.\u2019s challenges to the ALJ\u2019s decision lack merit, ultimately we conclude that his petition for judicial review should have been dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">These proceedings involve a divided family engaged in a custody tug-of-war over three young boys. In October 2006, Mr. B. was living with J.M. (\u201cMother\u201d) and her sons Kyle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>(born August 28, 2001), Tyler (born June 23, 1999), and Michael (born November 15, 1997) (the \u201cChildren\u201d). Although Mr. B. is not the boys\u2019 biological father, they called him \u201cDaddy.\u201d The Children had previously lived with their Mother in the home of her mother, B.L. (\u201cGrandmother\u201d), both when B.L. was living with her current husband D.L. (\u201cStep-Grandfather\u201d) and, before they divorced in 2000, when she lived with her former husband, G.M. (\u201cGrandfather\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The family schism is between Mr. B. and Mother, on the one hand, and Grandmother, Grandfather, and Step-Grandfather on the other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">After reviewing the administrative record, the circuit court gave the following account of the abuse allegations, DSS investigation, and administrative proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">At the conclusion of an August 26, 2006 outing with the Children, Grandfather and Grandmother refused to take the Children to Mother. They did so because, during the outing, the children made statements leading them to believe that Mr. [B.] had sexually abused them. At the time, Kyle was 4, Tyler was 7, and Michael was 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">When Grandparents refused to return the Children, Ms. [M.] called the police. Grandmother told the police about her concerns. The police, in turn, contacted the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d), which then began an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">On August 28, 2006, the DSS assigned Rashida Sims to investigate the allegations. Ms. Sims interviewed the Grandparents, Step-Grandfather and the Children. During those interviews, Grandparents and Step-Grandfather relayed statements made by the Children stating that Mr. [B.] had engaged in sexual activities with Kyle and Tyler. Kyle and Tyler substantiated what the Grandparents told Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Sims; Michael maintained he was never sexually abused and was unaware of what happened to Kyle and Tyler----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">On November 16, 2006, the DSS notified Mr. [B.] that it found him to be a person allegedly responsible for indicated child neglect. Mr. [B.] was also informed that he had a right to request a contested case hearing to challenge DSS\u2019s decision. On December 1, 2006, Mr. [B.] requested such a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">On March 20 and 28, 2007, a contested case hearing was held at the DSS office in Annapolis, Maryland, before ALJ Ann C. Kahinde. At the start of the hearing, Mr. [B.] counsel moved to withdraw his appearance; Mr. [B.] agreed, and proceeded <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">On May 14, 2007, the ALJ issued a written decision based on the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">7. The maternal grandfather told Ms. Sims that after the [August 26, 2006] outing, he was driving Michael home and the maternal grandmother was driving Tyler and Kyle. The maternal grandmother called him on his cellphone and said that Tyler had told her that, \u201cdaddy plays with my bird and makes it big and Kyle, too.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">10. Ms. Sims also met with the maternal grandmother at the maternal grandfather\u2019s home on August 28 [2006]. [The maternal grandmother] said that in early August [2006], she told one of the boys to wrap a towel around his waist after changing out of a swimsuit and he stated, \u201clet me show you what daddy does.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">11. The maternal grandmother told Ms. Sims that on August 26, 2006, she asked the boys about daddy touching them, and Tyler made a statement that \u201cdaddy licked his butt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">12. On August 30, 2006, Ms. Sims and a detective interviewed all three children separately at the Child Advocacy Center____ All three boys refer to the penis as \u201cbird.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-13\">13. Ms. Sims asked Kyle about touches he liked and does not like. Kyle said he did not know and shrugged his shoulders. Ms. Sims asked him if he was touched in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>that he did not like and Kyle said \u201cyes.\u201d Ms. Sims asked Kyle who did the touching and he said \u201cDaddy.\u201d He was asked where on his body and Kyle pointed to the \u201cbutt\u201d on the picture. Ms. Sims asked Kyle what he was touched with and he responded a \u201chand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">14. In response to Ms. Sims\u2019s questions, Kyle told her that the touching had happened on more than one occasion and that sometimes Michael was home and Tyler sees it happen. Kyle also told Ms. Sims that it happens in the home where daddy works \u201cdown in the basement, it is all painted down there.\u201d Kyle told Ms. Sims he did not know where on his body he was touched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">15. In the same interview, Kyle initially told Ms. Sims that he was not asked to touch his daddy. Later, he told Ms. Sims that his daddy asked him to touch his (his daddy\u2019s) bird and he touched his daddy\u2019s bird.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">16. [Mr. B.] and his father own another house down the street from where he lives with the children\u2019s mother. [Mr. B.] and his father have gutted the property and are renovating it.... The walls of the basement were unpainted cinder-block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">17. Ms. Sims and the detective then interviewed Tyler. After talking about other types of touches, Ms. Sims asked Tyler if he had been touched on his butt or his bird or if he had been asked to touch anyone else. Tyler responded \u201cno.\u201d Ms Sims said, \u201cmom-mom [maternal grandmother] said something happened that you didn\u2019t like, is that true?\u201d Tyler stated, \u201cdad made his bird big and then that stuff and then he put it in me and Kyle\u2019s butts, we were crying.\u201d Ms. Sims asked Tyler how he knew that his daddy put his bird in his butt? Tyler said his dad tells him to turn over and he spits on his bird and \u201con our butts\u201d and \u201cthen he rubs his bird on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">18. Tyler also told Ms. Sims that [Mr. B.] went into a closet \u201cto make his bird big.\u201d Tyler stated there is a television with a blue screen or video camera in the closet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>19. Ms. Sims inspected the inside of the home where [Mr. B.] and the mother of the children reside. Ms. Sims did not find a television or video camera in any of the closets....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">21. On August 30, 2006, Ms. Sims and the detective interviewed the maternal grandfather, the maternal grandmother, and the step-grandfather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">22. The step-grandfather told Ms. Sims that the children were at their house in early August swimming in the pool. The step-grandfather was accidentally hit in the private area with the ball and Tyler said, \u201cplay with it and make white stuff come out.\u201d The step-grandfather asked Tyler where he got that from and Tyler said \u201cdaddy on his bed.\u201d The step-grandfather contradicted Tyler and Kyle and said, \u201cyup he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">23. The maternal grandmother told Ms. Sims that she and her husband tried to figure out where the statements came from and she asked Tyler and Kyle on August 26, 2006, if their daddy ever touched them. She said Kyle told her \u201cyes\u201d that his daddy put his bird in his mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">24. On August 31, 2006, Ms. Sims met with [Mr. B.] and the children\u2019s mother. The children\u2019s mother told Ms. Sims she has found the children playing with each other\u2019s bird in the bathtub. She alleged inappropriate sexual activities by her father (nude parties, nude swimming, allowing her children to view inappropriate movies and go to adult stores) and that the children were banned from the public library after they visited pornographic sites on the computer because the maternal grandfather was not properly supervising them....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">25. On September 11, 2006, the boys were examined by a forensic pediatrician. There were no physical findings to establish trauma to the anus or penis of the three boys. Cultures were taken to test for sexually transmitted diseases; the cultures were negative____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">30. On October 12, 2006, Ms. Sims interviewed Tyler at his school. Ms. Sims told Tyler that it was suggested he had been told what to say in his interview, exposed to sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>inappropriate content, taken to sex stores and R-rated movies. Tyler denied that these things were true and said what he had said about his dad [was] true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">31. On October 12, 2006, Ms. Sims also interviewed Kyle at his school. Ms. Sims told Kyle that it was suggested he had been told what to say in his interview, exposed to sexually inappropriate content, taken to sex stores and R-rated movies. Kyle responded several times, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">32. On October 12, 2006, Ms. Sims also interviewed Michael at his school. Michael was upset when he saw Ms. Sims. His mother had told him the day before that she would call Ms. Sims and have the three boys placed in a non-relative\u2019s home. Ms. Sims asked Michael about sexual interactions and he denied ever touching his brother\u2019s privates. Michael said it was true that he and his brothers were not listening or following his mother\u2019s directions. Michael denied being taken to R-rated movies or being asked to leave the library.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">On the basis of these factual findings, the ALJ changed the finding of \u201cindicated\u201d child sexual abuse to \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d The ALJ reviewed the evidence in detail over eight pages of her written decision, making the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u2022 Step-Grandfather did not testify and was interviewed only once, along with Grandmother. The record did not disclose whether the two were interviewed separately. His account of the boys\u2019 statements at the pool \u2014 \u201cplay with it and make white stuff come out\u201d like \u201cdaddy on his bed\u201d \u2014 suggested that the children may have witnessed masturbation, but did not suggest that they had been touched on their \u201cbutts and birds,\u201d as the DSS claimed at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u2022 The ALJ found it \u201cpuzzling\u201d that, in light of their mutual desire \u201cin wanting to raise the children outside the influence of\u2019 Mr. B., Grandmother \u201cdid not mention the incident at the swimming pool to\u201d Grandfather when she learned about it from Step-Grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u2022 Ms. Sims\u2019s notes of what Grandmother told her about the boys\u2019 statements in response to her questions on August 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>did not contain everything that Grandmother testified the children told her. The ALJ was uncertain whether Grandmother did not tell Ms. Sims about these statements or whether Ms. Sims did not record everything Grandmother told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u2022 Although a police detective was present for Ms. Sims\u2019s first interviews with the boys, he provided no information, by way of notes or testimony. For that reason, the only information came from Ms. Sims, who \u201cwas not qualified as an expert in child abuse investigations.\u201d Although the ALJ elicited that she has a master\u2019s degree in counseling and that she used the protocol \u201cFinding Words\u201d to interview the children, DSS did not present Ms. Sims\u2019s qualifications other than working at DSS for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u2022 Ms. Sims asked appropriately \u201copen-ended and non-leading\u201d questions to Kyle, leading to his statement that \u201cDaddy\u201d touched him on his \u201cbutt\u201d with a \u201chand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u2022 Kyle described the abuse as occurring at the house \u201cwhere daddy \u2018works down in the basement, it is all painted down there.\u2019 \u201d Ms. Sims confirmed that the house exists, but did not inspect that property. Mr. B.\u2019s father testified credibly that \u201cthe basement has never been painted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u2022 When Tyler was interviewed by Ms. Sims, he answered, \u201cno\u201d when he was first asked whether he had been touched on his butt or his bird. Ms. Sims then \u201cused a very leading question,\u201d stating, \u201cmom-mom said something happened that you didn\u2019t like, is that true?\u201d Tyler then gave a graphic description of Mr. B. becoming aroused, ejaculating, and anally penetrating both he and Kyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u2022 Tyler\u2019s initial denial was not consistent with Mr. B.\u2019s accusation that the child was coached. Nor was his inclusion of graphic details without further prompting.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u2022 Although Tyler told Ms. Sims that Mr. B. went into a closet \u201cto make his bird big,\u201d and that there was a television with a blue screen and a video camera in the closet, no such equipment was found in the home where they lived. But the ALJ noted that \u201canyone who had engaged in that activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>would immediately get rid of the evidence ... when they knew social services would be coming to the house to investigate.\u201d Mr. B. and his father both testified, however, that the closets were not \u201cwalk-ins\u201d and would be difficult for an adult to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u2022 Michael denied abuse by Mr. B., knowledge of abuse of his brothers, and inappropriate activity by Grandfather. But the ALJ observed that it was possible that Michael was not abused because he was older and had \u201ca greater capacity (due to age and education) to accurately describe the abuse. And all the children agreed that Kyle and Tyler went with Mr. B. to the renovation house more frequently than Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u2022 When Ms. Sims re-interviewed Tyler in October, he denied that he had been told what to say or exposed to sexually inappropriate content by his Grandfather. He insisted that \u201cwhat he had said about his dad was true,\u201d which the ALJ found \u201cespecially important in light of the fact that when he was re-interviewed Tyler was now living back with his mother,\u201d even though Tyler presumably knew that she \u201csupported [Mr. B.\u2019s] innocence.\u201d (By that time, Mr. B. had moved out so the children would be returned to Mother.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u2022 Although Kyle answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to nearly all questions Ms. Sims asked in the October re-interview, the ALJ did not find this proved or disproved that his original statement had been coached. Given his young age (five years old), that he had been moved back and forth between Grandfather and Mother, and that Mother told the children \u201cthat she would call Ms. Sims and have them removed somewhere else if their behavior did not improve,\u201d it was \u201cnot surprising\u201d that \u201cKyle did not want to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Recognizing that the children\u2019s descriptions of genital arousal, contact, ejaculation, and anal penetration were critical evidence in the absence of any other witnesses or physical evidence of abuse, the ALJ carefully evaluated the trustworthiness of these hearsay statements over an additional eight pages of her decision. To determine whether the children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>accounts were sufficiently trustworthy to be treated as credible evidence of sexual abuse, the ALJ reviewed the statements in light of twelve statutory factors considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay statements by child abuse victims under the age of twelve in criminal and juvenile court proceedings under Maryland Code (2001, 2009 Cum.Supp.), section ll-304(e) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) \u2014 a procedure we approved in <em>Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. P.F., </em>137 Md.App. 243, 273, 768 A.2d 112 (2001) (hereafter cited as \u201cP.F.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The ALJ found the following factors to be indicative of trustworthiness:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u2022 The children reported that they had personal knowledge of the events they described, and each separately \u201cstated that the other one was aware of what their daddy did because the other one was present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u2022 \u201c[Tjhere was no challenge from [Mr. B.] that these statements were not made by Tyler and Kyle to Ms. Sims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u2022 The ALJ was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d that, even if Mother\u2019s allegations of inappropriate conduct by Grandfather were true, such behavior could \u201caccount[] for the details in the children\u2019s statements[.]\u201d The graphic accounts of sexual abuse were \u201cbeyond the child\u2019s expected knowledge and experience,\u201d and the ALJ weighed this factor \u201cdecidedly against [Mr. B.\u2019s] position that the statements were the result of coaching by the grandparents.\u201d The ALJ stated, \u201cAssuming for the sake of argument that everything the children\u2019s mother said about her father was true, it still does not provide a credible foundation for wh[y] five and seven year old children would be able to graphically describe an adult male ejaculating and anal penetration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u2022 The boys used age-appropriate terminology. \u201cThe boys consistently used the terms \u2018butts\u2019 and \u2018birds\u2019 and Tyler did not have a word for ejaculate other than \u2018stuff which appears appropriate for a boy of seven years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\u2022 The ALJ had \u201cno reason\u201d to question the credibility of Ms. Sims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>On the other hand, the ALJ weighed the following factors against the trustworthiness of the children\u2019s statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u2022 \u201c[T]he grandparents, especially the grandfather, wanted custody of the children.\u201d Grandfather stated \u201cthat he didn\u2019t care what it took, he would get custody,\u201d and his \u201cdesire to obtain custody was a motive to encourage the children to make statements against [Mr. B.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u2022 The spontaneous statement that Tyler made to his Step-Grandfather at the pool in early August \u2014 \u201cplay with it and make white stuff come out\u201d \u2014 \u201cdid not involve a disclosure by the boys that they were touched by [Mr. B.] as counsel for the local department claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u2022 After the pool incident, none of the children\u2019s disclosures were spontaneous. To the contrary, \u201call of the children\u2019s statements were in response to being questioned by either their grandparents or by Ms. Sims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u2022 Ms. Sims and Grandmother used leading questions to elicit Tyler\u2019s disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u2022 The ALJ \u201cquestioned] why [Ms. Sims] was not more probing in her contacts with the maternal grandfather,\u201d especially because \u201csome of the information she was obtaining from him might not have been as objective as she initially thought,\u201d given his strong interest in obtaining custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Finally, the ALJ explained that the following factors were either equivocal or not helpful in evaluating the trustworthiness of the children\u2019s statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u2022 The \u201ctiming of the statements\u201d did not aid the ALJ in evaluating their trustworthiness. Although Tyler and Kyle made statements to Grandmother in the car on August 26, this occurred after an outing with the grandparents, raising the possibility that they were coached. On the other hand, Mother and Mr. B. had been limiting the amount of time the children spent with Grandparents, making it difficult for Grandparents to coach them \u201cto make very detailed statements with only one day of preparation.\u201d The timing of the statements both children later made in October was \u201cnot helpful because they had been returned to their mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>shortly before the re-interview\u201d and Mother told them \u201cthey would be moved somewhere else if their behavior did not improve[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u2022 The \u201cnature and duration of the [alleged] abuse\u201d neither supported nor disproved trustworthiness, because the children \u201cwere vague as to how many times the abuse occurred,\u201d with Tyler stating that it \u201chappened a long time ago\u201d when it was both \u201chot and cold outside.\u201d Because Ms. Sims did not explain whether she tried to obtain more specific information, the ALJ did not consider this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u2022 The \u201cinternal consistency\u201d of both children\u2019s statements was \u201cmixed.\u201d For example, Kyle first said he was not asked .to touch Mr. B.\u2019s bird but later in the interview said Mr. B. did ask to be touched and Kyle did so, while in his October interview, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Similarly, when asked if he had been touched on his butt or bird, Tyler first answered \u201cno,\u201d but after Ms. Sims told him his Grandmother \u201csaid something happened that you didn\u2019t like,\u201d he said, \u201cdad made his bird big and then that stuff and then he put it in me and Kyle\u2019s butts, we were crying\u201d and that \u201chis dad tells him to turn over and he spits on his bird and \u2018on our butts\u2019 and \u2018then he rubs his bird on it.\u2019 \u201d The ALJ noted that, although Tyler\u2019s statements were \u201ccoherent, ... there was no way to judge their internal consistency because Ms. Sims did not testify that she asked the same question in different ways to see if she would elicit the same or different responses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u2022 The ALJ could not evaluate \u201cwhether Kyle and Tyler were suffering pain or distress when they made the statements because Ms. Sims did not describe their emotional state[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u2022 As for \u201copportunity to commit\u201d the abuse described by the children, the ALJ noted that, although the children said the abuse occurred both at home and at the nearby house Mr. B. was renovating, the neighbor next door to the renovated house testified that the boys routinely played outside with her grandchildren, in her sight. The ALJ concluded that although Mr. B. may have had only \u201climited\u201d opportunities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the neighbor\u2019s testimony did not establish that he \u201cwas never alone in the house with Kyle and Tyler\u201d or otherwise \u201caccount for where [the] children were during the cold months\u201d they accompanied Mr. B. to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Ultimately, the ALJ concluded that the children\u2019s descriptions of sexual abuse had been sufficiently challenged by Mr. B. that an \u201cindicated\u201d finding was not warranted. But she also concluded that these statements were still sufficiently credible that she could not find by a preponderance of the evidence that the abuse did not occur, as required to make a finding of \u201cruled out.\u201d Instead, the ALJ concluded that the appropriate finding was \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d explaining her decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">The local department concluded that \u201cindicated\u201d child sexual abuse was found as to both Kyle and Tyler based primarily on their statements. The credibility of their statements was partially called into question by the fact that Tyler initially said he had not been touched by anyone (or asked to touch anyone) and it was only after the Investigator asked him a leading question that he disclosed what his daddy did. Additionally, the credibility of both of their statements [was] weakened by the fact that [Mr. B.] refuted Kyle\u2019s assertion that the basement was painted and Tyler\u2019s assertion that [Mr. B.] would walk into a closet that contained a television and video camera to masturbate. Finally, the credibility is somewhat weakened by the fact that the interviews took place in context of a custody battle between the maternal grandfather and the children\u2019s mother and [Mr. B.]. For these reasons, I conclude the local department has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that there is \u201ccredible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted\u201d that the sexual molestation was caused by [Mr. B.]. COMAR 07.02.07.12 A(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">On the other hand, a finding of \u201cruled out\u201d child sexual abuse can not be made because it [is] impossible to conclude from the evidence that \u201cchild abuse did not occur.\u201d Primarily this is so because the graphic, detailed nature of the children\u2019s statements can not be attributed to any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>myriad of reasons offered by [Mr. B.] and the children\u2019s mother (e.g., PG-13 or R-rated movies, seeing inappropriate items in adult stores or going to Hooters). While it might be possible that viewing of pornographic websites or movies could have given the children sufficient knowledge of the details in their statements, they denied this when they were specifically questioned by Ms. Sims. They were not aware that Ms. Sims would be visiting them at school so it is unlikely that they were coached into denying being told what to say or seeing inappropriate materials. Therefore, the appropriate finding in this matter must be \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d child sexual abuse because there is \u201cinsufficient evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out child abuse.\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.12 B.

Mr. B. reads the rule differently, maintaining that subsection (3) of the rule applies, so that the thirty day period did not begin to run until he received the ALJ\u2019s decision, which he asserts was on June 11, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We agree with the DSS that subsection (2) of the rule applies and that the thirty day filing period began when the ALJ\u2019s decision was mailed on May 14, 2007. The ALJ\u2019s decision changing Mr. B.\u2019s responsibility for child sexual abuse from \u201cindicated\u201d to \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d was \u201csubject to appeal ... pursuant to State Government Article, Title 10, Subtitle 2, Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d COMAR \u00a7 07.026.14.F.

(Emphasis added.) This is the only notice required by law, and it clearly contemplates notice being complete when the ALJ\u2019s decision is mailed. The ALJ\u2019s decision indicates this by stating the \u201cDate Decision Mailed\u201d just above a notice of \u201cREVIEW RIGHTS.\u201d There is no provision in either the Administrative Procedure Act or the applicable regulations that mandates personal service of the ALJ\u2019s decision or otherwise requires some form of notice designed to ensure actual receipt, such as first class mail with return receipt or private delivery service with a person signature by the recipient. Thus, Mr. B.\u2019s petition was not filed within the thirty day filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Under Rule 7-203(a), this deadline has consistently been treated as \u201c \u2018an absolute statute of limitations, subject to waiver by failure of a respondent to raise the defense in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>proper manner but not subject to discretionary extension^]\u2019 \u201d <em>Colao v.

The Court of Appeals has explained that it deliberately changed the former rule governing judicial review of administrative agency decisions, by eliminating judicial authority to extend the filing period for good cause. <em>See Colao, </em>346 Md. at 361-63, 697 A.2d 96. Because a court may \u201cnot allow any implied or equitable exception to be engrafted upon\u201d this thirty day period, \u201c[a] late filing, beyond the period of limitations, of a petition for judicial review cannot be sustained simply because the late filing was the result of a \u2018clerical error\u2019 on the part of a petitioner [or] an attorney for the petitioner[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362-63, 697 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Court of Appeals has explicitly recognized that enforcing this deadline in close cases such as Mr. B.\u2019s is difficult, but ultimately necessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">Lest this result seem harsh or unfair, it is worth remembering that one of the important goals of the new procedure [for obtaining judicial review of administrative agency decisions] was to make the judicial review process more efficient. The basic battle in these cases is fought at the agency level. Whether acting under an administrative procedures act or under common law principles, the court\u2019s role is essentially limited to assuring that the agency acted lawfully, that there was substantial evidence to support its finding, and that it was not arbitrary____Making the 30-day requirement for filing the petition in the nature of an absolute statute of limitations, subject to waiver by failure of a respondent to raise the defense in a proper manner but not subject to discretionary extension, was in furtherance of that objective^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 364, 697 A.2d 96. <em>Cf. J.T.W., </em>397 Md. at 88, 916 A.2d 235 (holding that the thirty day filing period under Rule 7-203(a) began on the date that the administrative decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>mailed, so that a petition for judicial review filed six days late was properly dismissed as untimely).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Hence, the circuit court had no discretion to extend the thirty day deadline under Rule 7\u2014203(a)(2), even by two days. <em>See id. </em>The only remaining question is whether DSS waived its right to challenge Mr. B.\u2019s petition for judicial review on untimeliness grounds. We view Mr. B.\u2019s complaint that DSS did not move to dismiss his petition until September 22, 2008, more than fifteen months after he filed it, as a waiver argument. After reviewing the record, however, we are satisfied that DSS did not waive its right to contest the timeliness of Mr. B.\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">As the Court of Appeals has expressly stated, a timeliness challenge to a petition for judicial review may be \u201c\u2018raised either by preliminary motion under Rule 7-204 <em>or in the answering memorandum filed pursuant to Rule 7-207.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 362, 697 A.2d 96 (quoting Committee Note to Rule 7-203) (emphasis added). Accordingly, even though DSS could have contested Mr. B.\u2019s right to petition for judicial review via a preliminary motion filed with its initial response to that petition, it did not waive that right by failing to do so. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7-204(b); <em>Colao, </em>346 Md. at 362, 697 A.2d 96. Instead, DSS properly asserted its timeliness challenge by filing a motion to dismiss with its answering memorandum. <em>See Colao, </em>346 Md. at 362, 697 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Although that motion was filed fifteen months after Mr. B. petitioned for judicial review, the record shows that this delay resulted from a series of extensions granted to Mr. B. After the administrative record was filed on August 8, 2007, Mr. B. did not meet his responsibility to pay for a transcript of the recorded hearing before the ALJ, as required by Rule 7-206(a), or otherwise file his memorandum due under Rule 7-207(a), even after the court gave him two extensions of time to do so. DSS moved to dismiss Mr. B.\u2019s petition for judicial review on those grounds, and the court granted that motion on March 19, 2008. Asserting that he had been injured and out of work since July 13, 2007, Mr. B. moved for reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the dismissal. On May 22, 2008, the court granted that motion and permitted Mr. B. another sixty days to file the hearing transcript and ninety days to file his memorandum. Mr. B. filed the transcript on July 22, 2008 and his memorandum on August 22. In response, DSS filed its combined motion to dismiss and answering memorandum on September 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Without any hearing or explanation, the circuit court denied DSS\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree with DSS that this was error because the petition was undisputedly filed thirty-two days after the ALJ\u2019s decision was mailed, and the lateness of that filing was properly raised as an affirmative defense via DSS\u2019s timely motion to dismiss filed with its answering memorandum. <em>See J.T.W., </em>397 Md. at 88, 916 A.2d 235; <em>Colao, </em>346 Md. at 362-63, 697 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We must therefore vacate the judgment of the circuit court. To avoid further expense and delay, instead of remanding to the circuit court, we shall exercise our discretion to dismiss Mr. B.\u2019s petition for judicial review as untimely. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-604(e) (\u201cIn reversing or modifying a judgment in whole or in part, the Court may enter an appropriate judgment directly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Although Mr. B. may feel \u201cshortchanged\u201d by our dismissal of his petition on procedural grounds, we observe that, due to the circuit court\u2019s error in entertaining it, he has had the benefit of well-reasoned judicial review that, in our view, correctly explained why he is not entitled to the \u201cruled out\u201d finding that he seeks. Moreover, despite the \u201ccut and dried\u201d basis for our ruling, we have included extensive details from the ALJ\u2019s decision that demonstrate thorough consideration of the evidence and proper application of hearsay principles, and also provide Mr. B. with a clear explanation that a finding of \u201cruled out\u201d was not made because the children\u2019s strikingly graphic descriptions of sexual activities were not adequately refuted by Mr. B.\u2019s claims of \u201ccoaching\u201d and \u201cinappropriate exposure to sexual content\u201d by Grandfather. Given the contentious relationships and proceedings involving these family members, it is in the children\u2019s best interests for Mr. B. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>understand that, even if he had filed his petition for judicial review within the thirty day period, his efforts to obtain a \u201cruled out\u201d finding would not have succeeded because the \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d finding was supported by the substantial evidence cited in the ALJ\u2019s well-reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMING FINAL DECISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE VACATED.
