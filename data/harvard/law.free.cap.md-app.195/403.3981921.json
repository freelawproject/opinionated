The court imposed consecutive sentences of 15 years for each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Appellant presents four questions for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">1. Did the trial court err by denying a motion for mistrial after it was discovered that a sheriffs officer had closed the courtroom to the public, including members of Appellant\u2019s family, during jury selection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">2. Did the trial court err by asking the jury on <em>voir dire </em>whether they could convict the defendants in the absence of \u201cscientific\u201d evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">3. Did the trial court err by denying defense counsel\u2019s request to continue sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-15\">4. Were separate sentences for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery illegal under the circumstances in this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">On September 4, 2008, at approximately 11:30 p.m., two men robbed Ronald Bennett as he walked home from work. Appellant was charged with the following crimes: (1) robbery with a dangerous weapon; (2) robbery; (3) first degree assault; (4) second degree assault; (5) theft of property under $500; (6) wear, carry, and transport a handgun; (7) use of a handgun in a crime of violence; and (8) conspiracy to commit armed robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On April 27, 2009, trial commenced against appellant and his co-defendant, Donald Bland. Mr. Bennett testified that, as he walked home from work, two men yelled \u201cTommy\u201d and told him to stop. Mr. Bennett began walking faster, away from the two men. One of the men pointed a gun at Mr. Bennett, advising him not to run. The men caught up with him, and the other man searched Mr. Bennett and took his identification, cell phone, and duffel bag. The gunman continued to call Mr. Bennett \u201cTommy,\u201d but the other man corrected him, stating that Mr. Bennett \u201cwasn\u2019t the guy.\u201d Mr. Bennett testified that the gunman indicated that, if Mr. Bennett had been Tommy, he would have \u201ccut my dreads and then he was going to shoot me.\u201d The men let Mr. Bennett go, and when he was a block away from them, they asked Mr. Bennett if he wanted his bag back, but Mr. Bennett continued walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Mr. Bennett testified that the robbery occurred by a street light, and he could see both of the perpetrators\u2019 faces. Both men were wearing white t-shirts and \u201cdenim shorts, like capris.\u201d Mr. Bennett identified appellant as the person who \u201cwent in my pockets\u201d and Mr. Bland as the gunman.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>When Mr. Bennett arrived at his brother\u2019s home, he called 911. An officer responded and took Mr. Bennett to the police precinct. At the precinct, the police advised him that they had located two suspects. They transported Mr. Bennett to the place where the suspects were being held, and Mr. Bennett identified both suspects as the men who had robbed him earlier that night. Mr. Bennett subsequently identified appellant and Mr. Bland in photo arrays presented to him. In the first array, Mr. Bennett identified appellant, writing that he \u201cwas the guy that went through my pockets, took my w;allet and cell phone.\u201d In the second photo array, Mr. Bennett identified Mr. Bland as the one \u201cwith the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Officer Carmine Vignola testified that, in the early morning hours of September 5, 2008, he responded to a report of a robbery. He transported Mr. Bennett to the police station and then to the location where the suspects had been detained. Mr. Bennett identified the suspects as \u201cthe individuals that had robbed him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Officer James Howard saw appellant while on patrol on September 5, 2008. Appellant, who matched the description of one of the suspects, was \u201ctrotting\u201d out of an alley. Officer Howard made eye contact with appellant, who \u201ctook off in a full-fled[ge] run.\u201d Appellant tossed \u201ca sack\u201d over a fence and continued running. Officer Howard stopped appellant, handcuffed him, and called for backup. When other officers arrived, Officer Howard canvassed the area and recovered a gray backpack. When Officer Howard returned to the area where he had detained the suspect, he observed a second suspect, but he did not know how the police located the other man.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Howard transported appellant to the police station. Afterward, he checked the backseat of his vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>discovered a cell phone, which he turned over to the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Detective Arnold Pitman interviewed Mr. Bennett in the early morning hours of September 5, 2008. Mr. Bennett advised him that the assailants robbed him of his wallet, cell phone, and backpack, and he provided a description of both men. Detective Pitman instructed Officer Vignola to broadcast a description of the two suspects via radio to other police officers. When Detective Pitman learned that the police had located two suspects, he prepared two photo arrays, one for each of the suspects. Mr. Bennett viewed the photo arrays and positively identified appellant and Mr. Bland as the men who committed the robbery. Detective Pitman returned Mr. Bennett\u2019s property, including a gray backpack, a cell phone, and an earnings statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, counsel for appellant moved for judgment of acquittal on all counts. The court denied the motion. The defense rested without introducing any additional evidence. As indicated, the jury convicted appellant of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Right to a Public Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that \u201cthe trial court erred by denying a motion for a mistrial after it was discovered that a sheriffs officer had closed the courtroom to the public, including members of appellant\u2019s family, during jury selection.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>argues that, \u201c[w]hile the court had a legitimate interest in maintaining order in the courtroom and looking after the comfort of its occupants, it did not adequately balance those interests with [appellant\u2019s] constitutional right to a public trial.\u201d Appellant asserts that, \u201cbecause the officer\u2019s actions were not brought to light until after the fact, [he] never had the opportunity to suggest, and the court never had the opportunity to consider,\u201d whether there were other alternatives to excluding his family from the courtroom, \u201csuch as breaking the group of prospective jurors into smaller groups\u201d or \u201cdirecting [appellant\u2019s] family to remain silent during jury selection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The State contends that \u201cthe trial court properly refused to declare a mistrial after learning that, without the knowledge of the court or the parties, [appellant\u2019s] family members had been excluded from the courtroom for a limited part of the jury selection proceedings, during which there were not enough seats for all of the prospective jurors.\u201d The State argues that \u201cthe temporary, limited, and inadvertent exclusion of [appellant\u2019s] family during a portion of jury selection\u201d was <em>\u201cde minimus </em>\u201d and \u201ctoo trivial to implicate [appellant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to a public trial.\u201d It further contends that, \u201ceven if a Sixth Amendment analysis is appropriate, there were compelling, or at least substantial, interests justifying the exclusion and ... it was narrowly tailored to those interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">On the morning of the first day of trial, at 10:12 a.m., a large number of prospective jurors entered the courtroom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court stated: \u201cFill in every available seat, please folks. We\u2019ve got a full house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The voir dire process then began. After the court clerk completed roll call, the court asked the venire panel a series of questions. The court then called to the bench the prospective jurors who had indicated an affirmative response to a question and asked further questions. Prior to completing the voir dire process, the court took a break for lunch, instructing the prospective jurors to return at 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">When proceedings resumed in the afternoon, at 2:05 p.m., the clerk read off the numbers of the prospective jurors remaining, and the court prepared to continue with the individual questioning of the jurors. Prior to doing so, however, counsel approached the bench. Although not entirely clear, the record indicates that counsel approached to discuss the issue of the court closure, an issue to which it appears the court previously had been alerted, and counsel then handed the court a case, presumably <em>Watters v. State, </em>328 Md. 38, 612 A.2d 1288 (1992), <em>cert, denied, </em>507 U.S. 1024, 113 S.Ct. 1832, 123 L.Ed.2d 460 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After counsel gave the judge the case, the court commented about the small size of the courtroom and the security problems, stating that every seat was filled and jurors were standing. Counsel for Mr. Bland then stated that he wanted to wait to discuss the issue until his client arrived. The court and counsel then appeared to discuss other issues,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and they then proceeded with the questioning of the individual jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>After completing the strikes of prospective jurors for cause, counsel for appellant returned to the issue of the right to a public trial. Counsel moved for a mistrial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Your Honor, if we could just very briefly deal with that mistrial issue because I want to put that on the record now that Mr. Kelly is here. And I don\u2019t know if we need the Sheriffs input or not, but when I spoke to Mr. Kelly\u2019s father, he was here this morning. He was in the courtroom before we started the proceedings. And when I spoke to him over lunch, he indicated to me that he was asked by the Sheriffs office to leave, that there was \u2014 he was simply told that he couldn\u2019t be in here during the proceedings. I assume it\u2019s a space issue but, certain-iy-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">THE COURT: As far as I know. What I did note was that we didn\u2019t have enough seats for all of the jurors. We had jurors standing during voir dire until we sent some out of here. So if he was excluded on that basis, nobody brought it to my attention. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: I understand, Your Honor. And, certainly, I didn\u2019t know either until I stepped in the hall. I do want to make sure, certainly, that Mr. Kelly\u2019s family, and I\u2019m sure Mr. Bland feels the same way, can be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">THE COURT: They\u2019re actually going to be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Mr. Kelly has a Sixth Amendment right. It\u2019s clear to a public trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: To an open trial. Certainly, he wishes to exercise that [right]. And in keeping with that, Your Honor, just to protect the record, I would move for a mistrial at this point. I would simply make the proffer that, again, and I don\u2019t know if there is any factual exception to this on the State\u2019s part, that Mr. Kelly\u2019s family was asked to \u2014 Mr. Kelly\u2019s father, in particular, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The court then asked the sheriff what occurred. The sheriff acknowledged that she asked appellant\u2019s father to leave, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">[OFFICER]: Yeah I did. I didn\u2019t just ask his father to leave. I told everybody that was sitting in here that they had to leave because there\u2019s not enough room for their family to sit in here while we picked jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">THE COURT: Right. They were sitting amongst the jurors and I\u2019ve got to tell you even eight of them weren\u2019t able to sit (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">[OFFICER]: I think the problem was his father, he didn\u2019t understand why I asked him to leave and, once I explained it to him, he stood in agreement with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion \u201cat this point.\u201d It indicated, however, that it would review the case defense counsel had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The parties proceeded to select the jury. Following jury selection, the court made its final ruling denying the motion for a mistrial. The Court initially stated that \u201cthis matter was never brought to my attention,\u201d noting that, \u201cif it\u2019s not brought to us, there\u2019s just not much we can do.\u201d Although acknowledging that the exclusion in <em>Watters </em>also took place without the court\u2019s knowledge, the court distinguished <em>Watters </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">[I]n <em>Wat[t]ers, </em>the public was excluded in addition to the Defendant\u2019s family and the press. And, apparently, this was a hot case on the Eastern Shore. To my knowledge, there\u2019s been no press here and the public was not excluded in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">The big distinction, though, here in this case is we did not have enough seating. During the entire voir dire, we did not have enough seats for all of the jurors. We had a couple of jurors who were standing throughout the whole thing so we had no place for anybody else in the courtroom. And if we had shoe horned in \u2014 I guess you can always say, you know, we\u2019ve got ten people at the bench. I guess you could squeeze in 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>But if we\u2019d done that, the problem is putting in the family members in the middle of the voir dire of the array could cause terrible problems. Family members want to talk. What a wonderful guy the Defendant is, let\u2019s say. What a terrible guy the alleged victim is. And the jurors hear it. So in addition to not having any space at all, we don\u2019t have any space where we can keep them separate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The court then inquired regarding the amount of time that appellant\u2019s family members were excluded from the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">[THE COURT]: [A]s I understand this, this was a morning problem, kind of a.m. problem. Did they try to come in for the afternoon session, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t know, Your Hon- or, with respect to Mr. Kelly\u2019s family. I can tell the Court that Mr. Bland\u2019s family is here. I spoke with them after we spoke initially about this issue\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: \u2014 about them coming in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">THE COURT: But, I mean, there would have \u2014 I don\u2019t think they were excluded or were, you know, from the afternoon session. But maybe they took the exclusion this morning as being permanent. I don\u2019t know. I do know that they\u2019ve been here since we picked the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">The court then concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">I just think, under the circumstances, I have to deny the Motion for Mistrial. We just didn\u2019t have any room. The jurors were standing. If we\u2019d squeezed a couple in, they would have been smack dab in the middle of the array. I hope the Court of Appeals will keep in mind that we labor in this venue with inadequate physical planning. This is not utopia. It\u2019s not Lake Wobegon. It\u2019s not Howard County. It\u2019s not Montgomery County. It\u2019s Baltimore City and we just don\u2019t have the plan to do everything we might like to do. I think it\u2019s regrettable, but I think it\u2019s distinguishable under <em>Wat[t]ers. </em>So you have my ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Closing of Courtroom during Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... public trial.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. This Court has explained the purpose of the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">A public trial furnishes the public with the opportunity to observe the judicial process, and thus ensures that the judge and prosecutor carry out their duties responsibly. Indeed, [t]he knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power. It thus is a safeguard against any attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution. And, finally, it encourages witnesses to come forward and discourages perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>Markham v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 140, 152, 984 A.2d 262 (2009) (citations and quotations omitted). <em>Accord Peterson v. Williams, </em>85 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir.1996) (values furthered by the public trial guarantee are: \u201c(1) to ensure a fair trial; (2) to remind the prosecutor and judge of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions; (3) to encourage witnesses to come forward; and (4) to discourage perjury\u201d) (citing <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 46-47, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984)), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 878, 117 S.Ct. 202, 136 L.Ed.2d 138 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a public trial, however, is not absolute. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 102, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009). \u201cIn some circumstances, the trial court can close the courtroom \u2018in order to maintain order, to preserve the dignity of the court, and to meet the State\u2019s interests in safeguarding witnesses and protecting confidentiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Markham, </em>189 Md.App. at 152, 984 A.2d 262 (quoting <em>Robinson, </em>410 Md. at 103, 976 A.2d 1072). \u201cSuch circumstances will be rare, however, and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 45, 104 S.Ct. 2210.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The Supreme Court has identified four factors that the trial court must consider before closing a courtroom: (1) \u201c \u2018the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced\u2019 (2) \u201c \u2018the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest\u2019 (3) \u201c \u2018the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding\u2019 and (4) the trial court \u201c \u2018must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Presley v.

Accord Watters, </em>328 Md. at 45 n. 3, 612 A.2d 1288. In <em>Presley, </em>the Supreme Court held that the trial court violated Presley\u2019s right to a public trial when it excluded his uncle from the courtroom during voir dire due to space limitations and a concern that jurors might be exposed to \u201cinherently prejudicial remarks from observers during voir dire.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 722-23. The Georgia Supreme Court had found no error, stating that the trial court had an overriding interest in ensuring that the potential jurors were not exposed to prejudicial remarks, and rejecting the argument that the court had a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>to consider alternatives to closure when Presley had not offered such alternatives. <em>Presley v. State, </em>285 Ga. 270, 674 S.E.2d 909, 911 (2009). The Supreme Court, in its summary <em>per curiam </em>opinion, disagreed, pointing to the \u201cexplicit\u201d direction from <em>Waller </em>that \u201cthe trial court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>consider reasonable alternatives to closing\u201d the courtroom. <em>Presley, </em>130 S.Ct. at 724 (citing <em>Waller, </em>468 U.S. at 48, 104 S.Ct. 2924). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">Trial courts are obligated to take every reasonable measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal trials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court could not have accommodated the public at Presley\u2019s trial. Without knowing the precise circumstances, some possibilities include reserving one or more rows for the public; dividing the jury venire panel to reduce courtroom congestion; or instructing prospective jurors not to engage or interact with audience members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 725.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As the trial court noted, the Court of Appeals also has addressed the right to a public trial in the context of voir dire. In <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 41-42, 49, 612 A.2d 1288, similar to this case, a deputy sheriff excluded people from the courtroom \u201c[w]ithout the knowledge or consent of the trial judge or the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 612 A.2d 1288. The sheriff \u201cexcluded the public, including members of defendant\u2019s family and possibly representatives of the press, from the courtroom during voir dire and jury selection \u2014 a process that consumed the entire first morning of trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The deputy sheriff testified that he closed the courtroom because of \u201c \u2018the number of people involved in the case and the courtroom would not handle all the persons who wanted to get into the courtroom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Court of Appeals held that, because the courtroom was not full, and there were \u201c \u2018some seats\u2019 available,\u201d the circumstances \u201cdid not present a compelling need for excluding members of the defendant\u2019s family as well as the press and the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 45, 612 A.2d 1288. Moreover, it held that, \u201ceven if the State could show that under the circumstances then prevailing the government had a legitimate interest in preventing overcrowding, it could not show that the exclusion of all persons was a narrowly tailored means of protecting that interest,\u201d noting that \u201cempty seats were left vacant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 612 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\"><em>De minimus </em>Closure</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The State\u2019s initial contention here is that the closure \u201cwas so trivial or de minimus that it did not implicate [appellant\u2019s] public-trial rights.\u201d A triviality standard is different from a harmless error standard; it looks to whether the closure implicated the protections and values of the Sixth Amendment. <em>State v. Vanness, </em>304 Wis.2d 692, 738 N.W.2d 154, 157 (App.2007) (citing <em>Peterson, </em>85 F.3d at 42).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Appellant\u2019s sole response to this argument in his reply brief was to rely on <em>Presley. </em>He contends that <em>Presley </em>disposes of the State\u2019s argument that the closure of the courtroom for only a few hours of jury selection can be dismissed as a <em>de minimus </em>violation of his right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Presley </em>is misplaced. The summary <em>per curiam </em>opinion in <em>Presley </em>does not reflect that any argument was made, or considered by the Court, regarding whether the closure was so trivial or <em>de minimus </em>that it did not implicate the right to a public trial. <em>Presley </em>is not dispositive on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The Court of Appeals, however, has addressed the concept of a <em>de minimus </em>closure that would not implicate a defendant\u2019s public trial rights. In <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 46, 612 A.2d 1288, the Court expressed agreement with the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201cnot every closure is of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although noting that \u201cthe deprivation of the constitutional right to a public trial cannot be harmless error,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 612 A.2d 1288, the Court agreed that a violation could be \u201cclassified as <em>de minimus </em>and undeserving of constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 612 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The Court, however, rejected the State\u2019s argument in that case that the closure was <em>\u201cde minimus. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 612 A.2d 1288. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">The scope of the closure in this case was substantial. The courtroom was open only to court personnel, the venireper-sons, and witnesses. All other members of the public, including members of the defendant\u2019s family and the press, were barred. The closure extended over a significant period of time \u2014 an entire morning of trial during which the voir dire and selection and swearing of the jury were accomplished. Although we agree with the State that not every technical violation of the Sixth Amendment right of open trial requires a new proceeding or trial, we would be hard pressed to declare a violation of this magnitude <em>de mini-mus, </em>or otherwise not of constitutional significance. We conclude that this violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right carries with it the presumption of specific prejudice mandated by <em>Waller, </em>and thus requires the granting of appropriate relief. Under the particular facts of this case, that relief is necessarily the granting of a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The facts in <em>Watters </em>are similar to the present case in that both cases involve a sheriff excluding persons from voir dire without the knowledge of the parties or the court. As discussed, <em>infra, </em>however, there are significant factual differences between the two cases that persuade us to reach a conclusion different from that reached in <em>Watters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">In determining whether a courtroom closure is so <em>de minimus </em>or trivial that it does not implicate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, courts look to various factors. These factors include the length of the closure, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>significance of the proceedings that took place while the courtroom was closed, and the scope of the closure, <em>i.e., </em>whether it was a total or partial closure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">With respect to the length of time that the courtroom was closed, a closure for a shorter duration obviously is more likely to be held to be trivial or <em>de minimus </em>and not deserving of constitutional protection. For example, in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 619, 626-27, 814 A.2d 1 (2002), <em>cert, denied, </em>374 Md. 84, 821 A.2d 371 (2003), although this Court did not use the language <em>\u201cde minimus </em>\u201d or \u201ctrivial,\u201d we held that a closure for \u201conly a very limited period of time-the rendering of the verdict,\u201d when other members of the public were present, did not violate \u201c[t]he guarantees of an open and public trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Although the length of time, by itself, is not dispositive, courts have found that a courtroom closure of less than an hour was <em>de minimus. See Peterson, </em>85 F.3d at 41, 42, 44 (20 minute closure while defendant testified was \u201cextremely short\u201d and \u201ctoo trivial\u201d to constitute Sixth Amendment violation); <em>United States v. Al-Smadi, </em>15 F.3d 153, 154-55 (10th Cir.1994) (rejecting public trial violation, in part, because 20 minute closure was \u201cbrief\u2019); <em>People v. Bui, </em>183 Cal.App.4th 675, 686-87, 689, 107 Cal.Rptr.3d 585 (Cal.Ct.App.) (exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of three people for 40 minutes during voir dire was <em>de minimis </em>and did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">When the closure is for an entire day or longer, by contrast, courts have declined to classify the closure as <em>de minimus. See Owens v. United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 63 (1st Cir.2007) (rejecting the argument that closure to family was trivial because \u201cthis was not a mere fifteen or twenty-minute closure; rather, Owens\u2019 trial was allegedly closed to the public for an entire day while jury selection proceeded\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Cohen, </em>456 Mass. 94, 921 N.E.2d 906, 919 (2010) (finding that courtroom closure for three days during voir dire could not be classified as \u201ctrivial\u201d or <em>\u201cde minimus </em>\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">When, as here, the closure is for a period over an hour, but less than an entire day, courts have reached conflicting results. In <em>Watters, </em>as indicated, the Court of Appeals considered this amount of time to be a factor weighing against a finding that the closure was <em>de minimus. Watters, </em>328 Md. at 49, 612 A.2d 1288 (closure of courtroom during voir dire for \u201can entire morning\u201d was \u201csubstantial\u201d). There are decisions in other states supporting this conclusion. <em>See State v. Torres, </em>844 A.2d 155, 162 (R.I.2004) (exclusion of defendant\u2019s two sisters for \u201can entire morning\u201d during voir dire \u201ccannot be considered <em>de minimus\u201d); Vanness, </em>738 N.W.2d at 158 (in contrast to 20 minute closures in other cases, \u201cclosure of over an hour while the court was in session of a one day trial was not \u2018extremely short\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Other courts, however, have found a closure for this time period to be <em>de minimus. See Gibbons v. Savage, </em>555 F.3d 112, 121 (2d Cir.) (judge\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s mother from courtroom during afternoon of first day of jury selection was too trivial to violate right to public trial), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 61, 175 L.Ed.2d 233 (2009); <em>People v. Woodward, </em>4 Cal.4th 376, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d 434, 841 P.2d 954, 959 (1992) (90 minute closure of courtroom during closing argument during trial that lasted \u201cover a period of one month, and required 28 actual court hours to complete\u201d did not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Sixth Amendment right to a public trial), <em>cert, denied, </em>507 U.S. 1053, 113 S.Ct. 1950, 123 L.Ed.2d 655 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">As indicated, although the length of time the courtroom is closed is a significant factor, it is not, by itself, dispositive. In addition to the duration of the closure, the significance of the proceedings that took place while the courtroom was closed is an important factor. In both <em>Watters </em>and <em>Torres, </em>where closures for half a day were found not to be <em>de minimus, </em>the courts emphasized that the courtroom was closed during the entire process of voir dire and jury selection. <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 49, 612 A.2d 1288 (closure during time when the \u201cvoir dire and selection and swearing of the jury were accomplished\u201d); <em>Torres, </em>844 A.2d at 162 (closure \u201cthrough the entire jury selection and <em>voir dire </em>\u201d). By contrast, in <em>Bui, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at 677, 688, 107 Cal.Rptr.3d 585, the Court of Appeal of California found that the closure during 40 minutes of voir dire was <em>de minimus </em>because the closure occurred \u201cfor a very limited period, during only a small part of the voir dire of prospective jurors, and not during the evidentiary phase of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In this regard, we find instructive the analysis of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Gibbons, </em>555 F.3d at 114, 119-21. In that case, as indicated, the court held that the exclusion of the defendant\u2019s mother during the first afternoon of several days of voir dire and jury selection was \u201ctoo trivial\u201d to warrant reversal of Gibbons\u2019 convictions. The court noted that, although the denial of a public trial was a structural error to which the harmless error analysis did not apply, <em>id. </em>at 119, \u201cit does not follow that every temporary instance of unjustified exclusion of the public \u2014 no matter how brief or trivial, and no matter how inconsequential the proceedings that occurred during an unjustified closure \u2014 would require that a conviction be overturned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. The court explained that, in making the determination whether a closure is trivial, it looks to several factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">[W]e look to the values the Supreme Court explained were furthered by the public trial guarantee, focusing on (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ensuring a fair trial, (2) reminding the prosecutor and judge of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions, (3) encouraging witnesses to come forward, and (4) discouraging perjury. Essentially, our analysis turns on whether the conduct at issue \u201csubverts the values the drafters of the Sixth Amendment sought to protect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay0\"><em>Id. </em>at 121 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In finding that the closure in that case was \u201ctoo trivial\u201d to justify vacating Gibbons\u2019 conviction, the court explained that the \u201cthird and fourth values derived from <em>Waller </em>and articulated in <em>Peterson, </em>are not implicated by voir dire because no witnesses testified,\u201d and therefore, these factors \u201cdo not weigh either in favor or against a triviality finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then stated that the first and second values were not subverted by \u201climiting presence at the voir dire proceedings to only the attorneys, judge, defendant, and prospective jurors\u201d because the jurors were interviewed in an adjacent room, and \u201cnothing of significance\u201d occurred in the courtroom while the defendant\u2019s mother was excluded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Even if the trial judge had not excluded Gibbons\u2019s mother from the courtroom, she would not have been able to watch a significant portion of what occurred during that afternoon session because the private interviews of individual jurors as to their reasons for inability to serve were justifiably conducted in an adjacent room out of the hearing and sight of the other jurors. Further, nothing of significance happened during the part of the session that took place in the courtroom. The judge read the indictment, asked questions of a few jurors, and provided administrative details on what the jurors should expect if chosen. No prospective jurors were excused except with the consent of both parties. No peremptory challenges were made, and no objections were asserted by either party to anything that occurred. The next morning, when voir dire resumed, Gibbons\u2019s mother was allowed to watch the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\"><em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court held: \u201cAlthough the closure was not justified, we conclude upon examination of all details of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>occurred, that event was too trivial to warrant the remedy of nullifying an otherwise properly conducted state court criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Here, as in <em>Gibbons, </em>the exclusion was not for the entire voir dire proceedings. Moreover, as in <em>Gibbons, </em>and as discussed, <em>infra, </em>even if appellant\u2019s family had not been excluded from the courtroom during the morning portion of voir dire, they would not have been privy to much of what occurred; a significant portion of the proceedings involved questioning of individual jurors at the bench, a procedure that typically cannot be heard by spectators in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">With respect to the final factor, the scope of the closure, some courts have considered whether the closure was a partial, as opposed to a total, closure. In <em>Woodward, </em>14 Cal.Rptr.2d 434, 841 P.2d at 955, during a portion of the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, the bailiff had posted a \u201cdo not enter\u201d sign on the door and locked the courtroom doors. The courtroom remained closed for one and one-half hours, until defense counsel alerted the court to the situation. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether Woodward was denied the right to a public trial, the California Supreme Court found significant that \u201cthe courtroom was never cleared to remove all spectators for a significant period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 958. The court found persuasive the argument that the closing was too trivial to amount to a denial of the public trial right, noting that \u201cthe closure did not exclude preexisting spectators, did not include any of the evidentiary phase of the trial and lasted only one and one-half hours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 959 (citing <em>Snyder v. Coiner, </em>510 F.2d 224, 230 (4th Cir.1975)). <em>See also State v. Venable, </em>411 N.J.Super. 458, 986 A.2d 743, 748 (2010) (in finding that court\u2019s announcement that family members would not be allowed in the courtroom during jury selection was too trivial to warrant a finding of a violation of the right to a public trial, court noted that closure was partial, limited to family members as opposed to all spectators).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Applying the above factors to the present case, we hold that the closure here was <em>de minimus </em>and does not justify reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions. With respect to the length of the closure, the parties agree that the exclusion was limited to the morning and lasted approximately two to three hours.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This amount of time is not extensive, but it clearly is not inconsequential, and it falls within the time frame in which courts have reached conflicting results. Thus, it is necessary to look at the other two factors, <em>i.e., </em>the significance of the proceedings that took place and the scope of the closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">With respect to the nature of the proceedings that occurred during the closure, the proceedings here involved, as they did in <em>Watters, </em>voir dire. In contrast to <em>Watters, </em>however, appellant\u2019s family was not excluded for the entire voir dire and jury selection process, but only for a portion of it. As indicated, appellant acknowledges that the exclusion by the sheriff only encompassed the morning session, and voir dire and jury selection had not been completed at that time. Indeed, the court made explicitly clear prior to the selection of the jury that appellant\u2019s family was entitled to be in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In <em>Gibbons, </em>555 F.3d at 121, the Second Circuit, in finding that the closure was <em>de minimus, </em>noted that the mother was excluded from only part of the voir dire process, and it found as a significant factor that much of the voir dire proceeding from which Gibbons\u2019 mother was excluded was conducted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>manner that could not be viewed by spectators. Similarly, here, a significant portion of the voir dire from which the family members were excluded involved questioning of the prospective jurors at the bench, a process that typically is not audible to spectators in the courtroom. When court resumed in the afternoon, the voir dire process continued, and it is clear that the family was permitted in the courtroom during jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Thus, the concern expressed in <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 48, 612 A.2d 1288, that family members were prevented from contributing \u201ctheir knowledge or insight to the jury selection\u201d process, and that the prospective jurors were prevented from seeing \u201cthe interested individuals,\u201d is not implicated here. The closure in this case, unlike in <em>Watters, </em>did not extend to the actual selection of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">With respect to the final factor, the scope of the closure, the exclusion in this case was partial; it was not a total closure of the courtroom. The record reflects that only appellant\u2019s family members were excluded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Watters, </em>by contrast, the exclusion involved \u201cthe defendant\u2019s family as well as the press and the public.\u201d 328 Md. at 45, 612 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Analyzing all the circumstances of this case, we hold that the closure here was <em>de minimus </em>and did not implicate appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment constitutional right to a public trial. In reaching this conclusion, we consider as significant: (1) the limited duration of the closure, two to three hours during voir dire; (2) that the closure did not encompass the entire proceedings of voir dire and jury selection, and that a significant portion of the proceedings during that time were not even audible to spectators in the courtroom; and (3) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the closure was a partial one, and not a total exclusion of all spectators. Because there was no violation of appellant\u2019s right to a public trial, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">During voir dire, the court asked the prospective jurors the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">Now, I\u2019m going to assume, having done this a few times, that many of you watch way too much television, including those so-called realistic crime shows like CSI: New York and CSI: Miami and CSI: Glen Burnie and Law and Order and the rest of it. And I trust that you understand that these crime shows are fiction and fantasy and for your entertainment. And for dramatic effect, they purport to rely upon \u201cscientific evidence\u201d to convict guilty persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">While this is certainly acceptable as entertainment, you must not allow your entertainment to interfere with your duties as a juror. Therefore, if you are currently of the opinion that you cannot convict a Defendant without \u201cscientific evidence,\u201d regardless of all of the other evidence in the case and regardless of the instructions that I give you as to the law of the case, please stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court erred by asking the jury on voir dire whether they could convict the defendants in the absence of \u2018scientific\u2019 evidence.\u201d He asserts that the question asked was \u201ca nearly word-for-word version of the question\u201d that the Court of Appeals recently found to be improper in <em>Charles and Drake v. State, </em>414 Md. 726, 730, 997 A.2d 154 (2010). Acknowledging that defense counsel did not object to the voir dire question in this case, appellant requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>this Court to exercise its discretion to engage in plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The State asserts that appellant waived any argument regarding this voir dire question. It further contends that plain error review is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>Charles and Drake v. State, </em>a decision issued after the trial in this case, the Court of Appeals addressed the propriety of a voir dire question regarding the \u201cCSI effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731-33, 997 A.2d 154.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In that case, the trial judge, the same judge who presided in this case, gave an almost identical venire question.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions, holding that the trial \u201cjudge abused his discretion by suggesting to the panel that \u2018convicting]\u2019 Drake and Charles was the only option in the present case; this suggestive question poisoned the venire, thereby depriving Drake and Charles of a fair and impartial jury.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 739, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>997 A.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">In <em>Charles and Drake, </em>the defense objected to the voir dire questioning when it occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 730, 997 A.2d 154. Here, however, as appellant acknowledges, there was no objection to the question. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a), an appellate court ordinarily will not decide an issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d <em>See Robinson, </em>410 Md. at 103-104, 976 A.2d 1072 (appellant\u2019s failure to make a timely objection at trial bar appellate review of that issue as a matter of right); <em>Moye v.

Rule 8-131(a) to address an unpreserved issue. As the Court of Appeals has explained, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">It is a discretion that appellate courts should rarely exercise, as considerations of both fairness and judicial efficiency ordinarily require that all challenges that a party desires to make to a trial court\u2019s ruling, action, or conduct be presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\"><em>Chaney v.

In that case, James challenged the trial court\u2019s voir dire procedure of asking a continuous series of questions and then inquiring of each prospective juror, at the bench, whether he or she \u201chad any information to give the Court in response to my questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 991 A.2d 122. After trial in that case, the Court of Appeals held that this method of voir dire was improper because the delay between presentation of the questions and the answers \u201cdid not effectively ensure a fair and impartial jury[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 991 A.2d 122 (quoting <em>Wright v.

Judge Meredith, speaking for this Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">We decline to exercise our discretion in this case to notice plain error in the trial court\u2019s voir dire. Although an appellate court may address an unpreserved issue to \u201ccommunicate a desired message to the bench and bar that might otherwise go unsent,\u201d <em>McMillan [v.

Moreover, in this case, although the wording of the specific voir dire question was improper, the record as a whole does not lead to the conclusion that the jurors were under the impression that convicting appellant was the only option.

The prosecutor stated that she \u201cdid not fill one completely out but I do have guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Counsel for appellant then requested a continuance, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Your Honor, on behalf of Mr. Kelly I would ask the court to continue this matter briefly so we can better prepare for sentencing. I know [appellant] asked his family, who wanted to be here, were able to attend some of the trial and were not able to be here today. I also think it may make some sense to postpone [appellant\u2019s] matter so I can try to potentially resolve two of the other pending matters that he has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>And finally, Your Honor, I also anticipate filing a motion for a new trial. I would suggest to the Court that since that needs to be filed within the next ten days we could set a date in just about two weeks. I could get that to [the prosecutor] probably Monday or Tuesday with a copy to [Mr. Bland\u2019s counsel] then we could have the new trial motion. We could also do sentencing on that date and I think all the parties, I think I speak for [Mr. Bland\u2019s counsel] when I say that at that point he would be in a better position in terms of going forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">THE COURT: Counsel, I have, certainly for Mr. Bland I have a very complete work up from the medical services division which I have read and I\u2019m going to give to the Clerk for filing in this. Madam Clerk? In this case. But I see, as far as I\u2019m concerned on the negative side, from your perspective, what I need to know are his prior record. I have convictions in this case. I have the facts in this case. His age. And the guidelines. That\u2019s really what I need to know on the negative side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">On the positive side, I\u2019ll accept as true any proffers you wish to give me and I\u2019ve already reviewed and have read the medical report for Mr. Bland. So I don\u2019t see any reason to wait but your motion is noted. You can still file your motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Counsel for Mr. Bland also raised the issue of a pre-sentence investigation (\u201cPSI\u201d) report, but the court stated that it was the court\u2019s understanding that, except in circumstances not applicable to this case, \u201cthe PSI is within [the] discretion of the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The court then elicited information about appellant, including his age, his criminal record, and the sentencing guidelines. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The prosecutor initially proffered that the guidelines for appellant for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery were four to eight years for each offense. She later amended those numbers, stating that, because Mr. Kelly used a toy gun, not a \u201cweapon,\u201d the guidelines were three to seven years for each offense. The prosecutor advised the court of appellant\u2019s record, which at age 22 included second degree assault, a failure to comply with a peace order, felony theft, a previous violation of probation, and misdemeanor theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">I\u2019ll tell the Court that Mr. Kelly\u2019s [the] same age as Mr. Bland; he\u2019s 22 years of age. He\u2019s a graduate of high school. He graduated from Wallbrook High School ... in I believe 2004 so he does have his high school diploma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">He lived almost all of his life with his father who lives ... in Baltimore City and his father is here and I would ask him to address the Court in a few minutes, Your Honor. Mr. Kelly had some really positive things going on for him. He was working. He actually had had two jobs at one point. He was working at the stadium and then also at a fast food restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Your Honor, he was doing the best that he could to stay out of trouble. I think it\u2019s certainly, I note that he\u2019s been in trouble before. I\u2019m not trying to minimize that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">He was on probation for misdemeanor assault. I agree with the Court as to that. But I would ask the Court to consider that you have a young man who, certainly every dealing that I\u2019ve had with him he recognized the seriousness of these allegations and certainly recognized how serious it was to assist me in trying to prepare a defense for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">I think you have a young man, Your Honor, who if the Court believes incarceration is appropriate and certainly I understand that\u2019s likely to happen, I would ask the Court to fashion a sentence which would reflect the fact that he\u2019s a young man who perhaps needs to learn something but that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>not someone that we ought to throw away, lock him up and throw away the key.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">There\u2019s of course the option of boot camp. The[re] are programs like that in the Division of Correction. Which could allow some sort of rehabilitation to take place. And certainly I would ask the Court to consider a sentence within the guideline figures. If the Court imposes a guideline sentence, I would ask the Court to consider running the conspiracy and the robbery counts concurrent given the facts of this case. And also because I think that would be a sufficient sentence to both deter certainly Mr. Kelly from any sort of future behavior but also understanding that he\u2019s likely to receive a consecutive sentence in Baltimore County for that probation violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">So I\u2019d ask the Court to consider all of those things in sentencing. Certainly you have a young man, Your Honor, who I think has it in him to do good things and I\u2019d ask the Court to put him in a position where after he\u2019s finished serving this sentence that he\u2019s still a young man and he can do some of those things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Appellant\u2019s father, Kenneth Kelly, Sr., then addressed the court. He stated that appellant was \u201ca good kid,\u201d and although \u201cthe streets basically changed him,\u201d he was \u201cnot that type of kid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Defense counsel then advised the court that appellant\u2019s parents divorced when appellant was eight years old, that appellant had a \u201cdifficult time,\u201d and \u201cthere was certainly some psychiatric issues, some counseling, associated with [the divorce] so I would tell the Court Mr. Kelly does have some issues that I think he\u2019s dealing with as well.\u201d Counsel reiterated his request for a \u201csentence within the guideline range.\u201d Appellant declined to make a statement in allocution. The court imposed consecutive sentences of 15 years for the robbery conviction and 15 years for the conspiracy to commit robbery conviction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cThe decision whether to grant a request for continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Stone v.

Appellant has failed to identify what information he was unable to present due to the court\u2019s denial of his request. <em>See Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 706-07, 759 A.2d 764 (2000) (finding no abuse of discretion in denying the request to postpone sentencing, noting \u201c[a]ppellant never specified, at trial or on appeal, how his sentencing case might have been presented differently if he had had more time\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>549 U.S. 1342, 127 S.Ct. 2063, 167 L.Ed.2d 770 (2007). The court stated that it would \u201caccept as true\u201d any proffer that defense counsel gave. The record indicates that counsel presented the court with information regarding appellant\u2019s age, his educational history, his family background, work experience, and family involvement.

State, </em>321 Md. 214, 218 n. 2, 582 A.2d 525 (1990). \u201cThe required evidence test \u2018focuses upon the elements of each offense; if all the elements of one offense are included in the other offense, so that only the latter offense contains a distinct element or distinct elements, the former mergers into the latter.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGrath, </em>356 Md. at 23-24, 736 A.2d 1067 (quoting <em>Lancaster, </em>332 Md. at 391-92, 631 A.2d 453).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Even when offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, merger may be appropriate under the rule of lenity. The rule of lenity provides that, \u201c \u201cwhere there is no indication that the Legislature intended multiple punishments for the same act, a court will not impose multiple punishments, but will, for sentencing purposes, merge one offense into the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 356, 893 A.2d 1018 (quoting <em>McGrath, </em>356 Md. at 25, 736 A.2d 1067). The Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cEven if two offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, merger for purposes of sentencing may be appropriate under the rule of lenity or based on the rule of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Monoker, </em>321 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Md. at 222, 582 A.2d 525. <em>Accord Marlin v.

As a principle of statutory interpretation, \u201cthe rule of lenity applies where both offenses are statutory in nature or where one offense is statutory and one is derivative of common law.\u201d <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 434, 855 A.2d 1175 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The Maryland appellate courts have consistently declined to merge a conviction for conspiracy with a conviction for the substantive offense under the required evidence test or the rule of lenity. <em>See, e.g., Khalifa, </em>382 Md. at 437, 855 A.2d 1175 (conspiracy to detain a child and accessory to detain a child); <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 759, 506 A.2d 580 (1986) (conspiracy to murder and murder), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996); <em>Wooten-Bey v.

State, </em>89 Md.App. 626, 634-35, 599 A.2d 465 (1991) (conspiracy to distribute cocaine and distribution). The rationale behind these decisions is that \u201ca substantive offense is generally distinct from the act of conspiracy to commit the offense.\u201d <em>Khalifa, </em>382 Md. at 436, 855 A.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In <em>Woolen-Bey, </em>this Court explained why the offenses of conspiracy to rob and attempted armed robbery did not merge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">We thus have two separate criminal acts for which the Legislature has provided distinct punishments.... It makes sense that, because the two crimes and penalties address different criminal behavior, separate sentences be imposed. In the instant case, appellant received the first 10-year sentence for <em>planning </em>the robbery. The second sentence imposed for the attempt was for the steps appellant took toward <em>consummating </em>that plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">76 Md.App. at 629-30, 547 A.2d 1086. Accordingly, the Court upheld the two sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>In light of the above cases, appellant does not argue that his convictions for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery merge under the required evidence rule or the rule of lenity. Rather, he contends that the principle of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d requires the merger of the sentences, asserting in support that there was \u201cno evidence that the conspiracy embraced criminal objectives other than the substantive offense for which [he] was convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The State disagrees, relying on this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Wooten-Bey, </em>76 Md.App. at 629-30, 547 A.2d 1086, that the crimes involve \u201ctwo separate criminal acts for which the Legislature has provided distinct punishments.\u201d It argues that \u201c[p]rinciples of fundamental fairness do not trump the clear legislative intent to permit separate sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We agree with the State. The cases on which appellant relies, in which the principle of fundamental fairness required merger, involved situations where one crime was \u201can integral component of\u2019 or \u201cincidental to\u201d the other crime. <em>See Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 223-24, 582 A.2d 525 (solicitation was \u201cpart and parcel of the ultimate conspiracy and thereby an integral component of it\u201d); <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 150-53, 882 A.2d 900 (destruction of property was incidental to breaking and entering of dwelling), <em>cert, denied, </em>390 Md. 91, 887 A.2d 656 (2005). As indicated, however, conspiracy is not \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of or \u201cincidental to\u201d the substantive offense; it is a separate offense. Principles of fairness do not prevent separate sentences for these separate offenses. <em>See Fenwick v. State, </em>135 Md.App. 167, 177, 761 A.2d 1021 (2000) (rejecting merger of fourth degree burglary and second degree rape conviction, finding \u201cno fairness or rule of lenity reason that these separate acts and distinct crimes cannot or should not be punished by separate sentences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the principle of fundamental fairness requires his sentences to merge is without merit. The court properly imposed separate sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">. On the first day of trial, because the weapon used in the robbery was \"a toy plastic pistol,\" the State nol prossed the following charges: robbery with a deadly weapon; first degree assault; wear, carry, and transport a handgun; and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.

With respect to the first factor, <em>i.e., </em>whether the party seeking to close the courtroom advanced \"an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,\u201d <em>Presley v. Georgia, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 721, 724, - L.Ed.2d-(2010) (quoting <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984)), this Court has held that, where there is a partial closure of the courtroom, where only certain persons are barred from the courtroom, the trial court may close the courtroom based on the \"less stringent 'substantial reason\u2019 test ... in recognition that a partial courtroom closure does not 'implicate the same secrecy and fairness concerns that a total closure does.' \u201d <em>Longos v.

The court declined to address Presley's additional argument that there was not a sufficient interest to justify closure. <em>Presley, </em>130 S.Ct. at 725. It did state, however, that the \"generic risk of jurors overhearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any specific threat or incident, is inherent whenever members of the public are present during the selection of jurors,\u201d and it noted, \"[i]f broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a matter of course.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">.

The State suggests that an additional factor to consider is whether the closure was intentional or inadvertent. Some courts do consider whether the closure was inadvertent. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cohen, </em>456 Mass. 94, 921 N.E.2d 906, 919 (2010) (\"whether the closure was \u2018inadvertent\u2019 on the part of the judge is sometimes mentioned as one factor relevant to the analysis\u201d). Other courts find this factor irrelevant to the analysis. <em>See Walton v. Briley, </em>361 F.3d 431, 433 (7th Cir.2004) (\"Whether the closure was intentional or inadvertent is constitutionally irrelevant.\u201d); <em>State v.

We question how it is relevant to the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial whether a closure was intentional or inadvertent. We need not, however, resolve this issue in this case. Even if inadvertence is a relevant factor, the closure here was not inadvertent. Rather, it was an intentional exclusion of spectators. That the intentional closure was by the sheriff's office rather than the court does not matter. <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 49-50, 612 A.2d 1288 (it is \"of little moment\u201d that the closure of the courtroom was \"by a state official other than the judge\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">. In <em>State v.

The sheriff excluded appellant's family from the courtroom at the beginning of the first morning of trial, which the record reflects was 10:12 a.m. The State asserts that, given the break for lunch, and that court resumed at 2:05 p.m., the closure continued \"no more than 2 or 3 hours.\u201d Although the record is not clear whether appellant\u2019s family returned to the courtroom when proceedings resumed at 2:05 p.m., it is clear that the court and counsel were aware of the issue at that time. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated at argument that his contention involves only a closure during the morning portion of voir dire, and he agrees with the State\u2019s assertion that this involved a period of two to three hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\">. In support of his motion for a mistrial, appellant\u2019s attorney argued that appellant\u2019s father was asked to leave the courtroom. The sheriff said that she asked appellant\u2019s father to leave and \"everybody that was sitting in here\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s not enough room for <em>their family </em>to sit in here while we picked jurors.\u201d (emphasis added).
