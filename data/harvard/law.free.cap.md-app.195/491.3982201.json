Following a hearing in February 2009, Alijah was declared a CINA, and placed in the care and custody of his father. After a review hearing in May 2009, the juvenile master recommended that Alijah remain in Mr. A.\u2019s care, with supervised visitation granted to appellant, and that the court terminate its jurisdiction. Unhappy with that recommendation, appellant noted her exceptions. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County held a de novo exceptions hearing on October 23, 2009, and overruled Ms. Q.\u2019s exceptions on December 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">This appeal followed. Appellant presents two questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>I. Did the court err in discharging the mother\u2019s counsel [at the exceptions hearing] without first obtaining a valid waiver of her right to counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">II. Did the court err in denying the mother custody and unsupervised visitation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Alijah was born on December 14, 2007. On December 17, 2008, DSS filed a CINA petition alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Ms. Q. had a history of drug use; that Alijah was born exposed to drugs; that Ms. Q. had been absent from the family home; and that both parents had exposed Alijah to domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">At a preliminary proceeding on January 14, 2009, both parents were advised of their rights, including the right to counsel. Both requested legal representation by the Office of the Public Defender. In preparation for a CINA hearing on February 10, 2009, DSS submitted a report dated February 8, 2009. It alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Ms. Q. had not yet entered an inpatient treatment program;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Ms. Q. admitted to smoking crack cocaine on Christmas Day; that domestic violence between Ms. Q. and Mr. A. continued to be a problem; that Ms. Q. \u201creported that if Mr. [A.] obtains care and custody of Alijah, then she would leave Alijah\u201d; and that she \u201cthreatened the Agency ... stating that if the Agency does not intervene with the ongoing domestic violence within the home, then she would drop Alijah off at the Department.\u201d Further, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Ms. Q. reported to the Agency that she felt as though the petition was being prejudice [sic] against her. She stated \u201cMr. [A.] treats me in a demeaning way. He is a master of manipulation.\u201d Ms. [Q.] remains vague in her description of Mr. [A.]\u2019s behavior. She acknowledges that he is a good father and provides for his child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">At the hearing on February 10, 2009, Ms. Q. was represented by the Office of the Public Defender; Mr. A. proceeded without legal counsel. Evidence and proffers were presented to the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Thereafter, the circuit court issued an \u201cAdjudication And Disposition Hearing Order,\u201d dated March 5, 2009. It found that the allegations in the CINA petition, as amended, had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and that Alijah was a CINA. Further, the court ordered that Alijah remain in the custody of Mr. A., under the protective supervision of DSS. However, it also stated that the child could be placed with Ms. Q. in an inpatient substance abuse program, or, if she were not to pursue such a program, then she \u201cshall\u201d be granted \u201cliberal\u201d visitation. In addition, the court ordered DSS to provide referrals for various services,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ordered the parties to enter into a service agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On March 31, 2009, Ms. Q. filed a \u201cMotion for Immediate Hearing on Visitation,\u201d which she amended on April 7, 2009. At an emergency review hearing before the master on April 20, 2009, DSS presented a report discussing visitation. It said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Ms. [Q.] expressed concerns of not being able to see her son on a regular basis. Ms. [Q.] reported that when she visited her son, he began to cry hysterically, bite and scratch himself. She also reported that when she picked him up, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>turned away from her.... Worker offered to pick Alijah up and bring him to the office, as deemed necessary for the well-being of the child. Worker does not have a telephone number or address of Ms. [Q.]; therefore, the arrangement/visitation has been difficult to plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">It has been reported that Ms. [Q.] visits the home of Mr. [A.] to visit her son. The visits do not appear to be conducive to the welfare of the child. During one visit, it was reported that Ms. [Q.] became hostile toward Mr. [A.] in the presence of her son Alijah. Ms. [Q.] reported that she only kicked the door. Worker was on the phone and overheard Ms. [Q.] in the background kicking and screaming. Mr. [A.] acknowledged that he went to his neighbor\u2019s home and later went to sit in his car until Ms. [Q.] calmed down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In an \u201cEmergency Review Hearing Order\u201d dated May 8, 2009, the circuit court ordered liberal, supervised visitation for Ms. Q. In addition, the court again ordered a \u201c[djevelopmental assessment\u201d for Alijah and various services for Ms. Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">At a permanency plan review hearing before the master on May 11, 2009, appellant did not appear. However, her attorney was present. Mr. A. submitted documentation of his completion of a domestic violence intervention program. DSS submitted a report dated April 24, 2009, stating, in part: \u201cIt was agreed that Ms. [Q.] would enter into Crownsville on several occasions. To date, she has refused to enter into treatment.\u201d In addition, the report noted that Ms. Q. had not participated in any of the supervised visits with Alijah scheduled by DSS. Moreover, the Department documented that Alijah was doing well in his father\u2019s care, and recommended that Mr. A. be granted sole custody of Alijah, with liberal and supervised visitation awarded to Ms. Q. Because DSS was of the view that there no longer existed child welfare issues requiring the continued involvement of DSS or the juvenile court, it asked the court to close the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In a \u201cReview Hearing Order\u201d dated May 12, 2009, the master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Respondent ... has remained in the custody of his father, [Mr. A.], during this review period. The Department has retained protective supervision. Alijah continues to receive the appropriate care in his father\u2019s custody. Mr. [A.] provided documentation of completion of the domestic violence classes.... The court noted Ms. [Q.\u2019s] counsel\u2019s comments regarding some of the information in the court report about Ms. [Q.\u2019s] other children not being backed up by any evidence. Ms. [Q.] has not entered into Crownsville as she indicated she would at the emergency hearing ... nor has she entered any treatment program. Ms. [Q.] has not been available for any of the supervised visits at the Department and she did not appear for today\u2019s hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Further, the master recommended that Alijah remain in the custody of Mr. A., with liberal, supervised visitation granted to Ms. Q. The master also recommended rescission of DSS\u2019s protective supervision and termination of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, stating that \u201cthe father is providing the proper care and attention needed to care for the child and that continuing jurisdiction is contrary to the Respondent\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On May 21, 2009, Ms. Q. noted exceptions, complaining that the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations were contrary to the evidence. In particular, Ms. Q. asserted that the \u201cFather is not a fit and proper person to have custody of the minor child\u201d; that \u201cshe is the proper person to have custody of the minor child\u201d; and that \u201csupervised visitation ... is not in the best interests of the child.\u201d She also requested a de novo hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In preparation for the exceptions hearing scheduled for August 21, 2009,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DSS submitted a report to the court filed August 10, 2009.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>On July 31, 2009, Ms. [Q.] visited her son at the Agency as arranged. Ms. [Q.] fed her son his lunch for breakfast instead of giving him the oatmeal that was placed in his bag. Ms. [Q.] brought a new pair of shoes for her son. She fitted the shoes on his feet without taking the stuffing in the toe area out. She also allowed her son to walk outside with one shoe on and the other shoe was off his foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">To date, Ms. [Q.] has yet to enter into an inpatient drug treatment program. She refused to give worker any information pertaining to her treatment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Ms. [Q.] visited the Agency.... Ms. [Q.] verbally reported to the team that it was her goal to get Mr. [A.] locked up. She noted that if he goes to jail then she would be able to obtain care and custody for her son____She noted that she will do whatever it takes to get her son back because she is not going to allow Mr. [A.] to keep Alijah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The exceptions hearing was subsequently postponed until October 23, 2009. About two weeks earlier, on October 9, 2009, Vicki Wolfson, Esquire submitted a line striking her appearance as counsel for appellant and entering the appearance of Susan Gilhooly as counsel for Ms. Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Prior to the hearing, Ms. Gilhooly never filed a motion to withdraw her appearance, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-132. Instead, at the outset of the hearing on October 23, 2009, she orally moved to be discharged, and the court granted that request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">[MS. GILHOOLY]: Good afternoon, Your Honor. Susan [Gilhooly], attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s Office. It was my intention, and I came here prepared to enter my appearance \u2014 just give me a second here \u2014 on behalf of Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>[Q.], mother of the child. However, she\u2019s just most recently asked that I not represent her. Vicki [Wolfson] was the previous attorney, and that will be how the record stands.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">THE COURT: All right. So, you want to be excused, is that the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">[MS. GILHOOLY]: Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">THE COURT: All right. We\u2019ll excuse you, unless somebody objects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The transcript does not reflect any objections.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ms. Gilhooly subsequently advised the court that Ms. Q. was \u201casking for her file,\u201d and that Ms. Gilhooly \u201chanded her ... a copy of the [DSS] report\u201d as well as \u201cthe exception\u201d that was filed on appellant\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">At the hearing that ensued, DSS submitted a report dated October 2, 2009, which recited a litany of allegations that DSS had made in previous reports, as well as Ms. Q.\u2019s refusal to provide DSS with her home address or information regarding her drug treatment. The report also claimed that Ms. Q. had verbally threatened a DSS worker during a supervised visit with Alijah. In addition, counsel for DSS maintained that Alijah was no longer a GINA, and asked the court to adopt the master\u2019s recommendation. DSS\u2019s attorney also recommended that Ms. Q. complete parenting classes and that visitation remain in \u201cthe current configuration,\u201d i.e., supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Counsel for Alijah argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>I believe that Alijah is receiving appropriate care with his father, and I agree with the Department that he is no longer a child in need of assistance. As [counsel for DSS] pointed out, Alijah has been in his father\u2019s custody since February of this year, and I think the Department\u2019s report reflects that there are no concerns concerning the care that Mr. [A.] is providing his son. I am in agreement that the\u2014 with the Department that this case be closed, that the Department\u2019s interests be terminated, and that the order stands as was submitted by the Master, the custody to the father with liberal and supervised visitation to the mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">Ms. Q. stated that she \u201cdisagree[d] with the findings of the Court\u201d and that she wished to \u201cdispute some matters.\u201d Thereafter, Ms. Q. called Madeccia Lovett-Sampson,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the DSS case worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Ms. Q. sought to establish that she had made numerous calls to DSS about Alijah\u2019s care. She also attempted to show that one of the assessments ordered for Alijah had taken a great deal of time to arrange. The following colloquy is relevant:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKp\">[MS. Q]: Do you recall how long you took to have that assessment for Alijah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">THE COURT: Why do you object?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: Not specific. There were several recommendations for various assessments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">[MS. Q.]: Okay. Well, I can move onto another one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Ms. Q. inquired about domestic violence, visitation, and her treatment for substance abuse. The following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">[MS. QJ: ... Do you also recall me calling you numerous times, even to the point of saying that I would bring Alijah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to the agency if you did not intercede in the domestic violence that was going on in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: I asked you to sign a service plan, and I asked you to \u2014 if you and Mr. [A.] were not getting along, for you to leave the house. I put in place an assessment for you to go into drug rehab, which you did go in, you was [sic] discharged out. Then, we also made preparations for you to go into a long-term drug treatment program, and you did not adhere to any of the agency\u2019s recommendations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">[MS. Q.]: Okay. And did that long-term program \u2014 do you recall me calling you from that treatment center saying that it was not an appropriate place for me or Alijah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: The first agency that you attended, which was Second Genesis, from my understanding, you had several loud outbursts and you was [sic] not adhering to their recommendations, nor their program. Therefore, they discharged you. Upon their assessment, it was also indicated that it was not in the best interest of Alijah for him to go to Crownsville with you, and that was the second drug treatment that we requested that you go to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">[MS. QJ: Uh-huh. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: And you indicated that you were not going without your son. And it was in the \u2014 his best interests that he did not attend that program with you, because he had a nurturing environment in which to go to, which was with his father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">[MS. Q.]: Right, and I agree with that. He did have a nurturing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">[MS. Q.]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">THE COURT: It\u2019s okay. Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>[MS. Q.]: Okay. And so, are you also aware of \u2014 that Crownsville was not a facility that was for children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: The treatment was based for you, Ms. [QJ, not for Alijah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Ms. Lovett-Sampson then testified that she had visited Mr. A.\u2019s home and found that Alijah was living in a nurturing environment. Ms. Lovett-Sampson also said that she had supervised visits between Ms. Q. and Alijah. She described one visit that occurred after Ms. Q. had filed her Exceptions, when Ms. Lovett-Sampson observed Ms. Q. shake Alijah so hard that the case worker immediately ended the visit. Ms. Q. challenged the worker\u2019s failure to report Ms. Q. to the police for what Ms. Q. called \u201cabuse\u201d that \u201charm[ed]\u201d her child and placed him in \u201cimpending danger.\u201d The social worker testified that she ended the visit and met with Ms. Q. to sign a safety agreement, rather than call the police or report the abuse to Mr. A., because it was Ms. Lovett-Sampson\u2019s mission as a Family Preservation worker to try to preserve the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In addition, Ms. Q. attempted to show that, while Alijah was in Mr. A.\u2019s care, Alijah missed several medical appointments that Ms. Q. had made for him. Ms. Lovett-Sampson responded that Mr. A. was responsible for scheduling Alijah\u2019s medical appointments, and that Ms. Q. should not have been making them in the first place. Ms. Q. requested the DSS report from the Department\u2019s counsel, but her request was rebuffed by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">Hold on a second. He\u2019s not here to help you. * * * He represents another entity in this case. You had a lawyer that apparently you discharged this afternoon. * * * I appreciate this is difficult for a layperson to walk into a serious courtroom proceeding and have it all work out\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvY\">Ms. Q. also posed questions to Ms. Lovett-Sampson concerning the worker\u2019s duties. Specifically, Ms. Q. took issue with Ms. Lovett-Sampson\u2019s recommendation that Ms. Q. leave the home she shared with Mr. A. and seek inpatient treatment for substance abuse. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>[MS. Q.]: Is that the training that you get from the \u2014 your superiors is to remove one person for domestic count\u2014 violence, to remove one person from the home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">THE COURT: Objection sustained. Next question, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af4\">[MS. Q.]: Ms. [Lovett-Sampson], are you aware that removing one person from the home does not end mental illness or emotional illness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: That is why we recommended that you go into your in-patient [sic] drug treatment program that would adhere to your mental health issues, as well as your drug treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">[MS. Q.]: ... Did you ever advise Mr. [A.] to have any treatment at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: His assessment came back clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">[MS. Q.]: Okay, for domestic violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">[MS. LOVETT-SAMPSON]: He was already within a program. * * * And he completed the program, and I received a certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Further, Ms. Q. attempted to elicit testimony from Ms. Lovett-Sampson on the number of visits the worker had paid to \u201cthe home\u201d and Ms. Q.\u2019s requests that DSS look into Mr. A.\u2019s \u201calcohol problem and ... anger problem.\u201d Ms. Q. drew an objection from counsel for DSS, which the court sustained, when she asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">[D]o you recall how many times in what period of time between the time that I told you that that [sic] you had an assessment \u2014 actually the assessment actually was not \u2014 it was not you that wanted the assessment done. I don\u2019t know how, but do you recall after the numerous times I asked you to look into it until it was finally done?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>[MS. Q.]: I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtT\">THE COURT: I understand that. * * * That\u2019s why I\u2019m sitting up here and you\u2019re standing there, to be honest. * * * And if I go into a great deal of detail for you, then I\u2019m going to be standing next to you being your lawyer and not being the Judge in this case, is the problem. * * * So, telling me you don\u2019t understand why, you ask me to explain it, then \u2014 well, we already had a lawyer for you, you discharged. So, don\u2019t be disappointed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Ms. Q. also pursued the issue of an ex parte protective order that Ms. Lovett-Sampson had advised Mr. A. to file after an incident in which Ms. Q. allegedly went to Mr. A.\u2019s house and kicked his door. She again attempted to show that Ms. Lovett-Sampson had not assisted Ms. Q. with respect to Ms. Q.\u2019s complaints of domestic violence. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">[MS. Q.]: ... [D]id you ever recommend or try to aide [sic] me in my plight of domestic violence in the home? [COUNSEL FOR SOCIAL SERVICES]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">THE COURT: Sustained. Next question. It\u2019s sustained for a number of different reasons, and one of those are it assumes facts not in evidence. Next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">[MS. Q.]: Can you say that one more time \u2014 I didn\u2019t hear you, sir, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">THE COURT: I said it was sustained, because it assumes facts not in evidence in your question. I won\u2019t comment further, because I probably shouldn\u2019t. * * * I just don\u2019t want to sit up here and say objection every time you ask a question \u2014 * * * \u2014 and you think I\u2019m not giving you your day in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Subsequently, Ms. Q. attempted to establish that Ms. Lo-vett-Sampson was biased in favor of Mr. A. Ms. Lovett Sampson asserted that she has \u201centertained [Mr. A.\u2019s] wishes, as well as [Ms. Q.\u2019s] wishes,\u201d and stated that her job was to assess \u201cthe safety of [Alijah] at the time that [she] received the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Thereafter, Ms. Q. sought to call two additional witnesses: her sister and a woman from a foundation that assists victims of domestic violence. At the court\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Q. made a proffer as to their testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She said that both would assist in facilitating visitation between Ms. Q. and Alijah.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The court also allowed Ms. Q. to make a statement. Ms. Q., who was not under oath, told the court that she was \u201caware that [she] cannot take care of [Alijah],\u201d but wanted Mr. A. to undergo \u201cparental counseling\u201d and to take proper care of the child. Ms. Q. also suggested that counsel for Alijah was biased in favor of Mr. A. Further, she said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">My concern is this, is that because Mr. [A.] for whatever reason \u2014 he may have \u2014 he may be angry with me, because I did him wrong, but he\u2019s done the same. And we both need a lot of help, so even though the Court might not indulge me, what the child\u2019s attorney did say, that at least they were going to try to \u2014 she said this, and I have other witnesses of the attorney say that she was going to ask for parental counseling for him. And then, she turned around, and she reneged on it.

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">In addition, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">Respondent Alijah Q. has remained in the custody of his father Antoine A. during the review period. The Department retained protective supervision. The Respondent continues to receive the appropriate care in his father\u2019s custody. During the review period the mother retained supervised visitation with the Respondent. There were some incidents of concern during the mother\u2019s supervised visits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>as detailed in County\u2019s Exhibit One and as testified to by the Department\u2019s worker that lead the Court to conclude that continued supervised visitation is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The court also rescinded the award of protective supervision to DSS, ordered \u201cliberal and supervised\u201d visitation to Ms. Q., \u201cterminated\u201d the \u201cinterest\u201d of DSS and the court, and closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Appellant contends that the court erred in discharging Ms. Q.\u2019s counsel without first obtaining a valid waiver of counsel. Noting that she had a statutory right to counsel, pursuant to Maryland Code (2006 Repl.Vol., 2009 Supp.), \u00a7 3-813(a) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), Ms. Q. argues that the court was required to follow the waiver of counsel procedure delineated in Rule ll-106(b)(l). In her view, that rule applies to juvenile delinquents as well as to the parties in CINA cases. Noting that the court\u2019s Review Hearing Order stated that it had \u201cverified with the mother that she no longer wanted\u201d counsel, Ms. Q. contends that the court\u2019s finding is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">In addition, Ms. Q. insists that she was prejudiced by the lack of counsel. She points to the court\u2019s failure to analyze \u201cwhether there was a likelihood of further abuse or neglect by Ms. Q. if she were granted custody or unsupervised visitation.\u201d In her view, \u201cthe court erred in granting only supervised visitation,\u201d as the \u201cincidents\u201d concerning Ms. Q. \u201cdo not rise to the level at which supervised visitation is necessary.\u201d Further, Ms. Q. complains that the court \u201cerred in failing to order a specific visitation schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">In support of her position, appellant maintains that counsel would have protected her due process rights. She asserts that \u201cthere was no way for the court to assess the credibility or reliability of the evidence,\u201d and suggests that the \u201cassistance of counsel would have been critical in addressing these evidentiary issues.\u201d Further, Ms. Q. contends that her opportunity to present her case was \u201cseverely curtailed.\u201d She cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>her unsuccessful examination of Ms. Lovett-Sampson; the numerous objections that the court sustained; the court\u2019s decision to require her to proffer witness testimony; and its insistence on concluding proceedings by 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Appellees contend that the court did not violate Rule 11-106(b). Alijah recognizes that \u201ca parent in a CINA proceeding is entitled to the assistance of counsel and that this right must be explained pursuant to the waiver procedure of Md. Rule 11-106(b)(l).\u201d But, he contends that \u201cit is not clear that the waiver procedure [in Rule 11-106(b) ] applies in the circumstances' of this case.\u201d Rather, Alijah suggests that a \u201clesser degree of compliance with Md. Rule 11-106(b)\u201d is all that is required in CINA cases. In the Department\u2019s view, however, Rule ll-106(b)(l) does not apply at all to CINA cases. It argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">[T]he language used in Rule ll-106(b) and the pertinent CINA and delinquency statutes compel the conclusion that the waiver provision in 11-106 was intended to apply solely to delinquency and CINS matters. Hence the court did not err in allowing Ms. Q. to represent herself, after she had previously been advised of her right to counsel, because a party in any civil matter is entitled to proceed <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArH\">Both appellees<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> underscore that the primary purpose of CINA proceedings is to protect the child\u2019s best interests; the proceedings are civil in nature; the dispositions available in a CINA case \u201cinvolve child custody, and do not involve any form of commitment for parents\u201d; and CINA matters do not subject parents to criminal penalties. To that end, they observe that \u201cthe State must meet the heightened beyond a reasonable doubt standard in a delinquency case,\u201d because a liberty interest is implicated, whereas \u201cthe less stringent preponderance of the evidence standard applies in CINA adjudications,\u201d because no liberty interest is implicated. Given these key differences, argue appellees, \u201cMaryland courts have consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tently refused to apply the same procedural protections available in delinquency proceedings, to parents involved in CINA proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In addition, DSS argues that the \u201ccommonsense interpretation of Md. Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) is that it applies [only] to juvenile petitions filed <em>against </em>children, rather than CINA petitions, which are filed for the protection of children.\u201d According to DSS, the separate sections of Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) signify a \u201clegislative intent to handle CINA cases and delinquency cases differently.\u201d The Department explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">Rule ll-106(b) is divided into four distinct and separately numbered sections. The first section describes a waiver procedure to be used if \u201ca respondent or his parent indicates a desire or inclination to waive representation for himself.\u201d Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1). Section two states that indigents in <em>delinquency, child in need of supervision, and contributing cases </em>are entitled to legal representation at no cost unless that right is \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived.\u201d Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(2). Section three states that CJP \u00a7 3-821 governs the right to counsel in a CINA case.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(3). Section four addresses the appointment of an attorney to represent a child who is not indigent. Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) (4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Moreover, DSS contends that the \u201cparty\u201d referred to in Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) is a \u201crespondent or his parent,\u201d which \u201cindicate[s] that the waiver procedure is intended to apply only in the context of delinquency and CINS cases.\u201d It posits: \u201cThe absence of additional language in Rule 11-106(b)(3) or in the Courts Article requiring that a party in a CINA case knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel indicates that the waiver procedure does not apply to CINA matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">DSS contends that appellant had \u201cample opportunity to ask [Ms. Gilhooly] to continue with the representation or to inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the court that she did not wish to dismiss her lawyer.\u201d It also argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">The applicable statute pertaining to a parent\u2019s right to counsel in a CINA case, CJP \u00a7 3-813, mandates the right to counsel at every stage of the proceedings, but does not require that a parent be continuously re-apprised of the right to counsel at every subsequent hearing. CJP \u00a7 3-813. Had the legislature intended that parents have such a right to advisement in CINA cases, it could have enacted a statute similar in form to CJP \u00a7 3-8A-20, which specifically applies to juvenile causes <em>other than </em>CINA cases.\" <em>See </em>Subtitle 8A of CJP. CJP \u00a7 3-8A-20 sets forth a waiver procedure that applies when a <em>child </em>in a delinquency case or child in need of supervision (CINS) case chooses to waive the right to counsel.\" CJP \u00a7 3-8A-20(b). The legislature has not enacted any analogous provision to CJP \u00a7 3-8A-20 in the CINA statute. <em>See </em>Subtitle 8 of CJP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In sum, because Ms. Q.\u2019s \u201cpersonal liberty interests\u201d were not at stake, appellees contend that \u201cthe necessity of a personal waiver of the right to counsel\u201d was neither triggered nor required.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We begin with a review of the relevant portion of C.J. \u00a7 3-813:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\u00a7 3-813.

We focus here only on the waiver of her entitlement to counsel. Maryland Rule 11-106, in the \u201cJuvenile Causes\u201d Title, is pertinent to the issue of waiver.

Similarly, in our interpretation of Rule 11-106, \u201cwe must apply the same standards of construction that apply to the interpretation of a statute.\u201d <em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 592, 714 A.2d 841 (1998). <em>See also Johnson v.

Therefore, we turn to review these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274, 987 A.2d 18 (2010). Our analysis is guided by the plain language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSimilarly, with respect to the Maryland Rules, we seek to ascertain the Court of Appeals\u2019s intent in promulgating the rule,\u201d <em>In re Charles K., </em>135 Md.App. 84, 97, 761 A.2d 978 (2000), giving the words their ordinary meaning. <em>Zetty v.

In addition, \u201cwe construe the words in the text of a rule\u201d so as to give \u201ceffect to the rule as a whole.\u201d <em>In re Charles K., </em>135 Md.App. at 97, 761 A.2d 978. As with statutes, when we construe a rule, \u201cwe must give effect to the entire rule, \u2018neither adding, nor deleting, words in order to give it a meaning not otherwise evident by the words actually used.\u2019 Our mission is to give the rule a reasonable interpretation in tune with logic and common sense.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 94, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994) (citation omitted); <em>see Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v.

If a statute is ambiguous, however, we look to the \u201clegislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 987 A.2d 18. Similarly, if a rule is unambiguous, our analysis usually terminates. <em>Hoang v. Hewitt Ave. </em>Assocs., 177 Md.App. 562, 588, 936 A.2d 915 (2007). But, when the rule is ambiguous, \u201cwe may look to other sources in order to determine the Court of Appeals\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. at 592, 714 A.2d 841.

We have often noted that looking to relevant case law and appropriate secondary authority enables us to place the rule in question in the proper context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">As we have seen, Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) is captioned, in part, \u2018Waiver of representation,\u201d and Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) sets forth the \u2018Waiver procedure.\u201d In our view, Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) distinguishes CINA cases and delinquency cases with respect to waiver of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) refers to the \u201cfiling of a juvenile petition.\u201d In addition, the \u201cparty\u201d referred to in Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) is a \u201crespondent or his parent.\u201d As DSS suggests, the commonsense interpretation of Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) is that it applies to petitions filed <em>against </em>children, not petitions filed <em>for </em>their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>protection, such as a CINA petition. Moreover, Rule 11-106(b)(2) specifically refers to the knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel, but only as to \u201cdelinquency, child in need of supervision, and contributing cases.\u201d Notably, that subpart omits any reference to CINA cases. It is only in Rule 11-106(b)(3) that we see an explicit reference to CINA cases within the province of C.J. \u00a7 3-813. Yet, no other category of cases is mentioned in that subpart, nor is there any reference to the waiver of counsel. Thus, construing Rule 11-106 as a whole, and looking at its plain text, the rule does not establish the requirement of a voluntary and knowing waiver of counsel in CINA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (the \u201cRules Committee\u201d) assists the Court of Appeals in developing the rules. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-801. As we have seen, we may look to other sources to confirm or aid in our interpretation. The discussion of the Rules Committee as to the matter of the waiver of counsel in delinquency cases is consistent with our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The waiver of counsel provisions in Rule ll-106(b)(l) derive from Rule 906, adopted in 1976. The minutes of the November 1975 meeting of the Chapter 900 (Juvenile Causes) Rules Subcommittee of the Rules Committee contain the following pertinent remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">Judge Karwacki stated that in this, and other, rules such as Rule 906 (Right to Counsel) <em>delinquency cases ought to be treated differently than non-delinquency cases, </em>and that all such rules should be split into two sections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>Rule 906 b 1 presumably applies only to delinquency cases.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Minutes from the Chapter 900 (Juvenile Causes) Rules Sub-comm. 3, 5 (Nov. 19, 1975) (emphasis added). From these minutes, it would indeed appear that the waiver provision of Rule ll-106(b)(l) was intended to apply only to juvenile delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The case of <em>In re Christopher T., </em>129 Md.App. 28, 740 A.2d 69 (1999), a delinquency case, is noteworthy. There, a juvenile appeared without an attorney for an adjudicatory hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 740 A.2d 69. Based on the court\u2019s belief that it had previously advised the juvenile of his right to a lawyer, and that his mother \u201clacked \u2018any good reason\u2019\u201d for failing to obtain counsel, the trial court found a waiver of counsel by inaction, proceeded with the hearing, and determined that the juvenile was a delinquent. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we concluded that \u201cstrict compliance with Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) is essential to uphold a waiver of counsel in a <em>delinquency </em>proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 740 A.2d 69 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In its decision to vacate and remand, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 40, 740 A.2d 69:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">[E]ven if a waiver could be based on a finding that Ms. T. was dilatory, Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) does not specifically provide for waiver by inaction____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">Even if appellant had expressly waived his right to counsel, or did so by inaction, such a waiver would have been ineffective, because the record plainly demonstrates that the court failed to provide the information mandated by Md. Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v). Specifically, the record is devoid of any indication that appellant was advised of the following ... [information detailed in Md. Rule 11-106(b)(l)(i)-(v).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In <em>In re Shawn P., </em>172 Md.App. 569, 916 A.2d 399 (2007), also a juvenile delinquency case, we again examined a juvenile\u2019s alleged waiver of the right to counsel by inaction. The Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 583, 916 A.2d 399:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">The statute provides that there be appropriate questioning in open court, on the record. That questioning must elicit that the child fully comprehends [the information detailed in Md. Rule ll-106(b)(l)(i)-(v) ]____ [T]he record clearly reflects that no conference took place where any of the above matters could have been discussed, nor were they explained on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>To be sure, in the two cases discussed above, the Court only considered the waiver issue in the delinquency context, and not in regard to CINA proceedings. Here, the issue concerns the procedure, if any, attendant to the waiver of counsel in a CINA case. Therefore, the cases above are not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>In re Blessen, </em>392 Md. 684, 898 A.2d 980 (2006) <em>(\u201cBlessen </em>\u201d), is also illuminating, although it concerned the waiver of the right to a contested adjudicatory hearing in a CINA case, rather than the waiver of the right to counsel. In that case, the trial court did not hold a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing because counsel for the mother, Ms. H., represented that the mother wanted to mediate the dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 898 A.2d 980. After mediation, the parties agreed to an amended petition, the facts of which formed the basis for a finding of CINA. <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 898 A.2d 980. At the conclusion of the proceedings, however, Ms. H. protested that the court had never inquired as to her character or her \u201csituation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 898 A.2d 980. The court indicated that it had relied on her attorney as to the stipulation of facts contained in the amended CINA petition. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 898 A.2d 980. The court placed the child in foster care. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 898 A.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">On appeal, the mother contended that the stipulation of counsel was not sufficient to waive her right to a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 708, 898 A.2d 980. Rather, she argued that \u201cdue process require[d] application of the more stringent standard of waiver in CINA adjudicatory proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 898 A.2d 980. Ms. H. asserted, <em>id. </em>at 692, 898 A.2d 980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">[T]he right to a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing only can be waived where the record affirmatively discloses a personal, voluntary, knowing and intelligent relinquishment of the right by the parent herself, which requires a colloquy on the record in which the court would advise the parent of the right to have a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing, of the right to compel and present witnesses and to present evidence during the proceedings, that waiver of the hearing could lead to limitation of the parental rights, of the risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>maMng incriminating statements during the proceedings, and of the burden of proof assigned to the State, as well as would inquire into whether the parent is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, understands the English language, and is waiving the proceedings voluntarily, absent any duress or coercion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">The Court disagreed, stating, <em>id. </em>at 708, 898 A.2d 980: Certainly if the due process rights of parents are not violated by the failure to file a timely notice of objection in termination of parental rights proceedings, their due process rights are not violated when they do not personally waive less intrusive CINA adjudicatory proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">Contrary, then, to the arguments raised by Ms. H., the stricter standard of waiver requiring the court to conduct a personal colloquy with a parent to establish her or his voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver ordinarily only has been applied where the rights to be waived have been deemed to be \u201cfundamental,\u201d and the proceedings have been those that could result in confinement. In the present case, Ms. H.\u2019s waiver of a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing was sufficient when her attorney concurred with the stipulated facts.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Based on all of the foregoing, we are satisfied that the strict waiver of counsel requirements embodied in Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) do not apply to a parent\u2019s waiver of his or her statutory right to counsel in a CINA case. However, this conclusion does not fully dispose of appellant\u2019s claim of error. We elaborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981), the Supreme Court left to the trial court \u2014 subject to appellate review \u2014 the decision of whether due process requires the appointment of counsel in a termination of parental rights proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 101 S.Ct. 2153. But, the Court characterized as \u201cenlight<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ened and wise\u201d those state practices providing for appointment of counsel in both neglect and termination cases, stating, <em>id. </em>at 33-34,101 S.Ct. 2153:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">A wise public policy, however, may require that higher standards be adopted than those minimally tolerable under the Constitution. Informed opinion has clearly come to hold that an indigent parent is entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel not only in parental termination proceedings, but in dependency and neglect proceedings as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In Maryland, the Legislature enacted C.J. \u00a7 3-813, which provides for the right to counsel in CINA proceedings. The General Assembly has underscored its view of the importance of the right to counsel in such cases by making clear that the right is available to indigent persons through the Office of the Public Defender. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-204(b)(1)(v) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d) (stating that the Office of the Public Defender shall provide representation for \u201ca proceeding involving children in need of assistance under \u00a7 3-813 of the Courts Article\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We are mindful that a statutory right, such as the one created by C.J. \u00a7 3-813 and C.P. \u00a7 16-204,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cwhile deserving of protection, is not necessarily the equivalent of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>In the Matter of the Welfare of: G.L.H., </em>614 N.W.2d 718, 722 (Minn.), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Jackson v. Ramsey County, </em>531 U.S. 967, 121 S.Ct. 403, 148 L.Ed.2d 311 (2000). Nevertheless, in order to effectuate and safeguard the statutory right to counsel in CINA cases, certain minimal protections must govern the waiver of counsel, even if the waiver need not satisfy Rule 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) or constitutional standards of a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver. <em>See Beanrden v. Ark. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>344 Ark. 317, 42 S.W.3d 397, 402 (2001) (noting the distinction between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>statutory right and a due process right to counsel, the latter of which requires a \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>cf. In re Adoption/Guardianship of Chaden M</em>., 189 Md.App. 411, 417, 984 A.2d 420 (2009) (holding that the statutory right to assistance of counsel in a termination of parental rights case includes the right to effective assistance of counsel), <em>cert, granted, </em>415 Md. 40, 997 A.2d 791 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">To be sure, <em>Blessen, supra, </em>392 Md. 684, 898 A.2d 980, made clear that a full blown waiver of counsel colloquy is not required with respect to a contested CINA adjudicatory <em>hearing. Id. </em>at 708, 898 A.2d 980. But, the case did not concern a waiver of the statutory right to counsel. Moreover, the Court certainly suggested that at least some waiver of the right to a contested CINA hearing was appropriate, even if it did not have to satisfy the strict \u201cvoluntary, knowing, intelligent\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>Under the facts of that case, the Court indicated that it was sufficient that such a waiver could be made by counsel for the party. <em>Id. </em>Under the facts of this case, however, Ms. Gilhooly could not waive Ms. Q.\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The relationship of lawyer to client is generally one of agency. <em>See Salisbury Beauty Sch. v. State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 45, 300 A.2d 367 (1973). Ordinarily, \u201c[t]he actions of an attorney within the scope of his employment are binding upon his client under the ordinary principles of agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 300 A.2d 367; <em>see </em>Rule 1-332 (recognizing that an attorney may act for a client). In <em>Blessen, </em>it was reasonable for the trial court to rely on the waiver representations made by Ms. H.\u2019s lawyer, who unequivocally served as the agent for Ms. H.\u2019s interests throughout the proceedings. <em>See Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 374-75, 765 A.2d 587 (2001) (\u201c[T]here is a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that an attorney has authority to bind his client by his actions relating to the conduct of litigation.\u201d (alteration in original) (citation omitted)); <em>see also </em>7 Am.Jur.2d <em>Attorneys at Law </em>\u00a7 157 (2007) (\u201cThe entry of appearance by an attorney is itself presumptive evidence of his or her authority to represent the person for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>whom he or she appears.... In a civil proceeding, a client is bound by statements of his or her attorney made in open court when the statements are made in the client\u2019s presence and are not denied by the client.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The general agency principle is not without exception, however. For example, in the context of settlement agreements, we have declined to apply the presumption that counsel\u2019s acts are imputed to the client. We said in <em>Kinkaid v. Cessna, </em>49 Md.App. 18, 22, 430 A.2d 88 (1981), that \u201can attorney has no implied authority to compromise his client\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See also King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 108, 492 A.2d 608 (1985) (\u201c \u2018Even if a general discretion is vested in the agent, it is not deemed to be unlimited. But it must be exercised in a reasonable manner, and cannot be resorted to in order to justify acts, which the principal could not be presumed to intend, or which would defeat, and not promote, the apparent end or purpose, for which the power was given.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Mitchell Properties, Inc. v. Real Estate Title Co., </em>62 Md.App. 473, 483, 490 A.2d 271 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">At the hearing on October 23, 2009, Ms. Gilhooly informed the court that she came prepared to enter her appearance, but that Ms. Q. did not want her services. In fact, as of October 9, 2009, Ms. Gilhooly was already the attorney of record. In any event, when Ms. Gilhooly sought to withdraw, the court immediately acquiesced. It said: \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll excuse you, unless somebody objects.\u201d At the time, Ms. Gilhooly was not necessarily acting as her client\u2019s agent or in her client\u2019s interest; in the context of an eleventh hour request by an attorney to withdraw from a case, the attorney\u2019s interest may be at odds with that of the client. Under such circumstances, Ms. Gilhooly\u2019s representation to the court should not have bound Ms. Q. to a waiver. <em>See Colonial Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Boden, </em>169 Md. 493, 498, 182 A. 665 (1936) (\u201c[T]he act of the agent will not bind the principal if the interests of the former in a given transaction are hostile to those of the latter.\u201d). Instead, the court should have inquired of Ms. Q. to verify whether she wanted Ms. Gilhooly\u2019s legal services, to confirm that she was electing self-representation over professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>representation at an evidentiary hearing that was about to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">We recognize that Ms. Q. did not object when the court said, \u201cunless somebody objects.\u201d But, neither did she expressly consent. Indeed, Ms. Q. never uttered a single word, nor does the record reflect so much as a nod by her in agreement with Ms. Gilhooly. As to Ms. Q.\u2019s failure to object, it is for this very reason that litigants are guided and assisted by counsel. Because the court\u2019s inquiry was not specifically directed to Ms. Q., she could have thought that the court\u2019s comment was directed to counsel for DSS and Alijah. Alternatively, Ms. Q. may have been too intimidated to speak up. That we are left to speculate about Ms. Q.\u2019s silence underscores the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">As we see it, in the absence of any affirmative indication by Ms. Q. that she assented to the discharge of her counsel, it was incumbent on the judge to make some attempt to verify that, moments before the hearing was to begin, Ms. Q. wanted to discharge her lawyer. <em>Cf. Dillard v. State, </em>415 Md. 445, 453, 457-58, 464-66, 3 A.3d 403 (2010) (finding that the trial court had abused its discretion in not \u201cfully inquiring] about ... the extent of the prejudice to the defendant,\u201d even though the defendant had not asked for a voir dire of the jurors involved in potential misconduct, and stating that \u201cthe court has a duty to fully investigate allegations of juror misconduct before ruling on a motion for a mistrial, and that failure to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors before resolving the issue of prejudice is an abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion\u201d); <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 429-30, 676 A.2d 513 (1996) (where defendant\u2019s counsel and defendant\u2019s father addressed the trial court as to the defendant\u2019s request for discharge of counsel, the Court said: \u201cIt is <em>Respondent\u2019s </em>reply, not that of his father [or his counsel], that ordinarily would be relevant to determine whether or not the discharge [of counsel] should be permitted, because the [Sixth Amendment] right to counsel and the right to self-representation are personal rights,\u201d and \u201cthe responsibility is on the trial judge to ensure that the reason for requesting dismissal of counsel is explained\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>We are mindful of <em>Bles sen\u2019s </em>admonition that a personal, voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver colloquy is ordinarily required only in proceedings that involve fundamental rights or could result in confinement. Although the Sixth Amendment does not apply here, <em>Chaden M., </em>189 Md.App. at 425, 984 A.2d 420, a CINA proceeding implicates a \u201cfundamental\u201d right; a CINA case may alter the parent-child relationship and it may lead to the termination of parental rights. In <em>In re Maria P., </em>393 Md. 661, 904 A.2d 432 (2006), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">It is well-established that a parent\u2019s interest in raising a child is a fundamental right. Equally understood is the principle that a parent\u2019s fundamental right is not absolute, and is subject to the best interests of the child standard. [A parent] ... clearly has a liberty interest in the care and custody of her child, and <em>when, </em>as <em>in a CINA proceeding, a state seeks to change the parent-child relationship, \u201cthe due process clause is implicated.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 904 A.2d 432 (2006) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\"><em>In re Maria P. </em>supports our view that the court should have attempted to verify with Ms. Q. that she wanted to discharge her lawyer. In that case, the mother was excluded from the courtroom during her child\u2019s testimony at a CINA hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 676, 904 A.2d 432. In finding that the trial court abused its discretion, the Court stated: \u201cThere is <em>no indication on the record </em>that the hearing judge considered Petitioner\u2019s due process rights. <em>No testimony was placed </em>on the record, and <em>no inquiries were made </em>of the Department as to the specific reasons for Petitioner\u2019s exclusion during [her child\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Maryland Rule 2-132(b) is also relevant. It provides that a court may deny a motion to strike an attorney\u2019s appearance if it finds that \u201cwithdrawal of the appearance would cause undue delay, prejudice, or injustice.\u201d To be sure, there is no script to which a trial court must adhere in connection with a waiver of counsel in a CINA case. But, we cannot determine from the record whether the court considered the issue of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In addition, as we have noted, the court\u2019s Order said: \u201cThe Court verified with the mother that she no longer wanted the services of the Office of the Public Defender, and that she wanted to proceed without the assistance of counsel.\u201d Even if the court is not required to verify the CINA parent\u2019s desire to discharge counsel, the court\u2019s finding is not supported by the record. This suggests that the court may have discharged counsel in the mistaken belief that it had verified Ms. Q.\u2019s desire to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by the argument that Ms. Q. was not prejudiced by what occurred. In <em>In re Maria P., </em>the Court found that the court\u2019s error was not harmless, noting that the appellant in that case was unable to confer with her attorney as a result. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 904 A.2d 432. Ms. Q.\u2019s unskillful cross-examination was plainly evident. To find harmless error would undermine the statutory entitlement to counsel set forth in C.J. \u00a7 3-813.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
