Keys, Jr., appellant, pled guilty to seven counts of theft and identity fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On counts 1, 2, 19 and 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the court imposed concurrent sentences of 15 years, all but ten suspended, to be followed by five years on probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court ordered that restitution be paid in an \u201camount to be determined within 60 days either by agreement or if not agreed to, then either party can request a restitution hearing before the Court.\u201d When the parties were unable to agree on restitution, the court held a restitution hearing and ordered appellant to pay restitution to multiple victims in the amount of $101,993.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">On appeal, appellant presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Did the circuit court err in ordering appellant to pay $6,565.50 in restitution to Next Day Blinds and $38,123.16 in restitution to Williams-Sonoma?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall dismiss the appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">On September 15, 2008, appellant was facing 121 counts of identity theft, credit card fraud, and other theft related offenses involving many different victims. Appellant entered into a plea agreement, which provided that, in exchange for appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to seven counts, the court would \u201center a sentence of a maximum time served of 10 years with whatever suspended period of time [the judge] considers appropriate as well as any applicable probation and or restitution.\u201d As indicated, the amount of restitution was \u201cto be determined within 60 days,\u201d either by agreement, or, if no agreement could be reached, then after a restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The State presented a statement of facts \u201cto corroborate the plea.\u201d The facts presented indicated that, between November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>2005 and February 2007, appellant engaged in a felony theft scheme, receiving goods with a value over $500 by \u201cmeans of stolen and misrepresented credit cards\u201d issued to numerous individuals. Appellant stole the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Swarovski Crystal, GPS units, kitchen and housewares merchandise, gift cards, jewelry, purses, shoes, clothing, blinds, air line flights and other miscellaneous items from William Sonoma, J. Crew, J. Jill, Brooks Brothers, Bass Pro Shops, Territory Head, Isabella Bird Company, Next Day Blinds, Ware Jewelers, Lowe\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Zabos, Marshall Fields and other various merchants and or corresponding credit card company having a value of over $500 or greater in violation of [Md.Code (2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-104 of the Criminal Law Article].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The statement of facts described appellant\u2019s actions as \u201can account take over scheme,\u201d explaining that, \u201c[i]n all of their cases, the victim\u2019s credit cards themselves were still in the victim\u2019s possession but their credit card numbers were used by some person unknown to them,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll the merchandise ordered with the compromised credit card numbers were delivered to drop off points through Baltimore City Maryland.\u201d The investigation revealed that many of the victims had a common charge of $39 from a Baltimore City heating and air conditioning business called Cold Spring Company, Inc. Authorities eventually traced to appellant\u2019s wife a phone number that was used to obtain phone approval of credit card transactions, using Cold Spring Company\u2019s merchant ID number.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">On March 7, 2007, police executed a search and seizure warrant for appellant and Ms. Keys\u2019 residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The search revealed numerous items that \u201cwere linked back to purchases made using stolen credit card numbers of Carroll County victims,\u201d \u201cpaperwork and computers linked to credit card thefts,\u201d in addition to \u201cdozens of credit card numbers and owners\u2019 information.\u201d After contacting the victims, authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ties found that approximately 99% of the victims had used their credit cards at a Great Clips Hair Salon in Westminster, Maryland. This led the police to believe that an employee at that salon \u201cwas stealing the identity of the credit card customers and relaying that information to\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The statement of facts indicated that Special Agent Low-man, a United States Secret Service Special Agent, conducted a forensic analysis of appellant\u2019s computer, and he determined that appellant used the computer for numerous fraudulent purchases. In particular, \u201cCharles and Ericka Keys had used stolen credit card numbers to purchase items over the phone and via the internet totaling well in excess of $100,000. They also possessed dozens of personal \u2014 victim\u2019s personal identifying information which had not been used to purchase the items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">After determining that the State\u2019s facts corroborated appellant\u2019s guilty plea, the court found appellant guilty on all seven counts. The State nol prossed the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The court then inquired regarding the status of restitution. The State indicated that it needed more time to get exact figures from the retail victims. The court responded that it would \u201cprovide that [appellant] pay restitution in an amount to be determined,\u201d and that it would give the parties 60 days to agree to an amount. If an agreement could not be reached within 60 days, either party could \u201crequest a restitution hearing at which a restitution figure will be determined.\u201d The court then imposed the sentence of incarceration, to be followed by five years on probation, subject to the condition that appellant pay restitution in an amount \u201cto be determined\u201d within 60 days.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court stated that the restitution would be determined \u201ceither by agreement or if not agreed to, then either party can request a hearing before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>On December 5, 2008, the State filed a Request for Restitution Hearing, stating that the parties were unable to reach an agreement. On June 15, 2009, the court held a hearing. The State advised the court that the parties agreed on \u201cthe total amounts for each of these companies that were compromised as a result of the theft scheme,\u201d but there was disagreement regarding \u201ccredit for the merchandise that was recovered and also the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">David Siuta, the regional loss prevention manager with Williams-Sonoma, testified regarding Williams-Sonoma\u2019s loss. He accompanied authorities to appellant\u2019s residence during the execution of the search warrant to identify stolen merchandise belonging to Williams-Sonoma. Mr. Siuta found numerous Williams-Sonoma items that were connected to the stolen credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Mr. Siuta took these items to a Williams-Sonoma retail store to determine if the items were in resale condition, or if they were appropriate for donation to charity or trash. He explained that an item would be unsellable if it was used, which was the case with most of the items recovered from appellant\u2019s residence. The State introduced into evidence a list prepared by the store manager, indicating which items were to be disposed of or donated, and which items were \u201cin sellable condition.\u201d The items that were able to be resold by Williams-Sonoma had a retail value of $908.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The total loss to Williams-Sonoma was $39,032.11. Williams-Sonoma sought restitution in the amount of $38,123.61, which reflected the difference between the total loss to the company and the $908.95 in merchandise that the company determined could be resold.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Jeffrey Schuster, a Detective with the Criminal Investigations Bureau of the Westminster Police Department, participated in the search of appellant\u2019s residence. He recovered custom-made blinds from Next Day Blinds, which were obtained through fraudulent transactions. Some of the blinds were hanging in the residence and some were still sealed. Detective Schuster notified Next Day Blinds, but the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>did not want the blinds. It released the blinds to the Westminster Police Department and sought restitution in the amount of $6,562.50. Detective Schuster testified that the items that were being held by the State Police, the State\u2019s Attorney, or by the Westminster Police would be resold, if possible. Any profits from these sales would apply as a credit to the restitution amounts ordered. The detective did not know how the blinds were going to be utilized by the police department, but he stated: <em>\u201cIf </em>they can be sold, they will be sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">After Detective Schuster\u2019s testimony, the State and appellant\u2019s counsel stipulated that appellant was incarcerated and had no current source of income. The court then recessed and permitted appellant\u2019s counsel to submit further argument in writing, ordering the State to respond to that argument within 15 days of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On June 30, 2009, appellant filed a Memorandum in Response to State\u2019s Request for Restitution. In addition to arguing that the court should not issue a judgment of restitution because he did not have the ability to pay, appellant contended that, pursuant to Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 7-104(g)(l)(ii) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), he had the option to restore the stolen property to the owner or pay for the property. He argued that \u201cpayment of value of the property is inappropriate where the property has been restored to the owner,\u201d and therefore, it was inappropriate for Williams-Sonoma to seek payment of the value of the items that were recovered. Similarly, with respect to Next Day Blinds, appellant suggested that the company\u2019s release of the property to the Westminster Police Department constituted a recovery of the items by Next Day Blinds, with a subsequent donation to the police, and therefore, he could not be required to pay for its value. He argued that he should not be required to pay the value of the blinds without an order that the blinds be returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">On July 7, 2009, the State filed a memorandum in response. Initially, the State refuted appellant\u2019s contention that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>not have the ability to pay the restitution amount. The State also asserted that appellant\u2019s interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 7-104(g)(l)(ii) was \u201cnot in conjunction with the restitution statute ... and is in disregard [of] the legislative history behind the restitution and theft statutes.\u201d The State argued that appellant did not meet his burden in challenging the restitution requested by Williams-Sonoma or Next Day Blinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On July 17, 2009, the circuit court ordered appellant to pay restitution, as a condition of his probation and as a term of his sentence, to multiple victims. Specifically, the court ordered appellant to pay $6,565.50 to Next Day Blinds and $38,123.16 to Williams-Sonoma. This order was entered on July 20, 2009, and on July 24, 2009, the court recorded civil judgments in these amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On August 24, 2009, appellant filed a \u201cNotice of Appeal and Alternatively, Application for Leave to Appeal,\u201d challenging the order of restitution. On May 27, 2010, we issued an order granting appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and transferring this case to the direct appeal docket.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe circuit court erred in ordering [him] to pay restitution to Williams Sonoma, Inc. and to Next Day Blinds where the property had been restored to the owner.\u201d He argues that, pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 7 \u2014 104(g)(1)(H), \u201cthe court could not order restitution for the items of property that have been restored to the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The State contends that appellant\u2019s \u201cexpress agreement to pay restitution as determined by the circuit court as part of the binding plea agreement waives his appellate challenge to the restitution order.\u201d It further argues that the restitution awards were appropriate, supported by competent evidence, and fair, asserting that the \u201cproperty had little to no value to Williams Sonoma and Next Day Blinds.\u201d The State rejects appellant\u2019s argument \u201cthat the hearing judge\u2019s order, requiring him to pay restitution, was barred under \u00a7 7-104(g) because the stolen goods had been returned to Williams Sonoma and offered to Next Day Blinds,\u201d stating that the general restitution statute, Md.Code (2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a711-603(a)(1) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), \u201cmakes clear that the General Assembly intended that courts would order restitution even after stolen goods were returned to their owner.\u201d It argues that the purpose of the restitution statute would not be satisfied if stolen goods merely were returned to a retailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">As a preliminary matter, we must address whether the appeal was timely filed. The Maryland Rules provide that both a notice of appeal and an application for leave to appeal \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Md. Rule 8-202(a) (notice of appeal); Md. Rule 8-204(b)(2)(A) (application for leave to appeal). With respect to a notice of appeal, the requirement that it \u201cbe filed within thirty days of a final judgment is jurisdictional; if the requirement is not met, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>305 Md. 407, 413, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986). When an application for leave to appeal is granted, and it is determined that the application was not filed timely, this same principle applies, and the appeal must be dismissed. <em>See Michael v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 735, 738, 584 A.2d 1317 (1991) (\u201cthe rationale for requiring strict adherence to the time requirements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>case of appeals of right is no less persuasive where application for leave to appeal is sought\u201d). <em>See also </em>Rule l-204(a) (the \u201ccourt may not shorten or extend the time for filing ... a notice of appeal [or] an application for leave to appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Here, the court\u2019s order of restitution was issued on July 17, 2009. A stamp on the order indicates that it was filed on July 20, 2009, and the docket entries reflect that the order was entered on July 20, 2009. Appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal was not filed, however, until August 24, 2009, which was more than 30 days after entry of the order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The record contains other documents, however, which are titled \u201cNOTICE OF RECORDED JUDGMENT.\u201d These documents indicate that judgment was recorded in favor of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. and Next Day Blinds, and that the judgment entry date was July 24, 2009. If July 24, 2009, is the relevant date for purposes of appeal, the appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, filed on August 24, 2009, was timely.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">After the question of the timeliness of the appeal was raised at oral argument, counsel for both parties submitted supplemental memoranda addressing the issue. Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">[T]he record in this case indicates in one place an entry of judgment of restitution on July 24, 2009 and in another place an entry of restitution on July 20, 2009. In making a final determination of this conflict the court should accept the July 24, 2009 judgment entry date as specified on the Notice of Recorded Judgment since Judge Hughes\u2019 July 17, 2009 Order was mailed out at the same time and in the same envelope as the Notices of Recorded Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Appellant further recounts a conversation with a clerk, who, although having no personal knowledge of this case, surmised as to the events that occurred and suggested that the July 20, 2009, entry date on the docket entries should have been changed to July 24, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The State contends that the \u201centry of the judgment or order from which the appeal was sought\u201d occurred on July 20, 2009, when the order of restitution in the criminal case was entered. Because the application for leave to appeal was filed more than 30 days after that date, the State argues that the appeal should be dismissed. With respect to the reference to entry of judgment on July 24, 2009, the State asserts that this was when a civil judgment was indexed and recorded. It argues that this was \u201cunrelated to the final judgment of the trial court in the underlying criminal sentence that is the subject of [the] application for leave to appeal challenging the restitution in a criminal case.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Maryland Code (2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.P.\u201d), authorizes a party to appeal from \u201c \u2018a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u2019\u201d <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Servs., LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 565, 989 A.2d 210 (2010) (quoting <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 261, 983 A.2d 138 (2009)). C.J.P. \u00a7 12-101(f) defines \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court, including an orphans\u2019 court, from which an appeal, application for leave to appeal, or petition for certiorari may be taken.\u201d In a criminal case, a final judgment is rendered when \u201c \u2018the court has entered a verdict and a sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 172, 201, 788 A.2d 678 (quoting <em>Christian v. State, </em>309 Md. 114, 119, 522 A.2d 945 (1987)), <em>cert, denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002). <em>Accord State v. Lee, </em>178 Md.App. 478, 484, 943 A.2d 14 (2008) (final judgment occurred when the trial court sentenced appellee for his convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Here, the final judgment that is the subject of appeal is the court\u2019s order of restitution in the criminal case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That order was issued on July 17, 2009. As indicated, however, the relevant date in determining the timeliness of appeal is not the date the order was issued. Rather, pursuant to Md. Rule 8-204(b)(2)(A), an application for leave to appeal \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is sought.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Accord Sapero &amp; Sapero v. Bel Air Plumbing, </em>41 Md.App. 251, 258, 396 A.2d 317 (1979) (right to appeal from \u201ca \u2018final judgment entered,\u2019 not a final judgment rendered.\u201d). <em>See also Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 302, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981) (in appeal challenging validity of probation condition, the Court noted that appeal must be taken within 30 days following <em>entry </em>of final judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In determining when \u201centry\u201d of the judgment occurs, Rule 8 \u2014 202(f) explains that it \u201coccurs on the day when the clerk of the lower court first makes a record in writing of the judgment, notice, or order on the file jacket, on a docket within the file, or in a docket book, according to the practice of that court, and records the actual date of the entry.\u201d As the State notes, the docket entries show that the \u201cOrder of Court Granting Restitution as outlined in State\u2019s Petition both as a condition of probation and a term of his sentence,\u201d was entered on July 20, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Appellant acknowledges this docket entry, but he contends that there is a \u201cdirect conflict\u201d in the record regarding when the restitution order was entered, stating that \u201cthe notices of recorded judgment clearly indicate that the judgment was entered by the Clerk on July 24, 2009.\u201d He contends that this Court \u201cshould accept the July 24, 2009 judgment entry date\u201d because the trial court\u2019s restitution order \u201cwas mailed ... in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the same envelope with the Notices of Recorded Judgment on July 24, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We do not agree that there is a conflict in the record regarding the date the order of restitution was entered. The docket entries clearly show that the order was entered on July 20, 2009. The July 24, 2009, date on the notices of recorded judgment reflect the entry of a separate civil judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">C.P. \u00a7 ll-609(a) provides that a judgment of restitution ordered by a circuit court \u201cshall be recorded and indexed in the civil judgment index by the clerk of the circuit court as a money judgment as the Maryland Rules provide.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statutory scheme reflects that the civil judgment is separate from the criminal judgment of restitution. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-612(b) (\u201cSubject to the Maryland Rules, unless a restitution obligor pays complete restitution, termination of probation by a court does not affect a money judgment that has been recorded and indexed under Part I of this subtitle.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The July 24, 2009, entry date listed in the notice of recorded judgment refers to the indexing and recording of the order of restitution as a civil judgment. Although the civil judgment could be entered on the same day as the order of restitution in the criminal case, here it was not. The final judgment in the criminal case, the order of restitution which is the subject of this appeal, was entered on July 20, 2009. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, which was filed on August 24, 2009, was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.
