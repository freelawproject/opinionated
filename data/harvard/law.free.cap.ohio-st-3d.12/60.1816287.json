That was subsequently amended so as to read \u2018lowest and best bid\u2019. This amendment clearly indicates that the Legislature recognized that an element other than the mere low dollar bid often enters into the letting of a contract. Hence the amendment providing that the contract should be let to the lowest and best bidder followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\u201cThis amendment, therefore, places in the hands of the * * * [public] authorities the discretion of determining who under all the circumstances is the <em>lowest and best </em>bidder for the work in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">\u201cThis discretion is not vested in the courts and the courts cannot interfere in the exercise of this discretion unless it clearly appears that the * * * [public] authorities in whom such discretion has been vested are abusing the discretion so vested in them.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">See, also, <em>Dayton, ex rel. Scandrick, </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 356, 358 [21 O.O.3d 225]; <em>Boger Contracting Corp. </em>v. <em>Board </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App. 2d 195, 199 [14 O.O.3d 176]; <em>State, ex rel. Walton, </em>v. <em>Hermann </em>(1900), 63 Ohio St. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Moreover, the aforementioned statement by the court in <em>Altschul, supra, </em>constitutes an application of the well-established principle that \u201c* * * mandamus will not lie to substitute the discretion of a judicial tribunal for that of an administrative official, unless it is clearly shown that the refusal to perform the act constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Bd. of Edn., </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Edn. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 126, 128 [21 O.O.3d 79], citing <em>State, ex rel. Shafer, </em>v. <em>Ohio Turnpike Comm. </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 581 [50 O.O. 465], and <em>State, ex rel. Christman, </em>v. <em>Skinner </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">Regarding the term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d by a public authority in the letting of a contract subsequent to the taking of bids, this court has recognized that such an abuse includes the utilization of unannounced criteria in selecting a bidder, <em>Dayton, ex rel. Scandrick, </em>v. <em>McGee, supra, </em>as well as fraudulent conduct or bad faith, <em>State, ex rel. Shafer, </em>v. <em>Ohio Turnpike Comm., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">Appellant\u2019s complaint does not allege, nor does appellant argue herein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the utilization of unannounced criteria by the board of county commissioners. Nor does the complaint allege bad faith, fraudulent conduct or any other allegation which could be construed to constitute an abuse of discretion. Instead, the complaint simply alleges that appellant submitted the \u201clowest and best bid.\u201d Since under R.C. 307.90 the determination of which bid constituted the \u201clowest and best bid\u201d involved the exercise of a certain degree of discretion by appellees, appellant\u2019s complaint merely asked the court of appeals to substitute its discretion for that which was exercised by appellees. Under such circumstances, mandamus will not lie, and the court of appeals correctly dismissed the complaint. Cf. <em>State, ex rel. Britton, </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
