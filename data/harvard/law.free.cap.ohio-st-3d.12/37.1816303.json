It is well-settled concerning an appeal as of right from an action originating in the court of appeals that this court will review the judgment of the court as if the action had originally been filed herein to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether a plain and adequate remedy existed in the ordinary course of the law. See <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 164 [40 O.O.2d 141].</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">The common thread linking such extraordinary remedies as mandamus, prohibition or habeas corpus is that none of these writs will issue when a plain and adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of the law. See <em>State, ex rel. Berger, </em>v. <em>McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 28, and cases cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>therein as this rule is applied to actions in mandamus and prohibition, and <em>In re Hunt </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 378 [75 O.O.2d 450], for the application of the rule to habeas corpus actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">As stated in <em>In re Piazza </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St. 2d 102, 103 [36 O.O.2d 84]:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u201c* * * Habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy and as with every extraordinary remedy is not available as a means of relief where there is an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>In re Burson </em>[1949], 152 Ohio St. 375 [40 O.O. 391]. Habeas corpus may not be used as a substitute for appeal nor may it be resorted to where an adequate statutory remedy for review of the questions presented exists.\u201d See, also, <em>Linger </em>v. <em>Weiss </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 97 [11 O.O.3d 281]; <em>In re Hunt, supra; In re Clendenning </em>(1945), 145 Ohio St. 82 [30 O.O.301].</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Moreover, it is firmly established that a discretionary right of appeal to the court of appeals constitutes a sufficiently plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State, ex rel. Cleveland, </em>v. <em>Calandra </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 121, 122 [16 O.O.3d 143]; <em>State, ex rel. Berger, </em>v. <em>McMonagle, supra, </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In the instant cause, appellee not only possessed an adequate statutory remedy under R.C. 3109.32(A),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by which to seek enforcement of the Illinois custody order, but she pursued that remedy and received a decision from the court of common pleas on the precise issue which she then placed before the court of appeals through a discretionary appeal, as well as an original action in habeas corpus. Clearly, appellee sought to employ the writ as a substitute for, or in conjunction with, her statutory remedy under R.C. Chapter 3109 and her discretionary appeal, contrary to this court\u2019s prior pronouncements. <em>In re Hunt, supra, </em>at 381; <em>In re Piazza, supra, </em>at 103. Cf. <em>Hardesty </em>v. <em>Williamson </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 174, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">We therefore conclude that since this cause exhibits no circumstances warranting the issuance of the extraordinary writ of habeas corpus in place of the statutory procedure contained under R.C. Chapter 3109, or an appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment, the court of appeals improperly granted the writ.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the writ is denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
