Tyson, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-11\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">Appellant argues that the commission\u2019s order of October 27,1981 was final and not subject to modification pursuant to R.C. 4123.52 in the absence of evidence of new or changed conditions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ohio Stove Co. </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 27 [42 O.O. 117].</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">The commission submits, and the court of appeals found, that the initial order was clearly provisional pending further evaluation of appellant\u2019s claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The first sentence of the commission\u2019s decision states that \u201cthe claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>is Permanently and Totally Disabled,\u201d and makes an award \u201cfor such disability.\u201d Appellant contends that this finding is conclusive upon the commission. The award, however, is limited to the period beginning February 10, 1981 (the date when appellant\u2019s motion was filed) and ending October 27, 1982 (exactly one year after the initial order was issued). This limitation, in itself, is indicative of the order\u2019s provisional nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The language following the limited award clearly identifies the commission\u2019s intent to subject appellant\u2019s claim to further review. Appellant was to be evaluated by the rehabilitation division after which his file was to be reexamined by the legal section. Then the matter was to be reset. In short, the order itself provides the best support for the commission\u2019s argument that it was provisional and, therefore, subject to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">If the October 27, 1981 order was provisional, then the inquiry focuses on the order of December 27, 1982. With that order the commission denied appellant\u2019s motion for permanent and total disability \u201cbased particularly on the medical report of Dr. McCloud * * Dr. McCloud\u2019s report stated that appellant \u201cdoes not present with [sic] medical evidence consistent with considering him * * * [permanently totally impaired].\u201d Inasmuch as mandamus will not lie where there is some evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s findings, mandamus is inappropriate in the instant appeal. <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55 [11 O.O.3d 216].</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the initial order was provisional, the commission argues that evidence subsequently gathered provides it with authority to invoke its continuing jurisdiction and modify its earlier findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Appellant correctly contends that the initial order, if provisional, depended upon his potential for rehabilitation. Inasmuch as he was found to have no potential for rehabilitation, appellant reasons that the findings in the initial order should have been affirmed. Appellant\u2019s reasoning ignores the fact that his incapacity for rehabilitation was regarded as being categorically unrelated to his allowed conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if the initial order was final, the rehabilitation report provided ample support for the commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction and subsequent modification of its earlier findings. This court has consistently held that a claimant\u2019s disability must result from an allowed condition in order for it to be compensable. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Midland-Ross </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 267 [21 O.O.3d 168]. The commission\u2019s findings are supported by the record. They will not, therefore, be disturbed. <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 278 [73 O.O.2d 255].</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The judgment of the court of appeals is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b54-7\">C.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Acq\">concurring. My concurrence in the judgment does not need the aid of the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard as expressed in <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55 [11 O.O.3d 216], and in many other cases since 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The court of appeals correctly determined that the commission\u2019s order entered October 27, 1981, finding relator was permanently and totally disabled, was provisional and that relator would be evaluated further after his rehabilitation potential was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The court of appeals properly found that the commission in issuing its December 27, 1982 order upon reconsideration evaluated the rehabilitation report which was prepared and filed after the first commission order of October 27, 1981, and that this report alone supports the final order of the commission because it represents' new evidence of relator\u2019s condition. The report on relator\u2019s potential for rehabilitation reveals that relator is a poor candidate for rehabilitation due to his strong feelings that he is not able to return to work, his resistance to treatment, his antisocial behavior, including incarceration, his ongoing reinforcement for illness behaviors and his lack of motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The commission on December 27, 1982 had the power to reconsider its October 27, 1981 order of permanent and total disability by reason of R.C. 4123.52 which gives it continuing jurisdiction to revoke and modify its orders.</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-13\">J. P. Celebrezze, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
