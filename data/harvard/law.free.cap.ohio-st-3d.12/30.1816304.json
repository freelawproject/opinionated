Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">The parcel of land located at 508 Huron Avenue, Sandusky, Ohio, is a single-family residence which was erected before the 1956 enactment of the Sandusky city zoning ordinances. The area in which the property is situated was designated R2F by the 1956 ordinance. R2F zoning allows two-family dwellings and single-family dwellings. When plaintiff-appellant purchased the property in question in 1981, he did so for investment purposes with the idea of renting the residence. Appellant testified before the commission and board that he desired to convert the residence from a single-family to a two-family residence so as to make the rental property profitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The conversion of appellant\u2019s property to a duplex would not need the approval of the commission but for the fact that the lot on which the residence is situated is below the minimum area and yard requirements contained in the city zoning provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant, therefore, sought a variance to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the conversion of the residence. Such a variance is not a pure use variance. The variance sought by appellant is merely an area variance. It has been noted by other jurisdictions that the standard for granting a variance which relates to area requirements only should be a lesser standard than that applied to use variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The New York Court of Appeals when faced with a case quite similar to the present action explained, \u201c[a]n applicant for an area variance need not establish special [unnecessary] hardship. It is sufficient to show practical difficulties * * *.\u201d <em>Matter of Hoffman </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1966), 17 N.Y. 2d 138, 144, 269 N.Y. Supp. 2d 119, 123, 216 N.E. 2d 326, 329.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court went on to cite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>reason for such distinctions between use and area variances as being, \u201c* * * [w]hen the variance is one of area only, there is no change in the character of the zoned district and the neighborhood considerations are not as strong as in a use variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In this case the grant of a variance to appellant will not alter the character of the surrounding neighborhood. The record reveals that a vast majority of the surrounding neighborhood is at the present time being used as two-family residential rental property. In fact the lot directly north of appellant\u2019s property was granted a variance by the commission to be used as a multifamily residence, which is not only an area but a use variance. The residence granted this variance is on a lot which is smaller in area than the appellant\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">This court has recently addressed the issue of variances in <em>Consolidated Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 238. In that case the plaintiff sought a variance to convert his commercial property to a use which was outside the use permitted by the zoning ordinance. This court held that the requirement of an unnecessary hardship suffered by a landowner seeking a variance could not be met when the landowner purchased the property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The instant case is a different situation. While appellant had prior knowledge of the commission\u2019s denial of a variance requested by the previous landowner, the decision entered by the commission at that time was never appealed. The granting of a variance to the appellant should not be judged on the traditional showing of an \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d but on the lesser standard of a \u201cpractical difficulty.\u201d Because the standard which is used to guide the decision of the reviewing authorities is different in this action, the value of the precedent enunciated in <em>Consolidated Mgmt., Inc. </em>is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We are further persuaded that the common pleas court was correct when it found that the denial of the variance by the commission and board was unreasonable and arbitrary. An examination of the record reveals that the neighborhood in which appellant\u2019s parcel of land is situated contains many duplex residences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A significant number of these residences are on lots insufficient in size, according to the zoning ordinances. Even more persuasive is the fact that the lot north of appellant\u2019s lot was recently granted a variance for a multifamily residence. The allowance of other duplexes on lots insufficient in size and the granting of a multifamily variance to a neighboring landowner, while denying appellant\u2019s request for a variance, is unreasonable and arbitrary enforcement of the zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">When a zoning ordinance is enforced in an unreasonable and arbitrary-manner, as in this case, it is the responsibility of the trial court, reviewing the action pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506, to reverse the findings of the board of zoning appeals. The scope of review by the trial court is set forth in R.C. 2506.04, which requires the court to examine the \u201csubstantial, reliable and probative evidence on the whole record.\u201d This court has noted in <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>v. <em>Glendale </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 368, 370 [71 O.O.2d 331], that, \u201c* * * [although a hearing before the Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 2506.01 is not <em>de novo, </em>it often in fact resembles a <em>de novo </em>proceeding. R.C. 2506.03 specifically provides that an appeal pursuant to R.C. 2506.01, \u2018shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action,\u2019 and makes liberal provision for the introduction of new or additional evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A court of common pleas should not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative board, such as the board of zoning appeals, unless the court finds that there is not a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s decision. This court pointed out in <em>Dudukovich </em>v. <em>Housing Authority </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 202, 207 [12 O.O.3d 198], \u201c[t]he key term is \u2018preponderance.\u2019 \u201d The court went on further to explore the scope of review by the appellate courts and found, \u201c[i]n determining whether the standard of review prescribed by R.C. 2506.04 was correctly applied by the Court of Common Pleas, both this court [the Supreme Court] and the Court of Appeals have a limited function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In an R.C. Chapter 2506 administrative appeal of a decision of the board of zoning appeals to the common pleas court, the court, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, may reverse the board if it finds that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence. An appeal to the court of appeals, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, is more limited in scope and requires that court to affirm the common pleas court, unless the court of appeals finds, as a matter of law, that the decision of the common pleas court is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">This is consistent with the determination in the per <em>curiam </em>opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Univ. of Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St. 2d 108 [17 O.O.3d 65], which construed analogous R.C. 119.12 governing administrative appeals in R.C. Chapter 119. There, this court stated at 110-112:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u201cIn the case of <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St. 2d 92 [42 O.O.2d 286], discussing the scope of review of the Common Pleas Court under R.C. 3319.16 (teacher termination), Chief Justice Taft stated, at pages 96-97, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u201c \u2018The legislative purpose, generally to authorize a Common Pleas Court to weigh the evidence on an appeal from an administrative agency, is indicated by other statutes, as well as by our decisions construing them. Thus, after the holding of this court in <em>Farrand </em>v. <em>State Medical Board </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 222 [39 O.O.41], 85 N.E. 2d 113, the General Assembly amended what is now Section 119.12, Revised Code, to provide for such authority. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Board of Liquor Control, supra </em>(164 Ohio St. 275 [58 O.O. 51], paragraph one of the syllabus). Furthermore, in adopting Section 2506.04 Revised Code, in 1957, the General Assembly even used the words \u201cpreponderance of * * * evidence\u201d to emphasive <em>[sic] </em>this purpose.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u201cIn <em>Andrews, </em>this court acknowledged that determining whether an agency order is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence essentially is a question of the absence or presence of the requisite quantum of evidence. Although this in essence is a legal question, inevitably it involves a consideration of the evidence, and to a limited extent would permit a substitution of judgment by the reviewing Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u201cIn undertaking this hybrid form of review, the Court of Common Pleas must give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts. * * * However, the findings of the agency are by no means conclusive. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">\u201cApplying these general principles to the instant cause, we believe that the Court of Common Pleas utilized the appropriate scope of review in reversing the order of the commission. * * * We believe that the Court of Common Pleas was acting in accordance with its statutory power, under R.C. 119.12 in electing not to give credence to the testimony of Conrad, and in relying upon the testimony of the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals herein held that \u2018[i]t is well established that a common pleas court does not sit as the trier of facts in a case such as this. Its authority is solely that of a reviewing court * * *.\u2019 The appellate court then reversed the lower court, finding that there was reliable[,] probative and substantial evidence before the commission. We believe that the Court of Appeals misperceived the scope of review of the Common Pleas Court in such a proceeding pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">Since the standard for granting a variance which relates solely to area requirements should be a lesser standard than that applied to variances which relate to use, an application for an area variance need not establish unnecessary hardship. It is sufficient the application show practical difficulties. Having examined the record, this court concludes that the court of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>pleas did not abuse its discretion in reaching its judgment. The judgment of the court of appeals is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-6\">W. Brown, Sweeney and J. P.

The first paragraph of the syllabus in <em>Consolidated Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 238, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u201cGenerally, where a purchaser of commercial property acquires the premises with knowledge of certain zoning restrictions, he must accept the limitations on the usages of such property, and may not demand a variance based upon the claimed hardship due to such limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">In effect, the majority today finds a difference between commercial property and residential property for variance purposes. Appellant readily admits to having knowledge of the zoning restrictions applicable to his residential property when he purchased it in 1981 for investment purposes, yet is now permitted to ignore such restrictions. This is a <em>suh silentio </em>reversal of <em>Consolidated Mgmt., Inc., </em>since there should be no difference in the present context between commercial and residential uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The majority misinterprets the holding in <em>Consolidated Mgmt., Inc. </em>as requiring some sort of a previous attempt to secure a variance before knowledge is imputed. This was not the holding of that case. No distinction was made as to how the knowledge is gained. Rather, a landowner who buys with knowledge, <em>however gained, \u201c* </em>* * has created his own hardship and generally cannot thereafter apply for a zoning variance based on such hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The majority makes much of the fact that a neighboring landowner to appellant was granted a multifamily variance from a previous commercial use. This commercial use, however, was a <em>nonconforming </em>use that was eliminated by the variance. Hence, the present use of that property is more restricted than its previous use, and is now more closely tailored to the zoning plan than before. Thus, the neighborhood was <em>upgraded </em>by the granting of that variance. This is far different from what has occurred in the case herein: appellant is permitted to vary his previously conforming use into a downgrading use outside the bounds of the zoning code.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">The real problem with this court\u2019s holding today, though, is the abrogation of the home rule power of appellee city to enforce its zoning code. The property in question is <em>less than one-half </em>of the required two-family area dimensions. There is no question here of any arbitrariness on the part of appellee. Zoning has long been an established power of the municipality, with the burden on the claimant to show that a zoning board\u2019s refusal to grant a variance is unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. <em>Consolidated Mgmt., Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 240; <em>C.

The court of appeals was correct in citing the knowledge of appellant, the large size disparity, and the distinguishable circumstances of the neighboring parcel in holding for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I must therefore dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., and Holmes, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
