Appellant contends, however, that in the case of CMP, \u201cdisability,\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.61, can refer only to total disability, inasmuch as there are never any benefits to be computed for anything less than total disability. Appellees essentially argue that \u201cdisability\u201d is not defined in R.C. Chapter 4123 and should be given its ordinary meaning. Disability can reasonably be said to have begun when appellant\u2019s ability declined to the point where he left his job due to his physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">R.C. 4123.68 restricts benefits for CMP to claimants who are suffering total disability. That section states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">\u201cCompensation and * * * expenses on account of * * * coal miners\u2019 pneumoconiosis are payable only in the event of temporary total disability, permanent total disability, or death * *</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">From this and other language in the Ohio Revised Code, it appears that the General Assembly is well able to distinguish among the various categories of disability. R.C. 4123.61 could have read, \u201cat the time <em>\u2018total </em>disability\u2019 or <em>\u2018compensable </em>disability\u2019 due to the occupational disease begins.\u201d Instead, the General Assembly chose not to modify the word \u201cdisability\u201d at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">This court has often acknowledged that its duty is \u201c* * *\u2018* * * \u201cto give effect to the <em>words used </em>[in a statute], not to delete words used <em>or to insert words not used.\u201d\u2019 \u2019\u2019Dougherty </em>v. <em>Torrence </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 69, 70. (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>It appears, therefore, that \u201cdisability,\u201d under R.C. 4123.61, should be given its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) defines \u201cdisability\u201d in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">\u201cAs used in connection with Workers\u2019 Compensation Acts, disability is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>composite of (1) actual incapacity to perform the tasks usually encountered in one\u2019s employment and the wage loss resulting therefrom, and (2) physical impairment of the body that may or may not be incapacitating. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u201c* * * Inability to work * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (1975) defines \u201cdisability\u201d in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u201c* * * b: inability to pursue an occupation because of physical or mental impairment * * *[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Both of these definitions tie disability to the inability to work. The commission, in its order, determined the date disability began according to the date appellant last worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Appellee-commission also notes, as did the court of appeals, that R.C. 4123.85 contains the statute of limitations for the filing of an occupational disease claim. It reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u201cIn all cases of occupational disease, * * * <em>claims </em>for compensation or benefits <em>shall be forever barred unless, within two years after the disability </em>due to the disease <em>began, or </em>within such longer period as does not exceed <em>six months after diagnosis </em>* * * by a licensed physician * * *, <em>application is made </em>to the industrial commission or to the employer * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Appellant\u2019s cause of action arose on March 19, 1973 when he was diagnosed as having an occupational disease. As this court said in <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Kamrath </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 1, 4, \u201c[t]he statutory law in force upon the date the cause of action accrued is the measure of the right, and is not subject to enlargement or diminishment by the Industrial Commission * * *.\u201d The commission\u2019s designation of the date of disability comports with this court\u2019s determination regarding the measure of his right to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">This court has consistently held that, \u201c[t]he determination of disputed factual situations * * * is within the final jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 50 [1 O.O.2d 190]. \u201c[W]here the record contains evidence which supports the commission\u2019s factual findings, this court will not disturb that determination.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 278, 283 [71 O.O.2d 230].</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The commission found that appellant\u2019s disability due to occupational disease began on June 2, 1973, and the record shows the day prior to be his last day of work. No abuse of discretion having been shown, the commission\u2019s conclusion is a reasonable one. The judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-15\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">dissenting. I am convinced that today\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4123.61 is considerably too restrictive. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Elementary logic and common sense require that the term \u201cdisability,\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.61, be read as \u201ctotal disability\u201d in cases involving coal miners\u2019 pneumoconiosis. This is a gradually progressive disease, often taking years of exposure before reaching the point where total disability sets in, <em>which is the only point at which it becomes compensable. </em>See R.C. 4123.68(Y). Partial disability may occur years before total disability. It is manifestly unjust as well as contrary to legislative intent to measure benefits from the time mere (uncompensable) disability occurs as opposed to total (compensable) disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The court of appeals, in construing R.C. 4123.68(Y), which limits compensability for coal miners\u2019 pneumoconiosis to total disability or death, held that this delaying of eligibility for benefits \u201cindicates the legislature\u2019s desire to limit when payment of benefits will begin.\u201d This interpretation, obviously correct, actually commands a result opposite to that reached by the court of appeals and affirmed today. The proper result is that benefits should be computed as of the time the claimant becomes eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Not all occupational diseases are compensable only after total disability or death. See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 4123.68(Z), wherein radiation illness is compensable and not limited to total disability. The same is true for berylliosis. See R.C. 4123.68(V). Thus, R.C. 4123.61 should be read in light of the fact that the term \u201cdisability\u201d has differing significance for different occupational diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The majority reasons that the language of R.C. 4123.61 should be given its \u201cplain meaning.\u201d However, the meaning of the term \u201cdisability\u201d in this setting is hardly as \u201cplain\u201d as the majority assumes it to be. The more reasonable approach would be to construe the term in light of its special significance for certain occupational diseases. Today\u2019s decision presents an extremely narrow interpretation, which is not only short-sighted but needlessly restrictive of the rights of certain claimants, contrary to the liberal construction mandate of R.C. 4123.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The majority cites authority for the proposition that the statutory law in effect on the date the cause of action accrues is the measure of the right. I fail to see how this principle supports today\u2019s decision. We are not addressing appellant\u2019s <em>right </em>to benefits. This right has already been established. The only issue in the case at bar is the <em>amount </em>of benefits the legislature intended to confer on claimants such as appellant. The majority today advances an unduly harsh and inflexible construction. A more logical interpretation is available in this case which would fulfill the liberal construction requirement of R.C. 4123.95 without undue distortion of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Based on the foregoing, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and allow the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
