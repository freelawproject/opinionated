Orbison worked for Ma-Tex Rope Company, Inc. (Ma-Tex), he signed an employment agreement containing a non-competition agreement, a non-disclosure agreement, and a non-solicitation\n   agreement. During his tenure, he learned various things about Ma-Tex's business and customers and became the coordinator of Ma-Tex's recertification department. Orbison continued in that position until he resigned from Ma-Tex, went to work for Ma-Tex's competitor, American Pipe Inspections, Inc. (API), as the coordinator of its recertification department, and began soliciting work for API from Ma-Tex's customers. This lawsuit arose from that series of events and centers on Orbison's non-competition, non-disclosure, and non-solicitation agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ma-Tex fabricates and services equipment used in the oil and gas industry. As part of its services, Ma-Tex recertifies wireline\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   equipment for companies throughout the continental United States. Orbison began working for Ma-Tex in September 2011, at which time he executed the employment agreement that is at the center of this action. In July 2013, Orbison became the coordinator of Ma-Tex's recertification department. He resigned from Ma-Tex August 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly after Orbison left its employ, Ma-Tex discovered that Orbison was working for API in the same position he had filled with Ma-Tex and that he was soliciting recertification work from Ma-Tex's customers. When Ma-Tex failed to receive a satisfactory response to its cease-and-desist letter sent to Orbison and API, Ma-Tex sued them and obtained a temporary restraining order barring Orbison and API from disclosing or using Ma-Tex's trade secrets and confidential information, from soliciting or serving Ma-Tex's customers, and from competing with Ma-Tex in the servicing and recertification of wireline equipment in nineteen states. After a bench trial on the merits, the trial court granted Ma-Tex a permanent injunction against Orbison and API and awarded Ma-Tex actual damages and attorney fees against Orbison and API.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this appeal, Orbison and API (Appellants) assert that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of damages, in awarding damages, in enforcing the post-employment restrictions contained in the employment agreement, in issuing the permanent injunction, in denying Appellants' motion for sanctions, and in awarding attorney fees against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While we find that (1) there is insufficient evidence in this record to support the award of damages for lost profits and lost good will, we also conclude that (2) there was no abuse of discretion in issuing the permanent injunction, (3) there was no abuse of discretion in denying API's motion for sanctions, (4) there was no abuse of discretion in awarding attorney fees, (5) Appellants waived any objection to late-disclosed evidence by refusing the offered continuance, and (6) Appellants failed to preserve their complaint regarding termination of the employment contract. Therefore, we reverse the award of damages for lost profits and good will, delete the award of just those two elements of damages, and affirm the trial court's judgment in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    (1) There Is Insufficient Evidence in this Record to Support the Award of Damages for Lost Profits and Lost Good Will\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the award of damages for lost profits, lost good will, fee forfeiture, and profit disgorgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its findings of fact,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court found that, but for Orbison's solicitation on behalf of API, Ma-Tex would have secured the two recertification orders of Halliburton Pinnacle and Arklatex and that it would have made a net profit of $2,321.00 on these orders. The trial court also found that Orbison's and API's actions in soliciting its customers caused Ma-Tex to lose good will of the value of $120,000.00. In addition, the trial court found that Orbison spent at least 10% of his working time between April 11, 2016, and August 12, 2016, assisting API in setting up its recertification division to the detriment of Ma-Tex. The trial court also entered conclusions of law that Ma-Tex should recover unjust enrichment damages as a result of Orbison's misappropriation of trade secrets, and for his breach of fiduciary duties, in the amount of $1,866.15 (10% of the salary paid to Orbison by Ma-Tex from April 16 through August 12, 2016), and $2,307.68 (the amount paid to Orbison by API from August 15 through August 31, 2016).

He provided no explanation of how these lost profits were determined, and Ma-Tex points to no other evidence in the record that provided an explanation of how the lost profits were determined. Rather, Ma-Tex points only to the API invoices and Matthews' testimony set forth above and claims that Matthews identified the goods and services involved, then \"computed the incremental profit that\n   <em>\n    Ma-Tex\n   </em>\n   would have made on these projects.\" Even if we were to accept Ma-Tex's rather generous interpretation of Matthews' testimony, his testimony still does not provide this Court with the objective facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits were calculated, nor the method he used to calculate them. Consequently, the evidence is legally insufficient to support the finding of $2,321.00 in lost profits.

Ma-Tex responds that there is no set formula in determining good will damages and that Matthews' testimony shows he calculated the minimum loss based on his and Drew's time and the expenditure of company funds to repair its good will.

Here, it elected to require forfeiture of a portion of\n   the compensation paid by Ma-Tex to Orbison during the period of time that Orbison was assisting API to set up its recertification shop and was soliciting two of Ma-Tex's employee's to work for API. In addition, the trial court required disgorgement of an amount equal to the compensation paid by API to Orbison during the time that Orbison was actively competing with Ma-Tex by using Ma-Tex's confidential information to solicit its customers. Under\n   <em>\n    Swinnea\n   </em>\n   and the cases cited therein, we see no essential distinction between forfeiting a fee paid to an attorney or trustee who breaches his fiduciary duty and forfeiting the salary paid to an employee who does the same. In each instance the breaching fiduciary received compensation from the principal while breaching his trust. Neither do we see an essential distinction between disgorging a fee paid to, or the profit made by, an agent who usurps his principal's business opportunity and disgorging an amount equal to the salary paid to a former employee by his new employer when the former employee uses confidential information and trade secrets to solicit the customers of his former employer. In each instance, the breaching fiduciary profited by, or received compensation for, breaching the trust of his principal. The same principles apply to each of these circumstances, and the remedies of forfeiture and disgorgement are \"necessary to prevent such abuses of trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 874.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Consequently, we find that, under the circumstances of this case, Orbison was subject to the forfeiture of his salary paid by Ma-Tex and to the disgorgement of the salary paid to him by API while he was actively using Ma-Tex's confidential information to solicit its customers.

However, the evidence at trial showed that Orbison had been trained on, and had used, Ma-Tex's tracking software. Shortly before he left the employ of Ma-Tex, Orbison sent an email to API listing \"the high value items\" that needed to be in place for API to begin processing recertification orders. Included in the high value items was a \"Certificate tracking website\" that Drew identified as Ma-Tex's Customer Care Center (CCC),\n   its web-based tracking system. In the email, Orbison offered his upcoming vacation time to work on setting up API's shop. Shortly after Orbison began working for API, he sent an email to one of Ma-Tex's customers, Schlumberger, stating that \"[t]he Bradford, PA location has some items that need to be recertified in the near future.\" Drew testified that this information was contained in its CCC, or tracking, software. In addition, the trial court made an unchallenged finding that Orbison disclosed to API the concept of Ma-Tex's logistical/distribution network and corresponding tracking software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This evidence demonstrates that Orbison had used and disclosed Ma-Tex's tracking software and the information derived from it for the benefit of API and to the detriment of Ma-Tex, both before and after he left Ma-Tex's employment. Under these circumstances, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining Orbison from disclosing or using Ma-Tex's tracking software and the information derived from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Appellants also complain that the trial court abused its discretion by enjoining Orbison from soliciting Ma-Tex customers because, they contend, it is impossible for Orbison or API to ascertain who those customers might be. We interpret this complaint as relating to that portion of the injunction that enjoins Orbison from disclosing or using any information about Ma-Tex's customers. Among the unchallenged findings of fact that are supported by the evidence, the trial court found that Ma-Tex provided Orbison various customer information confidential to Ma-Tex, including information more specifically listed in the court's findings numbered 22-24 and 28-29 in the Appendix to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this case, Orbison was bound by the post-employment restrictions from competing with Ma-Tex and from disclosing or using any of Ma-Tex's confidential information. This confidential information included any customer information.

Further, the evidence also showed that Orbison has a list of Ma-Tex's wireline recertification customers and their\n   contact information in the contacts stored on his personal cellular telephone.

To the extent that Orbison proposes to perform work in the nineteen states that is related to the sales, service, or recertification of wireline equipment used in the upstream production of oil and gas, the injunction clearly restrains him from doing so, regardless of whether it is performed for Ma-Tex's current customers, until August 12, 2021. At the same time, the injunction does not restrain Orbison from performing work that is not related to the sales, service, or recertification of wireline equipment used in the upstream production of oil and gas in those nineteen states, even if such work is performed for a customer of Ma-Tex.

Nevertheless, Appellants point to certain testimony at trial which they contend shows that several affidavits and pleadings filed by Ma-Tex were filed in bad faith. Even assuming this testimony could be used to support API's motion for sanctions, it does not show bad faith on the part of Ma-Tex. First, Appellants point to certain testimony by Matthews that they contend shows Matthews admitted that he had no evidence that API's and Orbison's actions had caused his company to lose customers. However, an examination of Matthews' testimony indicates that, although he had information of at least one customer who Ma-Tex had lost, that evidence had not at that point been presented. Appellants also claim that Matthews admitted that Ma-Tex did not produce any documents to support its damages. Again, an examination of the testimony relied on by Appellants shows that Matthews testified that Ma-Tex had produced the specific documents requested, but had not produced documents that had not been requested by Appellants. Appellants' brief also claims that Drew signed an affidavit accusing API and Orbison of stealing Ma-Tex's custom tracking software, and it points to testimony rebutting that accusation. However, Drew's affidavit made no such claim. Rather, he averred that Orbison was using and disclosing confidential information and trade secrets, including its proprietary tracking software, to solicit Ma-Tex's customers. This statement can reasonably be construed to mean Orbison was using the confidential information contained in the tracking software to solicit Ma-Tex's customers. None of this testimony shows bad faith, that there were no grounds for the legal arguments advanced, or that the factual allegations lacked evidentiary support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, although API obtained a hearing on its post-judgment motion for sanctions, it merely argued its motion and presented no evidence to the trial court.

On November 2, 2016, Ma-Tex responded to the request for disclosures and stated that its damages included loss of good will, customers,\n   profits, and the benefit of its trade secrets, and that it would supplement its response with the amount and methods of calculating its damages. On November 8, 2016, Ma-Tex responded to API's interrogatories regarding damages in essentially the same manner.

On May 5, 2017, Ma-Tex supplemented its responses to API's interrogatories in the same manner. On the same day, Ma-Tex again supplemented its responses to the requests for disclosures and identified, for the first time, two of Ma-Tex's officers, Drew and Matthews, as experts who would testify regarding its damages.

As noted above, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it found that these actual damages consisted of $2,321.00 in lost profits, $120,000.00 in lost good will, and damages for unjust enrichment, fee forfeiture, and profit disgorgement in the aggregate amount of $4,173.83. We have determined that legally insufficient evidence supports the trial court's award of damages for lost profits and lost good will. Consequently, in said clause (A), the trial court should have awarded actual damages of $4,173.83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Therefore, for the reasons stated, we reverse the trial court's award of damages for lost profits and loss of goodwill and render judgment, under clause (A) in the judgment's paragraph awarding dollar amounts, that Ma-Tex Wire Rope Company, Inc., have and recover from Samuel D.

Ma-Tex is an oil and gas services company formed in the 1960s.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   7. Ma-Tex's headquarters are in Kilgore, Texas, and it has office locations in Alice, Pleasanton, and Midland, Texas, and in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   8. Ma-Tex has five divisions: rigging fabrication, nylon fabrication, electric wireline, cable service (sand line and drill line), and recertification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   9. Wireline recertification is a subset within the recertification division, and represents about 80 percent of Ma-Tex's total recertification business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   10. Ma-Tex's wireline recertification business is a niche business within the oil and gas industry, selling, servicing, and recertifing wireline equipment used in the upstream sector of the industry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   11. Ma-Tex's wireline recertification customers are in the oil and gas business and are located throughout the United States, including the following states: Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Colorado, California, Kansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Mississippi, North Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Ohio, Wyoming, and West Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   12. Over the past decade, Ma-Tex has grown its recertification business-and gained a competitive advantage-by developing and honing effective procedures for inspecting and recertifying wireline equipment, including a unique distribution network that increases convenience for customers and reduces the turnaround time for wireline recertification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   13. Ma-Tex also uses a uniquely-developed software application to oversee its recertification business and to provide customers with an online portal for monitoring the status of their\n   wireline equipment inspection and recertification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   14. Ma-Tex developed its wireline recertification customers and contacts through its preexisting relationships in its electric wireline division, which took years to develop, through many years of sales calls, trips, and consulting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   15. Ma-Tex does not publicize its recertification procedures, prices, or customer contacts and profiles, and Ma-Tex has spent considerable time and resources to protect the information and keep it confidential; e.g., Ma-Tex requires every employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement before they may access Ma-Tex's confidential business information, and Ma-Tex limits access to certain customer information, including as pricing, within its offices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   16. Ma-Tex hired Orbison as a management trainee and employed Orbison from September 15, 2011 until August 12, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   17. To protect Ma-Tex's confidential information, trade secrets, and good will, Orbison and Ma-Tex entered into an employment agreement on September 15, 2011, which contained non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disclosure restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   18. Ma-Tex agreed to provide Orbison with trade secrets, confidential information, and specialized training in exchange for Orbison's non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreements, and Orbison's covenant not-to-compete with Ma-Tex during the term of his employment and thereafter for five (5) years within three-hundred fifty (350) miles of Kilgore, Texas or any other geographical region where Ma-Tex does business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   19. After Orbison signed the Employment Agreement, Ma-Tex shared its trade secrets and confidential information with Orbison and also provided him with unique and specialized training; therefore, the covenant not-to-compete in the Employment Agreement was supported by adequate consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   20. The business good will, confidential or propriety information, trade secrets, customer information, and specialized training provided by Ma-Tex to Orbison over the course of five (5) years were and are worthy of protection by a covenant not-to-compete with Orbison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   21. The restriction period of five (5) years, the geographic restriction, and the restricted activity contained in the covenant not-to-compete are reasonable, both individually and collectively. They impose no greater restraint than is necessary to protect the business goodwill, confidential and proprietary information, trade secrets, customer information, and specialized training that Ma-Tex provided to Orbison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   22. Ma-Tex provided Orbison with various forms of confidential information and trade secrets, including design techniques, customer lists and information, vendor information, software programs (such as the Customer Care Center (\"CCC\") ), sales database with customer profiles, billing and pricing information, and marketing strategies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   23. The specific types of customer information Ma-Tex shared with Orbison included, among others, customer name, location, and contact information of decision makers; custom needs and requirements; custom pricing profiles; and purchasing history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   24. Orbison put the Ma-Tex customer contacts into his company-issued\n   iPhone and his personal Samsung Galaxy phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   26. When Orbison started working for Ma-Tex, he was a recent college graduate and (A) he had no prior experience in Ma-Tex's business of recertifying wireline equipment, nor in the oil and gas industry in general; (B) he did not know any of Ma-Tex's customers or vendors, and had no potential customers or vendors of his own to solicit; (C) he knew nothing about Ma-Tex's logistical network; (D) he knew nothing about Ma-Tex's tracking software; and (E) he knew nothing about Ma-Tex's pricing structure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   28. In 2013, Orbison became manager of Ma-Tex's recertification division-a role in which he had substantial contact with Ma-Tex's customers and vendors and in which he was intimately involved in pricing, logistics, tracking software, etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   29. Orbison worked with Ma-Tex's wireline recertification customers located throughout the United States, including the following states: Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Colorado, California, Kansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Mississippi, North Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Ohio, Wyoming, and West Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   30. Josh Tema and Robert Horton were the other primary employees working with Orbison in Ma-Tex's recertification division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   31. Orbison notified Ma-Tex around July 20, 2016 that he was quitting his employment with Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   33. Orbison's last day of employment with Ma-Tex was on August 12, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   36. Unbeknownst to Ma-Tex, Orbison began interviewing for a job with API in the spring of 2016 while still an employee of Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   37. Before becoming associated with Orbison in 2016, API was not in the wireline recertification business at all but wanted to get into that business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   39. During Orbison's last four months with Ma-Tex-beginning on April 6, 2016-Orbison and API's Vice President of Operations, David Alcorn (\"Alcorn\"), exchanged approximately 160 text messages and had approximately 22 phone calls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   40. Alcorn had the authority on behalf of API to hire Orbison and to communicate with Orbison between April and August 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   41. Orbison also communicated with API in this timeframe by email....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   42. API knew Orbison was employed by Ma-Tex in its recertification division and that API's new recertification division would be in competition with Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   43. In their communications, Orbison and Alcorn discussed (A) Orbison's Employment Agreement with Ma-Tex and its covenant not-to-compete; (B) the financial performance of Ma-Tex's recertification division; (C) API hiring additional Ma-Tex employees and their compensation; (D) equipment necessary to open a competing recertification division; (E) inventory orders with Ma-Tex vendors; and (F) soliciting Ma-Tex customers to move their business to API.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   44. Orbison also disclosed to API the concept of Ma-Tex's logistical/distribution\n   network and corresponding tracking software.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   45. Orbison had actual knowledge of his Employment Agreement with Ma-Tex and its post-employment restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   46. As early as April 27, 2016, and no later than June 7, 2016, API had knowledge of facts from which a reasonable person would conclude that Orbison had an employment agreement with Ma-Tex that contained post-employment restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   47. As early as June 7, 2016, and no later than August 24, 2016, API had actual knowledge of Orbison's Employment Agreement with Ma-Tex and its post-employment restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   51. API was familiar with covenants not-to-compete from its recent involvement in a lawsuit in which API was accused of hiring two employees who had covenants not-to-compete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   52. Before leaving Ma-Tex's employment, Orbison solicited Ma-Tex's recertification customers in an effort to move their recertification business to API.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   53. Before and after leaving Ma-Tex's employment, Orbison solicited other Ma-Tex employees (Josh Tema and Robert Horton) to leave Ma-Tex and go work for API.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   54. Before leaving Ma-Tex's employment, Orbison assisted API in preparing to open its new recertification division, which would compete with Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   55. API knew Orbison was performing tasks to benefit API while he was still employed by Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   56. API hired Orbison as the manager of its new recertification division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   57. API also hired Josh Tema and Robert Horton to work in its new recertification division, with knowledge that Tema and Horton were then working for Ma-Tex in its recertification division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   59. Orbison's first official day of employment with API was August 15, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   60. On August 16, 2016, after resigning his employment and turning in his Ma-Tex iPhone, Orbison accessed his personal iCloud account, downloaded the customer contacts from his Ma-Tex iPhone, and transferred those contacts to a non-Ma-Tex device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   61. Beginning on August 16, 2016, being employed by API, Orbison sent dozens of solicitation emails to Ma-Tex's customers-including its top 20 customers-in an effort to secure their recertification business for API.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   62. API authorized Orbison to send these solicitation emails, and the emails were sent from an API email account on its server.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   63. The customers that Orbison solicited were the same customers he learned of and interacted with while employed by Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   64. Orbison's solicitation emails included \"discounted\" price lists in the same format as the price lists Orbison used as manager of Ma-Tex's recertification division; API prices were consistently discounted by 20-25% off Ma-Tex pricing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   65. Orbison used the customer contacts and pricing information he obtained while working for Ma-Tex to solicit business for API.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   66. API admits it established pricing for wireline recertification services in\n   a group effort with Orbison, who provided feedback to API.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   67. Orbison's solicitations resulted in two recertification orders for API: one with Halliburton Pinnacle of Houston, Texas (\"Halliburton Pinnacle\") for $2,455 and one with Arklatex Energy Services of Broussard, Louisiana (\"Arklatex\") for $885.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   68. API completed these two recertification jobs on August 31, 2016 and invoiced Halliburton and Arklatex, respectively, on September 21, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   69. Orbison was introduced to Halliburton Pinnacle and Arklatex by Ma-Tex and Orbison dealt with these two customers while working for Ma-Tex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   74. API admits that it would take a while, approximately three to five years, to establish a wireline recertification division in the marketplace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   75. By consulting with and hiring Orbison, and using his knowledge and customer and vendor contacts, API was able to establish its wireline recertification division in approximately four months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   76. After receiving Ma-Tex's cease and desist letter with a copy of Orbison's Employment Agreement and its post-employment restrictions, API and Orbison did the following: performed two recertification jobs (Halliburton Pinnacle and Arklatex); hired Josh Tema away from Ma-Tex; and continued to solicit recertification business from Halliburton and Schlumberger, two of Ma-Tex's largest customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   77. After the Court issued its Temporary Restraining Order, API and Orbison continued to solicit wireline recertification business from Halliburton, one of Ma-Tex's largest customers, and also sought to collect payment for the two recertification jobs API had already performed for Halliburton Pinnacle and Arklatex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   78. Between April 11, 2016 and August 12, 2016, Ma-Tex paid Orbison $18,661.50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   80.

They argue that, since the trial court forfeited 10% of the salary Orbison received during this time, the lack of evidence as to how much time he spent assisting API should defeat the forfeiture.

Factors to be considered in whether to impose a forfeiture remedy, and its amount, include: \"[t]he gravity and timing of the breach of duty, the level of intent or fault, whether the principal received any benefit from the fiduciary despite the breach, the centrality of the breach to the scope of the fiduciary relationship, ... any threatened or actual harm to the principal, .... [and] the adequacy of other remedies.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 875. In this case, the unchallenged findings of the trial court show that Orbison's breach involved the misappropriation of Ma-Tex's trade secrets, the use of confidential information to solicit Ma-Tex's customer, the solicitation of two other employees who were key to its recertification division, and the assistance to API in setting up its recertification shop. They also show that Orbison actively sought to assist API to compete with Ma-Tex for four months before he left Ma-Tex's employ. These findings show that the trial court appropriately considered the factors set forth in\n    <em>\n     Swinnea\n    </em>\n    in fashioning the amount of the forfeiture and did not base the amount solely on the finding challenged by Appellants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    Appellants also challenge the basis for the permanent injunction and API being prohibited from interfering with the employment agreement. However, their sole argument in support of these complaints is that, since Orbison terminated the employment agreement, he was no longer bound by its post-employment restrictions. For the reasons stated in section (6), below, we find that Appellants failed to preserve this argument. In addition, as discussed above, the trial court made unchallenged findings that Orbison and API misappropriated Ma-Tex's trade secrets and that Orbison breached its fiduciary duties to Ma-Tex by soliciting Ma-Tex's customers and disclosing and using Ma-Tex's confidential information and trade secrets. The trial court also made an unchallenged finding that, without the permanent injunction, Ma-Tex would suffer imminent harm and irreparable injury in the form of lost profits, customers, and good will. These provide an additional basis for the permanent injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Braxton v.
