In support of their claim, Appellants expressly relied upon the supreme court's\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   opinion, asserting that\n   the holding in\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   authorized them to bring their\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim as a direct action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Team also argued in its motion that because Appellants'\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim was filed after article 4590i was repealed and replaced by civil practice and remedies code chapter 73 in 2003, there could be no\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   liability against the insurers beyond the amount of the capped damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court dismissed Appellants' claims against Truck and Team for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after granting Truck's plea to the jurisdiction and granting in part Team's summary judgment motion \"to the extent that the motion was based upon Plaintiffs' lack of standing to pursue a direct statutory\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   cause of action against Team Health, Inc.\" In its order, the trial court stated that in light of its ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   lawsuit due to Appellants' lack of standing, it expressly made no ruling on any of the other grounds for summary judgment in Appellees' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Specifically, Truck argued that a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   action may be brought by a judgment creditor only after a turnover proceeding or a valid assignment and that otherwise, the judgment creditor lacks standing to sue the insurer because there is no tort duty of an insurer to a third party, relying on\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Accordingly, Truck claimed, because Appellants lacked either a turnover order or an assignment from Yagnik, they had no standing to bring a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   action,\n   <em>\n    Bramlett I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   notwithstanding. Truck further argued that to the extent that Appellants could bring a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim via the principles of equitable subrogation, Yagnik's claim could not be pursued because the excess judgment against him had been paid upon becoming final in 2014 and Yagnik had released Truck from any claims he might\n   have had against Truck, leaving nothing to subrogate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Team likewise argued that absent an assignment from Yagnik or a turnover order, Appellants could not \"otherwise establish standing to bring a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   action against\" it. Team also argued that because Appellants did not file their current action until January 26, 2016, and because that action was wholly separate and apart from their underlying claim, Appellants were barred by civil practice and remedies code section 74.303(d) from pursuing any excess liability beyond the statutory cap applicable to Yagnik. Thus, according to Team, Appellants' judgment had been satisfied such that Appellants had no damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Appellants filed a joint response to Truck and Team's motions in which they acknowledged that they had no turnover order or assignment from Yagnik but asserted that they had brought their action as a direct statutory\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim against the insurers pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bramlett I.\n   </em>\n   Appellants argued that Truck entered a settlement agreement with Yagnik \"in an attempt to circumvent\" Appellants' right to recovery, pointing out that if Yagnik had no\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim, then the release he signed with his insurers would fail for lack of consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellants also argued that this situation is why the\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   court said that the direct claim was\n   <em>\n    akin\n   </em>\n   to equitable subrogation-not that it actually\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   an equitable subrogation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303330\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/288/876/\">\n    288 S.W.3d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Similarly, the Stowers exception to the cap is\n   <em>\n    like\n   </em>\n   this right to equitable subrogation.

Appellants stated, \"It beggars belief to think the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   [in 2009] in a way giving rise to a claim, but that it did not observe such a claim could never be brought because it would be precluded by the 2003 repeal of the MLIIA,\" particularly since a claimant cannot determine whether a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   case exists until a jury verdict is rendered.

According to Appellants, the 2003 statute governs only health care liability claims, not\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claims, that are filed after September 1, 2003. And they contended that they had been damaged \"the entire amount of the verdict against the insured that ha[d] not already been paid, plus interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Team replied that the plain language of the 2003 enabling statute encompassed Appellants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   claim because the statute applies to an \"action,\" not just a \"health care liability claim,\" essentially overruling the supreme court's 2009 holding in\n   <em>\n    Phillips I\n   </em>\n   for actions filed after September 1, 2003. Team further argued that Appellants should have brought their\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim in the underlying action by adding Team to the case once the trial court entered a judgment applying the healthcare liability caps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In their third and fourth issues, Appellants argue that their claims are not capped by the 2003 statute because that statute is a replacement, not an amendment, that the 2003 statute has no effect on claims that are not brought under the common law\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   doctrine, and that they are therefore entitled to money damages for the difference between the capped judgment and the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Truck responds that the trial court properly granted its plea to the jurisdiction because Appellants have no statutory standing under former article 4590i, section 11.02(c), to bring a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   action directly against Truck for amounts in excess of a judgment that was fully paid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bramlett v.
