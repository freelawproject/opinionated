PALAFOX, Justice\n   The underlying case involves a suit by a grandparent, M.G., for possession or access to the grandchild. Relator, J.M.G., has filed a mandamus petition against the Honorable Mike Herrera, Judge of the 383rd District Court of El Paso County, Texas, to challenge his order denying Relator's plea to the jurisdiction. We conditionally grant mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Relator and F.J.G., Jr. (Father) are the parents of two children, I.A.G., and F.A.G. Father is in jail awaiting trial on charges of indecency with one of his children by sexual contact. M.G. is the paternal grandmother of the children. On September 27, 2017, Grandmother filed a petition to modify requesting grandparent access and possession pursuant to Texas Family Code \u00a7 153.432(c). The petition to modify was not supported by affidavit as required by the Family Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.432(c) (West 2014). The associate judge denied Grandmother's petition to modify, and Grandmother requested a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Relator filed a plea to the jurisdiction seeking dismissal of the petition to modify because Grandmother had not attached the required affidavit. In response to the plea, Grandmother filed an amended petition which included an affidavit alleging that denying her possession of and access to the children \"would significantly impair the children's physical health and emotional well being....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the beginning of the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing, Relator argued that the suit should be dismissed because the allegations in Grandmother's affidavit, even if true, were not sufficient to establish standing to seeking possession or access. Grandmother argued that Relator had waived this complaint because the plea to the jurisdiction was limited to a complaint that no affidavit had been filed at all, and Relator was required to amend her plea to the jurisdiction in order to challenge the sufficiency of the affidavit. Relator responded that she was not required to amend the plea because it encompassed a complaint that Grandmother had failed to file an affidavit which made the necessary statutory showing. The trial court denied the plea to the jurisdiction and proceeded to hear the merits of Grandmother's petition to modify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Grandmother testified consistently with her affidavit, stating that her son lived with her from 2009 to June 2016 and she had access to the children during his periods of standard visitation, namely, every other weekend, spring break, thirty days in the summer, and holidays. Grandmother picked up the children from school during the periods of visitation and she returned them to Relator at the conclusion of visitation. She described her relationship with the children as \"very good\". Since Father has been in jail, Relator has not allowed\n   Grandmother access to the children, but the children have contacted her by telephone and text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relator testified that the children had a close relationship with Grandmother, but she stopped allowing Grandmother to have contact with the children after her daughter made an outcry that she was sexually assaulted by Father and his brother at Grandmother's home. Relator explained that she did not believe her children would be safe because Grandmother did not believe the child's sexual abuse allegations and she was asking Relator to drop the charges. Relator also testified that Grandmother never asked her how the children were doing and her only concern was the criminal cases against her sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated it would consider allowing Grandmother to have supervised visitation with the children, but only if the children wanted to see her. The court set the case for a conference with the children for March 9, 2018. On February 14, 2018, the trial court signed an order denying the plea to the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Relator filed a mandamus petition to challenge the order denying her plea to the jurisdiction. We granted Relator's motion to stay proceedings in the trial court pending our review of the mandamus petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    GRANDPARENT ACCESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In her sole issue, Relator contends that the trial court was required to dismiss Grandmother's suit for lack of standing because the facts alleged in Grandmother's affidavit, even if true, do not demonstrate that a denial of access or possession would significantly impair the children's physical health or emotional well-being as required by Section 153.432(c) of the Family Code. Alternatively, Relator argues that, even if the trial court was authorized to conduct the hearing on the merits, the evidence presented did not show significant impairment of the children's physical health or emotional well-being, and therefore, the trial court should have dismissed the suit rather than setting the matter for a conference with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Mandamus Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Generally, mandamus relief is appropriate only to correct a clear abuse of discretion or to compel the performance of a ministerial duty, and where the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319355\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/360/#p364\">\n    341 S.W.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (Tex. 2011) (orig. proceeding);\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Insurance Company of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146465\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/148/124/#p135\">\n    148 S.W.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-36 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding).

Assuming these facts are true, the affidavit nevertheless fails to rebut the presumption that Relator is acting in the children's best interest because it does not support a conclusion that denial of access or possession by Grandmother would\n   <em>\n    significantly impair\n   </em>\n   the children's physical health or emotional well-being. In fact, the affidavit does not allege any facts pertaining either directly or indirectly to the grandchildren's physical or emotional well-being and there is nothing to show that the children are suffering any impairment much less significant impairment. The trial court clearly abused its discretion by failing to dismiss Grandmother's suit for lack of jurisdiction and proceeding to hear the petition on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Scheller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322121\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/640/#p643\">\n    325 S.W.3d at 643-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (maternal grandfather failed to establish that denial of access to his grandchildren would significantly impair grandchildren's physical health or emotional well-being; evidence that grandchildren experienced anger and nightmares following their mother's death did not establish anything more substantial than grandchildren's understandable sadness resulting from losing a family member and missing their grandparents). We sustain Relator's sole issue and conditionally grant mandamus relief. The trial court is directed to vacate the order denying Relator's plea to the jurisdiction and to dismiss Grandmother's suit for possession or access. The writ of mandamus will issue only if the trial court fails to act in accordance with our opinion and judgment.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
