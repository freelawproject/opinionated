Alvarez, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a negligence suit with a\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   instruction in the jury charge. After Appellant Discount Tire Company of Texas, Inc. rotated the tires on a pickup truck, a tire detached and struck Appellee Federico Vargas Cabanas's vehicle. Cabanas sued for his injuries. The jury found Discount Tire negligent, and it awarded damages to Cabanas. Because the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   does not apply and there was no evidence of breach, we reverse the portion of the trial court's judgment in favor of Cabanas and render judgment that Cabanas take nothing on his claims against Discount Tire. We affirm the remainder of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tommy Ebarb owned a pickup truck. He upgraded it with custom lift, wheels, and tires. He took his seven-year-old pickup truck, with approximately 171,850 miles\n   on it, to Discount Tire. Discount Tire rotated the tires on Ebarb's pickup truck about 1:00 pm on a Friday. Ebarb drove his truck a few miles on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sunday evening, as he was driving on a highway, Ebarb's truck's left front wheel detached, struck Cabanas's vehicle, and injured Cabanas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cabanas complained of back pain and was taken to the hospital for evaluation. Following the accident, Cabanas underwent several surgeries and incurred some medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cabanas's wife, Xochitl Contreras, acting both individually and as next friend of their daughter Clara Vargas Contreras, and Cabanas sued Ebarb and Discount Tire for injuries allegedly caused by the defendants' negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the plaintiffs rested, Ebarb and Discount Tire moved for directed verdicts. The trial court granted Ebarb's motion, but denied Discount Tire's motion. The trial proceeded, and the trial court held a charge conference. Discount Tire objected to the\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   instruction in the charge, but the trial court overruled the objection. The jury found Discount Tire negligent, and awarded Cabanas damages-primarily for past medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Discount Tire raises three issues on appeal: (1) there is no evidence to support the jury's negligence finding, (2) the trial court erred by submitting a circumstantial evidence and a\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   instruction in the charge, and (3) the trial court erred by denying Discount Tire's request to put on evidence of the medical expenses Cabanas actually paid and incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For a legal sufficiency review, \"the court must consider evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Keller v.

If\n   <em>\n    res ipsa\n   </em>\n   applies, it would serve as some evidence of Discount Tire's breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobil Chem. Co. v.

Harrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509507\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/70/778/#p782\">\n    70 S.W.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 782 (Tex. 2001). Discount Tire agreed it had a responsibility to properly service Ebarb's truck's tires; it did not challenge the element of duty. The disputed elements are breach and proximate cause. We first address the evidence pertaining to breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    1. Garrett Puckorius-Service Technician\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Discount Tire called Garrett Puckorius; he was the service technician who was responsible to tighten and torque the lug nuts on Ebarb's truck. Puckorius testified to the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   He started working for Discount Tire in June 2011. He works on as many as 100 vehicles per day, and he had no specific recollections of working on Ebarb's truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   He testified repeatedly that he always follows the proper procedures to remove, inspect, and reinstall the tires. For a four-wheeled vehicle, he installs the tires on the passenger side of the vehicle, and the first\n   service technician installs the tires on the driver's side. After the first service technician installs the driver's side tires, Puckorius follows up and tightens the driver's side left tires' lug nuts twice more. He never deviates from the procedure; he uses the same procedure for every vehicle every time. He has never been reprimanded or cited for not doing his job correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   He knows he tightened and torqued the lug nuts on Ebarb's truck because the service invoice for Ebarb's truck has his initials on it, and he would not have initialed the invoice unless he performed the proper procedures for rotating the tires-including properly tightening and torqueing the lug nuts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Passport book (the procedures book) calls for two service technicians, one crew chief, and one service coordinator to rotate tires, but the team that day only had three people: two technicians and a service coordinator. The Passport book identifies a four-man crew. It does not require a four-man crew, but it does not expressly authorize a three-man crew. For Ebarb's truck they used a three-man crew. Puckorius acknowledged that if a crew did not follow the procedures, and a wheel's lug nuts were not properly tightened, a wheel could come off, but he does not know why Ebarb's truck's wheel came off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    2. Jesse Kubica-Assistant Vice President\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Cabanas called Jesse Kubica, who testified to the following facts. He began his 30-year career at Discount Tire as a service technician, and he worked his way up to Assistant Vice President for the San Antonio Region of Discount Tire of Texas, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Passport book identifies the roles required to perform tire rotations: two service technicians, one crew chief, and one service coordinator, but these are roles not individuals. One individual can, and regularly does, perform more than one role. Further, a crew chief may work on two vehicles at the same time; when he does, his time is divided between the two vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When Ebarb's truck's tires were rotated, Josh Pate was serving as both the crew chief and the service coordinator. The crew chief does not physically remove or install tires-only the service technicians do that. Discount Tire's procedures do not require a separate person to verify that the second service technician retightened and torqued the lug nuts that the first service technician tightened. When Pate initialed the service invoice, his initials indicated he properly supervised the job and the lug nuts on Ebarb's truck were tightened and torqued properly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With respect to vehicle defects, Kubica testified that Discount Tire's service technicians are competent to do visual inspections of tires, wheels, hub assembly studs, and lug nuts. There were no defects noted on Ebarb's service invoice. Kubica acknowledged that if there were no other defects in a wheel assembly, and if the lug nuts were properly tightened, a wheel would not normally come off, but he did not know why Ebarb's truck's wheel came off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    3. Tommy Ebarb-Truck Owner\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Tommy Ebarb, who now lives out of state, testified by a video recorded deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   He upgraded his seven-year-old pickup truck with aftermarket lift, wheels, and tires. He had his truck's tires rotated by Discount Tire. After they rotated his tires, they did not tell him there was anything wrong with his wheels or tires. He looked over his truck right after Discount Tire finished rotating his tires, and he didn't see anything wrong, but he didn't check\n   the torque on the lug nuts. He didn't have anyone else work on his truck after Discount Tire rotated his tires, and he didn't work on his truck either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   From Friday afternoon to Sunday evening, he drove around San Marcos, but not very much. When he drove his truck, he did not notice anything wrong; it was running fine. There was no wobble or other indication of trouble until the moment his wheel detached. After the accident, he noticed there were no lug nuts on the wheel studs. When he later saw the photograph of the studs on the wheel hub, he opined that the studs \"don't look good.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   He acknowledged that if Discount Tire had not properly tightened the lug nuts, that could have caused his wheel to come off, and he reported that to the officer who investigated the accident. He did not know of anyone trying to take or steal anything from his truck. But he suggested that another reasonable cause for the wheel to come off was that someone tried to steal the tire and they took the lug nuts off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    4. Trooper Eder Valera\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Trooper Eder Valera was the responding officer at the scene of the accident. He testified by video deposition to the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As a trooper, he was not trained in accident reconstruction, but was trained in \"basic crash investigation.\" His investigation included interviewing the drivers, trying to figure out what happened, and what caused the accident. He considers weather conditions, road conditions, and vehicle speeds; and he asks the drivers if there are any defects to the vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   He investigated the accident involving Ebarb's and Cabanas's vehicles. He found the left front wheel came off Ebarb's truck and struck Cabanas's truck. Ebarb told him he (Ebarb) had just gotten new tires on his truck. Valera opined that if a wheel had improperly tightened lug nuts, the lug nuts could vibrate and come loose. He did not find the wheel or the lug nuts, and he did not inspect the left wheel hub assembly on Ebarb's truck. He noted that if there was a need for accident reconstruction, such as for a fatal accident, an accident reconstruction team is called. But he did not try to determine why the wheel detached, and he had no idea why it came off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Evidence of Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Discount Tire acknowledged it had a duty of care in servicing Ebarb's truck, and Cabanas argued the jury could find from the evidence that Discount Tire was negligent and its negligence proximately caused the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    1. Cabanas's Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At trial, Cabanas argued that there were only two ways the wheel could have come off: a defect or improperly tightened lug nuts. Because Discount Tire had inspected the wheel and found no defects, the only remaining possibility was that Discount Tire did not tighten the lug nuts properly. Cabanas contended the jury could infer from the evidence and the accident that Discount Tire failed to tighten and torque the lug nuts properly, it breached its duty, and its breach was the proximate cause of Cabanas's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    2. No Direct Evidence of Breach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The only direct evidence of whether Discount Tire properly tightened and torqued the tires was Puckorius's testimony and the service invoice. Puckorius testified he always followed the same proper procedure, and his signature on the service invoice indicated he properly tightened and torqued the lug nuts on Ebarb's truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's finding, we nevertheless conclude it is no evidence of Discount Tire's alleged breach.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Freedom Newspapers of Tex. v.

Circumstantial Evidence of Breach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Cabanas also argued that the circumstantial evidence-a three-man crew instead of a four-man crew and the accident itself-was evidence that Discount Tire failed to tighten and torque the lug nuts properly. But Cabanas produced no evidence that the service coordinator (Pate) was not actually watching Puckorius work. Cabanas asserted that Pate's time was divided, but Cabanas produced no evidence that Pate did not properly supervise Puckorius's work or that Puckorius did not properly tighten and torque the lug nuts.

During the fifty-five hours after Discount Tire rotated the tires and before the accident, Ebarb had control over his truck, drove it, and parked it in places accessible to the public. Because Discount Tire, Ebarb, or an unknown party could be responsible for the wheel detachment,\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    res ipsa\n   </em>\n   does not apply, the doctrine did not supply some evidence of breach, and the jury's negligence finding was susceptible to Discount Tire's no-evidence challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Discount Tire asserted there was no evidence of breach, and we agree. Assuming\n   without deciding that Discount Tire's Passport book established the standard of care,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discount Tire's personnel testified that they followed their written procedures, and the service invoice supported their testimony; this evidence negated Discount Tire's breach. In response, Cabanas produced no controverting evidence or any other evidence of breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Given no evidence of breach, the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the jury's negligence finding, and the trial court erred by awarding damages. Because we will reverse the award of damages, we need not address Discount Tire's complaint about the trial court excluding evidence of Cabanas's medical bills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We reverse the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding Cabanas damages and render judgment that Cabanas take nothing on his claims against Discount Tire.
