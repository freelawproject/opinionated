In this appeal, we must determine whether the TCPA applies to Cassandra J. Elkins, DDS's legal actions and, if so, whether Dr. Elkins established by clear and specific evidence each element challenged on appeal. As explained in this opinion, we affirm as to some legal actions, reverse and render a dismissal as to others, and remand for a determination of\n   attorney's fees and costs as to the dismissed legal actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1991, Robert James, DDS hired Dr. Elkins to work at his San Antonio-based pediatric dental practice, Robert B. James, DDS, Inc. (\"the Practice\"). Dr. James and Dr. Elkins signed a written employment contract providing the terms of Dr. Elkins's compensation. Dr. Elkins worked for the Practice for twenty-three years and, according to her, the Practice consistently paid her 30% of her gross production. Dr. James hoped that when he retired, Dr. Elkins would purchase the Practice. But when he offered to sell the Practice to Dr. Elkins, she declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. James had his wife, Jean James, investigate Dr. Elkins's payroll history, and Jean sought the help of the Practice's administrator, Alexis Mei Pyles. Dr. James informed Jean and Pyles that, under Dr. Elkins's employment contract, she should have been paid only 30% of net production, a calculation based on collections and not gross production. Jean and Pyles reviewed financial records for the prior three years and found Dr. Elkins was being paid 30% of gross production. Pyles prepared a Fraud Examination Report, concluding that Dr. Elkins misappropriated over $350,000. When Jean and Pyles informed Dr. James of their findings, Dr. James decided to terminate Dr. Elkins's employment. Thereafter, Jean and Pyles reported Dr. Elkins's alleged theft to the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD). During the SAPD's investigation, Dr. James, Jean, and Pyles each made statements to the SAPD alleging Dr. Elkins stole money from the Practice. The Practice also made an insurance claim based on Dr. Elkins's purported theft with its insurer, Travelers Casualty Insurance Company. Dr. Elkins was later indicted and arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dr. Elkins sued the Practice, Dr. James, Jean, and Pyles, alleging various causes of action against them. Her theories of liability included defamation, business disparagement, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy. The Practice, Dr. James, and Jean (collectively \"the James Appellants\") filed a partial motion to dismiss under the TCPA; Pyles filed a separate TCPA motion to dismiss. Dr. Elkins responded by producing her affidavit, records from the Practice, the Fraud Examination Report, the SAPD report, Dr. James's and Jean's written statements to the SAPD, and other documents. Dr. Elkins also filed a motion for continuance and for discovery, which the trial court denied. No party produced the employment contract, which had been lost over the years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After hearing the motions to dismiss, the trial court signed an order denying both motions without specifying the basis for its order. The James Appellants and Pyles filed a joint motion to reconsider, attaching additional evidence it alleged was newly discovered. In response, Dr. Elkins produced additional evidence to dispute the authenticity of the evidence attached to the joint motion. The trial court signed an order denying the joint motion, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW &amp; STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   If a legal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to a party's exercise of First Amendment rights listed in the TCPA, that party \"may file a motion to dismiss the legal action.\" TEX.

The TCPA exempts \"a legal action ... arising out of an insurance contract.\" \u00a7 27.010(d). The TCPA broadly defines a \"legal action,\" which can mean a \"lawsuit\" or a \"cause of action.\" \u00a7 27.001(6);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D Magazine Partners, L.P. v.

It is undisputed that this case involves the Practice's insurance policy with Travelers and Dr. Elkins has alleged causes of action. The only dispute about the insurance contract exemption is whether the alleged facts entitling Dr. Elkins to relief (i.e. her causes of action) are legal actions \"arising out of\" the insurance policy with Travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pyles's &amp; the James Appellants' Construction is Contrary to the TCPA's Text\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pyles and the James Appellants argue that Dr. Elkins's causes of action do not \"arise out of\" an insurance contract\n   because Dr. Elkins is not seeking a remedy provided for in the insurance policy, specifically insurance benefits, and her theories of liability sound in common-law torts, not in contract. These arguments are contrary to the TCPA's plain language in at least four ways. First, in the insurance contract exemption, the Legislature used the term \"legal action,\" which is defined as \"a lawsuit, cause of action, petition, complaint, cross-claim, or counterclaim or any other judicial pleading or filing that requests legal or equitable relief.\" \u00a7 27.001(6). The definition of \"legal action\" does not contain the term \"remedy.\" A \"cause of action\" consists of the operative facts entitling the plaintiff to the relief sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loaisiga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7118638\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/248/#p262\">\n    379 S.W.3d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relief sought is the \"remedy.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1320 (8th ed. 2006) (defining \"remedy\" as \"legal or equitable relief\"). Thus, under the insurance contract exemption, if the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     facts\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   comprising a cause of action arise out of an insurance contract, the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     remedy\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   requested need not arise out of the insurance contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 27.001(6), 27.010(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the insurance contract exemption in 27.010(d) contrasts with section 27.010(c), which exempts legal actions \"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     seeking recovery for\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   bodily injury, wrongful death, or survival.\" \u00a7 27.010(c) (emphasis added). The insurance contract exemption in section 27.010(d) does not exempt legal actions \"seeking recovery for benefits under\" an insurance contract. Similarly, the insurance contract exemption in 27.010(d) contrasts with other statutory provisions, such as the Texas Tort Claims Act, that refer to the nature of exempted claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.057(2) (exempting claims \"arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, or any other intentional tort\"). The insurance contract exemption simply contains no reference to the nature of the exempted claims. Thus, the plain language of section 27.010(d) exempts legal actions \"arising out of\" an insurance contract, regardless of whether the legal action is \"seeking recovery for benefits under\" an insurance contract and regardless of whether the nature of the claim sounds in tort or in contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.010(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Third, Pyles's and the James Appellants' argument suggests that the insurance contract exemption requires a legal action to be \"based on\" or \"brought under\" an insurance contract. But in the insurance contract exemption, the Legislature used the phrase \"arising out of.\" \u00a7 27.010(d). The qualifying phrase \"arising out of\" in the insurance contract exemption contrasts with other phrases in the TCPA the Legislature purposefully used to qualify the term \"legal action.\" In sections 27.003(a) and 27.005(b), the Legislature used the phrases \"relates to,\" \"based on,\" and \"in response to\" to qualify \"legal action.\" \u00a7\u00a7 27.003(a), 27.005(b). And in section 27.010(d), the Legislature used the phrase \"brought under\" the Insurance Code to qualify \"legal action.\" 27.010(d). The text of the TCPA as a whole demonstrates the Legislature knew how to use narrower qualifying phrases, and could have limited the insurance contract exemption to legal actions \"brought under\" or \"based on\" an insurance contract. Conversely, the Legislature declined to use a broader qualifying phrase like \"relates to.\" In the insurance contract exemption, the Legislature purposefully used the phrase \"arising out of\" and not \"based on,\" \"brought under,\" or \"relates to.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cadena Comercial USA Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12380798\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/518/318/#p325\">\n    518 S.W.3d at 325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Adopting Pyles's and the James Appellants' position would require us to legislate from the bench by judicially modifying the TCPA's text, which we may not do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castleman v. Internet Money Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-0437,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656459\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/684/#p687\">\n    546 S.W.3d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687-88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201975039\">\n    2018 WL 1975039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tex.

App.-Fort Worth 2009, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fourth, a narrow construction of \"arising out of\" in section 27.010(d)'s insurance contract exemption would conflict with how Texas courts have construed \"arise out of\" in section 27.010(b)'s commercial speech exemption. The commercial speech exemption provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (b) This chapter does not apply to a legal action brought against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services, if the statement or conduct\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     arises out of\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   the sale or lease of goods, services, or an insurance product, insurance services, or a commercial transaction in which the intended audience is an actual or potential buyer or customer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00a7 27.010(b) (emphasis added). Other courts of appeals have construed \"arises out of\" in section 27.010(b) as relating to the defendant's motives in making the actionable statement or engaging in the actionable conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newspaper Holdings, Inc. v. Crazy Hotel Assisted Living, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7331214\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/416/71/#p88\">\n    416 S.W.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88-89 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, pet. denied).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our sister courts have thus concluded the Legislature used \"arise out of\" in the TCPA broadly to include statements and conduct ancillary to a commercial transaction. They have not construed \"arising out of\" narrowly to mean a statement or conduct that is based on or that comprises the commercial transaction itself. Thus, Pyles's and the James Appellants' construction would require arbitrarily giving different meanings to the same phrase used in the same section of the same statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Plain Meanings of \"Arising Out Of\" and \"Insurance Contract\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the TCPA does not define the qualifying phrase \"arising out of,\" we are not without guidance. When a term is not statutorily defined, we typically look first to dictionary definitions to ascertain the term's plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    City of Richardson v. Oncor Elec. Delivery Co.

The plain meaning of \"arise\" is \"[t]o originate; to stem (from)\" or \"[t]o result (from).\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 115. The different definitions of \"arise\" could support applying different tests that the Supreme Court of Texas has articulated in different contexts. When construing insurance contracts, the supreme court \"has held that 'arise out of' means that there is simply a 'causal connection or relation,' which is interpreted to mean that there is but for causation, though not necessarily direct or proximate causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Utica Nat'l Ins.

And, as previously noted, our sister courts have construed \"arising out of\" in the TCPA's commercial speech exemption as requiring that we consider the defendant's motives.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Newspaper Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7331214\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/416/71/#p88\">\n    416 S.W.3d at 88-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The TCPA does not define \"insurance contract,\" but the plain meaning of the term undoubtedly includes an insurance policy or agreement that governs the legal rights of and relationship between an insurer and insured regarding insurance benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 814 (defining insurance, generally, as a contract in which one party promises to indemnify another against certain risks). We further note the Legislature's use of the term \"insurance contract,\" as used in the phrase \"a legal action ... arising out of an insurance contract,\" does not limit our consideration only to whether there is, or is not, an insurance contract. We are aware of no cognizable cause of action for the mere existence of an insurance contract. Other facts (e.g., facts showing a breach or fraud), in addition to the insurance contract, are necessary to allege a cognizable cause of action involving an insurance contract. When considering whether a legal action \"aris[es] out of an insurance contract,\" we therefore must consider not only the insurance contract, but also other alleged facts involving the insurance contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loaisiga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7118638\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/248/#p262\">\n    379 S.W.3d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining a \"cause of action\" means the underlying facts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, the TCPA's text indicates the Legislature did not intend \"arising out of\" in the insurance contract exemption to be as broad as \"relates to.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.010(d),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 27.003(a), 27.005(b). Thus, \"arising out of\" in the insurance contract exemption requires something more than the mere presence of an insurance contract or a cause of action merely having any relationship to an insurance contract. But \"arising out of\" in the insurance contract exemption requires something less than a cause of action being \"based on\" or \"brought under,\" \"seeking benefits under,\" or \"seeking recovery for breach of\" an insurance contract. Consistent with how the supreme court and our sister courts have construed \"arising out of\" in various contexts, we construe \"arising out of an insurance contract\" as requiring that the insurance contract be a \"but-for\" or motivating cause of the alleged facts entitling the plaintiff to relief, or that the alleged facts entitling the plaintiff to relief have a nexus to or originate in a contractual relationship between an insurer and an insured for insurance benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Our construction is consistent with the obvious purpose of the 2013 amendments to the TCPA, which was to exempt from the TCPA's dismissal procedure more legal actions directly involving the business of insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fort Worth Transp.

In 2013, the Legislature broadened the TCPA's exemptions for legal actions involving the business of insurance in two ways. First, the Legislature enlarged the commercial speech exemption to cover more legal actions related to the business of insurance. H.B. 2935, 83rd Leg. (Tex. 2013), at \u00a7 3 (expanding the commercial speech exemption to include \"insurance services\"). Second, in the 2013 amendments, the Legislature exempted from the TCPA two additional categories of legal actions: those \"brought under the Insurance Code\" and those \"arising out of an insurance contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201976712\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The TCPA's legislative history reinforces the textual indicia of the Legislature's intent to exempt\n   from the TCPA's dismissal procedure additional categories of legal actions directly involving the business of insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.010(d);\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802377\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/488/294/#p299\">\n    488 S.W.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating the best indication of legislative intent is the TCPA's text).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We now turn to applying these principles to Dr. Elkins's legal actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Pyles's TCPA motion sought dismissal of all of Dr. Elkins's causes of action against her. But the James Appellants' TCPA motion sought a dismissal of Dr. Elkins's causes of action only to the extent those legal actions involved their statements to the SAPD. In other words, the James Appellants have never posited that the insurance contract exemption does not apply to Dr. Elkins's causes of action involving the insurance claim. Moreover, the TCPA requires us \"to treat any claim by any party on an individual and separate basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Better Bus. Bureau of Metro. Dall., Inc. v.

We therefore address separately Dr. Elkins's causes of action involving the insurance claim and her causes of action involving appellants' statements to the SAPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093064\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/401/440/#p443\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Insurance Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We first consider Dr. Elkins's causes of action against Pyles that involve the insurance claim, which contained Pyles's Fraud Examination Report. According to Dr. Elkins's pleadings and evidence, Pyles prepared the Fraud Examination Report for the primary purpose of submitting the insurance claim. Pyles did not dispute Dr. Elkins's allegations and evidence. Instead, Pyles's motion states, \"The Practice is insured by Travelers and filed a claim with Travelers.\" Her affidavit states, \"Travelers was provided with a copy of the Fraud Examination Report,\" and \"Travelers ultimately paid the Practice on its insurance claim related to Dr. [Elkins]'s misappropriation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to the pleadings and evidence, Pyles would not have made the complained-of statements in the insurance claim if there were no insurance policy, and the insurance contract motivated Pyles's allegedly defamatory, disparaging, and damaging statements that Dr. Elkins committed fraud and theft. The insurance policy has a close nexus to the facts Dr.\n   Elkins alleges entitle her to relief; in addition to the insurance contract being a but for and motivating cause of the insurance claim, the complained-of statements to Travelers comprised the insurance claim that invoked an insured's legal rights under an insurance contract. The transaction was pursuant to the insurance policy, and the insurer-insured relationship was the context in which the complained-of statements were made. Thus, those statements originated in the relationship between an insured and insurer under a contract for insurance benefits. Furthermore, it would be nearly impossible for Dr. Elkins to explain her case to a jury without reference to the insurance policy, and she would be entitled to rely on the insurance policy as proof of her claims. The insurance policy provides a theory of the defendants' motives for publishing allegedly false statements; explains why those statements were made to Travelers; and explains Travelers' response of further investigating Dr. Elkins, which Dr. Elkins complains contributed to her damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This case can be contrasted with\n   <em>\n    Tervita, LLC v. Sutterfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818081\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/280/\">\n    482 S.W.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Dallas 2015, pet. denied). In\n   <em>\n    Tervita\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged his employer retaliated against him for filing a worker's compensation claim and made a false representation to him about what benefits were available to him under the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818081\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/280/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818081\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/280/\">\n    at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complained-of statement in\n   <em>\n    Tervita\n   </em>\n   did not originate in any communication between an insurer and insured under an insurance policy; the statement originated in the context of an employer-employee relationship and merely related to an insurance policy. Although Pyles relies on\n   <em>\n    Tervita\n   </em>\n   to support her position, the\n   <em>\n    Tervita\n   </em>\n   court did not define the phrase \"arising out of\" or state what test courts should apply to determine whether a legal action arises out of an insurance contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818081\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/280/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818081\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/280/\">\n    at 285-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Dr. Elkins's causes of action against Pyles involving the insurance claim are legal actions \"arising out of an insurance contract.\" \u00a7 27.010(d). We must therefore affirm the trial court's order as to Dr. Elkins's causes of action against Pyles involving the Fraud Examination Report and the insurance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    2. The SAPD Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Pyles and the James Appellants argue Dr. Elkins failed to prove their statements to the SAPD arose out of the insurance policy. We agree. Dr. Elkins pled in her response to the TCPA motions that the only reason Pyles and the James Appellants made statements to SAPD is because the insurance policy required them to do so. However, Dr. Elkins had the burden to establish the applicability of the insurance-contract exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tervita, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818081\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/280/\">\n    482 S.W.3d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She also produced an email from Jeff Barrish, the Practice's accountant, stating Dr. Elkins's compensation package provides \"she receives 30% ... of production.\" Dr. Elkins's evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to her, shows Dr. James falsely stated to SAPD that Dr. Elkins was to be paid only 30% of net production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20993093\">\n    2017 WL 993093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

Dr. Elkins produced no evidence that Jean or Pyles knew the terms of the employment contract.

As to ill will and intent to interfere with Dr. Elkins's economic interests, Dr. Elkins does not cite us to any evidence, and we have found no evidence in our independent review of the record, supporting an inference that Jean or Pyles had ill will toward her or intended to interfere with her economic interests by reporting the findings of the fraud investigation to the SAPD.

Her affidavit also does not identify any sales, trade, or other dealings lost because of Dr. James's statements to the SAPD.

In 1991, he hired Dr. Elkins, a licensed pediatric dentist, to work in his practice. The parties agree they signed a written contract (\"the Contract\"). Dr. Elkins alleges the terms of her employment required that, among other things, she be paid a percentage of her gross production. This allegation is disputed by Dr. James and the other appellants, who contend she was to be paid a percentage of her net production, i.e., a percentage of collections. To collect payment, Dr. Elkins would submit a commission-payment request based on her production. To allow her to submit the information, Dr. Elkins had access to the practice's receivables. After calculating her percentage of production, and subtracting expenses and prior payments, Dr. Elkins would submit her commission statement to the practice's payroll provider. Dr. James would then sign her paycheck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is undisputed that over the course of Dr. Elkins's employment, Dr. James increased her managerial responsibilities with the hope that Dr. Elkins would ultimately purchase the practice when he retired. In 2014, they began discussing that prospect. However, because there was a disagreement over the valuation of the practice, in November 2014, Dr. Elkins declined the proffered purchase. According to Dr. James, he then decided to market the practice to other potential purchasers. To that end, according to Dr. James, he asked his wife Jean James to begin organizing the practice's business records in\n   order to market it for sale. Jean claimed that when she began reviewing the books and records, she discovered Dr. Elkins had submitted and received payments based on gross production and had charged write-offs against Dr. James's production as opposed to her own. Jean brought these issues to Dr. James's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Dr. James claimed that thereafter, he instructed Jean and an administrator for the practice, Alexis Mei Pyles, to investigate Dr. Elkins's activities with regard to the practice's finances. However, Dr. Elkins alleged the purpose of the investigation was retaliatory and based on her refusal to purchase the practice. She claimed the goal of the investigation was to permit the practice to submit an insurance claim for employee theft to the practice's insurance carrier, Travelers Casualty Insurance Company of America, in hopes of procuring a payment \"in excess of $500,000.00.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   According to Jean and Pyles, they reviewed practice financial documents for a three-year period-from 2011 through 2014, and interviewed current and former employees as well as other relevant witnesses. They claimed their investigation showed Dr. Elkins had been overpaid by more than $300,000.00 during the 2011-2014 period because, among other financial misconduct, she had submitted payment requests based on a percentage of gross production as opposed to the contractually mandated net production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At Dr. James's behest, Pyles prepared a report summarizing the findings made by Pyles and Jean during their investigation. This report was entitled \"Fraud Examination Report\" (\"FRE\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Dr. James claimed that as a result of the investigative findings, he terminated Dr. Elkins in January 2015. The practice submitted a claim to Travelers, which included a copy of the FRE. Travelers paid the practice $25,000.00-policy limits. In addition, Dr. James authorized Jean and Pyles to contact the San Antonio Police Department (\"SAPD\") about the alleged financial improprieties; Dr. Elkins claimed \"upon information and belief\" that Travelers required the matter be reported to law enforcement. SAPD prepared a police report. Dr. James, Jean, and Pyles provided written statements to SAPD. The record also shows Jean spoke with representatives from the Bexar County District Attorney's Office, urging that Dr. Elkins be prosecuted. Ultimately, Dr. Elkins was indicted in November 2016 for two counts of misapplication of fiduciary property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In January 2017, and as is relevant to this appeal, Dr. Elkins sued the practice, Dr. James, Jean, and Pyles for defamation, business disparagement, intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"), and conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Elkins's claims were\n   based on statements made in the FRE report and to SAPD and Travelers regarding Dr. Elkins's alleged malfeasance. In total, Dr. Elkins sought compensatory damages of more than $11,000,000.00 and punitive damages of almost $35,000,000.00. In response to the lawsuit, Dr. James, Jean, and the practice filed a partial motion to dismiss pursuant to section 27.003 of the TCPA in which they sought dismissal of Dr. Elkins's claims for defamation, business disparagement, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.003(a) (West 2015). Pyles filed a separate motion to dismiss under the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204208115\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She too sought to dismiss the claims for defamation, business disparagement, IIED, as well as conspiracy-the only claims lodged against her. In both motions, the parties alleged Dr. Elkins's claims should be dismissed because they fell within the TCPA, and Dr. Elkins had failed to produce clear and specific evidence on the elements of her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   After Dr. Elkins filed a response to the motions, the trial court held a hearing. Thereafter, the trial court denied both motions to dismiss. James and Pyles asked the trial court to reconsider based on newly discovered evidence-specifically the previously misplaced employment contract between the practice and Dr. Elkins. According to the movants, the Contract was discovered when the dentist who ultimately purchased the practice in May 2015 was cleaning out items left behind by Dr. James. In response, Dr. Elkins alleged the contract was a forgery. The trial court denied the motion to reconsider. James perfected an appeal, as did Pyles.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204208115\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 51.014(a)(12) (West Supp. 2017) (permitting interlocutory appeals from orders denying motions to dismiss filed under the TCPA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On appeal, James and Pyles contend the trial court erred in denying their motions to dismiss. They argue the trial court should have granted their motions because: (1) the claims asserted by Dr. Elkins fall within the TCPA; and (2) Dr. Elkins failed to produce clear and specific evidence establishing a prima facie case on the elements of her claims.

This is insufficient to establish actual malice. The financial records for 2011-2014-the records relied on by James and Pyles-showed payments to Dr. Elkins based on gross production. The Contract defined \"production\" as the fee charged for the service by the practice. Per the terms of the Ccontract, Dr. Elkins was to be paid \"production at a reduced rate\" for any procedures she did that were subject to a \"reduced rate for whatever reason.\" James and Pyles certainly could have interpreted this to mean net production. Dr. Elkins claimed her signature on the Contract produced by James and Pyles was a forgery, but she did not produce any evidence James and Pyles knew or should have known it was a forgery.

It is undisputed they reviewed four years of financial documents and interviewed numerous witnesses inside and outside the practice. Dr. James advised both Jean and Pyles when they came to him that Dr. Elkins was to be paid based on net production, and Jean and Pyles relied on that statement. Even if Dr. James's statement was false, there is no evidence the aged dentist knew it was false-and the Contract belies this, and there was no reason for Jean and Pyles not to rely on his statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DR Partners v.

Moreover, such a holding would be contrary to the TCPA. The issue is whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case by clear and specific evidence with regard to each element of her claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM.

A plaintiff could possibly meet her burden based on her petition and any evidence attached\n   thereto. Thus, I would decline to hold that failing to address a claim in a response to a motion to dismiss under the TCPA automatically results in waiver of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Pyles also contends Dr. Elkins's conspiracy claim was subject to dismissal because she failed to provide clear and specific evidence there was a meeting of the minds between James and Pyles to make false statements about Dr. Elkins. As set out above, a conspiracy requires a specific intent to agree to do something unlawful or to do something lawful in an unlawful way.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374635\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/214/#p222\">\n    514 S.W.3d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Assuming all of the statements made by James and Pyles about Dr. Elkins were false, there is no evidence of any specific intent to agree to make or report those false statements in an effort to injure Dr. Elkins. In her brief, Dr. Elkins relies on the lack of a complete investigation-failure to review of all the payroll records from 1991 through 2014-to establish an agreement to assert false statements. At best this evidence shows an agreement to conduct a limited investigation. A limited or deficient investigation is not clear and specific evidence-direct or circumstantial-of an agreement to make and publish false statements. Accordingly, I believe Dr. Elkins failed to provide clear and specific evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case that there was a meeting of the minds by Dr. James, Jean, Pyles, or any combination of the three, to make and report false statements about her. Thus, for this additional reason, the trial court erred in denying the Pyles's motion to dismiss with regard to the conspiracy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion for Discovery and Motion for Continuance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   As to Dr. Elkins's contention that the trial court erred in denying her motion for discovery and motion for continuance, she argues that if for any reason this court holds the trial court erred in denying the motions to dismiss, we should further hold the trial court erred in denying her motions for discovery and continuance. She contends the denial of these motions deprived her of access to evidence in possession of James, Pyles, and Travelers that was relevant to the motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374635\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/214/#p222\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.006(b) (stating that on motion by party or on court's own motion and on showing of good cause, court may allow specified and limited discovery relevant to motion to dismiss).

James, DDS, Inc., A Texas Corporation, Robert B. James, DDS, Individually, Jean James, Individually. When these appellants are referenced individually, I refer to them as \"the practice,\" \"Dr. James,\" and \"Jean.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    In the report, Pyles stated that not only had Dr. Elkins committed payroll fraud for a minimum of three years in the sum of more than $300,000.00, she had also: (1) breached her confidentiality agreement with the practice by making unauthorized copies of documents, removing financial information, and discussing practice information with individuals outside of the practice; (2) attempted to lure a practice dentist and other practice employees away from the practice; (3) committed theft of petty cash of at least $18,000.00; (4) removed practice documents from the building: (5) tampered with and changed a password to a practice video camera; and (6) added her name to Dr. James's personal credit card without his permission and purchased items with the card that were not for the practice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    Dr. Elkins also asserted claims for breach of contract against the practice, and negligent misrepresentation against the practice and Dr. James.

I believe the motion includes Elkins's claims based on the report to Travelers. For example, in the motion, James states the \"investigative findings\" were relayed not only to law enforcement authorities, but to Travelers. The motion references the insurance claim submitted to Travelers and its conclusion that a covered loss had occurred. In addition, the motion states the conduct complained of by Elkins \"is the report to SAPD, discussions with state prosecutors,\n    <em>\n     and the filing of an insurance claim.\n    </em>\n    \" Thus, James recognized Elkins's claims were based on both the report to SAPD and the FRE and sought relief under the TCPA based on both.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    James and Pyles alternatively argue the statements relied upon by Dr. Elkins in support of her claims are likewise subject to the TCPA based on the exercise of the right to petition and right to association.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027.001\">\n     Tex.
