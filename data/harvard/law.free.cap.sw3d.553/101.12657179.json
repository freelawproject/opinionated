The trial court not only appointed Father as sole managing conservator but also restricted Mother's access to E.D. to six supervised hours of visitation each month. Though the trial court record before us is replete with errors, we are nevertheless hamstrung by applicable legal rules and principles to dismiss this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 17, 2015, Father petitioned to modify the August 2014 order and sought appointment as a joint managing conservator and the imposition of a standard possession order.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20153.132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 156.101 (West 2014). On February 29, 2016, Father filed a \"Motion for Substituted Service\" alleging that his attempts to personally serve Mother at her last known address had been unsuccessful and requesting the trial court to permit alternate service under rule 106(b) by delivering the citation and petition to the maternal grandfather.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(b) (authorizing the trial court to allow alternate means of service). According to his attached affidavit, process server Matt Pruitt averred that he had made three unsuccessful attempts to personally serve Mother but had also spoken to the maternal grandfather, who had assured Pruitt that if he was served with the citation, he would deliver it to Mother. Although the motion did not comply with the requisites of rule 106(b) -by failing to state the location of Mother's \"usual place of business or usual place of abode or other place where [she could] probably be found\"-the trial court nonetheless signed an \"Order for Substituted Service\" granting the motion and ordering the citation to be served by delivering it to the maternal grandfather.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Furthermore, the trial court's signature on the order granting substituted service is curiously dated February 23, 2016, even though the motion for substituted service was not filed until almost a week later, on February 29. And, although the order is dated February 23, it bears a filemark of February 29 and a time stamp of 9:35 a.m., exactly one minute after the motion's time stamp of 9:34 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 29, 2016, the trial court entered an order finding that Mother, \"although duly and properly cited, did not appear and wholly made default\" and granted the modification sought by Father. The trial court's order gave Father the relief he had pleaded for-it appointed Mother and Father joint managing conservators, awarded Father the exclusive right to designate E.D.'s primary residence, imposed a standard possession order, and ordered Mother to pay child support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20153.134\">\n    Tex.

The trial court's nunc pro tunc judgment was problematic in two ways. First, in contradiction to Tex. R. Civ. P. 316, which allows only the correction of\n   <em>\n    clerical\n   </em>\n   mistakes in the judgment, it corrected a substantive (purported) \"mistake\" in the judgment, not a clerical one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, it granted more\n   relief than Father's petition requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simon v.

Unfortunately, while both of these errors arguably constituted error on the face of the record, Mother did not pursue the remedy of restricted appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 26.1(c), 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Granting even further relief beyond Father's pleadings, the nunc pro tunc order also restricted Mother's access to E.D. to six supervised hours on the first Saturday of each month. And, the nunc pro tunc judgment also reiterated that Mother had defaulted after being properly cited to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 11, 2016, Mother filed a motion to set aside the default judgment and for a new trial. In it, Mother asserted that she was never properly served, that the Pruitt affidavit did not comply with statutory requirements, and that she did not learn about the case until the local sheriff \"showed up at [her] house on June 18, 2016, to remove [E.D.] from [her].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Father's response he argued that Mother's motion was untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after the nunc pro tunc judgment was signed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(a). Mother argued that her motion was timely because it was filed within two years of the nunc pro tunc judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 329. After conducting a hearing on the matter, the trial court denied Mother's motion by letter ruling dated October 18, 2016, in which the trial court found that her motion was not timely filed. On appeal Mother challenges the trial court's order signed three days later that dismissed her motion for new trial as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a general rule, the deadline for a party to file a motion for new trial is 30 days after the date the judgment is signed. Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(a). This 30-day deadline is modified in certain situations, one of which is when service has been authorized through citation by publication. Tex. R. Civ. P. 109, 329.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   All lawsuits must be properly served upon the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 99. Most often, service is effectuated through the personal delivery of a clerk-issued citation and a copy of the petition by a sheriff, constable, process server, or individual who is not a party to the suit. Tex. R. Civ. P. 103, 106(a). But sometimes, as appears to have been the case here, attempts at personal service are unsuccessful, whether because the defendant has purposely avoided service or because the defendant cannot be located. In those situations, the rules of civil procedure provide for alternative means of service, three of which are at issue here: rules 106, 109, and 109a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 106(b) provides that the party seeking service may submit a motion to the court supported by an affidavit that states (1) the location of the defendant's usual place of business or abode or another\n   place where the defendant can probably be found and (2) facts showing that either personal service or service through certified mail was attempted but unsuccessful. Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(b). Upon receipt of such a motion and affidavit,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   the court may authorize service (1) by leaving a true copy of the citation, with a copy of the petition attached, with anyone over sixteen years of age at the location specified in such affidavit, or (2) in any other manner that the affidavit or other evidence before the court shows will be reasonably effective to give the defendant notice of the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Service by publication is another alternative. Tex. R. Civ. P. 109. Generally, service by publication is conducted through the placement of a small notice published in the classified section of a local newspaper.\n   <em>\n    In re E.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095517\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/385/552/#p558\">\n    385 S.W.3d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (Tex. 2012).

Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-07-00565-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203539968\">\n    2008 WL 3539968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tex. App.-Austin 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.) (noting that plaintiff received permission for 109a substituted service to be effected by leaving a copy of the citation and petition with anyone 16 years of age or older at defendant's former residence);\n   <em>\n    Isaac v. Westheimer Colony Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10012745\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/933/588/#p590\">\n    933 S.W.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, writ denied) (noting use of 109a substituted service of citation and petition on defendant's father). But the question of whether substituted service was ordered under rule 106(b) or rule 109a is generally of no practical concern, as long as service was accomplished as ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But here, whether substituted service was ordered under rule 106 or 109a is a critical question. Jurisdiction turns on the answer, because when substituted service is ordered under rule 109a, the deadline for filing a motion for new trial is extended from 30 days to two years. Tex. R. Civ. P. 109a (providing that rule 329 shall apply as if citation had been served by publication), 329 (providing that the trial court may grant a new trial upon petition showing good cause filed within two years after the date the judgment was signed). And here, Mother's motion to set aside the default judgment and for a new trial was filed 66 days after the judgment nunc pro tunc was signed. Thus, it was timely-subject to a two-year, rather than 30-day, deadline-only if the trial court ordered substituted service under rule 109a. To determine which rule the trial court invoked here, we must look at the motion requesting substituted service and the order granting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In urging us to hold that service was ordered under rule 109a, Mother argues that because Father's motion did not comply with rule 106(b), as discussed above, substituted service could not have been properly ordered under that rule. Although we agree that substituted service was not\n   <em>\n    properly\n   </em>\n   issued under rule 106(b), for purposes of our analysis that fact is irrelevant. Any complaint as to defective service under rule 106(b) was subject to the 30-day deadline for filing a motion for new trial, a deadline that Mother did not meet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because she failed to lodge a timely challenge to any defects in service under rule 106, we focus instead on whether the substituted service was ordered under rule 109a because only if substituted service was ordered by rule 109a would Mother's motion for new trial have been timely filed, preserving her right to appeal here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Substituted service under rule 109a cannot be ordered unless citation by publication was authorized under rule 109. Tex. R. Civ. P. 109a (providing that \"[w]henever citation by publication is authorized, the court may, on motion prescribe a different method of substituted service\" and when \"the defendant has not appeared, the ... [two-year deadline] shall apply\"). Thus, we face two questions: whether service by publication was authorized under rule 109 and, if so, whether the trial court's order authorized substituted service under 109a. The trial court had jurisdiction to consider Mother's motion for new trial only if the answer to both questions is \"yes.\" But based on the record here-especially considering the language of the motion and the order itself-we must hold that the answer to both questions is \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to the first question, to trigger the two-year deadline, service by publication must be \"authorized.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10012745\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/933/588/#p590\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rule 109 sets forth the requisites for authorization of service of citation by publication, including that the party, his attorney, or his agent must swear under oath, among other things, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 the defendant's residence is unknown to the affiant, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 the defendant is a transient person, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 the defendant is a nonresident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 109. Father's motion for substituted service did not comply with the requisites of this rule. It was not verified, nor did Father or his attorney sign an affidavit in support of the motion. Assuming that the process server acted as Father's agent, the process server's affidavit did not attempt to address whether Mother's residence was known or unknown to him, except to say that service attempts at an unspecified location or locations were \"unsuccessful\" and that a telephone number and an address provided to him by Mother's father were not \"accurate.\" And it wholly failed to address whether Mother was a transient person, or whether she was a nonresident. Not only did the motion fail to meet the requisites of rule 109, it specifically sought substituted service under \" Rule 106(b).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the second question, any order granting substituted service under rule 109a must recite that the substituted method of service \"would be as likely as publication to give defendant actual notice.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 109a. The order here contained no such recitation. To the contrary, it stated, \"The manner of service ordered will be reasonably effective in giving the Respondent notice of this suit,\" which echoes the language used in rule 106(b)(2). Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(b)(2) (providing that the court may authorize service in any other manner that the affidavit or other evidence \"shows will be reasonably effective to give the defendant notice of the suit\"). Finally, the order implicitly purports to grant relief under rule 106(b), rather than rule 109a, by its reference to Father's motion which explicitly requested substituted service under \" Rule 106(b).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because the order of substituted service was not authorized by rule 109 and it did not comply with rule 109a, we hold that the two-year period for filing a motion for new trial under rule 329 was never triggered. As such, Mother's motion for new trial-which was not filed within the 30-day deadline-was untimely, and the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider it. Accordingly, the rules leave us no choice but to overrule Mother's sole issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having held that Mother's motion for new trial was untimely, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   BIRDWELL, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MEIER and GABRIEL, JJ., join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   WADE BIRDWELL, JUSTICE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Along with the entire court, I share the majority's articulated concerns about the many errors and irregularities apparent on the face of the record in this appeal and the consequentially suspect result in the trial court's judgment and judgment nunc pro tunc, the latter of which effected an\n   essentially 180-degree change of custody, possession, and access to a child under three years of age, wholly unsupported by any pleading, based on attempted substituted service that was so incredibly defective as to amount to no service at all. But I respectfully dissent to the majority's holding that we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal. I believe our analysis of the jurisdictional issue should focus on whether Father and the trial court attempted but failed to effect substituted service under rule 109a, instead of deciding that service pursuant to that rule was not authorized because the trial court failed to sign an order containing the recitations required by that rule. By narrowly construing the scope of the remedy available to a party for whom substituted service under rule 109a has been ordered-whether properly or not-the majority denies Mother relief based on\n   <em>\n    Father's\n   </em>\n   failure to strictly comply with substituted service requirements and does so when the record as a whole supports Mother's contention that the trial court attempted to order substituted service pursuant to rule 109a. In doing so, the majority's disposition runs contrary to the directive that we are to liberally construe the rules of civil procedure to resolve matters \"with as great expedition and dispatch and at the least expense both to the litigants and to the state as may be practicable.\" Tex.

Although Father indicated in his motion that he sought service via the\n   <em>\n    method\n   </em>\n   authorized by rule 106(b), he also plainly asserted as a fact supporting service by that method that \"[d]espite his diligent efforts, Mr. Pruitt [the process server] ha[d] been unable to locate\" Mother. In his affidavit, Pruitt does not indicate that when he encountered Mother's father at the place he had been attempting service, Mother's father affirmed the location was Mother's residence. Instead, Pruitt states that Mother's father gave him another address and a phone number but that those proved to be inaccurate. Thus, nothing in Father's motion or the attached affidavit shows that Mother's address or location was known to the process server, Father, or Father's attorney.

Upon a showing that such attempted service was unsuccessful at that location, the rule outlines one of two methods for substituted service:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (1) by leaving a true copy of the citation, with a copy of the petition attached, with anyone over sixteen years of age at the location specified in such affidavit, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (2) in any other manner that the affidavit or other evidence before the court shows will be reasonably effective to give the defendant notice of the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814419\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/924/#p925\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, rule 106(b) prescribes a way of effecting substituted service when a process server is unable to serve a defendant at a known, named location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.L.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811953\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/485/537/#p541\">\n    485 S.W.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541 (Tex.

Additionally, Pruitt never averred that the location at which he located Mother's father was in fact Mother's last known address, and he represented that the address and phone number Mother's father gave him were incorrect. Reading the affidavit in its entirety, it is clear that Pruitt averred that substituted service was necessary because he did not know where to find Mother even if he did not expressly state those words. And, again, the trial court's own file containing the original SAPCR order shows that Mother's location was intended to be unknown to\n   <em>\n    Father.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Rule 109a allows the trial court to fashion a method of substituted service other than publication \"[w]henever citation by publication is authorized.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 109a. The majority concludes that this quoted language means that Father could not have attempted, and the trial court could not have ordered, service under rule 109a because (1) the trial court's order did not include a recitation that the substituted method of service \"would be as likely as publication to give defendant actual notice\" and (2) Pruitt's affidavit does not aver that Mother's address was unknown to Father. Maj. Op. at 107. But the plain language of rule 109\"authorizes\" citation by publication when, among other things, a party, his agent, or attorney swears that the defendant's location is unknown to the affiant and the party and despite diligent efforts, he or she cannot locate the defendant. Father clearly proffered the affidavit of the process server as his agent for purposes of establishing the facts necessary to obtain alternate service under rule 109.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sgitcovich v.

It is Father's seeking of and attempt to effect such service based on his inability to locate Mother because he did not (and by order could not) know her address-a permitted reason for seeking service under rules 109 and 109a -that makes rule 329(a) applicable to extend the trial court's plenary power and the appellate deadlines so that we may properly address the merits of Mother's appeal in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   And, contrary to the majority's conclusion that the trial court's April 29, 2016 docket entry is irrelevant to the jurisdictional analysis, that docket entry is consistent with a conclusion that the trial court attempted, but failed, to properly effectuate service under rules 109 and 109a. It is also consistent with the trial court's duty to inquire into the sufficiency of the diligence exercised in attempting to ascertain Mother's whereabouts, a duty not imposed on the trial court by rule 106(b).

I do not believe this court should hold Father's and the trial court's errors in effecting that substituted service against Mother as the defaulting party when the record must show that\n   <em>\n    Father\n   </em>\n   strictly complied with the rules regarding service to support his default judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9991475\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/800/833/#p836\">\n    800 S.W.2d at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The docket sheet includes an odd notation dated April 29, 2016-the same day the default judgment was signed and two months after the order of substituted service was filed with the clerk-that states, in part, \"R served by publication-No Answer.\" But there is no evidence in this record that Mother was actually served by publication, and neither party makes such a contention on appeal. The judgment is silent on the method of service, instead reciting that Mother was \"duly and properly cited\" and that \"[a]ll persons entitled to citation were properly cited.\" Thus, this docket sheet entry appears to be an erroneous one. If in fact the judge's docket sheet entry is correct, however, then the clerk's record is not only incomplete but the trial court also committed error by failing to appoint an attorney ad litem to defend Mother in the suit, as is required by rule 244 when a party has actually been served by publication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.

The absence of any reference to the prior family-violence finding in Father's petition might explain the trial judge's apparent lack of consideration of the finding's effect on Father's inability to effect service, in light of the fact that the trial court had previously ordered that Mother's address was not to be disclosed to Father to prevent child harassment, abuse, serious harm, or injury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    I have omitted the listing of the parties' names.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The process server failed to explain why he was confident that serving the citation and motion to modify on Mother's father would ensure that Mother would receive actual and timely notice even after Mother's father had provided him with an incorrect address and phone number for Mother.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    In his Response to Mother's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment and Motion for New Trial, Father blames Mother for his inability to obtain personal service, conceding that her residence was unknown to him when he requested substituted service.
