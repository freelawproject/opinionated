Hughes appeals from the trial court's order granting Tom Green County's plea to the jurisdiction. Hughes sued the County for breach of contract and unjust enrichment based on an agreement Hughes and the County entered into in connection with prior litigation and for violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 551.001 -.146. Asserting its governmental immunity, the County filed a plea to the jurisdiction as to the claims based on the agreement. The trial court granted the plea, and Hughes filed this interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 51.014(a)(8). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hughes's uncle, Duwain E. Hughes, Jr., by his will, left certain mineral interests in trust for the lifetime benefit of two individuals and the remainder of the mineral interests to Southern Methodist University (SMU) for the purpose of establishing an endowed chair in the English Department. Duwain Hughes also left his home and rare book and music collections to the County, directed that his home be named as the \"Duwain Hughes Branch of the Tom Green County Library,\" and bequeathed his residuary estate to the County for the purpose of paying off any indebtedness against the home, for upkeep of the home,\n   and for the purchase of new books. By April 1991, SMU was receiving funds in excess of the amount needed to fund the chair in English at the highest level authorized by the university-$1.5 million. The SMU Board of Trustees filed an application to release the restriction on the use of the funds, seeking authority to use the excess funds for other purposes \"supporting and maintaining\" the English Department (the SMU Litigation). In May 1991, the County intervened in the SMU Litigation claiming that the chair in English was fully funded, that the purpose of Duwain Hughes's bequest had been accomplished, and that the County was entitled to the excess funds as part of the residuary estate left to the County. In March 1993, Hughes intervened in the SMU Litigation alleging that because the County had sold Duwain Hughes's home, the residuary gift to the County had lapsed, and he and other heirs at law\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were entitled to the mineral interests remaining after the English chair at SMU was fully funded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties agreed to mediate the case in May 1994. One or two days prior to mediation, Hughes and the County entered into a Mutual Partial Assignments agreement (MPA), which is the basis of Hughes's breach of contract claim. In the MPA, Hughes and the County agreed, in essence, to split equally the proceeds of any settlement payment from SMU.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As further consideration, the County also agreed to name the main library in honor of Duwain Hughes or Frances Hughes Crews \"if the commissioners consider[ed] the County's ultimate recovery in the [SMU Litigation] to be substantial enough for such recognition.\" Hughes and the County further agreed to continue to prosecute the SMU Litigation, and the preamble provided that the agreement was \"in no way intended to eliminate or reduce in any fashion the causes of action, claims or rights held by the heirs-at-law or the County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hughes and the County proceeded to mediation with SMU, at which the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby SMU agreed to pay $1 million to the other parties. Subsequently, the parties executed a \"Compromise and Settlement and Release of All Claims,\" in which the parties confirmed SMU's agreement to pay the other parties $1 million, agreed to entry of judgment declaring that SMU has a vested fee title in the mineral interests, and agreed to release the restrictions on SMU's and the County's use of the funds left to them. In the \"Compromise and Settlement and Release of All Claims,\" the County, Hughes, and the other heirs released SMU from all of the claims they had asserted in the SMU Litigation. In July 1994, the County Commissioners ratified the parties' agreements in the SMU Litigation. In September 1994, the trial court in the SMU Litigation entered a\n   final judgment in accordance with the terms of the parties' agreement. The County subsequently deposited the settlement proceeds in the Hughes Library Fund. It appears from the record that the County began planning for a new main library, sold the Duwain Hughes home at some point, and ultimately used money from the Hughes Library Fund to purchase the building that housed the main library at the time and remodel it to serve as the new main library.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2011, when the remodeling of the library building was completed, the County Commissioners determined that the \"ultimate recovery in [the SMU Litigation was] not substantial enough to name Tom Green County's main library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.\" and named the library after other library supporters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, Hughes filed suit against the County asserting claims for breach of the MPA, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Open Meetings Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 551.001 -.146. Hughes alleged that the County had breached the MPA by failing and refusing to name the library after Duwain Hughes or Frances Hughes Crews and had unjustly accepted and retained the benefits of the MPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County filed a plea to the jurisdiction seeking dismissal of all claims pertaining to the MPA on the basis of governmental immunity. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the motion, and Hughes filed this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Governmental immunity protects political subdivisions, including counties, from suit and from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

First, Hughes contends that the County waived immunity by voluntarily intervening in the SMU litigation, settling the suit-from which it was not immune-and then breaching the terms of the settlement agreement. Second, Hughes argues that the County waived immunity by its conduct in breaching the MPA. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Voluntary Intervention and Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his first issue, Hughes argues that the County waived its immunity from suit for breach of the MPA because the MPA was a settlement agreement in a lawsuit for which the County had no immunity by virtue of its voluntary intervention. Hughes relies on\n   <em>\n    Texas A &amp; M University-Kingsville v. Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311985\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/87/518/\">\n    87 S.W.3d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2002). Under the\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   rule, the Texas Supreme Court held that where the Legislature had waived the university's immunity in the Whistleblower Act, the university could not \"claim immunity from a suit brought to enforce a settlement agreement reached to dispose of a claim brought under the Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311985\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/87/518/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311985\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/87/518/\">\n    at 522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   to the facts of this case, Hughes argues that the County waived its immunity by intervening in the SMU Litigation, that he and the County settled their claims against each other in the MPA, and that the County cannot not now claim immunity from suit for breach of the MPA, in which it settled a lawsuit from which it had no immunity. On the facts before us, we do not find this argument persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, we cannot agree that the County waived its immunity from suit by intervening in the SMU Litigation. Implicit in Hughes's argument is reliance on the voluntary litigation \"exception\" to immunity applied by the Texas Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Reata. See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p373\">\n    197 S.W.3d at 373, 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, while the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Reata\n   </em>\n   applied a judicial modification to immunity, its holding was limited to claims related to and defensive to claims asserted by the\n   governmental entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p373\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of New Braunfels v.

The Supreme Court held that \"the decision by the City of Dallas to file suit for damages encompassed a decision to leave its sphere of immunity from suit for claims against it [that were] germane to, connected with and properly defensive to claims the City assert[ed]\" but only to the extent \"necessary to offset the City's claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p373\">\n    at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, under the holding in\n   <em>\n    Reata\n   </em>\n   , a governmental entity waives its immunity only as to claims asserted by the party it has sued that are related to and defensive to claims the governmental entity has asserted and only up to the amount of damages necessary to offset the governmental entity's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p373\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the County did not make a decision to seek affirmative relief from Hughes and asserted no claims to which Hughes filed related defensive claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p373\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, the record reflects that Hughes and the County did not assert any claims against each other in the SMU Litigation. The County filed its plea in intervention before Hughes was a party and sought to recover, as part of the residuary estate awarded to the County, the funds in excess of the amount needed by SMU to fully fund the chair in English. Likewise, when Hughes intervened, he requested judgment \"against SMU and the Library\" for the remainder of the mineral interest granted to SMU, following full endowment of the chair. Hughes and the County had \"competing claims\" for the funds going to SMU, as Hughes argues, but they did not seek relief from each other. Therefore, the County's intervention in the SMU Litigation does not fall outside the \"contours of immunity\" set out in\n   <em>\n    Reata. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Dall. v.

The language of the MPA did not include any reference to release or settlement of any claims between Hughes and the County; rather, it was in the nature of a joint defense agreement, expressly providing that the MPA did not eliminate their respective claims, that they agreed to pursue the litigation against SMU, and that they would split the proceeds from any settlement with SMU.
