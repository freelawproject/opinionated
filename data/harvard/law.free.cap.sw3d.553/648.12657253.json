In six issues, Walmart argues: (1) the evidence was legally insufficient and, alternatively, factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that the negligence of Walmart's employee proximately caused the box to fall from the shelf; (2) the evidence was legally insufficient and, alternatively, factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that Bishop's injury was proximately caused by the box falling on her head, and the trial court committed reversible error by permitting Bishop to offer expert testimony when the expert had not been adequately disclosed and was not a proper rebuttal witness; (3) the trial court abused its discretion by denying Walmart's Motion for Leave to File Counteraffidavits under civil practice and remedies code section 18.001, and refusing to allow Walmart to present expert witness testimony at trial on the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's medical expenses; (4) the trial court committed reversible error by submitting an ambiguous question concerning vicarious liability in the jury charge; (5) the evidence was factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for physical pain, legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for\n   mental anguish, and factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for physical impairment; and (6) the trial court committed reversible error by allowing improper jury argument by Bishop's counsel. We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 7, 2012, Bishop went to a Walmart store to shop for curtains. While on her way to the curtain department, she entered a clearance section in an area previously occupied by a fast food restaurant. There is no dispute the clearance section was open to customers. At trial, Bishop testified there was no caution sign or other indication the clearance section was dangerous or posed a risk of injury. Photographs of the clearance section introduced into evidence depict multiple adjustable, four to five tiered, metal shelving racks on wheels, sitting side by side in aisles and along the walls. The shelves appear full to capacity with stacked merchandise, some of which is haphazardly arranged. At trial, Bhola Gajurel, the Walmart employee whose negligence was imputed to Walmart under a theory of vicarious liability, confirmed the photographs accurately depicted the clearance section on the day of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Randy Dill, the Walmart manager who filled out an incident report with Bishop immediately after the accident, testified that Walmart used temporary shelving units on wheels called \"plant racks\" in the clearance section. He did not know whether the wheels on the plant racks were locked. Unlike merchandise on the general sales floor, which was arranged and stacked in accordance with company standards and policies, Walmart \"maintain[ed] no policies on how to set up a clearance section,\" and there was no \"rhyme or reason as to how merchandise [was] kept in the clearance section at Walmart.\" Dill testified that falling merchandise is a serious hazard at Walmart stores, and it is important to train employees concerning the danger posed by falling merchandise and the proper stacking of merchandise on the shelves. Dill indicated that unlike the general sales floor, there is access from either side of the plant racks in the clearance section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Until Dill arrived after the accident, the only other person in the clearance section with Bishop was Gajurel, who was stacking items on the shelves. According to Bishop, \"[Gajurel] was back there shelving and moving things on the shelf\" while she was shopping. On the first aisle, Bishop found some curtains, and proceeded to look for more. As she approached the second aisle, she \"looked down and saw some curtains that might be what [she] was looking for.\" Bishop could see Gajurel's lower body on the other side of the shelving unit, and she could hear him stocking merchandise. Bishop testified she \"heard him pushing the merchandise that was in the same place where the [box] was.\" As she was bent down looking at curtains on the lowest rack, a box fell from above and hit her on the back of the head. \"[W]hen the box fell [onto Bishop's head] and [she] kind of yelled out,\" \"[Gajurel] came around from the other side [of the shelf].\" Bishop testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [H]e came around and he said, I'm sorry and are you hurt. And I asked him: Did it put a-a cut in my hair? Is my head bleeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   And he stood there and helped the-helped me look, and he said: No, ma'am, it's not any blood there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   And he asked did I need the manager, and I said yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bishop indicated she neither touched the shelves in that row prior to the box falling on her head, nor placed any merchandise back on any of the shelves in that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bishop stated she did not see Gajurel cause the box to fall because she was looking down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Bishop, when Dill arrived at the clearance section, he filled out an incident report with Bishop's assistance, and asked Bishop to make a customer statement. While Bishop was standing with Dill in the clearance section filling out the paperwork, Gajurel moved to the other side of the shelf from where Bishop and Dill were located. As Bishop was filling out the paperwork, Gajurel again started shelving items, and \"he pushed something-it was a candle ... off the shelf and onto [Bishop],\" \"hit[ing her] foot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The customer statement Bishop filled out immediately after the incident was introduced into evidence at trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and corroborated Bishop's testimony, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   While shopping in the clearance isles (sic) for curtains a heavy box on the top shelf of a cart fell and hit me on my head. It was a box Cakesickle maker brand Homemade approx 15 lbs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wile (sic) completing this form a glass candle fell on my foot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Walmart's incident report also substantiated Bishop's trial testimony. It described the incident as, \"Box fell and struck customer on head,\" and confirmed the incident caused \"Bodily injury,\" specifically, \"Neck was hurt.\" Bishop testified that after leaving the store,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [She] went home and laid down. [Her] neck had started to get a little stiff and sore, and [she] thought maybe [she] could sleep it off, so [she] laid down for about three hours, got up, told [her] husband [she] wasn't feeling good, and it was getting worse....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At that point, Bishop \"went to the emergency room, CareNow.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At CareNow, Bishop was diagnosed with a cervical strain and a head contusion caused by the box falling on her head. Because she \"started to feel worse,\" Bishop returned to CareNow the following day, a Sunday, then went to her primary care physician, Dr. Michelle Ho, on Monday. Dr. Ho prescribed physical therapy. Bishop completed two courses of physical therapy, which \"last[ed] until about January of 2013.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bishop testified that when she walked into Walmart on July 7, 2012, she did not have any problem with her neck. After the incident and approximately six months of physical therapy, \"[she] was still in the pain. The pain still didn't go away, so [she] knew that something else was wrong. It-it never stopped.\" Ultimately, Bishop saw a pain management physician; over a six or seven month period, she received thirty-four steroid injections in her neck that required general anesthesia ; visited a chiropractor; completed at least four rounds of physical therapy; was examined and treated by more than five physicians, including a neurosurgeon and an orthopedic surgeon; and had cervical fusion surgery resulting in \"two cages, ... a plate and six screws in [her] neck.\" Bishop testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I'm still in pain. It-it's still-I have good days, and I have bad days. The type of work that I do, sitting at a computer all day, just having to do everyday things, things that you may not think about until you've lived that day, now a day for me, when I get up in the morning and brush my teeth and lean\n   over the sink, that's painful for me. Taking a shower, that's painful for me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   When I get in the car and I turn right and left, my head right to left, your body just automatically does it, it just moves if you're in traffic or something, but then I'm in pain. So by the time I get to work, I feel like I've already worked a half a day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   So there's no day for me without pain. I sit here now with pain.... It's always there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Evidence at trial showed Bishop continues to experience pain across her neck and shoulders, as well as throbbing in her eyes. Almost four years after the accident, Bishop, upon the recommendation of her neurosurgeon, still receives physical therapy, and remains under the care of various doctors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The record indicates Bishop underwent back surgery in 2010 for degenerative disk disease, but never complained about neck pain. According to Bishop, she was \"pain free\" and had an active lifestyle prior to the accident. She is employed as an administrative executive assistant. Her job duties include typing, planning, special projects, and managerial responsibilities. Outside of work, her everyday activities prior to the accident consisted of spending time with her children and grandchildren; hosting dinners at her house; traveling to Austin to see family; sewing, including ongoing sewing for a ministry; and attending church activities, such as workshops. Bishop indicated she no longer engages in these activities as she used to. She is less active, mentally alert, and creative because she is \"in pain all the time.\" The injury \"changed [her] life.\" Now, she frequently leaves work and goes to bed. Bishop testified, \"[Before the injury] I felt like I was in total control. I'm not anymore. The pain controls me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Gajurel testified that on the day of the accident, he was employed at Walmart as a cashier, and while at work was \"very, very sick, so sick that [he] didn't know if [he] could work or not.\" He was called to rearrange some of the stock in the clearance section, items that \"had fallen on-from the places.\" Gajurel \"was barred from lifting heavy goods,\" including heavy boxes. The evidence at trial showed that Gajurel was not provided training or specific instruction \"on what to do\" in the clearance section or the \"dangers associated with falling merchandise,\" because he was a cashier and merchandise placement is \"the responsibility of the stocker.\" Gajurel testified he did not \"know how or why the box fell off the shelf,\" he was standing with his \"back to Ms. Bishop\" and not \"on the opposite side of her at the very same rack when this box fell,\" and he did not hear the box fall. However, a little more than a week before his trial testimony, Gajurel stated in a sworn discovery response that he believed Bishop manipulated the box and caused it to fall. Gajurel further testified he would be fired if he had caused the box to fall and injure Bishop, stating, \"If I pushed [the box] then the ... manager [would] ... become upset. The manager is going to fire me because if I hurt my customer, the Walmart customer.\" Gajurel also stated he did not \"cause any glass candle to fall in this area on that day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Walmart's medical expert, Dr. Raymond Peeples, testified that, in his opinion based on a review of Bishop's medical records,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bishop's neck injury was age-related and not caused by the box falling on her head. Dr. Peeples observed that Bishop's medical\n   records showed she underwent lumbar fusion surgery in March 2010 as a result of disk degeneration, yet \"still ha[d] pain in her lower back\" in June 2011. According to Dr. Peeples, Bishop's lower back pain fifteen months after the lumbar fusion procedure indicated a \"failure of surgery.\" In his opinion, \"[n]o traumatic anatomy was discovered after the Walmart event. Findings six months later on cervical MRI were age-related, normal findings of disk bulges.\" Based upon a review of CareNow records, Dr. Peeples testified Bishop's \"scalp showed no lesion. There was no hematoma.\" In his opinion, a \"significant blow\" would have resulted in \"swelling, discoloration and enlargement,\" and Bishop had \"no objective findings of a scalp abnormality.\" Because Bishop had \"[c]omplaints of neck pain without findings,\" Dr. Peeples opined she only had \"a contusion and strain\" as a result of the box falling on her head. Dr. Peeples characterized Bishop's headache after the accident as a \"[t]ension headach[e]\" which is \"frequently brought on by stress, driving, studying too many hours. That's not a headache from a blow to the head that should be present regardless of [one's] activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. Peeples further testified that because Bishop's medical records indicated she had \"[n]o radiation of pain to arms or hand\" on \"the day or two\" after the accident, she therefore showed no symptoms of nerve injury; and an EMG report on Bishop indicated \"there was no evidence of nerve compression or nerve damage.\" In Dr. Peeples' opinion, after the box fell on her head, Bishop \"had symptoms attributed to a strain,\" that got \"steadily better,\" and then \"six months after the event and a recovery,\" Bishop suffered \"[n]ew symptoms\" from \"a new condition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Peeples testified he knew the standards maintained by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons for orthopedic expert testimony required orthopedic surgeons to review all pertinent medical records, including prior depositions, before rendering any statement or opinion on the medical or surgical management of the patient. However, Dr. Peeples admitted he had not read Bishop's deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. James Stanley, an orthopedic surgeon and one of Bishop's doctors, testified that in his opinion based on reasonable medical probability, Bishop's neck injury, which ultimately resulted in the need for spinal fusion surgery, was caused by the box falling on her head as she was \"bent forward looking down.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Stanley's medical notes reflected,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Bishop] had a box fall on her head and sustained an injury. That injury required surgery. To my thinking, that spells out causation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to Dr. Stanley, because Bishop was looking down when the box hit her head, \"her neck [was] in flexion,\" which \"means that the chin is-closer to the chest.\" Bishop suffered an \"axial flexion injury\" because the box fell on her head from above, causing her \"neck to flex,\" which \"load[ed] the spine. And flexion ... is the worst position to load your cervical spine.\" Dr. Stanley further testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [When] a high school collegiate or professional football player ... sustain[s] a catastrophic cervical spine injury... it's almost always in a flexed spine with an axial load. That's the absolute worst biomechanical position for your neck to be in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]he disk is a circular ligament with a jelly inside. The jelly is the actual shock absorber. ... [The spine] is designed to\n   take loads in extension. So the more flexed you are when you're subjected to an axial load, the more of that force, instead of being dissipated equally, it goes ... into the nucleus, which is the jelly. And when ... the center of rotation is forward of where it's ... supposed to be, the forces that are directed towards ... the jelly are then directed posterior towards the back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [I]n most of us, the weak link is what we call the annulus which is that circular ring around the disk. ... And so when you get an axial load in a flexed posture and the weak link is the annulus, you get a disk bulge or a disk displacement or sometimes an actual extrusion of disk material. ... And the place that it typically goes is back towards the spinal canal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dr. Stanley opined that, based on his review of Bishop's medical records, Bishop did not suffer from any type of degeneration in her spine, and \"[Bishop's] pain and resultant medical care and medical treatment ... [did not have] anything to do with degeneration in her cervical spine at all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A jury found that Gajurel was negligent while acting within the course and scope of his employment, his negligence proximately caused Bishop's injury, and Walmart therefore was negligent on a theory of vicarious liability. The jury awarded damages to Bishop in the amount of $1,393,484.52, upon which the trial court rendered judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In six issues, Walmart argues: (1) the evidence was legally insufficient and, alternatively, factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that the negligence of Walmart's employee proximately caused the box to fall from the shelf; (2) the evidence was legally insufficient and, alternatively, factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that Bishop's injury was proximately caused by the box hitting her head, and the trial court committed reversible error by allowing Dr. Stanley to offer expert testimony when his testimony had not been adequately disclosed and he was not a proper rebuttal witness; (3) the trial court abused its discretion by denying Walmart's Motion for Leave to File Counteraffidavits under section 18.001 of the civil practice and remedies code, and refusing to allow Walmart to present expert witness testimony at trial on the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's medical expenses; (4) the trial court committed reversible error in submitting an ambiguous question concerning vicarious liability in the jury charge; (5) the evidence was factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for physical pain, legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for mental anguish, and factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for physical impairment; and (6) the trial court committed reversible error by allowing improper jury argument by Bishop's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   When, as here, an appellant attacks the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support an adverse finding on an issue on which it did not have the burden of proof, it must demonstrate that no evidence supports the adverse finding.\n   <em>\n    Exxon Corp. v.

The jury was given the following instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    NEGLIGENCE\n   </strong>\n   \" means failure to use ordinary care, that is, failing to do that which a person of ordinary prudence would have done under the same or similar circumstances or doing that which a person of ordinary prudence would not have done under the same or similar circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    ORDINARY CARE\n   </strong>\n   \" means that degree of care that would be used by a person or ordinary prudence under the same or similar circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    PROXIMATE CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   \" means a cause, that was a substantial factor in bringing about an event, and without which cause such event would not have occurred. In order to be a proximate cause, the act or omission complained of must be such that a person using ordinary care would have foreseen that the event, or some similar event, might reasonably result therefrom. There may be more than one proximate cause of an event.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A single liability question was presented to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   QUESTION 1\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Did the negligence, if any, of Wal-Mart, proximately cause the occurrence in question:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Wal-Mart was negligent if Bhola Gajurel was negligent while acting within the course and scope of his employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Answer: ________\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The jury answered \"Yes.\" Walmart argues the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that Gajurel was negligent because there was no evidence as to what caused the box to fall from the\n   shelf; what standard of care applied; or what conduct by Gajurel violated the standard of care. Walmart argues in the alternative that the evidence is factually insufficient to support the jury's finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As to cause in fact, there is evidence of record indicating Bishop was injured when a box on the upper shelf of a temporary, wheeled shelving system in the clearance section fell on her head as she was bent down looking at curtains on the bottom shelf. Immediately preceding the accident, Bishop saw Gajurel's lower body on the other side of the rack, and heard him stocking, moving, and pushing merchandise around in the same area occupied by the box before it fell. Dill, the Walmart manager who went to the clearance section to assist Bishop immediately after the accident, testified that merchandise falling from shelves was a \"serious hazard\" at Walmart, and employees assigned \"zoning\" duties (i.e. stacking and shelving merchandise) were trained on the \"danger of falling merchandise.\" Unlike merchandise on the general sales floor, which was specifically arranged and stacked in accordance with standards, policies, and a \"modular\" sent to the stores by Walmart's corporate offices that provide instructions on \"where to exactly put each individual box\" on a shelf, the merchandise in the clearance section was haphazardly stacked, with \"no rhyme or reason\" as to the arrangement of the items. Walmart did not have any standards or policies that applied to the arrangement of merchandise in the clearance section. The evidence also showed that Walmart invited and intended for customers to enter the clearance section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although he was employed and trained as a Walmart cashier, Gajurel was in the clearance section at the time of the accident re-arranging and stacking items on the temporary shelving units. Gajurel admitted he did not know \"what to do\" or how to properly stack the items, and had not been informed of the dangers of falling merchandise. At trial, Gajurel testified he did not know how or why the box fell, yet his sworn discovery response just a week prior to his testimony blamed Bishop for manipulating the box and causing it to fall. Gajurel further testified he would be fired if he had caused the box to fall and injure Bishop. Gajurel denied causing a glass candle to fall and hit Bishop's foot despite Bishop's contemporaneous documentation of that event in the incident report she filled out while standing in the clearance section with Dill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to foreseeability, Dill testified that because Walmart was aware of the \"serious hazard\" posed by merchandise falling from shelves and injuring shoppers, Walmart's own standards and policies required employees charged with stocking items on shelves to receive training on how to properly shelve items to prevent merchandise from falling and injuring someone-training and knowledge Gajurel lacked. Gajurel admitted he did not know \"what to do\" while stacking, shelving, and re-arranging merchandise in the clearance section, a customer shopping space that was not subject to store standards or policies regarding the stocking and placement of store merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   From this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that the box fell due to Gajurel's negligent actions moving and stacking merchandise on the shelves in the clearance section, and Walmart could reasonably foresee that boxes and other merchandise haphazardly stacked in the clearance section could fall and injure a customer. While there was conflicting evidence as to Gajurel's precise whereabouts in the clearance section at the moment the box fell on Bishop, the jury was entitled to believe Bishop's testimony and reject any conflicting testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We conclude there was more than a scintilla of evidence from which the jury could reasonably have drawn the inference that Gajurel's actions in moving and shelving merchandise in the clearance section without the benefit of standards or policies for stocking merchandise on the temporary, wheeled shelving units in that section, and without knowledge of \"what to do\" or training on how to stock and shelve merchandise in that section, proximately caused the box to fall on Bishop's head. Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's finding that Gajurel was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the box falling from a shelf and hitting Bishop on the head.\n   <em>\n    King Ranch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9070904\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/118/742/#p751\">\n    118 S.W.3d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record, however, contains testimony and documentary evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the box falling from a shelf was the proximate cause of Bishop's neck injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Bishop testified that she did not have any problem with her neck when she walked into Walmart on July 7, 2012. The testimonial and documentary evidence at trial showed that her neck was injured when the box fell on her head. Walmart's incident report stated, \"Box fell and struck customer on head,\" causing \"bodily injury,\" specifically, \"Neck was hurt.\" Within hours of the accident, Bishop went to an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a cervical strain and a head contusion. She returned to the urgent care facility the next day, and visited her doctor on the third consecutive day following the accident. Thereafter, Bishop continuously received treatment from physicians and other health-care providers, including physical therapy and invasive surgery resulting in the placement of two cages, a plate, and six screws in her neck. At the time of trial, Bishop remained under the care of physicians and other health-care providers, including treatment and physical therapy for her neck pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Dr. Stanley testified that, based on reasonable medical probability, Bishop's neck injury was caused by the box falling on her head as she was \"bent forward looking down,\" necessitating spinal fusion surgery in her neck. Dr. Stanley provided a detailed medical explanation of how a box striking a person's head in that position could cause severe neck trauma and injury, stating \"[t]hat's the absolute worst biomechanical position for your neck to be in.\" Although Dr. Peeples testified that Bishop's injury was age-related and not caused by the box falling on her head, it was the role of the jury to assess witness credibility and weigh contradictory evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based upon Dr. Stanley's testimony, Bishop's medical records and testimony, Walmart's records of the accident, and the temporal proximity between the accident and Bishop's immediate neck pain and multiple visits to the urgent care facility,\n   physicians, and other health-care providers, there existed more than a scintilla of evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that Bishop's neck injury was proximately caused by the box falling on her head while she was looking down.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guevara v.

Other than offering that single statement, Walmart does not provide substantive analysis of its factual sufficiency issue, nor does it provide citations to applicable law. We therefore question whether Walmart has presented anything for our review; an appellant's failure to cite legal authority or provide substantive analysis of a legal issue results in waiver of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Fredonia State Bank v.

At trial, Bishop testified that almost four years after the accident, she is still in pain. She continues to experience pain across her neck and shoulders, and throbbing in her eyes. She cannot engage in every-day activities as simple as turning her neck while driving, showering, sitting at her computer for work, or leaning over the sink while brushing her teeth without pain. The evidence showed Bishop's injury now limits her mobility, thereby preventing her from living her life as she did before the box fell on her head. She no longer is able to spend time with her children and grandchildren, host dinners at her house, sew, travel, and attend church activities as she did before the accident, and is generally less active, mentally alert, and creative. She frequently leaves work and goes directly to bed. Bishop testified she has lost the control she previously had over her life because of the pain, stating, \"[Before the injury] I felt like I was in total control. I'm not anymore. The pain controls me.\" The record reflects that prior to the box falling on her head, Bishop never complained about neck pain, including after undergoing back surgery in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even if Walmart has not waived its argument that the evidence is factually insufficient to support the jury's damage award for physical pain, we conclude on this record that the evidence of physical pain was not so weak that it can be said the jury's award was clearly wrong, manifestly unjust, or shocks the conscience.\n   <em>\n    PNS Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811765\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/503/#p517\">\n    484 S.W.3d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (headaches, ringing in ears, severe pain in eye upon exposure to light, and soreness and stiffness in neck and shoulder for over two years constitutes factually sufficient evidence to support damage award for physical pain).

Rather, Bishop called Dr. Stanley to testify as a rebuttal witness concerning the testimony of Walmart's testifying expert, Dr. Peeples, that Bishop's \"pain and resultant medical care and medical treatment\" were the result of the degeneration of her cervical spine. In a hearing conducted outside of the presence of the jury, the trial court reviewed Dr. Peeples's report, and determined it did not state whether Bishop's neck injury was caused by the box striking Bishop's head or a \"pre-existing degenerative condition in her neck.\" On that basis, the trial court allowed Dr. Stanley to testify as a rebuttal witness on the issue of causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   ... I agree with [Bishop that the report did not address causation] because I can't discern from what ... Defense counsel gave me as to ... causation.... [B]asically [Peeples] was just negating some of the medical records, but he never actually stated that ... [Bishop's] injury was not caused by the falling of the [box].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The trial court specifically limited the scope of Dr. Stanley's testimony to the issues of causation and cervical degeneration. After considering the foregoing, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Dr. Stanley's rebuttal testimony. We resolve the sub-issue of Walmart's second issue against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In its third issue, Walmart contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying Walmart's Motion for Leave to File Counteraffidavits under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 18.001, and not allowing Walmart to present at trial the expert testimony of Dr. Brent Morgan on the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's medical expenses. Bishop moved to exclude Dr. Morgan as an expert witness on the ground that Walmart did not attempt to file a section 18.001 counteraffidavit until late January 2016, long after the statutory deadline had passed, even though Bishop timely began filing section 18.001 affidavits more than a year prior, in early January 2015. Walmart argues the trial court, as a matter of fairness, should have permitted Walmart to file a counteraffidavit by Dr. Morgan under\n   section 18.001(e)(1), since it allowed Bishop to challenge Walmart's designation of Dr. Morgan as an expert witness thirteen days after the deadline set forth in the agreed scheduling order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bishop responds that when Walmart did not timely file section 18.001 counteraffidavits, and did not seek leave to late-file counteraffidavits for more than a year after she began filing section 18.001 affidavits, she \"had every reason to believe that [she] would not be required to arrange-and pay-for all of her treating physicians to testify live at trial,\" and it was not feasible to do so ten weeks before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In a personal injury case, a claim for past medical expenses must be supported by evidence that (1) the plaintiff's injury was caused by the defendant's negligence, and (2) the medical treatment was necessary and the charges for that treatment were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ten Hagen Excavating\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177893\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/463/#p487\">\n    503 S.W.3d at 490-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In March of 2015, Walmart timely designated Dr. Morgan as a testifying expert witness and provided Bishop with a copy of Dr. Morgan's expert report. Walmart, however, failed to timely serve or file a controverting affidavit of Dr. Morgan under section 18.001. As relevant to this appeal, on January 25, 2016, Bishop filed a motion to exclude Dr. Morgan's testimony on the issue of the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's past medical expenses on the basis that Walmart failed to timely file a section 18.001 controverting counteraffidavit. On January 29, 2016, Walmart filed a motion for leave to file a counteraffidavit and response to Bishop's motion to preclude Dr. Morgan from testifying at trial. The trial court denied Walmart's motion for leave to file counteraffidavit, and the trial transcript reflects that Dr. Morgan did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Walmart argues the trial court erred by excluding the controverting counteraffidavit of Dr. Morgan and not permitting him to testify at trial regarding the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's past medical expenses, because the timely designation or Dr. Morgan as a testifying witness provided notice that Walmart had engaged a testifying witness on that issue.

We conclude there was a legitimate basis for the trial court to deny Walmart's request for leave to late-file a counteraffidavit, and, therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying that request and declining to permit Dr. Morgan to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We conclude the trial court did not act without reference to guiding rules or principles, and there was a legitimate basis for its evidentiary rulings.

Counsel must confine argument strictly to the evidence and to the arguments of opposing counsel. TEX. R. CIV. P. 269(e). Toofanian's misleading statement to the jury was improper because Walmart was precluded by the court from introducing evidence on the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's medical expenses. However, the statement was not incurably harmful. In determining whether an improper argument caused harm, an appellate court must look at the length of the argument, whether it was repeated or abandoned, whether there was cumulative error, and the probable effect of the argument on a material finding.\n   <em>\n    Standard Fire Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9953853\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/584/835/#p839\">\n    584 S.W.2d at 839-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Toofanian's improper statement concerning Walmart's failure to present evidence on the reasonableness and necessity of Bishop's medical costs was not incurable because the statement was short and not repeated. Additionally, even if Toofanian had not made the misleading statement, the only evidence before the jury on the reasonableness and necessity of medical expenses was Bishop's section 18.001 affidavits, and \"[t]he jury is not required to award a plaintiff the amount of damages established in the affidavit[s]....\"\n   <em>\n    Liang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207163841\">\n    2016 WL 7163841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Walmart did not object to Toofanian's statement at trial or in its motion for new trial, and thereby waived any alleged error concerning improper argument. However, even if Walmart's objection had been preserved for appellate review, Toofanian's statement was not incurable jury argument. While unsupported accusations of perjury may constitute incurable jury argument, Toofanian's statements were not unsupported. Rather, the argument emananted directly from testimony and evidence presented at trial. Gajurel provided conflicting sworn statements on why the box fell, which were admitted as evidence for the jury's consideration. Gajurel's trial testimony confirmed that, a little more than a week prior to his testimony at trial, he provided the following information in response to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, and understood he signed the responses under oath and that he \"[had] to tell the truth\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Interrogatory No. 3: Please state those facts which you contend establish that the incident in question was caused solely and/or proximately by a new and independent\n   cause, and described each such new and independent cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   First Supplemental Answer: Defendant believes plaintiff manipulated the shelved merchandise is (sic) such a way as to cause the merchandise to become unstable and fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   At trial, however, Gajurel-the only other person in the clearance section at the time the box fell and hit Bishop on the head-provided the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Q: Now isn't it true, Mr. Gajurel, that you didn't see what happened in this incident?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   A: No, I didn't see. I came to know when she called me and showed this thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Q: And you don't know how or why the box fell off the shelf?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   A: She was the only person there, so I didn't see how that-that box fell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Q: Okay. And it's your test-and you've testified in this case that you don't know how or why the box fell off the shelf?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   A: Yes.... That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Toofanian argued that Gajurel's \"story has changed significantly.\" Additionally, Toofanian's closing argument identified other conflicting trial testimony provided by Gajurel. Toofanian questioned how Gajurel could make an affirmative statement about Bishop's \"position in the [clearance] section\" while claiming \"that his back was turned to Mrs. Bishop while he was in the clearance section.\" Toofanian's suggestion that Gajurel's conflicting statements regarding the cause of the box falling on Bishop's head constituted perjury was not unsupported, but was reasonably based on or may be inferred from the evidence produced at trial. It therefore did not constitute incurable jury argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202561245\">\n    2017 WL 2561245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   We conclude Toofanian's jury arguments were not \"so extreme that a 'juror of ordinary intelligence could have been persuaded by that argument to agree to a verdict contrary to that to which he would have agreed but for such argument.' \"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303330\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/288/876/#p883\">\n    288 S.W.3d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
