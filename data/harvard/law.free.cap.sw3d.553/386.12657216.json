Following his guilty plea, but before sentencing, Knox obtained new counsel and filed a Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 29.07(d). The court denied Knox's motion and sentenced him to 17 years' imprisonment. Final judgment was entered and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Knox was charged with raping a woman he met at a party (\"Victim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Victim's statements, she had been drinking heavily throughout the evening. Victim laid down on a couch and later began throwing up in a trash can beside the couch. Victim awoke and remembered Knox asking if she wanted to go with him to the bedroom and she responded no. Victim then passed out on the couch and awoke to Knox having sex with her. She testified that she attempted to stop Knox, tried to push him off of her and told him she did not want to have sex but he did not stop. After he finished he kissed her forehead and said thank you and then stated that he was sorry. When Knox left the room, the Victim left the residence and reported the rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 19, 2016, Knox appeared before the circuit court and entered an open guilty plea, meaning that there was no plea agreement with the state and the sentence was left to the discretion of the trial court. The court questioned Knox regarding his mental capacity to plead, his satisfaction with his attorneys and the representation they had provided. The court also advised Knox of the constitutional rights he was waiving by entering a guilty plea, which he acknowledged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court questioned Knox under oath regarding the factual basis for his plea. When the court asked how the Victim lacked capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, the prosecutor answered that the victim was drunk and passed out. Defense counsel clarified to the court that Knox did not agree that she was \"passed out\" but he did agree that she was too intoxicated to consent. In further questioning directed at Knox, he acknowledged that she was \"very drunk\" but then equivocated as to whether he was aware at the time of the offense that she was too intoxicated to consent. After his equivocation the plea court stated, \"Well, I need more than that.\" Knox then had a further consultation with his counsel off the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Knox then, back on the record, had the following exchange with the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Knox]: I didn't think she was incapacitated at the time to where she couldn't consent. But I do believe that in the situation that it was, I do believe it was not right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Court]: It doesn't sound to me like we have a plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court then gave Knox an opportunity to again confer with counsel. The Court instructed Knox \"whatever you want to do, sir. Just work with your attorneys and make a determination which way you want to go, all right?\" Following consultation with counsel, Knox informed the court on the record that he wanted to plead guilty. The plea court informed Knox that he was not required to plead guilty and that it was his option whether to enter a plea or not and Knox acknowledged he understood that fact. The court went on to explain that he could not accept a plea of guilty unless the party admitted to committing the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following exchange then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Court]: So when we quit we were talking about what took place, and I asked you if on or about October 9th, 2015, in the County Lafayette, State of Missouri you knowingly had sexual intercourse with [Victim], a person who was incapacitated or incapable of-it says content, but I'm sure it means consent-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [State]: Yes, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Court]: -or lacked capacity to consent, and you had said yes but then I inquired a little further about why there was a lack of consent and I think that is where we had some confusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Knox]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: It's my understanding there was some alcohol consumed-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: -and that maybe she had consumed it to the point where she had actually threw up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: Okay. That would be an indication that she was pretty drunk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q: And drunk enough that she probably didn't have-or she would not have had the capacity to consent and to the point where she would be incapable of consent. Would you agree with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: And even though she was in that condition, you went ahead and had sexual intercourse with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: And you understand why that is now a problem?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q: Does that clear up any questions you had, sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A: It does, yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court then continued on to confirm that no one had threatened Knox or any family member to coerce him to enter his plea. The court also made clear that Knox understood the range of punishment to be five to 30 years or life imprisonment and that, as an open plea, the court could impose any sentence in that range. The court further made clear that he could be sentenced up to life in prison and that Knox would not be able to withdraw his plea, even if the court gave him the maximum sentence. Ultimately, the court accepted Knox's plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Before Knox was sentenced, Knox obtained new counsel and filed a Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea pursuant to Rule 29.07(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Motion\"). Knox argued that his plea was not knowing, voluntary or intelligent. Specifically, Knox alleged that he was not advised by his attorneys that he would be ineligible for probation or that he must complete at least 85% of any sentence before being eligible for parole. Nor was he told that he must complete sex offender treatment prior to being eligible for parole, would be subject to lifetime GPS monitoring and supervision, would have to register as a sex offender, and could be subject to civil commitment. Further, Knox alleged that his counsel failed to explain to him all the elements of the crime and failed to provide him the Victim's deposition in which he alleges she never stated that the sexual contact was not consensual and also alleges she testified in the deposition to her belief that she was not incapacitated at the time of the rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Knox stated that he only pled guilty\n   out of fear because he felt threatened by his attorney who told him that if he did not plead guilty and went to trial the court would give him a worse sentence, possible life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on the Motion on March 6, 2017. Knox was the only witness and testified consistently with the allegations raised in the Motion on most issues. However, contrary to his Motion, Knox testified at the hearing that his attorneys did make him aware that he would have to serve at least 85% of any sentence imposed by the court before being eligible for parole. A point the circuit court recognized. Knox did not call his prior counsel as a witness at the hearing. Following the hearing, the court found the plea to be voluntary, intelligent and knowing, and denied the Motion to set aside the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A sentencing hearing was held. The court sentenced Knox to 17 years' imprisonment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Before we begin, we must address the State's initial argument that this Court lacks authority to consider this appeal. The State cites to several cases that have found that the denial of a Rule 29.07(d) motion is not a final judgment from which an appeal can be taken.\n   <em>\n    Stevens v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8446375\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/208/893/\">\n    208 S.W.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2006). The State later, however, admits that this is not an appeal from a denial of a Rule 29.07(d) motion. Knox is appealing the final judgment and sentence, raising the denial of his 29.07(d) motion as an allegation of error. Thus, the State's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, the State argues that there is case law finding that an appellate court has no jurisdiction to consider an appeal of \"a Rule 29.07(d) motion that is\n   <em>\n    filed and ruled on after sentencing\n   </em>\n   when that motion seeks relief for claims that may be raised in a Rule 24.035 motion for post conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395309\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/66/721/\">\n    66 S.W.3d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2002) (overruled on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Zinna v. Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299172\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/301/510/#p517\">\n    301 S.W.3d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (Mo. banc 2010) ). Since the Rule 29.07(d) motion in the case at bar was filed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   sentencing, reciting the holdings of these cases also has no merit. This case is procedurally a direct appeal from the final judgment which incorporates allegations of error in the court's ruling on the 29.07(d) motion. It is not, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , a post-conviction motion seeking to avoid the time limitations of Rule 24.035.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395309\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/66/721/\">\n    66 S.W.3d at 724-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The State's argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction for this appeal runs contrary to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wilder v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297015\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/301/122/\">\n    301 S.W.3d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. E.D. 2010). In\n   <em>\n    Wilder\n   </em>\n   , the Eastern District of this Court\n   found that, because Wilder could have raised the denial of his 29.07(d) motion on direct appeal, but failed to, he was then barred from raising it in a motion for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297015\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/301/122/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297015\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/301/122/\">\n    at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is clear from the case law, including those cases cited by the State, that this Court has authority to hear Knox's appeal. The State confuses the procedural posture of the cases it cites, correlating the holdings of cases in which the 29.07(d) motion was brought\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   sentencing as procedurally the same as cases, such as the present case, where the 29.07(d) motion was brought\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   sentencing. The State also supports its position with the holdings of cases not involving a Rule 29.07(d) motion challenge but merely addressing the direct appeal of a case in which the defendant did not seek to set aside his or her plea.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Klaus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9383945\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/91/706/\">\n    91 S.W.3d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (Mo. App. E.D. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131935\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/492/\">\n    501 S.W.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2016). To determine the authority of this Court to hear this direct appeal from a judgment incorporating the denial of a 29.07(d) motion, we look only to procedurally comparable cases in which a 29.07(d) motion was brought\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   sentencing. All other cases cited by the State have other procedural considerations which are distinguishable and not at issue herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, we disagree with the State's argument that, to the extent this Court has authority to hear this case, its authority is limited to only those issues that may be raised in a Rule 24.035 setting and is limited by the bounds of such a request for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    Elam v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8338398\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/210/216/#p219\">\n    210 S.W.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (Mo. App. W.D. 2006) (\"[I]f a defendant raises claims in a Rule 29.07(d) motion which are within those enumerated in Rule 24.035, the motion remains a Rule 24.035 motion and is subject to all the terms and conditions of Rule 24.035, including time limitations.\"). Whether the State believes that there is a \"meaningful basis to treat defendants who file such motions before sentencing differently than those who file them after sentencing\" is immaterial. Rule 29.07(d) and Missouri courts have explicitly found a clear distinction, and this Court is bound by the clear terms of the rule and existing case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A trial court has discretion to grant or deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ultimately, while these factors all relate to the underlying question of whether the plea was \"voluntary\" and free from duress the point relied on is multifarious in that it both presents distinct claims of error that should be asserted in separate points relied on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886174\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/454/428/\">\n    454 S.W.3d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437 n.6 (Mo. App. W.D. 2015). In general, multifarious points preserve nothing for appellate review and are subject to dismissal. However, because we prefer to decide cases on the merits where appellant's argument is readily understandable-as is the case here-we have elected to exercise our discretion to review the merits of the arguments presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Knox specifically argues that his plea was made under duress because: (1) there was a lack of factual basis for his plea; (2) he was told by his attorney that he would receive a life sentence if he did not plead guilty; and (3) he was not told by his attorney that the victim had made conflicting statements in her deposition regarding her capacity to consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The State argues that these claims are merely claims that Knox's attorney was ineffective and thus are not recognized claims available to be raised in a direct appeal. Rule 24.035(a). The State makes no argument as to\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   this Court should review Knox's claims as ineffective assistance of counsel claims but merely treats them as such in its brief. While certainly the attorney's actions are at issue, they are merely ancillary to the ultimate question of whether Knox was under duress or fear when entering his plea or, as related to his second point on appeal, whether his plea was voluntary. He does\n   not claim that the judgment should be overturned because his counsel was ineffective, merely that based, in part, on his attorney's actions or inactions, his plea did not meet the voluntariness requirements of Rule 24.02(e) and should be set aside. We reject the State's argument in this regard and proceed to the substantive issues presented by Knox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Knox correctly notes that under Rule 24.02(e), \"[t]he court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it determines that there is a factual basis for the plea.\" Thus, the plea court must determine whether the facts to which the defendant admits are sufficient to find that he is guilty of the offense charged.\n   <em>\n    Hoskin v.

While Knox initially may not have expressed an understanding of the consent element of the offense, the court gave Knox additional time to consult with his attorney regarding this issue. Further, the court correctly walked Knox through the facts of the case which established the Victim was unable to consent-a fact to which Knox agreed. This case is distinguishable from cases in which the defendant has denied an element of the crime and the court has continued with the proceedings and accepted the plea.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saffold v.

Knox was given multiple opportunities to speak privately with his attorney regarding any questions he may have. After explanations from the court and after private consultations with his attorney, Knox never indicated that he did not agree that all the essential elements of the crime were met or that he disagreed with the facts as presented by the court. Knox's assertion that he never indicated he had sexual relations\n   with a person incapable of giving consent is incorrect. Having confirmed that he had sexual relations with the Victim, Knox agreed with the court that the Victim was drunk enough that \"she would not have had the capacity to consent and to the point where she would be incapable of consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Knox testified at the motion hearing that his later agreement with the court's factual statements was due to duress and coercion by plea counsel during those private consultations. Specifically, Knox testified that during a break in the proceedings his attorney told him that he would go to prison for life if he did not answer the questions in the way the court phrased them. First, Knox bore the burden of proving these facts and the circuit court is free to believe or disbelieve a witness even when the testimony is not contradicted.\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

The attorney was truthful and acting competently when he informed Knox that, if he did not plead guilty, he risked a life sentence. In fact he still faced the possibility of a life sentence by entering an open plea of guilty, a fact which was fully explained to Knox by the plea court. An attorney is not coercing his or her client by fully advising the client of the range of punishments available to the court and offering legal advice to the client based on the attorney's experiences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Knox notes that this Court has stated that it is advisable when questioning a defendant during a guilty plea for the plea court to ask: \"[h]as your attorney or anyone else made any threats or promises to you whatsoever in order to convince you to plead guilty?\"\n   <em>\n    Samuel v.

He fails, however, to offer any legal support for his argument or setting forth what further questions the court could have or should have asked. Informing a client as to the full range of punishment that may occur is not a form of threat or abuse. The court would not have been prevented from accepting Knox's plea even if additional questioning had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to Knox's argument that his counsel failed to inform him that Victim made conflicting statements in her deposition regarding her capacity to consent to sexual contact, Knox failed to provide the deposition to this court on appeal.
