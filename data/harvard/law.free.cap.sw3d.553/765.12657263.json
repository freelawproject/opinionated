MARK KLAPPENBACH, Judge\n     Doriane Clentail Norton appeals from a ruling of the Miller County Circuit Court that revoked his probation. In 2016, Norton pled guilty to eighteen counts of breaking or entering under Arkansas Code Annotated section 5-39-202 and two counts of theft of property under section 5-36-103(b) to receive a total probationary sentence of 120 months.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      The State petitioned to revoke Norton's probation in September 2017, alleging that Norton had been charged with two Class D felony counts of delivery of methamphetamine; had failed to pay fees, fines, and costs; and had failed to report to his probation officer as required under the terms of his probation.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-8\">\n      The circuit court conducted a bench hearing on September 14, 2017, where Detective Jesse Grigsby testified that Norton, who was known to the Bi-State Narcotics Task Force, was the individual who sold methamphetamine to a confidential informant on two occasions in Texarkana. Jo Frederickson, Norton's probation officer, also testified at the hearing regarding the terms of Norton's probation and alleged violations. Norton testified on his own behalf, maintaining that he did not sell the methamphetamine and that the other violations were excusable. Upon the conclusion of the testimony, the court revoked Norton's probation, finding that Norton had violated the terms of his probation by failing to report, failing to pay fines, and committing two felony counts of delivery of methamphetamine.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      The circuit court then imposed on Norton a prison sentence totaling one hundred years (ten years on one charge and six years each on fifteen charges) and an additional six-year suspended imposition of sentence (\"SIS\") on the remaining charges of theft and breaking or entering. Specifically, the court ordered that charges one through sixteen \"run consecutive with each other, which will give you a general sentence of 100 years[,]\" and for \"[c]ounts 17, 18, 19, and 20, the court gives you a six year suspended imposition of sentence, so when you get out, you can take care of paying back the people that you stole from[.]\" Amended sentencing orders were filed on September 27, 2017, to reflect this ruling, with a note explaining that \"[c]ounts 1-16 shall run consecutively, counts 17-20 shall run concurrent with each other but consecutive to counts 1-16. Must pay all previously assessed fines, costs, restitution, etc. upon release.\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Norton now appeals from the revocation.
