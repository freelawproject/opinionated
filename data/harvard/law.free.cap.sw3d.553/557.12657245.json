The trial court severed plaintiffs' contractual claim from their extra-contractual claims, but did not abate the extra-contractual claims pending resolution of the contract claim. In this mandamus proceeding, relators assert the trial\n   court erred when it refused to abate the extra-contractual claims. We agree and conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The real parties in interest (hereinafter, the \"plaintiffs\") were involved in an automobile accident, which they contend was caused by the negligence of the other driver whom they allege is underinsured. After the accident, the other driver's insurance company tendered the full per person liability policy limit of $30,000 to each plaintiff. The plaintiffs then made a claim to their insurance company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, under their policy that includes coverage for injuries, damages, and expenses sustained due to an underinsured motorist. According to plaintiffs, State Farm never responded to their demand; therefore, they sued State Farm and its two adjustors, Janet Ann Lorenz-Floyd and Lisa Horton. Plaintiffs alleged State Farm and its employees (collectively, the \"relators\") failed to pay in accordance with the terms of the policy. The plaintiffs alleged causes of action for breach of contract, as well as extra-contractual claims for violations of the Texas Insurance Code. The relators filed an answer and a motion asking the trial court to (1) sever plaintiffs' contractual claim from their extra-contractual claims and (2) abate the extra-contractual claims until the contract claim is resolved. The plaintiffs did not challenge the request for a severance, but objected to an abatement. The trial court granted the severance and denied the abatement. Relators then filed their petition for writ of mandamus in this court. The plaintiffs filed a response to the petition, to which relators replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their petition, relators argue the trial court erred by not granting the abatement because the plaintiffs may not litigate their extra-contractual claims until after they obtain a judgment establishing (1) the other driver is at fault, (2) the extent of the resulting damages, and (3) the other driver is underinsured. Relators assert that until plaintiffs obtain this judgment, State Farm is under no contractual duty to pay underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Texas Insurance Code provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In this section, \"uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage\" means the provisions of an automobile liability insurance policy that provide for coverage in at least the limits prescribed by Chapter 601, Transportation Code, that\n   <em>\n    protects insureds who are legally entitled to recover from owners or operators of uninsured or underinsured motor vehicles\n   </em>\n   damages for bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or property damage resulting from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   TEX.

In\n   <em>\n    Menchaca\n   </em>\n   , the jury answered \"no\" to the question of whether USAA breached the contract, but answered \"yes\" to the question of whether USAA engaged in various unfair or deceptive practices.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201866041\">\n    2018 WL 1866041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. On appeal, Menchaca asserted she could recover policy benefits as damages resulting from USAA's statutory violation because that claim was independent from her claim for policy breach. The Supreme Court characterized the issue as whether the insured could recover policy benefits based on jury findings that the insurer violated the Texas Insurance Code and the violation resulted in the insured's loss of benefits the insurer \"should have paid\" under the policy, even though the jury did not find that the insurer failed to comply with its obligations under the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, 17. In resolving the appeal, the Supreme Court sought to clarify its precedent by announcing five rules that address the relationship between contract claims under an insurance policy and tort claims under the Insurance Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, 7. However, before clarifying the five rules, the Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   An insured's claim for breach of an insurance contract is \"distinct\" and \"independent\" from claims that the insurer violated its extra-contractual common-law and statutory duties. ... A claim for breach of the policy is a \"contract cause of action,\" while a common-law or statutory bad-faith claim \"is a cause of action that sounds in tort.\" But the claims are often \"largely interwoven,\" and the same evidence is often \"admissible on both claims.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court summarized its rules as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In an effort to clarify these issues, we distill from our decisions five distinct but interrelated rules that govern the relationship between contractual and extra-contractual claims in the insurance context. First, as a general rule, an insured cannot recover policy benefits as damages for an insurer's statutory violation if the policy does not provide the insured a right to receive those benefits. Second, an insured who establishes a right to receive benefits under the insurance policy can recover those benefits as actual damages under the Insurance Code if the insurer's statutory violation causes the loss of the benefits. Third, even if the insured cannot establish a present contractual right to policy benefits, the insured can recover benefits as actual damages under the Insurance Code if the insurer's statutory violation caused the insured to lose that contractual right. Fourth, if an insurer's statutory violation causes an injury independent of the loss of policy benefits, the insured may recover damages for that injury even if the policy does not grant the insured a right to benefits. And fifth, an insured cannot recover any damages based on an insurer's statutory violation if the insured had no right to receive benefits under the policy and sustained no injury independent of a right to benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Court ultimately rejected Menchaca's independent-claims argument because \"the Insurance Code only allows an insured to recover actual damages 'caused by' the insurer's statutory violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Menchaca\n   </em>\n   stated that a breach of contract claim is \"distinct and independent\" from extra-contractual claims, while\n   <em>\n    Brainard\n   </em>\n   set forth the test an insured must satisfy before pursuing extra-contractual claims in an UIM case.

In both cases, the trial court had severed and abated the extra-contractual claims, and both appellate courts allowed discovery in the breach of contract case to proceed to the extent such discovery was relevant to the claims and defenses raised by the parties in the breach of contract case.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2017, orig. proceeding). However, as quoted, the cited rationales for abatement are conditional on the facts and circumstances of the case-discovery on the UIM claim \"may not\" be relevant to discovery on the extra-contractual claims, and the extra-contractual claims \"may be rendered moot\" by a trial on the UIM claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The majority also relies on a prior opinion by this court which involved abatement of extra-contractual claims in a UIM case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re United Fire Lloyds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321107\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/327/250/#p253\">\n    327 S.W.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2010, orig. proceeding). The issue there was whether the trial court erred in bifurcating the trial rather than granting the insurer's motion for severance and abatement of the bad faith claims against it on the grounds that introduction of a prior settlement offer would prejudice it in the UIM trial. After considering other courts of appeals' opinions addressing whether it was an abuse of discretion to refuse to order a severance of contractual claims from bad faith claims when a settlement offer had been made, we held that the trial court abused its discretion \"in bifurcating the case instead of severing and abating.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321107\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/327/250/#p253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321107\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/327/250/#p253\">\n    at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The instant case presents a unique situation where the extra-contractual claims were severed from the contractual UIM claim, but abatement was denied. Thus, relators were required to establish a factual and legal basis for this court to conclude that denial of the abatement\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   was a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court. Relators did not make any specific complaint in the trial court about any particular discovery sought by the real parties in interest, or otherwise show that the insurer's interest in reducing litigation expenses warranted abatement. I believe relators therefore failed to meet their mandamus burden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Ins.
