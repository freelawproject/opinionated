On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fowler\n   originally raised three points of error. He challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, asserted error in the admission of extraneous-offense evidence, and claimed reversible error in the trial court's admission of an unauthenticated video-recorded exhibit into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court found that there was sufficient evidence to support Fowler's conviction, but agreed that the trial court erred when it admitted the video exhibit, and determined that his conviction should be reversed. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed our ruling and remanded the matter to us with instructions that we were to address Fowler's second issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his second issue, Fowler asserts that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of extraneous offenses from Collin County, which he claims were not linked to him, were not relevant, were unfairly prejudicial, and misled the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State returned three indictments in Hunt County against Fowler arising out of a series of burglaries and thefts in and around the Royse City area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State tried all three cases together. The indictment in this case charged Fowler with stealing the ATV from Paul Blassingame. In our prior opinion in this case, we set forth the evidence relevant to this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Blassingame testified that the ATV had been located on property he owned in Hunt County, which he visited often. In November 2014, he went to that property, where he discovered that the ATV was missing, a fact that he duly reported to the Hunt County Sheriff's Office as a theft. Law enforcement officers in Royse City of neighboring Rockwall County found the ATV on December 6, 2014, while investigating a burglary at a concrete supply business. The ATV was identified by its vehicle identification number and returned to Blassingame.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The ATV was found hidden in a wooded area beyond a field on property owned by Lattimore Materials,\n   <sup>\n    5\n   </sup>\n   a ready-mix concrete business that had suffered a series of burglaries over the months preceding the discovery of the ATV. While investigating one of the burglaries that occurred at Lattimore Materials in December 2014, Royse City policemen noticed tire tracks (which they believed were made by an ATV) which led from the building that had been burglarized to a tree line; just beyond the tree line was the copse of trees in which the ATV was hidden. There was trash scattered on the ground around the ATV, among which was a receipt from a Family Dollar store that included the time and date of its issuance. Further, within fifteen feet or so of the ATV, the policemen found packaging in which a box cutter had been located, and a box cutter was one of the items listed on the Family Dollar store receipt. Royse City Police Officer Jaime Torrez took the receipt to the store that had issued it and was able to view the store's surveillance video\n   recording showing what appeared to be the purchase memorialized by the receipt. The store was unable to duplicate the recording or render it to a format Torrez could take with him, so he and an officer he was training used Torrez' department-issued camera to record the surveillance footage as it played on the store's video monitor. The footage's date and time information corresponded generally to the date on the receipt. Particularly of note to the State's case, the recording showed a man entering the store then completing a purchase, and it was the State's theory at trial that that man was Fowler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition to those circumstances, in the weeks leading up to the December discovery of Blassingame's ATV, officers had found a blue Nissan Xterra vehicle in the area under suspicious circumstances. On November 3, 2014, at about 1:45 a.m., Royse City Police Sergeant Ryan Curtis and Rockwall County Deputy Brad Dick found the truck parked on a dirt road behind some industrial businesses in a poorly lit area.\n   <sup>\n    6\n   </sup>\n   Virginia Cox (eventually named as a co-defendant with Fowler in one or more of his indictments) was sitting in the Xterra. Cox's explanation to the law enforcement officers of her whereabouts was that she and her boyfriend had run out of gasoline and that he had gone back to a gas station for fuel. Because one of the businesses (Four Brothers, a mower and tractor dealer) behind which Cox's vehicle was parked had been the victim of multiple burglaries in the past, Curtis was suspicious of Cox. Curtis saw several sets of bolt cutters in the Xterra\n   <sup>\n    7\n   </sup>\n   and got another police officer to go to the nearest gas station. That officer encountered no one purporting to be in search of gasoline for a stalled vehicle. When Curtis asked Cox to attempt to start the vehicle, it started with no problem (thereby casting doubt on Cox's story that it had no fuel).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   At about 6:00 a.m. that same day, Royse City Police Officers William Potter and Tim West observed the same blue Xterra in another part of Royse City parked on the side of a local county road. As previously, the vehicle was occupied only by Cox, and when she was questioned by the policemen, she made reference once again to a male companion. Later that morning, Potter and West again encountered the Xterra, this time containing both Cox and Fowler. Between these two encounters, Potter had responded to a call regarding an alleged theft at the Four Brothers mower and tractor dealership. The dealership representatives called Potter's attention to three mowers, each of which had their gasoline caps removed and none of which held any gasoline in their tanks.\n   <sup>\n    8\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   After that, Potter returned to the Xterra and questioned Fowler about involvement in any theft of gasoline, which Fowler denied. From our reading of the record, Potter took no further action with respect to Fowler after that point.\n   <sup>\n    9\n   </sup>\n   There was another encounter between West and Potter, on the one hand, and Fowler and Cox, on the other, on either November 3 or 10 wherein Fowler allowed the officers to look inside the Xterra. At that time, the officers noticed that there were three bolt cutters, binoculars, and a pry bar inside the vehicle.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   When questioned about those items, Fowler attempted to explain the presence of the tools in his vehicle by\n   saying he was an electrician. That explanation failed to quell West's suspicions of Fowler because (as West explained) he ran a construction company and was aware of the tools and equipment used by electricians, and those items would not ordinarily be used by electricians.\n   <sup>\n    10\n   </sup>\n   This encounter occurred near Lattimore Materials, which had suffered multiple recent burglaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Testimony about the burglaries at Lattimore Materials revealed that a part of the method of operation of the burglars was to sever cables or heavy wires and remove them from the site. In addition, the burglars had cut padlocks on the gates of the premises more than once. While investigating one of the burglaries, Torrez found three sets of bolt cutters near some of the cut cables, and he suspected that the bolt cutters had been used to cut the cables.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <sup>\n    5\n   </sup>\n   At the time of the burglaries, the Lattimore Materials facility located on the subject property was non-operational. Duane Wetteland, the area manager for Lattimore Materials, described other facilities owned by the company and explained that business needs determined whether the facility on the property at issue was operational or not. Wetteland testified that he periodically checked on the facility when it was non-operational.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <sup>\n    6\n   </sup>\n   Curtis described the area where the Xterra was parked as \"a dirt road that you really can't even travel through.\" He continued, \"I mean, I'm unaware of any vehicles being able to travel through it for years.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <sup>\n    7\n   </sup>\n   The issue of consent to the search of the vehicle was not challenged by Fowler at trial or in this appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <sup>\n    8\n   </sup>\n   Potter actually said the gas cans were empty; from the context, he likely was referring to the mowers' tanks, but he never testified that anyone at Four Brothers told him there had been gas in the tanks the night before. Nonetheless, Potter did testify that he was responding to a report of stolen gasoline, and he left the dealership telling \"management that [he] had a suspect and that [he] was going to go back and talk with them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <sup>\n    9\n   </sup>\n   A recording of that encounter, recorded via the dash camera of Potter's police car, was admitted into evidence. There was much discussion and argument over the recording. The exhibit provided to this Court has several files; there are three video recordings, each less than thirty seconds in duration, which contain no audio. The final file is an audio/video recording that is two minutes and twenty-eight seconds in duration which captured Potter asking Fowler about any involvement in theft of gasoline from Four Brothers. Potter suggested during this exchange that the business had surveillance videos. When Fowler stated that he was done talking with the officer, the video ended. From the discussions at the bench by the parties and the trial court, it appears that this audio/video recording was played for the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <sup>\n    10\n   </sup>\n   Fowler's objection to this testimony was sustained, but he did not request an instruction to disregard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

R. EVID. 104(b). At the hearing, the State noted that the other burglaries occurred during the time frame between when the ATV was stolen and its recovery, that the November burglaries occurred during the time when Fowler's Xterra was parked\n   near Lattimore Materials, and that bolt cutters were used in the Lattimore Materials burglaries. The State argued that the evidence was necessary to establish identity since the Family Dollar video recording showed a man who generally (but not definitely) looked like Fowler. It also argued that the evidence was necessary to give the jury the reason why the discovery of the ATV on the Lattimore Materials property led them to suspect Fowler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[I]t has long been the rule in this State that the jury is entitled to know all the relevant surrounding facts and circumstances of the charged offense; an offense is not tried in a vacuum.\"\n   <em>\n    Moreno v.

As noted above, on November 3, Officers Curtis and Dick found a blue Xterra, which was ultimately determined to belong to Fowler, parked on a dirt road behind Lattimore Materials at 1:30 in the morning. Several sets of bolt cutters were seen in the automobile. The explanation that she and her boyfriend ran out of gas, given by the occupant, Cox, was apparently untrue. Later that morning, the same Xterra was found by officers parked on the side of another road, this time occupied by both Fowler and Cox. When questioned about why he had multiple bolt cutters and other items, Fowler said that he was an electrician, which the officers found suspect. West also testified that on November 10, he once again encountered Fowler in his Xterra while West was on his way to Lattimore Materials to respond to a reported burglary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Testimony regarding the Lattimore Materials burglaries showed that the police investigated burglaries at Lattimore Materials on November 6, November 10, December 1, and December 5, 2014. The November 6 burglary involved the cutting of some heavy cables and the discovery of three sets of bolt cutters, which were introduced into evidence. Testimony regarding the November 10 burglary showed that someone had removed the cables found cut on November 6, that a padlock had been cut, and that several other items were missing. On December 1, the two buildings that had been burglarized in November had once again been broken into, and more wire was missing. On December 5, a padlock on one of the buildings had been cut, an ice machine had been taken, and four-wheeler tracks were found that led to the recovery of the ATV in some woods near\n   the back of Lattimore Materials' property and in the vicinity of a county road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, the trial court could have concluded that the Lattimore Materials burglaries were inextricably interwoven with the theft of the ATV. The State maintained that the several encounters by police officers seeing Fowler with bolt cutters in near proximity to Lattimore Materials, contemporaneously with the November burglaries that involved the use of bolt cutters, linked Fowler to these burglaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State also took the position that repeated burglaries of the same buildings within a recent time frame indicated that they were committed by the same culprit or culprits and the nature of the items taken in the burglaries explained why an ATV was needed to transport the items to the county road where they could be picked up, thus providing a motive for the theft of the ATV. The presence of the ATV in some woods near Lattimore Materials, and its connection to Fowler, would have been much more difficult to explain without referring to the series of burglaries at Lattimore Materials. Based on this record, we find that it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement for the trial court to admit the evidence as same-transaction contextual evidence.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204931447\">\n    2015 WL 4931447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

In this case, the only other evidence linking Fowler to the theft of the ATV was the Family Dollar video recording linked to the time and date printed on the receipt found near the recovered ATV. However, although the recording shows a man with similar features to Fowler's entering the\n   store and purchasing the items listed on the receipt, nobody at trial testified that it was definitely Fowler. Thus, the evidence of extraneous burglaries at Lattimore Materials was necessary to aid the jury in determining whether the man shown in the recording was Fowler. Further, the extraneous evidence consisted of crimes similar to the one for which Fowler was indicted, not some more heinous crime. These circumstances reduce the potential that the jury would be impressed in some irrational manner. This potential was further diminished by the trial court's limiting instructions that required the jury to only consider the extraneous-acts evidence if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Fowler committed the acts, and then only as evidence of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. Finally, the amount of time necessary to develop the extraneous-acts evidence was not inordinately lengthy in this case, especially considering that it was necessary to present the jury with relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the theft of the ATV. Consequently, we conclude that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 344.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Fowler also complains that the trial court erred when it admitted testimony by Potter of the alleged theft of gasoline from Four Brothers on November 3.
