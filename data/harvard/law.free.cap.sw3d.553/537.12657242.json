In his first issue, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his counsel the opportunity to question the venire on probation during his voir dire presentation even though he was eligible for probation. He also contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction as alleged in the indictment. Finding Appellant's first issue meritorious, we affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the conviction but reverse and remand for a new hearing insofar as it relates to punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case presents a question regarding a defendant's right to voir dire on the possible punishment range he may face when he has elected to have the jury determine sentencing. Appellant, Francisco Quezada, was charged with intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury to a child younger than fifteen by allegedly submerging the child's hands into hot liquid. The child, C.W.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was four-years-old at the time of the injury. C.W.'s mother, Neila Wilson, had been dating Appellant for three years and would let him stay at her home and watch C.W. while she was at work. Wilson testified that on the day of the injury she had gone to work around 7:30 in the morning and left C.W. in Appellant's care. A few hours later, Wilson received a message from Appellant that C.W. had hurt himself. When Appellant sent her pictures of the skin peeling off of the child's hands, Wilson raced home to find C.W. crying and Appellant in an excited state. Appellant told her he had made sandwiches for himself and C.W. and retired to the bedroom to watch television; shortly thereafter, he said he heard C.W. scream and found him in the bathroom with the burns on his hands. Appellant repeatedly stated he did not know what had caused C.W.'s injuries. The three\n   quickly left the trailer for a medical clinic nearby, and medical professionals there told Wilson that because of the severity of the burns they would need to go to the El Paso Children's Hospital. When they arrived at the children's hospital, they were told that C.W. would need to be flown to the burn center in Lubbock, so he and his mother flew there and he was ultimately treated there. Appellant was later charged with causing the injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to Appellant's trial, the trial judge exercised his discretion in criminal cases to order an Article 28.01\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pretrial hearing. Appellant made several motions at the hearing, including his election to have punishment assessed by the jury, but did not submit an application for probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the first day of trial, when the venire was present but before questioning had begun, Defense Counsel attempted to submit an application for probation to the court clerk but she refused it and instructed counsel to take the matter up with the trial judge. Moments later, Defense Counsel requested to approach the bench but was interrupted by the trial judge, who, ignoring the request, began the opening address to the venire. No further mention was made of the application until a few minutes into the State's voir dire. As the State began to discuss punishment with the jury, the trial judge asked the attorneys to approach the bench. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   THE COURT: It's been brought to my attention that there's no application for probation in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: You filed the application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #2: We have it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: We filed it, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: Show it to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: I was trying to file it when she showed up, and she told me to approach you.

The State informed the venire that the punishment range was five-to-ninety-nine years or life, but then stated, \"[n]ow to fully consider the full range of punishment ...\" and was immediately called to the bench by the trial judge. The record reflects the following exchange occurred during the bench conference:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Did you hear what I said?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   PROSECUTOR #1: I'm not going to do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: Nothing to do with probation. You come to me or-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   PROSECUTOR #1: He filed an application for jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: But you're not going to probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   PROSECUTOR #1: No, I'm not doing probation. I'm not doing probation. I understand you perfectly, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: Please continue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: I want to make a bill on this, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: Go back to your seat, [Defense Counsel], right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (Bench discussion concluded.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: Was that on the record, Your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The State continued its voir dire, informing the venire the minimum punishment upon conviction was five years. Defense Counsel then began voir dire, having several one-on-one discussions with venire members. After describing the punishment range according to the trial court's instructions, Defense Counsel stated \"[o]ne of the other options that the jury has is probation.\" Defense Counsel was immediately called to the bench by the trial judge, where another exchange on venire questions about probation took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: I'm going to repeat this one time and one time only, and somebody's going to be held in contempt. There's no application for probation. You cannot voir dire on probation. The next one who does will be held in contempt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: So would the Court permit me to make-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: Absolutely. Absolutely. But not right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL #1: I won't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defense Counsel concluded his voir dire without questioning the venire members on the issue of whether they could consider probation. After both sides exercised their strikes, the court allowed Defense Counsel to make a bill of exceptions. Defense Counsel called the court clerk to testify on his attempt to submit the probation application to the clerk. She related that counsel had attempted to hand her the application for probation as she was walking in-just prior to jury selection-but that she refused it because she understood the application was to have been submitted at the Article 28.01 conference. She directed counsel to take the matter up with the trial court because she was busy going over the venire absences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In completing his bill, Defense Counsel stated he had discussed the issue with the State and State was not opposed to allowing\n   his application to be considered filed before trial. The State voiced agreement, but emphasized the decision was up to the trial judge. The trial judge denied the request, but allowed the application to be submitted solely for the record. The trial proceeded, and the jury heard arguments and evidence from the State and Appellant. The record reflects the trial court received and accepted a probation application for Appellant sometime after the defense rested its case-in-chief in the guilt or innocence phase. After deliberations, the jury found Appellant guilty as charged and the trial proceeded to the punishment phase. During closing arguments, without objection from the State or admonishment from the trial judge, Defense Counsel discussed probation several times and asked the jury to give Appellant probation. In its closing, the State urged the jury to give Appellant time in prison instead of probation, arguing that probation would not do justice in this case. The trial judge also included an instruction on probation in its charge to the jury. The jury deliberated, and ultimately assessed punishment at ten-years' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In two issues, Appellant asserts that: (1) the trial court reversibly erred in prohibiting defense counsel from questioning whether the venire could consider probation in the punishment phase; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction as alleged in the indictment.

App. 1979) (holding that the trial court cannot prevent counsel from discussing the punishment range even where the trial court had previously told the jury it must consider the full punishment range).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, the trial judge strongly admonished attorneys for the State and Appellant that questions on probation would not be permitted because of the failure to file the probation application at the Article 28.01 conference. Defense Counsel protested he had properly attempted to file the application but was thwarted by the court clerk and by the trial judge's refusal to accept the application. Further, Defense Counsel attempted to question the venire regarding probation during his voir dire, but was immediately cut off by the trial judge and warned he would be held in contempt if he attempted to voir dire on probation again. Defense Counsel also created a bill of exceptions on whether the application for probation was improperly rejected. Despite the lack of a fully developed question by Defense Counsel, there is little question that the trial judge was aware that Defense Counsel wanted to question the venire regarding probation and disallowed any voir dire on it. This was made clear by the trial judge's direct order not to question the venire on the issue and its threat to hold Defense Counsel in contempt if he mentioned it at all. Because Defense Counsel attempted to question the venire on probation but was told categorically he could not discuss probation, and because he created a bill of exceptions, the requirement of a specific question is unnecessary here; the trial judge was on notice Defense Counsel was attempting to question the venire regarding the possibility of probation if they found him guilty and prevented Defense Counsel from doing so regardless of how the question was formulated.\n   <em>\n    Sells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301226\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/121/748/#p756\">\n    121 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   756 ;\n   <em>\n    Franklin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11459636\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/12/473/#p477\">\n    12 S.W.3d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the issue of whether Appellant was entitled to question the venire regarding the full range of punishment, including probation, was properly preserved for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In determining whether Appellant was improperly restricted, we look to the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure's timing requirements for filing an application for probation. Appellant urges us to focus on the language in Article 42.12 of the code, which at the time of the proceeding below read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (e) A defendant is eligible for community supervision under this section only if\n   <strong>\n    before the trial begins\n   </strong>\n   the defendant files a written sworn motion with the judge that the defendant has not previously been convicted of a felony in this or any other state, and the jury enters in the verdict a finding that the information in the defendant's motion is true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Emphasis added].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant argues this rule makes filing an application for probation proper provided it is filed any time before trial. But Appellant's position is complicated by Article 28.01 of the code, which authorizes a trial court to hold a pretrial hearing and mandates a defendant raise all preliminary matters at the hearing if the trial court exercises its discretion to hold one. TEX.CODE CRIM.PROC.ANN. art. 28.01, \u00a7 1 (West 2006). Any preliminary matters not raised or filed seven days before the hearing cannot be later raised or filed except by permission of the trial court for good cause shown. TEX.CODE CRIM.PROC.ANN. art. 28.01, \u00a7 2. Preliminary matters include all pleadings of the defendant, and Article 27.02 defines pleadings of a defendant to include an application for probation.

It is apparent from the record the trial judge initially did not allow the application to be filed, and subsequently disallowed questioning on the full range of punishment during voir dire. Had that been the end of the matter, the statute would seem to require affirmance of the trial court's actions. But during the guilt or innocence phase, the trial court reversed its decision and allowed Appellant to submit the probation application and the jury was ultimately charged on probation. A trial court can allow an untimely filing for good cause shown, as noted above, and when a trial court addresses the merits of an untimely filing it functionally waives the defendant's noncompliance with Article 28.01.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093118\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/399/285/#p291\">\n    399 S.W.3d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291 (Tex.App.-Waco 2013, no pet.) (intent can be inferred from the method used to produce the injuries and the words, acts, and conduct of the defendant). Secondly, whether serious bodily injury occurred depends on the disfigurement or impairment of the injury as it was at the time of the offense, not as it is after medical treatment has lessened its impact.\n   <em>\n    Blea v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808951\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/483/29/#p35\">\n    483 S.W.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016). A jury is free to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented to it based on its common sense, knowledge, and experience.\n   <em>\n    Sizemore v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095601\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/387/824/#p830\">\n    387 S.W.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2012, pet. ref'd). C.W. was hospitalized for two weeks, had to receive a skin graft, and his treating physician predicted he would have to wear compression gloves twenty-four hours a day for three-to-four years. The jury was also shown photographs of C.W.'s burns. A rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt, based on this evidence and the inferences therefrom, the injury as inflicted would cause serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of C.W.'s hands.

Accordingly, Appellant's second issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the conviction of Appellant, but\n   we reverse the judgment insofar as it relates to punishment.
