Prater contends that the trial court erred in granting judgment in favor of the Respondents because there were genuine issues of material fact in dispute, and because the elements of collateral estoppel and judicial estoppel were not established. Prater also contends that the trial court erred in awarding costs to the Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
