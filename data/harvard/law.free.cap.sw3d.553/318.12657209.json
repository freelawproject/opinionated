Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion because the Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement (\"Arbitration Agreement\") is valid and enforceable under Missouri's Uniform Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act. We reverse and remand.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As a result of events which are unrelated to this action, Kevin Bratton (\"Bratton\") suffered anoxic brain damage, which rendered him totally incapacitated and disabled, mentally and physically. On October 17, 2008, Belinda Ramirez-Leon (\"Ramirez-Leon\"), Bratton's mother, was appointed by the Jackson County Probate Court as Bratton's guardian and conservator, and Bratton was placed in a nursing home in Smithville, Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2015, Ramirez-Leon decided to move Bratton to Golden Living Center (\"GLC\") in Independence, Missouri. During the admission process, Ramirez-Leon was provided with admission forms by Carla Hopper (\"Hopper\"), the Director of Admission at GLC. Ramirez-Leon was instructed to sign the forms in order for Bratton to be admitted. Among the forms presented to her was a separate document containing the Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Arbitration Agreement is titled Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement. Directly below the title, in all capital letters, the Arbitration Agreement states: \"THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT A CONDITION OF ADMISSION TO OR CONTINUED RESIDENCE IN THE FACILITY.\" The Arbitration Agreement further provides that it is between the facility, GLC, and the resident of the facility, Bratton. According to the Arbitration Agreement, the facility includes \"the living center, its employees, agents, officers, directors, affiliates and any parent or subsidiary of the facility and its medical director acting in his or her capacity as medical director,\" and resident includes \"the Resident, all persons whose claim is or may be derived through or on behalf of the Resident, including any next of kin, guardian, executor, administrator, legal representative, or heir of the Resident, and any person who has executed this Agreement on the Resident's behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next part of the Arbitration Agreement is titled \"Voluntary Agreement to Participate in ADR.\" In the middle of that section, in bold typeface and capital letters, the Arbitration Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND AGREE THAT THEY ARE SELECTING A METHOD OF RESOLVING DISPUTES WITHOUT RESORTING TO LAWSUITS OR THE COURTS, AND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THEY ARE GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR DISPUTES DECIDED IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY, THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR CLAIMS AS A CLASS ACTION AND/OR TO APPEAL ANY DECISION OR AWARD OF DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE ADR PROCESS EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Arbitration Agreement also has a choice of law provision, which states the Arbitration Agreement should be governed by and interpreted under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"). The Arbitration Agreement states that it \"applies to any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement or to the Resident's stay at the Facility or the Admissions Agreement between the Parties that would constitute a legally cognizable cause of action in a court of law sitting in the state where Facility is located.\" Above the signature block, the Arbitration Agreement includes another statement in bold typeface and capital letters which states: \"THIS AGREEMENT GOVERNS IMPORTANT LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE SIGNING.\" Ramirez-Leon signed the Arbitration Agreement on the line labeled \"Signature of Resident\" and did not sign on the line labeled \"Signature of Resident's Legal Representative\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bottom of the Arbitration Agreement also includes a line to sign if one wishes to decline the Arbitration Agreement. This line was left blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 20, 2016, Bratton, through Ramirez-Leon, filed a negligence claim in the Circuit Court of Jackson County against Richard T. Chung, M.D. and Appellants, alleging that he sustained certain physical injuries due to his treatment by Appellants. Appellants filed the Motion to Dismiss and Enforce Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement on April 6, 2017. On May 8, 2017, Ramirez-Leon filed Suggestions in Opposition to Appellants' Motion, which argued that the Arbitration Agreement was unconscionable and violated public policy. Ramirez-Leon further argued that GGNSC Independence II, LLC, Golden Gate National Senior Care, LLC, and GGNSC Equity Holdings, LLC were not parties to the Arbitration Agreement and therefore could not claim any rights pursuant to that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 31, 2017, the trial court denied Appellants' Motion to Dismiss and Enforce Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement. This timely interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Judgment of the trial court is affirmed on appeal unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Stubblefield v.

In Appellants' first point on appeal, they argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion to enforce the Arbitration Agreement because the Arbitration Agreement is valid and enforceable under the Missouri Uniform Arbitration Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Point Two, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their Motion to Dismiss and Enforce Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement because the Arbitration Agreement is valid and enforceable under the FAA.

The Arbitration Agreement form specifically provided a separate place for her to sign if she desired to decline the Arbitration Agreement.

While this Court acknowledges that admitting a loved one into a nursing home is a difficult and stressful time, and one may be distracted by the gravity of the situation, this does not absolve the individual from reading the contract presented to them. \"The law is clear that a signer's failure to read or understand a contract is not, standing alone, a defense to the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Further, as Bratton's court appointed legal guardian she had authority to enter into contracts on Bratton's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section\n   475.120.3(4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"The general powers and duties of a guardian of an incapacitated person shall be to take charge of the person of the ward and to provide for the ward's care, treatment, habilitation, education, support and maintenance; and the powers and duties shall include, but not be limited to, the following: ... Provide required consents on behalf of the ward.\"). Since she was entering into the Arbitration Agreement on behalf of Bratton as his legal guardian, there was no issue in her signing on the resident line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ramirez-Leon then argues that because the suit is Bratton's, and she is merely suing as his representative and not in her individual capacity, Bratton cannot be compelled to undergo arbitration because he did not sign the agreement. However, Bratton was appointed a legal guardian because he was unable to make decisions and enter into contracts on his own behalf. As his legal guardian, Ramirez-Leon was required to make decisions on his behalf, including entering into contracts such as the Arbitration Agreement at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 475.120.3(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ramirez-Leon further cites to the majority in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Beverly Manor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166430\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/273/525/#p533\">\n    273 S.W.3d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2009) and\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Both\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   involve wrongful death actions brought by the decedents' children.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166430\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/273/525/#p533\">\n    273 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   526-27 ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208463\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/236/\">\n    275 S.W.3d at 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, wrongful death actions are \"distinct from any underlying tort claim\" and \"[do] not belong to the deceased [resident].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166430\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/273/525/#p533\">\n    273 S.W.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Ramirez-Leon points out, this lawsuit is a negligence claim brought by Bratton, alleging negligent acts that resulted in harm to Bratton, and Ramirez-Leon signed the Arbitration Agreement on behalf of Bratton. There is no reason Ramirez-Leon signing on Bratton's behalf would not make Bratton bound to the terms of the Arbitration Agreement for the claims in this action. If we were to accept Ramirez-Leon's circular argument Bratton could never enter into an arbitration agreement because he is unable to consent to a contract due to his lack of capacity but if his legal guardian were to sign on his behalf it would be unenforceable in a negligence claim involving Bratton because he did not personally sign the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lastly, Ramirez-Leon argues that GGNSC Equity Holdings, LLC and Golden Gate National Senior Care, LLC are not parties to the arbitration agreement because they did not prove that they are affiliated with GLC under the terms of the Arbitration Agreement. However, Ramirez-Leon is the one who filed suit against GGNSC Equity Holdings, LLC and Golden Gate National Senior Care, LLC d/b/a GLC. She named all of the Appellants in the petition and she alleges that they are affiliated with GLC when the care for her son was provided. The language in the Arbitration Agreement states that the facility includes affiliates and parent companies. Further, \"the plaintiff [can]not avoid enforcement [of an arbitration agreement] when the plaintiff treated signatory and non-signatory defendants as a 'single unit.' \"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

We find no other reason why the Arbitration Agreement is not valid and enforceable under the FAA. Further, we find the claims brought by Ramirez-Leon fall under the scope of the Arbitration Agreement, as they relate to Bratton and his treatment at GLC. Finding insufficient evidence to support the trial court's denial of Appellant's Motion to Dismiss and Enforce Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement, Point Two is granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     Point One\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    In Point One, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their Motion to Dismiss and Enforce Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement because the Arbitration Agreement is valid and enforceable under Missouri's Uniform Arbitration Act Section 435.350\n    <em>\n     et. seq.\n    </em>\n    (\"Missouri Act\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    As is fully discussed in our analysis of Point Two, the Arbitration Agreement expressly states that it is governed by the FAA. The Missouri Act covers matters that are not preempted by the FAA.\n    <em>\n     Bertocci v. Thoroughbred Ford, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387084\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/543/\">\n     530 S.W.3d 543\n    </extracted-citation>\n    n. 1 (Mo. App. W.D. 2017). Neither party raised any argument that the Arbitration Agreement should not have been subject to the provisions of the FAA. Ramirez-Leon does argue that the particular agreement in this case violates section 435.460 of the Missouri Act regarding the form of the Arbitration Agreement. This statute requires that an arbitration agreement must contain language in ten point type and capital letters substantially similar to: \"THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.\" Section 435.460. The Arbitration Agreement at issue contains a similar statement that was in capital letters, larger than ten point type and provides more detail than what is required by the Missouri Act. The Arbitration Agreement does not violate this provision of the Missouri Act. Point One is granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded for the circuit court to enter an order staying the civil action and compelling arbitration between Ramirez-Leon and Appellants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    All concur\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
