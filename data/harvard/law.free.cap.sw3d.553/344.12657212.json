App. E.D. 2010) (citations omitted). The school board of Houston R-1 School District desired to finance the building of a new high school through bonds and contracted with Hart Co. to underwrite the proposed bond sale. The bond issue was placed on the April 2009 ballot. At the time, Hart was the President, Secretary, and only member of the Board of Directors of Hart Co. and advised the school board on the financing aspects of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Impey, a candidate for Houston's school board at the same election, opposed the plan to finance the new high school through bonds. Although he was not in attendance at the meetings when Hart provided advice to the school board, Impey sent various letters, including one published in the Springfield News-Leader, regarding Hart and the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 13, 2009, Hart and Hart Co., represented by Husch, filed a Petition\n   against Impey alleging defamation, tortious interference with business expectancy, and seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief \"prohibiting Impey from again making [defamatory and false] statements and accusations[,]\" and damages. They also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and preliminary injunction. The petition and motion narrowly focused on three specific statements by Impey regarding Hart Co. and Hart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to the trial court conducting a hearing on the requested injunction, Impey filed a special motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment pursuant to section 537.528,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Missouri's anti-SLAPP statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was overruled by the trial court. The anti-SLAPP statute provides, in part, that \"[i]f the court finds that a special motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment is frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the party prevailing on the motion.\" \u00a7 537.528.2. Pursuant to this section, Hart Co. and Hart requested that they be awarded their litigation costs and attorney's fees related to the special motion. The request was granted, and the trial court ordered that an affidavit describing such fees and costs incurred be submitted. The order awarding the fees and costs was entered on August 12, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, the election was held on April 7, 2009. The school bond issue did not pass, and Impey also was not elected to office. A hearing on the Harts' request for a preliminary injunction was held on April 16, 2009. The trial court, finding that Hart and Hart Co. would \"suffer irreparable harm to their reputations and business expectancies\" if the accusations were republished during the litigation and that \"good cause\" had been shown, entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Impey \"from making the following accusations:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Hart advised the school board to circulate rumors that the historic [Houston High School] building was \"unsafe\" and \"structurally unsound.\" When a report by Pinnacle engineering failed to confirm this rumor, Hart advised the board to shift its tactic to calling it \"unusable\" [sic] to condition the public to consider their living history a \"waste of space.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. In Pierce City, when a report by Rosenbury Architect concluded its original high school was structurally sound, and should be renovated rather than destroyed, Hart influenced the board to hire a new architect to give them a report more in tune with his own self-interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 5, 2011, Impey filed a special motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 74.04 and section 537.528. On August 8, 2011, Hart Co. and Hart requested additional time to respond to the motion, and voluntarily dismissed the cause of action less than a week later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Impey filed suit against the Harts and Husch nearly two years later in August 2013, claiming that the original action between the parties amounted to malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Both defendant groups (Hart Co./Hart and Husch) moved to dismiss Impey's suit for failure to state a claim. The motions were considered together and granted, and the suit was dismissed without prejudice. On August 5, 2014, Impey filed an amended petition, and defendants renewed their motions. After a hearing, the trial court again dismissed Impey's suit for failure to state a claim, this time with prejudice. The Missouri\n   Court of Appeals, Southern District, reversed, holding that the amended petition sufficiently pleaded claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.\n   <em>\n    Impey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839282\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/471/776/\">\n    471 S.W.3d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After being remanded, the case was transferred to Cole County.

The Harts received the relief sought on their behalf by Husch when the trial court in the original action entered its preliminary injunction. Notably, the hearing on the preliminary injunction occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the election and did not \"silence\" Impey from discussing the bond issue but instead prohibited Impey from making two very specific statements that Husch, on behalf of Hart Co. and Hart, alleged to be false and defamatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Impey nevertheless argues that we must reach a different conclusion because the\n   lawsuit did not proceed to its authorized conclusion and was allegedly filed for an improper purpose. However, the two cases that Impey primarily relies on to support his argument,\n   <em>\n    Romeo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   , are distinguishable from the case before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Romeo\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that summary judgment on the Appellants' abuse of process claim was precluded by evidence that the lawsuit \"was to shut Appellants up[,]\" a letter from the attorney stating that the lawsuit had \"been successful in quieting Appellants[,]\" and a letter from the attorney stating \"that he had been able 'to orchestrate a continuance' \" so that his client would \"be through with his efforts to develop and sell so that there will be little to risk in dismissing the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Romeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311644\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/86/428/#p431\">\n    86 S.W.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Romeo\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence here that Husch, on behalf of Hart Co. and Hart, attempted to \"silence\" Impey before the election. In fact, Impey was not prohibited or \"silenced\" from discussing the bond issue either before or after the election. Husch has maintained that the purpose of the original lawsuit between the parties was to keep Impey from making very specific statements regarding Hart Co. and Hart that were alleged to be false and defamatory. We disagree with Impey's argument that \"[t]his is simply a distinction without difference[,]\" as a claim for defamation may be brought on such basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs filed their action in the incorrect venue without disclosing prior litigation between the parties, dismissed their case when it was transferred to the correct venue, refiled their case again in the improper venue, and ultimately dismissed their case after conducting discovery in the correct venue, leading the appellate court to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A jury could reasonably conclude that had Appellants' purpose been to protect their property rights by forcing City to obtain a clarified demolition order, Appellants would have pursued the TRO actions to completion, and would not have dismissed the actions before adjudication on the merits.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Romeo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   , the lawsuit was not continued to cause delay or increase costs. Although the lawsuit lasted for approximately two years after the entry of the preliminary injunction, the only action taken by Husch, on behalf of the Harts, was related to the attorney's fees that were ordered when the trial court denied Impey's special motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by Impey's argument that the legal axiom that \"[n]o liability is incurred where the defendant has done nothing more than pursue the lawsuit to its authorized conclusion regardless of how evil the defendant's motive might be\" mandates the opposite presumption,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that a defendant is liable for abusing the judicial process if the lawsuit is not pursued to its authorized conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311644\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/86/428/#p431\">\n    86 S.W.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9945621\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/670/529/#p532\">\n    670 S.W.2d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The proper use of judicial process is to resolve disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7129000\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/849/#p856\">\n    379 S.W.3d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The fact that the trial court denied Impey's special motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment filed pursuant to this statute provides, at a minimum, additional evidence that the original suit was not a strategic lawsuit against Impey's public participation and should proceed.

By contrast, the issue before us is whether there existed probable cause to initiate the original suit between these parties. The fact that a disinterested judge, after conducting a contested hearing, independently found there was a likelihood that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits and entered a preliminary injunction remains probative of whether the plaintiffs had probable cause to initiate the action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
