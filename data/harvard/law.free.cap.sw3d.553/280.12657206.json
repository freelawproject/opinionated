She argues the circuit court erroneously barred her from asserting the implied warranty of habitability as an affirmative defense and counterclaim because she remained in possession of the premises without depositing her unpaid rent to the circuit court\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   , which is \"traditionally used in reference to property taken into the court's charge during pending litigation over it.\" Black's Law Dictionary 885 (10th ed. 2014). The circuit court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Johnson entered into a written lease agreement with Kohner to rent an apartment. The lease required Johnson to pay monthly rent. During her tenancy, the ceiling above the shower in the bathroom collapsed as a result of a water leak in the unit above Johnson's apartment. Kohner attempted to repair the leak and placed a tarp or trash bag over the hole in the ceiling, but the leak persisted. As a result of the damage, Johnson stayed at a hotel at her own expense to use the shower. The circuit court found the parties offered conflicting testimony as to whether Johnson allowed Kohner access to the premises to repair the ceiling and broken floor tiles. Johnson withheld two months-worth of rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Kohner filed an action against Johnson seeking unpaid rent and possession of the apartment. Johnson filed an answer and raised an affirmative defense and counterclaim alleging Kohner had breached the implied warranty of habitability. At trial, and prior to opening statements, Kohner verbally moved to bar Johnson's affirmative defense and counterclaim because she remained in possession of the apartment but had failed to deposit her unpaid rent to the circuit court\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis.\n   </em>\n   After hearing argument, the circuit court overruled Kohner's motion, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Inasmuch as the Court has not received any evidence at this juncture as to what the circumstances are regarding this tenancy and has no information at this time as to the status of the tenant in her claim, so at this point the Court finds-I'm sorry-the Court is going to overrule [Kohner]'s objection and does not consider whatever position [Kohner] has at this juncture. A bar to [Johnson] defending this claim and will take up whether or not the elements of any defense she might have have been substantiated during this trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the parties were permitted to introduce evidence regarding whether Kohner breached the implied warranty of habitability. After trial, the circuit court, upon \"careful consideration of the evidence[,]\" entered judgment in favor of Kohner. The circuit court found the hole in the ceiling remained covered by plastic and had not been repaired, and water continued to drip from the hole and plastic covering the ceiling into the bath tub below. Nonetheless, the circuit court barred Johnson from asserting her affirmative defense and counterclaim based on the implied warranty of habitability because she \"failed to either vacate the premises or tender her rent to the Court\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   as required by\"\n   <em>\n    King v. Moorehead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118438\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/495/65/#p77\">\n    495 S.W.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77 (Mo. App. 1973).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, the circuit court also found, while Johnson was barred from asserting her affirmative defense and counterclaim, Kohner breached its promise to make repairs under the maintenance clause of the lease agreement and awarded Johnson a set-off for hotel expenses. Accordingly, the circuit court awarded Kohner possession of the apartment along with rent, late fees, attorney fees, and court costs. Johnson appealed, and the court of appeals, after opinion, transferred the case to this Court. Mo. Const. art.

But the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure discussed in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   was simply dicta. The principal opinion reasons it is immaterial that the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   is dicta because such dicta has been \"dutifully followed by our circuit courts for almost five decades.\" An examination of Missouri case law, however, reflects only one case in which application of the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure discussed in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   was necessary for the resolution of the case for tenants remaining in possession of the rented property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tower Mgmt.

App. W.D. 1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   More importantly, an examination of the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure espoused in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   reveals its origin is not rooted in application of common law principles. Rather, the recognition of an implied warranty of habitability marked a change from Missouri's previous application of\n   <em>\n    caveat\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    emptor.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118438\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/495/65/#p77\">\n    495 S.W.2d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In recognizing the implied warranty of habitability, Missouri courts acknowledged a shift in the common law from a landlord's unfettered right to rent and possession toward recognition of a bilateral contract in which the tenant's obligation to pay rent is dependent on the landlord's performance of the obligation to provide a habitable dwelling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118438\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/495/65/#p77\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is not surprising, therefore, that, in the course of that transition, the court of appeals discussed the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure, which undoubtedly reserved some remnants of protection for the landlord. But the fact remains such a procedure had no basis in present property law or contract principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, despite the principal opinion's finding to the contrary, the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure is not necessary to safeguard landlords' property interests when a tenant asserts a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. A landlord suffers no detriment from assertion of the defense in the absence of an\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   requirement because a landlord is not otherwise entitled to recover rent or possession prior to a favorable adjudication of the landlord's rent and possession claim. Therefore, requiring tenants to deposit with the court the rent as it becomes due places landlords in a better position than they would be if tenants did not assert an implied warranty of habitability defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The principal opinion finds the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure \"preserves the status quo\" and \"is not a windfall to landlords.\" But requiring a tenant to deposit rent as it comes due prior to adjudication of a landlord's claim for rent and possession is a financial prerequisite to a tenant's access to the courts to present a claim or defense of a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. And the principal opinion cannot cite to any other action-based in either property or contract-requiring the disputed amount to be paid into the court as a precondition to asserting a defense or raising a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, such findings ignore the disparity between tenants and landlords that often exists in situations in which the implied warranty of habitability is being asserted and overlook the likelihood that requiring payment of rent as it becomes due acts as a deterrent to tenants wishing to assert the defense. Therefore, in practice, the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure revives the constructive eviction doctrine the implied warranty of habitability was designed to replace. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that an\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   requirement is a necessary procedural safeguard in rent and possession actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, even if I agreed the discretionary\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure adopted by the principal opinion were appropriate, that would not justify affirming the circuit court's judgment in this case. Rather, the record makes clear the circuit court perceived the\n   <em>\n    in custodia legis\n   </em>\n   procedure to be mandatory, not discretionary, when it barred Ms. Johnson from asserting a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Ms. Johnson should be afforded the same opportunity for the circuit court to exercise its discretion in this case as tenants in rent and possession cases will have going forward. Accordingly, I would reverse the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    It is unclear whether Johnson is claiming the circuit court erroneously declared the law or erroneously applied the law. \"[A]llegations of error not briefed or not properly briefed shall not be considered in any civil appeal.\" Rule 84.13(a). Nowhere in her substitute brief does Johnson expressly say the circuit court erroneously declared or applied the law. This alone suggests Johnson's contention against the\n    <em>\n     in custodia legis\n    </em>\n    procedure is \"technically deficient\" and thus not preserved for review in this Court.\n    <em>\n     Wilkerson v.
