We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff was employed as a janitor for Southeast Missouri State University, working at the university arena. On May 18, 2007, he was mopping bleachers when he fell off the end of a row and sustained injuries. Plaintiff and his wife filed a negligence action against his co-employees Bess, Eaves and Guss. The petition alleged that Defendants each had a personal duty to refrain from acts that caused an undue risk of injury to Plaintiff above and beyond ordinary workplace risks. It alleged that Defendants breached that personal duty by affirmatively instructing or permitting Plaintiff to mop the bleachers without first installing guardrails, after he had specifically asked for them to be installed for fall protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the alleged duty was part of the employer's nondelegable duty to provide Plaintiff with a safe workplace and, therefore, Plaintiff could not pursue a claim against them as co-employees. The following facts established in the summary judgment record are undisputed. On the date of the injury, the janitorial crew believed they needed to mop quickly and they were all mopping faster than normal that day. When Plaintiff asked if the guardrails were going to be installed, he was told that there was not time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was the ordinary procedure to mop without guardrails when there were\n   time constraints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff had cleaned the bleachers at the arena hundreds of times, and usually the guardrails were installed. But Plaintiff had also cleaned the bleachers 15 to 20 times\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   the guardrails in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment because the undisputed facts showed that Defendants owed Plaintiff no independent duty, separate and distinct from the employer's duty, and therefore the claims against them failed as a matter of law. This appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review the grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    ITT Commercial Finance Corporation v.

The Court found that the dangerous work condition-the slippery road-was not created by the co-employee, but by the weather.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 557. \"[T]he risks associated with driving a delivery vehicle in a region that experiences dangerous weather conditions are reasonably foreseeable to employers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The employer had a procedure for drivers in bad weather and relied on its supervisors to ensure that it was followed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was reasonably foreseeable, the Court held, that a supervisor would be negligent in directing a delivery driver to remain on the road in dangerous weather conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McComb\n   </em>\n   , the employer had imposed safety measures to address the very risk that caused the plaintiff's injury, hence negligence by the co-employee in carrying out that measure was deemed foreseeable. In\n   <em>\n    Fogerty\n   </em>\n   , there were no such measures in place. There, the employer \"failed to provide a safe manner and means\" to do the job of installing a fountain, and the Court found the employer should have reasonably foreseen that its employee might be negligent in deciding how to handle the installation on his own and that another employee might be injured as a result. 541 S.W.3d at 546-48. A similar case in which the Employer should have reasonably foreseen the negligence at issue and taken measures to prevent it was also discussed in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff in\n   that case,\n   <em>\n    Kelso v. W.A.

The\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   Court distinguished itself and the above cases from other cases in which it was held that a co-employee did have an independent duty, finding that the negligence in those other cases was not reasonably foreseeable.

But here there is no such difficulty. Here, the co-employee's alleged negligence in directing or allowing the plaintiff to mop the bleachers without installing the guardrails provided by the employer is precisely the type of risk deemed reasonably foreseeable by the Supreme Court. The danger of falling off the bleachers was a known risk that existed at this workplace, and the employer attempted to address it by providing guardrails. Plaintiff maintains that the employer therefore fulfilled its duty to provide a safe workplace and the Defendants' independent, separate and distinct duty \"arose when [they] withdrew from [Plaintiff] the use of the safety rails provided by the employer while ordering and directing him to mop the bleachers in a known dangerous manner, creating the hazardous condition which directly resulted in [Plaintiff's] injuries.\" But that argument completely misses the point. The point is not whether the co-employees failed to follow the safety measure the employer provided, but whether that failure was reasonably foreseeable: \"What matters, and the only thing that matters ... is whether the duty the co-employee breached was part of the employer's duty to protect employees from reasonably foreseeable risks in the workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655965\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/315/#p324\">\n    542 S.W.3d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   That a co-employee would fail to use the safety measures put in place by the employer is the very negligence the Supreme Court found to be reasonably foreseeable in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McComb\n   </em>\n   . Just as it was reasonably foreseeable that the co-employees would fail to follow the employer's rules for safe handling of power lines in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and for safe driving in inclement weather in\n   <em>\n    McComb\n   </em>\n   , it was reasonably foreseeable that the co-employees in this case would not use the guardrails. Moreover, here, it was not only\n   <em>\n    foreseeable\n   </em>\n   that the co-employees would negligently fail to install the guardrails, it had\n   <em>\n    actually occurred\n   </em>\n   many times in the past. It fact, it was common to mop without the guardrails when there were time constraints. Unlike the unusual and therefore unforeseeable negligence discussed above-such as violently shaking a compressor hose or suddenly and for no reason slamming down a shovel-mopping without guardrails was the norm when there were time constraints and it was something Plaintiff experienced multiple times. In short, Plaintiff has wholly failed to demonstrate any way for us to find this risk was unforeseeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because it was reasonably foreseeable that the guardrails would not be installed by its employees, the duty to protect Plaintiff from this risk was within the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace. There being no separate and distinct duty of the co-employee Defendants here, Plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law.
