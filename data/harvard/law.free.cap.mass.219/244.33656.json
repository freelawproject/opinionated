He did work for various persons in Pittsfield and that vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Pierce owned a coal yard in Pittsfield, where he did a retail coal business. At different times in 1911, 1912 and 1913, Pierce employed Cheevers to deliver his [Pierce\u2019s] coal with his [Cheevers\u2019s] horse and team. The course of business was for Cheevers to come to the yard with his horse and team, put the coal into bags and lift them into his cart, or fill his cart in bulk from the chute; Cheevers \u201cusually\u201d was helped in doing this by a laborer employed by Pierce; Pierce gave Cheevers written slips with the names and addresses of the purchasers of the coal, and with directions \u201cto assist in carrying and putting the coal into the houses;\u201d and the man who helped Cheevers in loading the coal at the yard went with him to help in putting the coal into the houses. This helper was paid by Pierce. Cheevers was paid $5 a day for himself and his team. Pierce \"hired Cheevers for this general work for no fixed duration of time and for no specified job.\u201d When Pierce wanted Cheevers he would say to him, \u201cI want you to come up and help me,\u201d and when asked by the committee of arbitration whether Cheevers would have a right to send another man, Pierce replied, \u201cNo, I wanted Cheevers, because he knew how to handle coal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">As we construe the record, the accident happened on February 25, 1913, though in one place in the record it is stated \u00abthat it happened on February 28, 1913. On this day Cheevers fell from his cart while delivering coal. One of Cheevers\u2019s men tried to do the work for Pierce on the following day in Cheevers\u2019s place, but was not able to do it to Pierce\u2019s satisfaction; and Cheevers\u2019s horse and team and man were not employed further. The last period Cheevers worked for Pierce (that is to say the period here in question) was on February 7, 8, 10, 11,12,13,15 and 25. The last period before that was on February 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, 1912. In addition, the arbitration committee made this further finding, to wit: \u201cCheevers worked the same as any other of Pierce\u2019s regular men, under his orders, loading, driving, and putting in coal.\u201d The committee decided \u201cthat in doing this work, Cheevers was so under the direction and control of Pierce, that the relation between them was that of master and servant,\u201d and made an award in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Industrial Accident Board, on review of this decision of the committee of arbitration, made the following decision: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Board, upon the facts found by the committee, believes that an error of law was made in the conclusion of the committee and accordingly reverses its decision. This reversal is made in accordance with the decisions in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>212 Mass. 102, at page 107; <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Franey, </em>205 Mass. 413; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>204 Mass. 110; <em>Delorey </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>185 Mass. 126; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>181 Mass. 416, at pages 418, 419. Cheevers, the injured man in this case, was in the general business of teaming, as a proprietor on his own account, owning horses and wagons and employing men to drive and work with them. According to the above decisions, and as stated with particular clearness in <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Franey </em>and <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>it is held to be an implied understanding that the proprietor of such a teaming business retains the control of his horses and wagons when in use, and of their loading and unloading, and is therefore an independent contractor in doing such work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Cheevers has contended that by reason of the special finding made by the committee, this case is taken out of the ordinary rule (applied in <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Franey </em>and <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, ubi supra), </em>and is brought within the decision in <em>Linnehan </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>137 Mass. 123. We do not find it necessary to come to a decision upon that contention because we are of opinion that on the facts found by the committee Cheevers\u2019s employment was casual.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The meaning of this clause was considered at length in <em>Gaynor\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 86. In addition to what was said there it may be of importance (in determining whether in a particular case the \u201cemployment is but casual\u201d) to have in mind the apparent reason for this limitation upon the class of persons who are entitled to the benefits of the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The scheme created by the workmen\u2019s compensation act is a scheme of insurance in which the premiums to be paid by the employer are based upon the wages paid by him to his employees. It may have been thought impracticable to work out a scheme of insurance if persons who are only occasionally employed are to be included among those insured. This limitation was repealed by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 13.'</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Both on the reasoning in <em>Gaynor\u2019s Case </em>and having in mind the reason for this limitation, we are of opinion that Cheevers\u2019s employment was but casual. In <em>Howard\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>404, the employee was continuously employed, though not by the same employer, and for that reason the employment was not an employment which was \u201cbut casual.\u201d For a similar case see <em>Sabella </em>v. <em>Brazileiro, </em>91 Atl. Rep. 1032. In <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>De Grottola, </em>56 Vroom, 444, and in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Payne Brothers, </em>56 Vroom, 446, the employment was, or could be found to have been, employment for an indefinite period, and therefore not casual.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
