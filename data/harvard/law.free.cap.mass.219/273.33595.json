Writ dated January 17, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\">The declaration alleged that the defendant\u2019s son Flam was a minor sixteen years of age and was not a proper person to have possession and control of a gun, which the defendant well knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, and that the defendant negligently gave to his son Flam and suffered him to have in his possession and control a gun and ammunition to-be fired from it, and that Flam on December 3, 1910, negligently fired the gun and shot and wounded the plaintiff\u2019s son Joseph Sousa, junior, who in consequence thereof suffered in body and mind and died on December 28, 1910, whereby the plaintiff was put to great expense for medical and other care and attendance and was deprived of the wages and services of his son, who was about fifteen years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">The answer was a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. The character of the evidence and the essential facts which could have been found upon it are described and stated in the opinion. It appeared that Flam\u2019s full name was Flam Correa Irome and that he often was called Flam Correa. One Donohue, a police officer of the town of Somerset, who was called as a witness by the plaintiff, was asked the question, \u201cDo you know what the reputation of Flam Correa was as to the use of a gun at the time of the shooting?\u201d Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, he answered, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d He then was asked, \u201cWhat was his reputation as to the use of a gun? \u201d and, subject to a like exception, answered, \u201cHis reputation was that he handled this gun in a very careless manner at different times in the neighborhood.\u201d On cross-examination the witness testified that he heard one Thurber say \u201cthat Flam\u2019s reputation was bad before the shoot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ing as to the manner of handling a gun,\u201d and that one Butler \u201cmade complaint to him; that this was about the time of the shooting; that he did not go to his father about it.\u201d He then was asked, \u201cThurber and Butler before this accident both told you that Flam was handling a gun about there?\u201d and answered, \u201cOn or about.\u201d Being asked, \u201cOn or about the time of the shooting? \u201d he answered, \u201cYes, they are two of the men. I don\u2019t know as I recall now any others.\u201d Then he was asked the final question, referred to in the opinion, \u201cYou cannot say that these men came to you before this accident and told you, can you? and be sure of it?\u201d and answered, \u201cNo, positively no.\u201d Thurber and Butler both had testified as witnesses for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant, among other rulings which were made, asked the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-6\">\u201c1. Upon the whole case the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">\u201c8. If the plaintiff knew the boys and that they had gone off into the woods with the guns, and could have prevented them, he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">The judge refused to make either of these rulings. In regard to the subject matter of the ruling numbered 8, the judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIt is said by one of the witnesses, or claimed by somebody in the course of the trial, that the father of the boy who is dead met them when they were on their way on a hunting trip, and saw the boys going off with the gun; and it is claimed that you should say that if he did permit his boy to go in that way, that, in itself, was a careless thing to do, and so connected with the boy\u2019s later injury that the father should not be permitted to recover. I leave that whole question to you. If any careless act on the part of the boy or on the part of the father, who is bringing this suit, contributed to the boy\u2019s accident and injury, then he could not recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\">In regard to the evidence of reputation the judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201cBut on that I ought to say, if the police officer\u2019s testimony means that because of this shooting, or as a result of investigation after the shooting, he discovered things as to the boy then, then that reputation and evidence ought not to go in at all. It is only if the boy had a reputation for being a careless boy with a gun before this accident, that it becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>competent evidence; then only on one theory, not at all to prove the boy was careless in this case, it would not be competent on that issue, only on this, if there was such a reputation, such talk in the community, it is for you to say whether the father would or would not have had knowledge of it if people generally had; that is, as bearing on the father\u2019s knowledge of the reputation. If you find it bears at all on the case, it bears only on that issue of whether the father knew that the boy was careless with a gun.\u201d The defendant excepted to this part of the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $900; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-6\"><em>A. S. Phillips, (T. C. Crowther </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-7\">\u2019 <em>R. A.

They could find that the defendant was negligent in allowing his son Flam to have the gun and ammunition, that Flam was not a fit person to be trusted with articles of so dangerous a character, and that Flam\u2019s act was either wrongful or negligent and was one which the defendant ought to have foreseen and guarded against. In that event the defendant was liable for the natural consequences that followed directly from his negligence. <em>Horan </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>217 Mass. 185, 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">There was evidence of the due care of both the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The evidence as to Flam\u2019s reputation about the use of a gun was admitted properly upon the question whether the defendant knew or ought to have known that it was unsafe and dangerous to allow Flam to have and use a gun. The jury were told that this evidence could be considered only if it showed that before the accident Flam had the reputation of being careless with a gun, and that in any event it could be considered only upon the issue of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of that fact. That comes within the principle of such cases as <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>150 Mass. 439; <em>Killam, </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>153 Mass. 502, 506; <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Canning, </em>180 Mass. 461; and <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Coyle, </em>187 Mass. 136, 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">The police officer could testify as to that reputation. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>testified that he knew it. His testimony on cross-examination did not show conclusively that all his knowledge had been acquired since the accident. His answer, \u201cNo, positively no,\u201d to the final question whether he could say that his information was before the accident, may have been shown by his manner and his emphasis on the words to mean that he could not say this positively. On that, the inference was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
