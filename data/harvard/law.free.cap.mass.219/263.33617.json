The defendant offered no evidence. <em>Held, </em>that findings were warranted that the team was the defendant\u2019s and was being driven by one who was his servant and who was acting within the scope of his employment.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-5\">Cbosbt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-V\">This is an action to recover for personal injuries received by the plaintiff through coming in collision with a horse and wagon when she was crossing a street in Fall River.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There was evidence that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and that the driver of the team was negligent. The only questions presented are whether the team was owned by the defendant, and whether at the time of the accident it was driven by his servant acting within the scope of his employment.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The plaintiff testified that the defendant came to her house the day after the accident and told her that the team which injured her belonged to him and that the driver at the time was \u201chis boy.\u201d She further testified: \u201cHe asked me if I heard the boy call out,\u201d and \u201cHe said the boy called out to me.\u201d There was evidence that the boy was twelve or thirteen years of age; that this team was seen on Harrison Street between half past six and seven o\u2019clock on the evening of the accident, and then was being loaded with old mortar which was taken from a house on that street; that at the time of the accident, which occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>at the corner of Covel and County Streets, a little before seven o\u2019clock that evening, there was a load of lime and plaster on the wagon, which weighed about twelve hundred pounds; that the team was seen turning from County Street into Covel Street, and \u201cthat there was a public dump on Covel Street near where the accident happened.\u201d There also was evidence that at the time of the accident the wagon had on it the name, \u201cI. Pokrass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant rested without offering any evidence. If the jury believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony a finding that the defendant owned the team was well warranted, aside from the evidence as to the name which was on the wagon. There was no direct evidence to show that the driver of the team was in the defendant\u2019s employ except that the defendant referred to him as \u201cmy boy.\u201d We think the jury properly might have inferred from this evidence that the driver was the servant of the defendant, as similarly might have been inferred had the driver been a man of mature years and the defendant had spoken of him as \u201cmy man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Upon the evidence whether the driver was acting within the scope of his employment, these facts might have been found: That this team was owned by the defendant and was driven by his servant; that shortly before the accident it was loaded with refuse at a house on Harrison Street and was being driven to the public dump on Covel Street when the accident occurred; and that the next day after the accident the defendant called upon the plaintiff and, knowing that she had been struck by his team, told her that the driver called out to her, and asked her if she did not hear him. It will be observed that he did not refer to the employment of the boy or to the work in which he was engaged at the time of the accident. Apparently his interview with the plaintiff was for the purpose of making the assertion that the boy had warned her of the approach of the team, and inferentially that the accident was due not to any fault on the part of the driver, but to her own carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In view of this conversation, of the work which was being done with the team just before the accident, of the presence of the name upon the wagon, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, the jury were warranted in finding that at the time the plaintiff was injured the team was owned by the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that it was driven by his agent and servant, and that the latter was acting within the scope of his employment. <em>D\u2019Addio </em>v. <em>Hinckley Rendering Co. </em>213 Mass. 465.</p>\n<summary id=\"b292-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b292-7\"><em>D.
