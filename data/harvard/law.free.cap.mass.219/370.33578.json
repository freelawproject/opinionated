A master found that the defendant elected to hold the land as mortgagee in possession, and not as the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, until a certain day when he sold the land as owner in fee, both he and the purchaser acting in good faith, and received the purchase money, that the plaintiff relied on the defendant\u2019s election to hold as mortgagee in possession and on the consequent continuance of the plaintiff\u2019s right to redeem. <em>Held, </em>that, even if, as seemed to be the case, the foreclosure proceedings were sufficient to give the defendant a good title which he subsequently conveyed to the purchaser of the property, yet as between the plaintiff and him he was bound by his election to hold as mortgagee in possession so far as the question of an accounting was concerned until he parted with all his interest in the land and no longer could be regarded as mortgagee in possession.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-11\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on January 16 and amended on June 25, 1913, also amended on January 2, 1914, by the alleged owner of certain real estate in Medford to set aside the foreclosure of a mortgage made by the plaintiff to the defendant Carro and by him assigned to the defendant Forster, also, by amendment, for an accounting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-12\">The case was referred to Ralph W.

The case is before us upon appeals by the defendant Carro from the order overruling his exceptions to the master\u2019s report and from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">In the course of the proceedings the plaintiff abandoned her claim to be entitled to redeem; and the bill was held only for an accounting between the plaintiff and Carro. The first, second, third, fourth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and twelfth exceptions relate to the effect of the foreclosure proceedings of September 9, 1912. The defendant Carro contended in substance that these proceedings worked a valid foreclosure and that he became thereby the owner in fee, and that the accounting should be only up to that date. The plaintiff contended that these proceedings did not work a valid foreclosure, and further, that, even if they did, Carro had elected to hold as a mortgagee in possession. The master found that Carro elected to hold as a mortgagee in possession. We think this general finding justified by the subsidiary findings in the report. It further appears in the report that this was the understanding of the plaintiff, and that she relied upon the right to redeem as still outstanding. As between the plaintiff and Carro, the election should stand so far as respects the question of accounting, at least so long as Carro held the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">But on October 7, 1912, Carro sold the property to one Yuill, free from all incumbrances except certain first mortgages and taxes. He sold as owner in fee. The master has found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sale was \u201c a <em>bona fide </em>transaction entered into in good faith by both parties,\u201d and that the consideration was $1,250, which was received by Carro partly in cash with a note for the balance which has since been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">By this transaction Carro parted with all his interest in the land. He no longer could be regarded as holding as mortgagee in possession. Under these circumstances equity requires that up to and including the sale to Yuill he must be held to his agreement with the plaintiff as holding as mortgagee in possession, so far as respects the period to be covered by the accounting. And that would be so, even if, as contended by the defendant (and we think rightly), the foreclosure proceedings were sufficient to enable him to convey the fee to Yuill. The result is that the third, fourth and twelfth exceptions should be overruled, as not in accordance with law, and the first, second, seventh, eighth and ninth as immaterial. The sixth exception is untenable and was properly refused. Interest was to be paid on the mortgage note at the rate of six per cent per year. The tenth and eleventh exceptions also should be overruled. The error in overruling the fifth exception is corrected by the final decree. The result is that the final decree should be affirmed, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
