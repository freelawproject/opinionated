L. c. 76, \u00a7 8, the defense relied upon was that what the defendant had done was as a clairvoyant and was within the exception established by \u00a7 9 of the statute. There was evidence that the defendant, when consulted by a patient, went into a trance, while in the trance gave advice, and on coming out of the trance furnished the patient with medicine. The judge instructed the jury that the defendant, although a clairvoyant, was not within the exception specified in \u00a7 9 if, \u201cfor the cure, prevention or alleviation of any pain, disease or ailment of those seeking treatment from the defendant, she prescribed or directed any drug or medicine, with the expectation of receiving compensation therefor.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the instruction was right.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-10\">Complaint, received and sworn to in the Police Court of Springfield on December 31, 1913, charging that the defendant, without being lawfully authorized or registered to practice medicine in this Commonwealth, held herself out as such a practitioner and practiced and attempted to practice medicine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-11\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C.

L. c. 76, \u00a7 8. Her defense was that what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>she did was done by her as a clairvoyant within the last clause of R. L. c. 76, \u00a7 9. The Commonwealth introduced evidence that two men called on her for treatment; that while asleep, holding the patient\u2019s hands, she gave advice to the first and told the second the nature of his sickness; and that in both cases she furnished the patients with medicine for which she was paid. The defendant took the stand in her own behalf and testified that she was not learned in diseases or in medicine; that when consulted by a patient she went into a trance and that while in the trance she was told by \u201coccult force\u201d what the matter with the patient was and what remedy to prescribe; and that on coming out of the trance she prescribed what had been revealed to her while she was in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The judge instructed the jury \u201cthat, although she [the defendant] be a clairvoyant, in her line of practice, she is not within the exception specified in the statute, if, for the cure, prevention or alleviation of any pain, disease or ailment of those seeking treatment from the defendant, she prescribed or directed any drug or medicine, with the expectation of receiving compensation therefor.\u201d To this an exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Possibly the word \u201cclairvoyant \u201d might be interpreted to include one who hears communications made by \u201coccult force\u201d while in a trance. But in the accurate and indeed in the ordinary meaning of the word it is confined to a person who sees, while in a trance, things which by reason of distance or for other reasons are not ordinarily visible. We are of opinion that \u00a7 9 of R. L. c. 76, in creating exceptions to the general rule established by \u00a7 8 of that act, is to be construed strictly. It follows that the word \u201cclairvoyant\u201d must be construed accurately. So construed, it does not authorize a defendant to prescribe medicines revealed to his hearing by \u201coccult force\u201d while in a trance. The instruction given was right and the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
