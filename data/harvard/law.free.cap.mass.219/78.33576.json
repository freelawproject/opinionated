Henry, the original defendant, died on March 1, 1902, and his death was suggested to the court. On June 16,1911, the death of Jesse A. Taft, the original plaintiff, was suggested to the court, in a petition asking that Royal C. Taft, the sole heir of the original plaintiff and entitled to all his rights in the land in question, be substituted as plaintiff. This was allowed. On November 5, 1913, a motion was allowed admitting as the defendants Alice J. Henry, the widow of the original defendant .and the administratrix of his estate, and also his children, who with his widow were his only heirs at law. On December 8, 1911, the case was referred to Frank N. Thayer, Esquire, of Blackstone, \u201cas master, to hear the parties and their evidence, and report his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>findings to the court together with such facts and questions of law as either party may request.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">The material facts reported by the master are stated in the opinion. The case was heard upon the pleadings and the master\u2019s report, and the defendants\u2019 exceptions thereto, by <em>Ratigan, </em>J., who made a final decree overruling the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the master\u2019s report and confirming that report, declaring that the plaintiff, Royal C. Taft, was the true owner of the premises described in the plaintiff\u2019s bill and the same that were described in the deed of Stephen Cook to the defendant Albert F. Henry, dated March 7, 1876, and ordering that the defendant Alice J. Henry, as statutory heir of the original defendant, Albert F. Henry, deceased, and the other defendants, as the heirs at law of said Albert F. Henry, dec\u00e9ased, should deliver to the plaintiff, Royal C. Taft, a deed conveying all the right, title and interest which the said Albert F. Henry \u00e1t the time of his decease had in and to the above described premises free from all incumbrances made or suffered by Albert F. Henry or the above named defendants; and further ordering that the plaintiff\u2019s costs be taxed in the stun of $142.50 as in an action at law. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-7\"><em>R.

Henry, is defended now by his widow and administratrix and by his heirs at law. Henry, in March, 1876, having taken a deed of the premises described in the bill and having paid the sum of $450 therefor, gave shortly afterwards to one Southwick a bond by which he bound himself to convey those premises to Southwick on demand, one year after date, on payment of the same sum with interest. Three years later, in 1879, Southwick gave to one Hobbs a quitclaim deed of the premises for the consideration stated therein of $200. More than two years later, in 1881, Hobbs gave to Amariah A. Taft a quitclaim deed of the premises for the consideration stated therein of $30.50, which was an inadequate consideration. All these deeds were duly recorded, and Hobbs and Taft had' actual knowledge of the deed to Henry and of his bond to Southwick. Taft died some eleven years after the deed to him, never having demanded a conveyance from Henry. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>is his heir at law. When the bill was brought, nothing remained to be paid to Henry of the agreed sum of $450, or for interest, or for taxes paid by him; but it does not appear when the final payment of such sums was made to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On these facts, the plaintiff is entitled to have the premises conveyed to him by the defendants unless some matter of defense is shown. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Story, </em>132 Mass. 205, 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The defendants contend that the plaintiff, claiming under Southwick, is not entitled to a conveyance because Southwick, having himself bargained for the premises, caused them to be conveyed to Henry for the reason that he (Southwick) was at that time, as the master has found, \u201capprehensive that if he took title in himself to the premises . . . they would be either attached or levied on, either by reason of some pending execution obtained against him or some other legal liability he was under, and on account of this apprehension, to prevent his judgment or other creditors from getting any hold on this property and to ensure to himself the benefit of its purchase, he procured the deed of said premises to be made to said defendant Henry.\u201d It may be conceded that by this transaction Henry acquired an absolute title against Southwick; but that could not prevent Southwick from obtaining afterwards rights thereto from Henry or from enforcing such rights against Henry when obtained. The plaintiff\u2019s rights rest now upon the bond given by Henry to Southwick .and are independent of any fraud contemplated upon South-wick\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">It is not material whether the considerations for the conveyances from Southwick to Hobbs and from Hobbs to the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor were or were not adequate. It has not been shown how large a part of the amount to be paid to Henry then remained unpaid; it is not suggested that either of the conveyances was not made in good faith; and Henry could not complain that .Southwick\u2019s rights had passed to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The defense of loches cannot be maintained. We do not know when the right of the plaintiff accrued by the full payment of the .agreed price to Henry. Nor has the position of the defendants in any way been altered to their prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">None of the defendants\u2019 exceptions can be sustained. Those that relate to findings of fact must be overruled because the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>dence has not been reported. Those that relate to rulings of law are not open, because the master was only to find the facts and not to rule upon their legal effect. But so far as the questions raised are material, the defendants have had the full benefit of them in considering what decree should be entered upon the facts reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">What we have said covers everything that has been argued. The decree of the Superior Court must be affirmed with the costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
