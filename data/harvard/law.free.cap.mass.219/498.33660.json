It does not appear on the evidence when the aunt Florinda Petrozino, began to send money to the parents of Carlo Caliendo. She was on a visit to Italy about fourteen years ago and she had sent money to the mother before that time, and since, and apparently most of the money that she sent was after the death of the employee. All of the money so paid was in the form of a gratuity. The earnings of the sister, who was an apprentice, were hardly sufficient to support herself, and there is no evidence to show that any of her earnings were paid to the mother or sister, and we find that there was no dependency either upon the sister or upon the aunt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">\u201cWe find that the mother and Celia were totally dependent upon the wages of Carlo for support and we find that there is due from the insurer the amount of $4 a week from the date of the injury, to continue for a period of three hundred weeks one half to be paid to the administratrix for the benefit of the mother and one half to be paid to the sister, Celia Caliendo.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">The judge made a decree in accordance with the findings and decision of the board; and the insurer appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-8\"><em>V.

It was a question.of fact whether the mother and sister of the deceased employee to whose support he had contributed were wholly dependent upon him within the provisions of the statute. <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>198 Mass. 163. <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Niddrie &amp; Benhar Coal Co., Limited, </em>[1913] A.

The insurer, however, contends, that the six or seven cents a day earned by another sister who was a member of the family, and the remittances from time to time to the mother of various sums by an aunt of the decedent were sufficient to take the case out of the statute. But the findings, that the remittances were mere gratuities, and that the pittance earned by the sister was hardly sufficient for her own maintenance and that no part was paid to the dependents who never relied upon either for aid, eliminates those relatives as contributing and dependable sources of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It being plain on the facts that during his life the mother and sister had no other source of income except his earnings, they rightly were found to have been wholly dependent upon the employee, and the rulings requested could not be given. <em>Pryce </em>v. <em>Penrikyber Navigation Colliery Co., Limited, </em>[1902] 1 K.
