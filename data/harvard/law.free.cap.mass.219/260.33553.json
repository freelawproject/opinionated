Writ dated February 4, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. Material facts are stated in the opinion. The only testimony on the matter of the making of the representation or promise was that of the plaintiff himself. At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked for a ruling that on all the evidence the verdict should be for the defendant. The ruling was refused. There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,700. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-7\"><em>A.

His contention is that taking the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as a whole, that evidence ought not to be believed and for that reason the judge ought to have directed the jury to return a verdict in his favor. There is nothing in that contention nor in the case relied upon by him <em>(Fay </em>v. <em>Alliance Ins. Co. </em>16 Gray, 455) in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
