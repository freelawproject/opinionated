The only question raised upon the insurer\u2019s appeal is whether he was entitled to any and what additional compensation for the injuries to his hands under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, St. 1911, c. 751, Part. II, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1913, c. 445. This amendment provides that the additional amounts to be paid \u201cin case of the loss of a hand, foot, thumb, finger or toe \u201d shall also be paid \u201cin case the injury is such that the hand, foot, thumb, finger or toe is not lost but is so injured as to be incapable of use: provided, that when the incapacity ceases the said additional payment shall also cease.\u201d The insurer contends that the words \u201cincapable of use\u201d require a total incapacity for use. Assuming this to be so, it has been found by the Industrial Accident Board, affirming the findings of the committee of arbitration, that the right hand of this employee \u201chas been so injured as to be incapable of use,\u201d and that the incapacity is permanent. If this finding was warranted upon the evidence, it is conclusive. <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 111. <em>Nickerson\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 158, 160. We cannot say that it was unwarranted. The hand was cut across and most of the flexor tendons were severed. Those in the thumb were cut. A physician testified that the hand was permanently disabled. The board was not required to accept as decisive the testimony of the physician called by the insurer. Even that testimony went little farther than to say that some things might be carried on the thumb as a hook, and that a steel splint might be used which would not hurt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the hand, and that this would be much better than amputation. But we find no evidence that even with such an appliance there would be any real ability to use the hand. Certainly it could be found that the normal use of the hand was wholly gone, and so that the hand was \u201cso injured as to be incapable of use.\u201d The incapacity of use need not be tantamount to an actual severance of the hand; it is enough that the normal use of the hand has been taken entirely away. This is the reasoning of <em>Garcelon </em>v. <em>Commercial Travelers\u2019 Eastern Accident Association, </em>184 Mass. 8, and <em>Genest </em>v. <em>L\u2019Union St. Joseph, </em>141 Mass. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Still further compensation was allowed to Meley on the finding that the little finger of his left hand was so injured as to be incapable of use. Plainly the finding of fact was warranted. But the insurer contends that the hands are not to be considered separately, and that additional compensation cannot be given for the incapacity to use one finger of the other hand. The insurer\u2019s argument has some plausibility; but the plain words of the statute are against it. It is settled that the statute provisions are to be construed liberally for the protection of the injured employee, whose rights to compensation either at common law or under the employers\u2019 liability act (St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7\u00a7 127 <em>et </em>seq.) it has taken away. <em>Donovan\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 76, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">It cannot be said that this appeal was prosecuted without any reasonable ground; and we ought not to charge \u201cthe whole cost of the proceedings\u201d upon the insurer, under the provisions of St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 14. Accordingly we need not consider whether the words \u201cwhole cost\u201d mean all the expenses which reasonably have been incurred, or include only the amounts which would be included in the taxable costs of ordinary civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The decree of the Superior Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
