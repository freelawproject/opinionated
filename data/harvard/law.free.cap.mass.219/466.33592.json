The evidence is described in the opinion. Pease, there mentioned, who was driving the defendant\u2019s automobile at the time of the collision, was called as a witness for. the defendant and testified that at the time of the accident he was employed by the defendant as a repair man in his garage at Hartford, and that on the morning of the accident he had asked the defendant\u2019s permission to take the automobile for a pleasure drive for himself and his wife, that he drove to Warehouse Point in Connecticut, where he stopped at the Saltonstall Inn and went in to see one Loftus, the bartender at that inn, and had some talk with him and that he knew that Loftus had a lady friend. The defendant then offered to show what the conversation was between the witness and Loftus, stating that he offered to show that Pease, the witness, invited Loftus to take his lady friend to go out to drive with him in this car on this day for pleasure. This evidence was objected to by the plaintiffs and was excluded by the judge, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to give the following instructions to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-3\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If the defendant was not driving the car or in the car at the time of the accident the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">\u201c3. If the defendant was not driving the car or in the car at the time of the accident there is no sufficient evidence to show that the driver of the car was engaged in the defendant\u2019s business and the plaintiffs cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">\u201c6. If the defendant was not in the car at the time of the accident, and the car was driven by Pease for his own purposes, the plaintiffs cannot recover, even if Pease had been granted permission to use the car for his own purposes by the defendant.\u201d \u201c8.

The judge stated to the jury that he did not give the eighth instruction requested because it was a question of fact for the jury. The charact\u00e9r of the charge is described in the opinion. Among other matters, the judge instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-10\">\u201cEven if the defendant said to either of the Ouimettes that Pease upon the day of the accident requested permission from the defendant to take the car for the purpose of demonstrating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>same to a possible customer, yet if the fact be that Pease did not take out the car for any such purpose, and did not in fact demonstrate said car for any such purpose and the defendant was not in the car at the time of the accident, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">\u201cThat is, the whole thing turns on the question, whether the defendant was there or not, whether Pease, in taking the car and running it, was carrying out the orders of the defendant and acting within the scope of his employment. That is the whole question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">The jury returned a verdict' for the plaintiff Joseph Ouimette in the sum of $375, for the plaintiff George Ouimette in the sum of $100 and for the plaintiff Elizabeth Donnelly in the sum of $50.

There was evidence that the plaintiffs who were in the carriage were in the exercise of due care, and that the driver of the automobile was negligent in the running of it at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The plaintiffs introduced evidence that the defendant himself was in the automobile at the time, and the defendant introduced testimony to the contrary. On the issue thereby raised there is no question of law before us. The evidence offered by the defendant also tended to show that the automobile was being driven by one Pease, who was in his employ; but that Pease was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. The defendant requested certain rulings on this issue and the refusal to give the second and third raises the main question before us. That is, in substance, was there evidence to warrant a finding that the driver of the car was acting within the scope of his employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">If the verdict for the plaintiffs was based on this issue, the jury must have rejected much of the testimony of the defendant and of Pease, the two persons whose relation to each other was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>involved. The remaining testimony on the question was meagre, and perhaps necessarily so. It consisted chiefly of statements alleged to have been made by the defendant himself on the morning after the accident, and near the scene thereof, to the effect that Pease was one of his best men, that Pease and himself did all of the demonstrating for the defendant, and that Pease had told him on the day of the accident that he \u201cwanted to take the car out to demonstrate it to somebody, ... to show it to a party,\u201d and he, the defendant, \u201clet him take it.\u201d In addition to this, however, the jury properly might infer that when Pease later in the day took the car from the garage he was acting in pursuance of the purpose so expressed by him, and as expressly authorized by the defendant. So far as appears he never drove the defendant\u2019s cars except as a demonstrator. As probably is usual in the process of demonstrating an automobile, no limits were prescribed by the defendant in this alleged conversation as to where Pease should take the car, how he should drive it, or when he should return. In view of all this testimony and the reasonable inferences we cannot say that there was not evidence to be submitted to the jury on the question whether Pease was doing the defendant\u2019s work, and acting within the scope of his employment on the evening of the accident. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Denholm, </em>213 Mass. 576. <em>McKeever </em>v. <em>Ratcliffe, </em>218 Mass. 17. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Arnold, ante, </em>160.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The second and third requests were refused rightly, and the eighth was adequately covered in the full and correct charge. On the evidence the issues were, Was Pease using the car in the work of, and by the permission of, the defendant? or Was he using it for his own pleasure and without permission? There was no evidence that he \u201chad been granted permission to use the car for his own purposes,\u201d and the judge properly refused to give the \u2022 sixth request without modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The evidence of self-serving statements made by Pease in Connecticut on the morning of the accident was not admissible on any ground suggested by the defendant. His visit to the Saltonstall Inn was not material to the issues tried, and accordingly his declarations made at that place could not be admitted as verbal acts or as part of the <em>res gestae. Whitney </em>v. <em>Houghton, 125 </em>Mass. 451, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
