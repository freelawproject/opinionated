Writ dated January 16, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-12\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. The facts which could have been found upon the evidence are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make certain rulings, among which were the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201c1. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-3\">\u201c2. There is no sufficient evidence in the case to warrant a finding that the defendant or any one for whose acts and omissions it is responsible, was negligent, and, therefore, a verdict must be returned for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-4\">\u201c8. If there was any negligence in the maintenance or operation of the automatic regulators at the town line, it was not the negligence of the defendant, but that of the metropolitan water and sewerage board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">\u201c9. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant ought to have foreseen the possibility of the automatic regulator of the metropolitan water and sewerage board .failing to work properly and to have guarded against such danger.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-6\">The judge refused to make these and other rulings requested by the defendant and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $250. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-7\"><em>H. W.

The standpipe, even if used in a dual capacity, formed part of the water system, and the water on storage was the property of the defendant, subject to its sole management and control. It having voluntarily undertaken for its own corporate benefit a commercial enterprise, the defendant was required to use reasonable care in the maintenance and use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>standpipe to avoid injury to the contiguous estate of the plaintiff. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Westborough, </em>151 Mass. 174. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>188 Mass. 595, 599, and cases cited. <em>Farrigan </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>193 Mass. 147, 150, 151. See R. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 38-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s expert, whose qualifications were for the presiding judge to determine, is sufficient to show, that if an overflow pipe had been provided the water would have been discharged on the defendant\u2019s own land, and the jury could have found that this device was feasible and that if it had been used the plaintiff\u2019s property would not have been damaged. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 527. <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Hazen Confectionery Co. </em>211 Mass. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The fact that previously no overflow had occurred cannot as matter of law exonerate the defendant. Its freedom from liability depended upon the discharge of its duty of exercising due care in the construction of the standpipe for the uses for which it was designed as well as in proper supervision after the water system had been put in operation. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Westborough, </em>151 Mass. 174, 182. <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>126 Mass. 324. It is doubtless true, as the defendant contends, that, if the regulation valve over which it had no control had not become clogged, the water level would have remained ten feet below the top of the standpipe. But it was unquestioned that if foreign substances floating in the water passed into the valve it would cease to work automatically and would leak, flooding the standpipe. The jury accordingly were warranted in finding that the defendant reasonably ought to have anticipated and guarded against this condition. <em>Cormo </em>v. <em>Boston Bridge Works, </em>205 Mass. 366, 369. It could not under the circumstances store this body of water without at least using the care of an ordinarily prudent and careful man to prevent its escape to the land of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The defendant\u2019s requests in so far as they were not covered by the instructions coiild not have been given, and, no error of law appearing, the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\"> The plaintiff-testified \u201cthat she bought water from the defendant and paid for the same by payment other than real estate taxes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
