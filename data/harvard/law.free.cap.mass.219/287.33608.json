Northeasterly and from twelve to fifteen hundred feet distant from the pond, and on this water shed, is the defendant\u2019s glue factory. He has been engaged in the manufacture of fish glue at this place since 1901, and on a location near by for twenty years before that time. Although the defendant Benjamin F. Elwell has died since the hearings were held, and the administratrix of his estate has entered her appearance, we shall refer to him as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The waste water from the factory is drained into two disposal basins, where it is exposed to evaporation and absorption in the adjacent soil. A drain to take care of the overflow, when both basins are full, leads from Basin No. 2 into Cat Tail swamp, about fourteen hundred feet from the pond. The intervening land has a general slope toward the pond, is largely wooded, and the character of the soil is what is known as swampy peat and muck, with practically no filtering capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">This bill in equity is brought to enjoin the defendant under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the provisions of R. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 124, 126.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The master to whom the case was referred <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> viewed the premises; and at the hearings before him experts testified, chemical analyses were submitted, and the records of the State board of health were used. See R. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 113. The plaintiffs filed exceptions to the report, based on the failure of the master to find certain facts as requested by them; but these must be overruled as we have not before us the evidence on which the findings were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The statute in question provides prompt injunctive relief where polluting matter is discharged (1) into a pond used as a source of water supply; (2) upon its banks or shore, if any filter basin so used is there situated; or (3) into any feeder of such pond within twenty miles above the point where such supply is taken. It is apparent from the master\u2019s report, however, that there is no feeder or tributary flowing into Cape Pond. Admittedly there is no filter basin located there. And his fifteenth finding, namely, \u201cAnalyses of the waters of the pond do not disclose evidence of the presence of impurities from the waste from the defendant\u2019s factory,\u201d negatives the contention that the defendant has discharged polluting matter into the pond itself. In other words, the plaintiffs have failed to make out a case under the section of the statute which they invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">It may be added that the master found that no action, with reference to the defendant\u2019s factory or business, has been taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>by the board of health of the town of Rockport under the provisions of R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 91; nor by the State board of health under R. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 108, 109, regulating the exercise of offensive trades.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b315-6\"><em>J. M.
