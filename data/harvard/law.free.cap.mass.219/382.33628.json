Writ in the District Court of Southern Essex dated February 7, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hamilton, </em>J., without a jury. The following facts appeared in evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-11\">The plaintiff was born on February 27, 1893. The plaintiff\u2019s mother owned a house in Lynn and the land on which it stood. In October, 1911, she mortgaged the house and lot to the defendant for $2,100. The defendant issued to her eleven shares of its stock, which she pledged to the defendant to secure the mortgage. Eleven dollars a month was to be paid the bank on the shares and $9.63 a month as interest, making $20.63 payable monthly. The mother had a bank book on which the eleven shares were carried and on which the monthly payments of $20.63 were credited. Besides these shares the mother held five unpledged shares in the defendant on which $5 a month was payable to the defendant. These shares were carried on another book and the depositor or shareholder could withdraw at any time the money paid on the unpledged shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>On December 26, 1911, the plaintiff\u2019s mother died intestate. The plaintiff then was seventeen years and ten months of age. After her mother\u2019s death and before the appointment of an administrator, the plaintiff, using her own money, kept up the payments to the bank on both the pledged and the unpledged shares, paying a total of $347.59. No administrator was appointed until January, 1913, after which no payments were made to the defendant. The defendant paid over to the administrator the money that had been deposited on the unpledged shares. In January, 1914, the defendant foreclosed the mortgage, after declaring forfeited the eleven pledged shares and applying the sums paid on them toward the payment of the mortgage debt. The property was sold on foreclosure for $2,060. After paying the amount remaining due on the mortgage, the interest and the foreclosure expenses, there remained $11.93, which the bank paid to the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\">The plaintiff after her mother\u2019s death lived in the house until the foreclosure, taking lodgers and boarders. At first she did a fair business, but after May, 1912, did not make expenses. Her younger brother lived with her. Her father ceased to live there and did not support them. In making payments to the defendant after her mother\u2019s death, the plaintiff would go to the bank with her mother\u2019s two books on the first Wednesday of each month and present them with the money either to the defendant\u2019s treasurer or to one of its clerks, who would take the money, credit the payments on the books and hand them back to her. She said nothing about her mother\u2019s death until June, 1912, when she talked about it to the defendant\u2019s treasurer and asked him whether she would be responsible for the payments. He replied that she had better continue them until an administrator was appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings, which were disposed of by the judge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">\u201c1. That the plaintiff could legally act as the agent of the estate of the mortgagor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">The judge refused to make this ruling, and said, \u201cI find that the plaintiff did not so act but acted for herself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That, where payments were made by the plaintiff as agent for the mortgagor and such payments were continued without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>notice on the part of the defendant, the defendant had the right to assume that the same relationship continued and said payments were valid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">The judge refused to make this ruling, and said, \"The defendant\u2019s treasurer who had charge of its business did not testify and there was no evidence that he did not know of the death of the mortgagor and that the plaintiff was making the payments from her own money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">\u201c3. That, as to the payments on the pledged shares, the minor having a beneficial interest in the estate, said payments were beneficial to her and there can be no recovery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\">The judge refused to make this ruling, and said, \u201cI find that these payments were not beneficial to the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">\u201c4. That the payments made by the plaintiff without the knowledge of her ownership of the money or claim thereon must be construed to be a loan by her to the estate for the benefit of which the payments were made and liability, if any, exists against the estate and not against this defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">The judge refused to make this ruling, and said, \u201cI find that the payments were not made by way of loan as indicated by this request.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\">The defendant also asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-11\">\"5. That, the plaintiff being informed of all of the facts, any mistake was a mistake at law and there can be no recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-12\">\u201c6. That the act of the defendant in receiving the money and crediting it to the account of the owner of the shares was an act of agency and there can be no recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-13\">\u201c7. That the payment by the plaintiff was an implied instruction by the plaintiff to credit the amount so paid to the owner of the shares and on such credit being given the transaction is complete and there can be no recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-14\">\u201c8. That, the defendant having paid out the money paid and credited to the owner of the shares in the ordinary course of business and without knowledge of any claim of the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-15\">\"9. That, the money paid by the plaintiff having been derived from carrying on the business of the owner of the shares, said money belonged to the estate of the deceased and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>payments were payments by said estate and there can be no recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-3\">\u201c 10. That the plaintiff in taking the property and business of the owner of the shares became an administrator <em>de son tort </em>and is not entitled to the income from said business, that said income belongs to the estate and payments therefrom are valid payments credited to the estate and there can be no recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">\u201c11. That on all of the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $354.54. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\"><em>A. B. Tolman, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-7\"><em>H. D. Linscott, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-8\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aps\">The judge before whom without a jury the case was tried found that in making the payments in question the plaintiff acted, not as the agent of her mother\u2019s estate, but for herself alone; that the payments were made from her own money; that they were not beneficial to her, and that they were not made by way of a loan to her mother\u2019s estate. All of these findings were warranted by the evidence. The plaintiff, being a minor at the time the payments were made, had the right to rescind the transactions even without putting the defendant <em>in statu quo. Simpson </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins Co. </em>184 Mass. 348, and cases cited. It follows that the first ten rulings requested were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">It is urged by the defendant that the practical effect of a decision that an institution like the defendant, having thousands of depositors, \u201ctakes payments from the hands of a minor at its peril,\u201d would be serious. The obvious answer to this is that if the defendant cannot safely do business under the general rules of law, it should close its business, and not that the law should be changed to meet its methods. The eleventh ruling requested was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
