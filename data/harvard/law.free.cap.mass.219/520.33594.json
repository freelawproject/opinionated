Williams, a widow, and for many years a resident of the defendant, died there on September 30, 1908, leaving the plaintiff, a son, as her only heir at law and next of kin. The plaintiff was appointed administrator of his mother\u2019s estate on November 20, 1908, and qualified as such administrator by filing a bond which was approved by the Probate Court for the Comity of Middlesex on the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The estate consisted of both real and personal property and in the years 1909 and 1910 the assessors of the defendant assessed a tax to the administrator based upon the amount of personal estate subject to taxation as shown by the administrator\u2019s inventory. The taxes for these two years were paid by the plaintiff as administrator. Before the first day of April, 1910, the plaintiff removed his legal residence from this Commonwealth to the city of Augusta in the State of Maine, where he has lived ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">On March 13, 1911, the plaintiff sent to the chairman of the board of assessors of the defendant a letter which was duly received reading as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">\u201cAugusta, March 13, 1911. Mr. William F. Stevens, Chairman Board of Assessors, Acton, Mass. Dear Sir: I beg to notify you that all of the personal property belonging to the estate of Margaret E. A. Williams has been distributed, none of it to an inhabitant of Massachusetts. Yours truly, Charles J. Williams, Administrator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">Before March 31, 1911, the plaintiff as administrator had paid all debts, expenses and charges of administration and inheritance taxes due the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and had transferred all the remaining stocks and other assets of the estate of his mother to himself as sole heir at law and next of kin, but had not filed any account in the Probate Court up to the date of the writ in this action. On or about April 10, 1911, the assessors gave notice to all citizens to bring in lists as required by St. 1909, c. 490, Part I, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, 43. No list was brought in by the plaintiff. The assessors of the defendant assessed to the plaintiff as administrator of said estate as of April 1, 1911, a tax on personal property only, amounting to $304.95. A bill for the tax was sent in due course to the plaintiff by the collector of taxes of the defendant, demanding payment. Payment was refused by the plaintiff. The collector of taxes for the defendant on July 26, 1912, placed in the hands of a deputy sheriff a tax warrant in proper form directing the officer to collect the tax or to take the body of the plaintiff. Notice of this fact was given by the deputy sheriff to the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid to the collector of taxes on January 23, 1913, the amount of the said tax, $304.95, together with interest, $17.25, and costs upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tax warrant amounting to $3.50; in all the sum of $325.70, and at the same time delivered to the collector of taxes a protest in writing reading as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">\u201c January 23, 1913.

In that case the plaintiff sued to recover the amount of a tax assessed to her as the administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband. Before the making of the assessment there had been an informal settlement and distribution of the estate, by an amicable arrangement of all the parties interested therein, of which the assessors had had notice. The statute then in force (Gen. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 12, cl. 7) provided that after the appointment of an executor or administrator the personal estate of a deceased person should be assessed to such executor or administrator until he should give notice to the assessors that the estate had been distributed and paid over to the parties interested therein. It was held that there need not be a formal settlement and decree in the Probate Court, and that the property could not be assessed to the plaintiff after she in fact had properly distributed and paid it over, and had given notice thereof to the assessors, although no accounting had been made and no decree had been entered in the Probate Court. This construction of the statute was in accordance with the statement of its object and reasons made by the court in <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>6 Allen, 277, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The statute afterwards was amended (St. 1878, c. 189, \u00a7 <em>2; </em>Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, cl. 7; R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 23, cl. <em>7; </em>St. 1909, c. 490, Part I, \u00a7 23, cl. 7) by adding the requirement that the notice to the assessors should state the name, residence, and the amount paid to the several parties interested in the estate who are inhabitants of the Commonwealth. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>182 Mass. 195. The subsequent re-enactment of the statute as thus amended in three successive codifications of our tax laws, after the decision in <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Ashburnham, ubi supra, </em>goes far to show a legislative adoption of the rule there laid down, as was pointed out in <em>White </em>v. <em>Mott, ubi supra. </em>The same doctrine has been stated again in our decisions. In <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>208 Mass. 188, 189, it was said that if executors have distributed the property or any part of it, \u201cthey can protect themselves and the \u00e9state by bringing in a list as required by the R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 41, or by showing a distribution under the R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 23, cl. 7, which sections with slight changes are re-enacted in St. 1909, c. 490, Part I, \u00a7\u00a7 41, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>23, cl. 7.\u201d See also <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>176 Mass. 384, 386, and <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>211 Mass. 178,183, in which the authority of <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Ashburnham </em>is recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In the cases chiefly relied on by the defendant, the transfers had been made by executors to themselves acting in another fiduciary capacity. In such cases a decree of the Probate Court is required to complete the transfer. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em>9 Pick. 395, 409. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>9 Met. 525, 534. <em>Conkey </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>13 Met. 51. <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>6 Allen, 277. <em>Seam </em>v. <em>Nahant, </em>215 Mass. 329. The distinction between the two classes of cases is pointed out in <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>211 Mass. 178, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The notice given by the plaintiff to the assessors contained all the information required by St. 1909, c. 490, Part I, \u00a7 23, cl. 7. Its statements of fact were correct. It follows from the decisions already referred to that the assessors, after they had received this notice, had no jurisdiction to make the assessment in question upon the plaintiff. There is nothing inconsistent with this conclusion in <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners, </em>154 Mass. 143; <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>176 Mass. 384; or <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Nahant, </em>215 Mass. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">This is not a case where the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy is by asking for an abatement, for the assessment was void. Whether he might have maintained also a petition for the abatement of the whole tax <em>(Milford Water Co. </em>v. <em>Hopkinton, </em>192 Mass. 491, 498; <em>Milford </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>213 Mass. 162) need not be determined. He was personally liable for the tax; <em>Dallinger </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>149 Mass. 62; St. 1909, c. 490, Part II, \u00a7 34; and he paid it under protest to avoid an arrest of his body. He can maintain an action for its recovery. <em>Boston &amp; Sandwich Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>4 Met. 181. <em>Loud </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>99 Mass. 208. <em>Wheatland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>202 Mass. 258, 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In accordance with the terms of the report, judgment must be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $325.70 with interest from January 23, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
