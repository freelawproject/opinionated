After hearing testimony from police officers and the defendant, the court found \u201cthat there is sufficient evidence before the Court to suggest a valid entrapment defense. The Court finds that the information requested * * * [is] necessary, relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and compelling in the preparation of this defense and * * * [is] sufficient to justify disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The balancing of the arresting authority\u2019s interest in protecting its source of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense was addressed in <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957), 353 U.S. 53, 60-61, wherein it was stated that \u201c[w]here the disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity, or the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">This qualification of the privilege of immunity and the basis for establishing such qualification have been applied by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 294 [56 O.O.2d 174], and approved, though determined not applicable, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 74, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 156. While <em>State </em>v. <em>Beck </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 73 [23 O.O.2d 377], cited by appellant, denied disclosure, the basis therein for seeking the identity of the informant was for impeachment purposes and was not for the purpose of presenting a relevant defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The appellee\u2019s action, as reflected in his order requiring disclosure, demonstrates application of the proper criteria for determination of whether the name and address of the confidential informant should be revealed. As we stated in <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 157, \u201c[t]he <em>Williams </em>and <em>Phillips </em>standards necessarily require an analysis of each case\u2019s facts and circumstances as to whether the proffered reasons for abrogating the informant\u2019s confidentiality are valid.\u201d Inasmuch as the appellee made his evaluation of the testimony consistent with established standards, the appellant fails to show any clear legal duty of appellee to set aside or vacate his order requiring disclosure. Thus, appellant has failed to prove an essential element which is required before a writ of mandamus will be issued. See <em>State, ex rel. Westchester, </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42 [15 O.O.3d 53].</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b63-10\">W. Brown, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
