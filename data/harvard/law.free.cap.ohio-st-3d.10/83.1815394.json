However, such construction is unnecessarily restrictive and would contradict the principles set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Emmons </em>(1978), 57 Ohio App. 2d 173 [11 O.O.3d 173], and <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Initially, we must conclude that the provisions of R.C. 4505.04 were designed to protect title as between true and fraudulent title claimants and to create an instrument evidencing title to and ownership of motor vehicles. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Al Green, Inc. </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 110, 115 [19 O.O.3d 307], We do not hold that the legislature intended for said section to be construed to effectively deprive equitable owners of their interest in a vehicle where that vehicle may be forfeited to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The circumstances in this cause place it among narrowly drawn case-law exceptions, along with theft and fraud, involving \u201cequitable ownership.\u201d Though we reaffirm that concept today, and thereby reject appellant\u2019s second proposition of law, we further find that the issue raised is not necessary to the resolution of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The person to whom a \u201ccertificate of title\u201d to the automobile in question was issued, Louis Shimits, was the operator of the vehicle during its use in the commission of a felony drug abuse offense, in violation of R.C. 2925.13(A). The vehicle was, in fact, seized by the Parma Police Department and Shimits was convicted of violating R.C. 2925.13(A). R.C. 2925.13(D), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">\u201cVehicles used in violation of division (A) of this section shall be seized and forfeited to the municipal corporation * * *. <em>Forfeiture shall not apply to </em>* * * <em>innocent owners * </em>* (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The statutory framework is clear. When a person knowingly permits a vehicle to be used for the commission of a felony drug abuse offense in violation of R.C. 2925.13(A), that vehicle \u201cshall be\u201d seized and forfeited upon proper motion. R.C. 2925.13(D). The seized vehicle shall not be forfeited where there is an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d of the vehicle. Once the court determines that the vehicle is to be forfeited, R.C. 2933.41(D)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> details the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>dispositional alternatives for the court and R.C. 2933.41(E)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> explains exactly how any proceeds generated by the disposition of forfeited property are to be distributed.. After a determination has been made that the vehicle is to be forfeited, R.C. 2933.41(D) and 2933.41(E) are absolute and there are no statutory exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The problem in this case is that the trial court made contradictory findings. First, it determined that the third-party claimants were \u201cinnocent owners\u201d by virtue of an equitable ownership interest, and then it ordered the vehicle \u201cforfeited\u201d and sold. The court further ordered, under the guise of \u201cdoing equity,\u201d that the proceeds generated by the sale of the vehicle were to be split between the third-party claimants and the appellant. This was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">As R.C. 2925.13(D) currently stands, if an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d exists, then forfeiture \u201cshall not apply.\u201d This can only mean that a seized vehicle must be returned to an innocent owner. If forfeiture is ordered, then the court has implicitly determined that no innocent owners exist and the relevant municipal corporation is entitled to all of the proceeds generated by the disposition of the forfeited property. R.C. 2933.41(E). We hold that the trial court has no authority, under either R.C. 2933.41 or 2925.13, to order an \u201cequitable distribution\u201d of the proceeds generated by the disposition of a vehicle seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>pursuant to R.C. 2925.13 once the court has declared the vehicle \u201cforfeited.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Though the trial court found the third-party claimants to be \u201cinnocent owners,\u201d it is clear that it did not believe their equitable interest was strong enough to prevent the forfeiture and sale of the seized vehicle. Accordingly, we must find that, upon ordering forfeiture, the trial court erred by not following the legislative directive of R.C. 2933.41(E) and by not ordering that all of the proceeds generated by the sale of the seized vehicle be distributed to the city of Parma.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">To summarize, we hold that where a vehicle used in violation of R.C. 2925.13(A) is seized by law enforcement authorities, and a motion is made by the state to order the vehicle forfeited pursuant to either R.C. 2933.41 or 2925.13, and third parties enter the action claiming to be \u201cinnocent owners\u201d of the vehicle, the trial court has two options: the court may find that the vehicle is \u201cforfeited\u201d and follow the dispositional alternatives provided in R.C. 2933.41, or the court may find the third parties to be \u201cinnocent owners\u201d of the vehicles, in which case the forfeiture provisions \u201cshall not apply\u201d and the vehicle shall be returned to the innocent owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Further, in determining whether a third party is an innocent owner, evidence establishing an equitable ownership interest is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed and this cause is remanded to the trial court so that it may order that the proceeds of the sale of the forfeited vehicle be placed in the general fund of the city of Parma.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

R.C. 2933.41(D)(6), however, details only the options available to a court in the <em>disposal </em>of forfeited property and permits a court to dispose of property as it \u201cconsiders proper in the circumstances.\u201d Only R.C. 2933.41(E) speaks to the distribution of the proceeds generated by the disposal of forfeited property, and it only permits a distribution of the proceeds to the proper municipality.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
