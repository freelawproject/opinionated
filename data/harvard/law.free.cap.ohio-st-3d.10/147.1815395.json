Rossetti, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 230, 232; <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 396, 397 [23 O.O.3d 358]; <em>State, ex rel. G. F. Business Equip., Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 446, 447 [20 O.O.3d 379].</p>\n<p id=\"AiM\">Relator-appellant asserts that there was no evidence before the commission upon which it could have based its determination that he had a fifteen percent permanent partial disability. It is appellant\u2019s contention that the report of Dr. Kackley cannot be relied upon by the commission, because it addresses only the question of appellant\u2019s physical impairment and not his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Appellant is correct in noting that the terms \u201cimpairment\u201d and \u201cdisability,\u201d as applied by the Industrial Commission, are not synonymous. The Medical Examination Manual issued by the commission defines the terms, on pages 1 and 2, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">\u201c \u2018Impairment\u2019 is a medical term measuring the amount of the claimant\u2019s anatomical and/or mental loss of function as a result of the allowed injury/occupational disease. The examining physician evaluates impairment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201c \u2018Disability\u2019 is a legal term indicating the effect that the medical impairment has on the claimant\u2019s ability to work. Disability is determined by the Industrial Commission and its hearing officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In medical reports, however, these terms are not always used with precision. Dr. Kackley\u2019s report in the instant case is phrased in terms of \u201cimpairment,\u201d but it is apparent that his conclusions were based upon considerations relevant to a determination of disability. Dr. Kackley noted in his report that appellant was \u201ccarrying out full normal work activity without significant difficulty.\u201d He also stated that there was \u201cno medical evidence to support an increase in PPI beyond the 15% he has already been awarded.\u201d This statement logically can refer only to appellant\u2019s previous award of permanent partial <em>disability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Though Dr. Kackley used imprecise terminology in his report, it is apparent that he expressed an opinion as to appellant\u2019s disability; and his report is sufficient evidence to support the commission\u2019s determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b173-10\">C. Brown, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b173-11\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEdJ\">concurring. I concur in the judgment of this court and the analysis of the facts which results in affirmance of the court of appeals\u2019 denial of a writ of mandamus to relator. Our decision properly causes the Industrial Commission\u2019s award of fifteen percent permanent partial disability to stand undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The award by the commission is based upon credible, reliable evidence. Thus, we do not need the crutch of the \u201csome evidence\u201d rule, <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 396 [23 O.O.3d 358], as set forth in the second sentence of the <em>per curiam </em>opinion to support the commission award and the court of appeals\u2019 decision in accord therewith. I have often asserted that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard should b\u00e9 rejected because it is a meaningless rubberstamp used to validate unjust decisions of the Industrial Commission and is an abdication of the judicial function to the commission. <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra, </em>dissenting opinion at page 400. Instead we should adopt a rule of meaningful judicial review of commission awards, in harmony with the standards of judicial review of other administrative agency decisions, as explained in <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165 [22 O.O.3d 400], dissenting opinion at page 174. That rule should be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">\u201cWhere the record before the Industrial Commission contains reliable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>probative and substantial evidence in accordance with the law to support a factual finding and determination that a relator is disabled to the extent determined by the commission, the relator will not be afforded relief in an action for mandamus to obtain an award greater than that determined by the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">For further analysis and criticism of the some evidence rule, see, also, <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72, concurring opinion at page 77; <em>State, ex rel. Taylor, </em>v. <em>Indus.
