In support of their contention, appellees state that in <em>Bd. of Mental Retardation, supra, </em>the court <em>\u201c* * </em>* did not closely review the propriety of the remedy of mandamus, * * *\u201d since it was agreed by the parties therein that the board of mental retardation had no adequate remedy at law. However, R.C. 5705.341 and 5705.37, which are the relevant statutes providing for appeal, confine such rights to: (1) those required to pay taxes pursuant to such levies (R.C. 5705.341)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) taxing authorities (R.C. 5705.37). Appellees\u2019 claim that appellant falls within the category set forth in R.C. 5705.341 is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Thus, the issue here is the same as in <em>Bd. of Mental Retardation, supra, </em>and revolves around the apparent conflict between R.C. 5705.31, which requires the county budget commission to approve, without modification, levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation that have been properly passed by the voters, and R.C. 5705.341 which mandates that all tax rates be clearly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>quired by an approved budget pursuant to procedures set forth in R.C. 5705.01 to 5705.47. In <em>Bd. of Mental Retardation, supra, </em>at 109, we considered the statutory scheme of R.C. 5705.01 to 5705.47 as being interrelated relative to \u201c* * * the procedure necessary to collect certain tax levies.\u201d We resolved the sections so as to harmonize them \u201cin order to give meaning and effect to each of them.\u201d In so doing, we concluded that voter approval of a levy properly placed upon the ballot pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5705 constitutes an approved budget as a matter of law, thus satisfying the provision of R.C. 5705.341 which requires budget approval before levying any rate of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Appellees criticize this conclusion in <em>Bd. of Mental Retardation, supra, </em>for the reason that tax rates beyond the ten-mill limitation may be increased by the voters without the protective requirement that need therefor be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the county budget commission. This argument fails to recognize that tax levies submitted for approval by the electorate in fact afford the opportunity for consideration and evaluation of need by the voters themselves. See R.C. 5705.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Based upon <em>Bd. of Mental Retardation, supra, </em>the Fairfield County Budget Commission\u2019s action was contrary to law when it reduced the total voter-approved millage. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling the appellees to reinstate the levy to the total original voter-approved millage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the writ prayed for is hereby allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\"> R.C. 5705.341 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\"><em>\u201cAny person required to pay taxes on real </em>* * * <em>property </em>* * * in any taxing district or other political subdivision of this state <em>may appeal </em>to the board of tax appeals from the action of the county budget commission * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
