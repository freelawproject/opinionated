Compensation received as settlement of a claim exclusive of lost wages, shall become the property of the claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">The court of appeals held that Section 163.10(e)(4) specified reimbursement only in cases involving workers\u2019 compensation benefits and for that reason appellants had no authority to demand reimbursement under any other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">Appellants argue that the last sentence of Section 163.10(e)(4), stating that \u201c[compensation received as settlement of a claim exclusive of lost wages, shall become the property of the claimant,\u201d applies to claims other than workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">The clause is ambiguous. On the one hand, its failure to affirmatively direct reimbursement where lost wages are received from sources other than workers\u2019 compensation suggests that the second sentence merely relates back to the first. On the other hand, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are generally not referred to as \u201ccompensation received as settlement of a claim,\u201d and they are not referred to as such in the first sentence, suggesting appellants\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">Section 1.01(b) of the Youngstown City Ordinances provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-16\">\u201cUnless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of the Revised Code of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-17\">R.C. 1.49 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-18\">\u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the legislature, may consider among other matters:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-19\">\u201c(A) The object sought to be obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-20\"><em>tt* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-21\">\u201c(F) The administrative construction of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-22\">In view of the fact that Section 163.10 requires reimbursement at all, we find that its purpose is to pay employees for time lost due to injuries received on duty only to the extent that such wages are not received from other sources. Injured-on-duty status also permits an employee to earn sick leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and certain vacation leave during the tenure of such status. Thus, benefits accrue to the employee even where the wages paid are reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Section 163.10 has, since its enactment, been interpreted by the city to require reimbursement in the event the employee receives a settlement or judgment from a third party for lost wages. The city\u2019s Risk Management Division has required the completion of Form YSC-8 (the assignment appellee refused to sign) when an employee loses time due to injuries received in a motor vehicle accident, and has notified the various departments periodically of its necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Considering the object of the ordinance and its administrative interpretation, we construe Section 163.10(e)(4) to require reimbursement if the employee receives lost wages from a source other than workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b34-10\">C. Brown, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b34-11\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">dissenting. The decision of the court in this case is based upon a strained interpretation of Section 163.10 of the Youngstown City Ordinances. For the following reasons I find such interpretation of Section 163.10 to be improper. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">The only issue present before this court is whether Section 163.10(e)(4) requires an injured employee to assign lost wages recoverable from a third party to the city before he can obtain \u201cinjured-on-duty\u201d leave from the city. Section 163.10(e)(4) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-13\">\u201cAny compensation received by an employee from the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation as are reimbursement for wages for a period the employee was carried on injured-on-duty status shall be paid over to the Treasury of the City. Compensation received as settlement of a claim exclusive of lost wages, shall become the property of the claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">This subsection is clear on its face. It requires an injured municipal employee- to pay over to the city any compensation received from the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation attributable to lost wages. It makes no mention of the benefits derived from any actions against third parties. If the city had intended for lost wages recovered from employees in actions against third parties to be payable to the treasury, Section 163.10 could have so required. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-15\">The court, however, strains to find the second sentence of subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>(e)(4) to include all claims other than workers\u2019 compensation claims. This interpretation is improper. Courts should not read terms into statutory sections in an attempt to determine legislative intent. See <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St. 2d 125 [49 O.O.2d 445].</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">I would, therefore, affirm the decision of the court of appeals allowing the writ and giving the plain interpretation to Section 163.10(e)(4) as required by its very terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
