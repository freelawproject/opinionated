Thereafter, and on August 10, 1931, the court made its order appointing such receiver and he duly complied with the conditions of the order by filing a good and sufficient bond, and entered upon the performance of his duties. About a year later, on September 12, 1932, the court, of its own motion, vacated and annulled the order of August 10th, and ordered a petition to appoint another receiver off calendar. From this order plaintiff Saewert appealed. On October 19, 1932, a supplemental <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order was filed, amending the minute order of September 12th to show that it was based upon the court\u2019s finding that the first order of appointment was in excess of its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Appellant, of course, contends that the court- had jurisdiction to appoint a receiver and that it erred in vacating said order of appointment on its own motion, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>notice, and after more than a year had elapsed. With this we cannot agree. The complaint failed to state a cause of action in that it asked for no affirmative relief to which a receivership might be incidental; hence the order appointing the receiver had no validity. Furthermore, the fact that the corporation consented to the appointment is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">As authority for this' pronouncement see the recent case of <em>McCutcheon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>134 Cal. App. 5 [24 Pac. (2d) 911], decided August 22, 1933, and cases therein cited. No additional citation of authority need be made to effectually dispose of this appeal. That ease is similar in fact to the instant case, it is directly in point and contains a full discussion of the issues raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Shenk, J., Langdon, J., Seawell, J., and Waste, O. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
