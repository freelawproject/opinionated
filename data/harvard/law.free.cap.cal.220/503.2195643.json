In 1909 the lot was purchased in decedent\u2019s name for about $900. Respondent, by trade a carpenter, constructed a dwelling thereon which was, until the passing of decedent in 1931, the family home of this husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The sole question here presented is that of sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding that the entire estate was community property and not separate property. Appellants claim that the evidence established an uncontroverted disputable presumption that said property was separate property of decedent by reason of the fact that it was purchased in her name; at the same time respondent deeded to her any interest he might have in it, and the purchase price was paid from a bank account, also in decedent\u2019s name, wherein had been mingled, with her separate funds exceeding the amount of such purchase price, community funds of a less sum than said purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">We have reviewed the record with care. It supports the action of the court below and contains evidence which, though meager, is sufficient to overcome the presumption raised by the aforesaid circumstances and to establish the community character of the estate. It is fundamental that a finding of the court below, supported by sufficient evidence, is binding and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The order and decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Langdon, J., Curtis, J., Shenk, J., Thompson, J., Waste, C. J., and Seawell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
