A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A3U\">The primary question raised by this appeal is whether a plaintiff is barred from .commencing a personal injury action against an alleged tortfeasor after having obtained partial recovery for the injury from the tortfeasor\u2019s employer in a prior action against the employer alone based exclusively on the employer\u2019s vicarious liability for the employee\u2019s causative act of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The question arises out of a largely undisputed factual background. Plaintiff Ann McEadden, while a patient at the Medical Center at Princeton (hospital), fell on a piece of soap left on the bathroom floor, sustaining serious injuries, including a herniated disc whose treatment required two subsequent hospitalizations and, ultimately, a laminectomy. The medical expenses incurred for treatment of the injuries as stated in plaintiff\u2019s answers to interrogatories were close to $5,000. She sued the hospital on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory for the negligence of its employees in maintaining the bathroom in an unsafe condition. In a bifurcated trial she obtained a liability verdict against the hospital, the sole defendant in that suit. The claim was, however, settled before the damages trial for a total compensatory sum of $9,500. The release of the hospital executed by plaintiffs in connection with the settlement is silent as to whether the hospital\u2019s employees were also being released, but the letter of transmittal of the settlement documents by plaintiff\u2019s attorney did state that \u201cThis settlement is predicated on the defendant\u2019s hospital statute limitation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>$10,000.00 liability.\u201d The statutory reference was obviously to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A.-53A-8, which so limits the negligence liability of hospitals to their patients. Since, however, the limitation does not extend to the hospital\u2019s employees, who are accordingly obligated to respond in full for the damages resulting from the acts of negligence, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:53A-7, and since plaintiffs believed that the amount of their compensatory damages exceeded the hospital\u2019s limitation, they then commenced this action against these defendants, who were the floor nurses at the time the injury was sustained and were alleged to be those employees of the hospital actually responsible for the unsafe condition which resulted in the accident. Because<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the identity of this cause of action and that prosecuted in the prior suit against the hospital, defendants, relying on the so-called entire controversy doctrine, moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. It is from the denial of that motion that defendants, on leave granted, appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">At the outset we note that this court, in <em>Moss v. Jones, </em>93 <em>N. J. Super. </em>179, 185 (App. Div. 1966), has heretofore held that when a plaintiff has a cause of action against two possible defendants, namely the negligent actor and the person vicariously liable for the negligent conduct, he need not join both in a single action but has the option of suing them separately in successive actions. The rationale permitting successive litigation is that although the act of negligence complained of is the same in each action, there are nevertheless two distinct and separate persons responsible to the plaintiff, the actual tortfeasor himself and the person vicariously liable for the tort. Thus a plaintiff has two separate causes of action which he may prosecute separately, there being \u201cnothing mandatory as to joinder, 'when liability is several or joint and several.\u201d <em>Moss v. J ones, supra. </em>This holding accords with the <em>Restatement </em>view. See <em>Restatement, Judgments, </em>\u00a7 94 at 467 (1942); <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d (Tentative Draft No. 3, 1976), \u00a7 94 and Comment (a) at 72-75. The fact, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>same alleged wrongdoing is the basis of two separate actions is not entirely without preclusive consequences. Thus, it is well settled that if the first suit, whether against the actual tortfeasor or the person vicariously liable, fails because of an adjudication that the injury was not caused by the actual tortfeasor\u2019s negligence, plaintiff, having had his day in court with respect to the underlying merits of the claim, will be precluded from relitigating the identical factual issue in the second suit by reason of <em>res adjudicata/ </em>collateral estoppel considerations. See <em>Restatement, Judgments, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 96 to 99 at 472-495 (1942); <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d (Tentative Draft No. 4, 1977), \u00a7 99, Introductory Note and Reporter\u2019s Note at 50-66; <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d (Tentative Draft No. 3, 1976), \u00a7 99 and Introductory Note and Reporter\u2019s Note at 89-102. And see cases collected in Annotation, \u201cRes Judicata \u2014 Same Accident-New Party.\u201d 23 A. L. R. 2d 710, 726-735 (1952), and La.ter Case Service. And see <em>Ettin v. Ava Truck Leasing, Inc., </em>53 <em>N. J. </em>463, 478-479 (1969). It is also clear that a plaintiff is entitled to only one satisfaction for the same loss. See generally, <em>Theobald v. Angelos, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>228, 235, 239 (1965); <em>Theobald v. Kenney\u2019s Suburban House, Inc., </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>203, 206\u2014209, 212 (1966). Hence, if he has obtained a judgment in the first litigation, satisfaction thereof will bar his prosecution of a second action based on the same harm. If, however, plaintiff has been successful in the first action and the judgment in his favor obtained therein remains unsatisfied, he is free to proceed against the other party whose responsibility to him for the harm presents a fact issue not foreclosed by reason of a prior adverse adjudication. Thus, as was held in <em>Moss v. Jones, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">* * * [A] person injured by the negligence of an agent or servant may sue the agent or servant and the principal and master in one suit, or may proceed against them in separate suits, and the recovery of a judgment, not satisfied, against the agent or servant does not bar a separate suit against the principal or master.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>We are satisfied- that a partial satisfaction of the judgment in the first suit has the same nonpreclusive effect, at least in respect of the difference between partial and full recovery. This is particularly so where, as here, damages were not adjudicated in the first suit and a different measure of damages applies as between the actual wrongdoer and the party vicariously liable. See Restatement, <em>Judgments </em>2d (Tentative Draft No. 4), \u00a7 99(2) (b), which provides, among other things, that a judgment in favor of the injured person in the first action is conclusive upon him as to the amount of the damages unless there is a legal disability against recovery of full damages in the first suit. Thus, had the damages portion of the first suit here gone to trial and resulted in a verdict of $10,000 or less, plaintiffs, entitled to and presumably recovering that amount, would have been barred from commencing this second suit. If the jury had returned a verdict in excess of $10,000, that amount would have constituted a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ceiling on the recovery in this suit. Damages not, however, having been adjudicated but rather settled between plaintiffs and the vicariously liable party in the first suit, the initial question to which we must address ourselves is whether the fact of the settlement and the release of the vicariously liable party in the first action militates here against the application of the noripreclusionary rule of the <em>Restatement </em>and <em>Moss v. Jones.' </em>We are' satisfied that it does not, either conceptually or factually.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The general rule in this jurisdiction is that a release of one tortfeasor will not release others who may also be liable to plaintiff for his harm unless the release is so intended or the plaintiff receives as a result thereof either full satisfaction or satisfaction intended as such. <em>Breen v. Recks, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>351 (1958). While that departure from the common law was formulated in the context of multiple acts of negligence. committed by concurrent tortfeasors, each of whom was himself actually, rather than merely vicariously liable, we see no reason why the rule should not apply as well to the single act of negligence for which both the actual wrongdoer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>his master or principal are each independently liable. The rationale o\u00ed the rule is equally apposite whether the liability is actual or vicarious \u2014 namely, that plaintiff is entitled to pursue all those who are independently liable to him for his harm until one ifull satisfaction is obtained. Where the cotortfeasors are each liable to plaintiff because of their respective distinct acts of negligence, obviously plaintiff is not precluded from suing one by reason of a prior adjudication adverse to him with respect to the other. But that difference in preclusionary consequences has, in our view, no bearing at all on the question of the effect of a release given to one co-obligor. We are aware of earlier decisions by our trial courts holding that the release of either the actual tortfeasor or the person vicariously liable serves to relieve the other as well 'where, as here, the document of release does not expressly reserve the right to proceed against the other. See <em>Aljian v. Ben Schlossberg, Inc., </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>461 (Law Div. 1950); <em>United States Fidelity and Guar. Co. v. Goetze, </em>108 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>210 (Ch. 1931). These eases were, however, decided prior to <em>Breen v. Pech, supra, </em>and we fail io discern therein any persuasive reason for not applying the intent/full satisfaction test of <em>Breen </em>to this special category of joint obligor release. But see <em>Mayfair Fabrics v. Henley, </em>101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>363, 375 (Law Div. 1968). We are also aware of the divergent views taken by other jurisdictions as to the question of whether the release of the master or servant releases the other. See Annotation \u201cTort of Servant \u2014 Release \u2014 Effect,\u201d 92 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 533 (1963), and Later Case Service. We concur, however, with the view expressed by such cases as <em>Biles v. Harris, </em>521 <em>P. </em>2d 884- (Okl. Ct. App. 1974), holding that the consequences of the release of a master or servant <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>the other are not different than those of a release of one actual joint tortfeasor <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>another and hence that the negligent employees are not released by a release of the employer where no such intent to release is manifest. We further note that this is the view proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>by \u00a7 95 of Tentative Draft No. 3 of the <em>Restatement, Judgments- </em>2d, supra&gt; which rejects the rule of \u00a7 95 of the original <em>Restatement </em>to the effect that the release of one co-obligor releases all. And see the Tentative Draft, <em>supra, </em>Comment (b) on \u00a7 99 at 94, also observing that the release of either master or servant does not <em>ipso facto </em>release the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Applying the intent/full satisfaction test of <em>Breen v. Peck, supra, </em>we are persuaded by this record that the instant defendant employees were not here intended to be released and that the settlement amount was not intended to and did not, in fact, constitute full compensation for the claim. That the $9,500 sum was predicated on the hospital\u2019s limitation of liability rather than on the fair value of the damages claim is a virtually self-evident proposition. Not only was that basis of the settlement made clear in the transmittal letter referred to but it is also obvious to us that the hospital\u2019s liability having already been adjudicated, the verdict value of the claim, considering the nature of the documented injury and its sequelae and the extent of the medical expenses, was patently substantially in excess of the hospital\u2019s liability. We feel confident in assuming that the settlement figure of $9,500 was reached in these circumstances not because plaintiffs may have believed that a prospective judgment could have been less than $10,000 but, rather, because of the $10,000 maximum, they were willing to deduct from the recoverable amount a figure roughfy equivalent to their anticipated trial expenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Finally, defendants urge that we reconsider the express holding of <em>Moss v. Jones, supra, </em>93 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 184\u2014185, that the successive suit here should be barred, if for no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>reason, on the basis of the entire controversy doctrine as developed by such decisions as <em>Ajamian v. Schlanger, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>483 (1954), <em>cert, </em>den., 348 <em>U. S. </em>835, 75 <em>S. Ct. </em>58, 99 <em>L. Ed. </em>659 (1954), and <em>Falcone v. Middlesex County Med. Soc., </em>47 <em>N. J. </em>92 (1966). In response to that argument, <em>2Loss r. Jones </em>concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">* * * [Tlhose cases involved the question of whether a plaintiff may fragmentize his claims against the same defendant, by seeking a measure of relief in one suit and, having obtained it, thereafter seek additional relief in a second suit by reason of the same alleged wrong. The Supreme Court said that he may not; that a plaintiff should seek all of his relief against the same defendant for the alleged wrong in his initial action. We have a different situation herein, because the second action is against a different person and pursuant to the rule of several liability. [93 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 184-185]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Although we are couvineed that it is far preferable for the co-obligors to be joined in a single action and while the temptation to require that to be done by an application of the entire controversy doctrine is formidable, we nevertheless adhere to our former determination that in those circumstances the joinder rule is permissive and not mandatory. We reach that conclusion because of our continued perception of the entire controversy doctrine as a rule of mandatory joinder of claims, not of parties. As we understand the doctrine, its essential purpose is to assure a party to litigation that that litigation will be conclusive as to the entire matter which is its real subject. It is in effect a principle of repose intended to protect one who is already a party to litigation from the expense, delay and harassment implicit in multiple successive actions whose individual scopes are limited to only a fragment of the complete dispute. As we said in <em>Wm. Blanchard Co. v. Beach Concrete Co., Inc., </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>277, 293-294 (App. Div. 1977), the jurisprudential basis of the doctrine is the conception that litigants in an action should not bo required, after final judgment therein is entered, \u201cto engage in additional litigation in order to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>clusively dispose of their respective bundles of rights and liabilities which derive from a single transaction or related series of transactions.\u201d Thus the entire controversy doctrine operates, and was intended to operate, to prevent a party from being compelled to successively litigate. Being compelled to successively litigate does not, however, mean that one may not elect to successively litigate so long as he has a viable cause of action to litigate and so long as his election does not result in another\u2019s compulsion. So here. Plaintiffs have a viable cause of action against these defendants by reason not only of the allegations against them but also by reason of the substantiation of those allegations in the first action. These defendants have not yet been called upon to answer for their alleged negligence and for plaintiffs\u2019 unsatisfied loss resulting therefrom. The principles of repose and conclusiveness underpinning the entire controversy doctrine do not therefore apply to them at all. In short, the defendants here, having been omitted from the first action and hence not subject to vulnerability therein, are not prejudiced in any substantial or fundamental way by the prosecution of this action. We perceive no persuasive reason based on the procedural facts and chronology before us which would justify their immunity from suit at the expense of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to be made whole. Indeed, the technique of successive suits here had the potential of relieving these defendants both of the obligation to defend on the merits and of the obligation to respond in damages since, if plaintiffs had lost the initial action against the hospital, the pre-clusionary consequence here urged would then have obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We believe that it is the inapplicability of the principles of repose and conclusiveness which accounts for the limitation heretofore of the entire controversy doctrine to the joinder of claims among those already litigating and explains the fact that it has not been heretofore extended to require joinder of nonparties whose presence is not indis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>pensable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>R. </em>4:28-1. We are further cognizant of the fact that one of the significant subsumed consequences of the entire controversy doctrine is its effect on the administration of the civil court system, which is thereby spared the burden in cost and time of successive litigation raising issues susceptible of adjudication in a single action. Efficiency of the civil justice process is, of course, a compelling consideration to the extent that it contributes to the ability and capacity of the court system to expeditiously dispose of its steadily increasing volume of litigation. All litigants are, therefore, the beneficiaries of rules and procedures which reduce the demands upon the system. The successive litigation here certainly inns counter to those efficiency desiderata since the same underlying cause of action will be relitigated. But in our view, efficiency is not by itself a sufficient basis for denying a party access to the courts where it is not accompanied by the dimension of prejudice to a party whieti underlies the entire controversy doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We wonld, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>be loathe to prevent plaintiffs from pursuing a complete remedy in two suits only because they had the option of pursuing it in one, particularly where they were without notice that the failure to exercise that option would prove fatal. It may well be that what has been heretofore optional should be made mandatory on a prospective basis and perhaps by the exercise by the Supreme Court of its rule-making power. We do not, however, regard it as appropriate to our function as an intermediate court to engage in prospective rule-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">ln reaching this conclusion we are disregarding, because not properly part of the appellate record, plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit submitted to us with their supplemental brief filed at our request at oral argument. The affidavit states that they orally apprised the hospital of their intention that the release of it not release the negligent nurses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We are aware of a possible reading of <em>Thatcher v. Jerry O\u2019Mahony, Inc., </em>39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>330 (App. Div. 1956), as an extension of the entire controversy doctrine to require joinder of parties. We are satisfied, however, that the primary <em>ratio decidendi </em>there was the rule requiring joinder of indispensable parties. We further note that <em>Thatcher </em>involved a dimension of prospective fractionalization of a single controversy not here present. We also limit our observation of the circumscription of the doctrine to, as we have said, the ordinary situation. We recognize that extraordinary circumstances may inhere in particular party and claim relationships which require joinder of otherwise separate claims by separate litigants. See, for example', <em>Ekalo v. Constructive Serv. Corp. of America, </em>46 N. <em>J. </em>82 (1965), implemented by <em>R. </em>4:28-3(b), lequiring joinder by a spouse asserting a <em>per quod </em>claim in the negligence action brought by the injured spouse. But note that this rule of mandatory joinder of parties in respect of derivative claims has not been extended to <em>per quod </em>claims of parents in respect of their children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">It is suggested that the hospital might be prejudiced by this litigation in respect of its common law right to indemnification, particularly if plaintiffs failed to obtain a judgment adjudicating the nurses\u2019 liability. We note, however, that the possible adverse con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sequences to the hospital -would be limited to its obligation to reliti-gate the indemnity issue directly against the nurses if it chose, as is unlikely, actually to pursue its indemnification rights, and we note, further, that the possibility of inconsistent results could have been avoided by the hospital itself had it chosen to implead the nurses in the original litigation pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:8-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b394-5\">Bilder, J.

I do this with some diffidence because my view stems largely from Judge Pressler\u2019s excellent analysis of the Entire Controversy Doctrine in <em>William Blanchard Company v.

See <em>William Blanchard Company v. Beach Concrete </em>Company, supra 292-294. I recognize that most of the cases cited involve the same parties in both actions \u2014 <em>i. e.; </em>the parties are trying to split their controversy <em>inter se </em>into separate suits.

In <em>Thatcher </em>the plaintiff sued a corporation to set aside a corporate loan and stock option agreement. He failed to join the beneficiaries of the agreement.
