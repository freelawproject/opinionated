On October 21, 1974 plaintiff filed his complaint seeking a dissolution on \u201cno fault\u201d grounds, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-2(d), of his marriage to defendant. Defendant answered and counterclaimed seeking (1) a dissolution of the marriage on the same \u201cno fault\u201d grounds; (2) equitable distribution of the property \u201cacquired by the plaintiff during the marriage,\u201d and (3) counsel fees and costs. On January 25, 1977 that action was dismissed, without prejudice, for lack of prosecution. On April 14, 1977 plaintiff filed a new complaint seeking dissolution of the marriage on the' same grounds. Defendant then moved \u201cfor an Order assessing counsel fees and costs [in regard to the prior dismissed action^ in accordance with Rule 4:37-4.\u201d While this motion was pending, plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed what was captioned to be a \u201cStipulation of Dismissal\u201d of the second action, but what was obviously intended to be a unilateral voluntary dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>counsel then addressed a letter to the clerk of the court requesting that the dismissal not be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion the trial judge did not decide the matter but called for an affidavit from defendant\u2019s 'counsel \u201cas to services rendered in connection with this pending matter,\u201d adding \u201cand I\u2019ll have a letter opinion on this matter.\u201d No letter opinion was issued, nor did the trial judge render any decision orally or in writing. He did, however, sign an order submitted to him by defendant\u2019s counsel, in which \u201cplaintiff\u2019s application for a dismissal\u201d was granted, and a counsel fee of $205 was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As we previously indicated, defendant moved for \u201ccounsel fees and costs in accordance with Rule 4:37-4.\u201d Her attorney, in his affidavit submitted in support of the motion, requested</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">* * * an Order, compelling the plaintiff, herein, Reginald A. Sassano, to pay the counsel fees and costs of the defendant Phoebe Sassano, in the amount of $680.00, for the action brought under Docket No. M-3444-74' [the earlier action], and to stay the proceedings in this action bearing Docket No. M-16611-76 until such time as the plaintiff complies with such Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">While counsel fees may be allowed in a matrimonial action under <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a) (1), defendant\u2019s motion was not made pursuant to that rule. Instead, it was specifically made pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:3 7-4,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under which the trial court might have allowed costs of the earlier action, but not counsel fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>We further note that, in the circumstances, plaintiff could have, under <em>R. </em>4:37-1, filed a notice of dismissal without court order \u201cat any time' before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment * * The rule says nothing about any other kind of motion. As we earlier indicated, plaintiff\u2019s dismissal, though referred to as a stipulation, was clearly intended to be a notice. We are satisfied that the granting of \u201cplaintiff\u2019s application for a dismissal,\u201d as set forth in the \u201cOrder of Dismissal\u201d of July 18, 1977, inappropriate as it may have been, accomplished the same purpose and that no harm resulted to either party in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The order of July 18, 1977 under review, insofar as it directs plaintiff to pay counsel for defendant a counsel fee of $205, is reversed. Insofar as such order grants a dismissal of the action, it is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of the costs to be allowed pursuant to <em>B. </em>4:37-4 and the entry of an appropriate order limited thereto.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\"> Although the \u201cStipulation\u201d reads: \u201cIt is hereby stipulated by and between the parties that the above entitled matter be and the same is hereby dismissed without prejudice and without costs,\u201d it is signed only by the attorney for plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Prior to the. filing and service of an answer in the second suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\">On a motion made pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:37-4, the court \u201cmay make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it deems appropriate and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied therewith.\u201d While the <em>Rule </em>may, by its terms, be invoked by a defendant before serving an answer where \u201cplaintiff,\u201d having dismissed his prior action commences another action based upon or including the same claim against the same defendant, we are satisfied that, when read in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>with <em>R. </em>4:42-8(a), it may similarly be invoked where, as here, the earlier action was dismissed, on the court\u2019s own motion, for lack of prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
