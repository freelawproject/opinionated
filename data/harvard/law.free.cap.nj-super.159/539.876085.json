The following are the essential facts. On March 14, 1977, at about 11:15 p.m., defendant was arrested when his auto was observed by the arresting officer \u201cswerving around in the slow lane\u201d and shortly thereafter \u201chitting the right shoulder.\u201d After stopping defendant the officer observed defendant\u2019s manner and smelled alcohol. He placed defendant in the rear seat of the patrol car with his hands \u201ccuffed\u201d behind him. While proceeding to headquarters, the officer noticed defendant bump his head on the window. Defendant requested to be taken to the hospital, but this request was initially denied because no injury was observed. Defendant refused to submit to a breathalyzer or any other form of testing. It was then decided that he would be taken to the hospital, where x-rays were negative. The hospital record did indicate that defendant had a contusion on his forehead. The hospital refused the officer\u2019s request to perform a blood test without defendant\u2019s consent. According to the arresting officer, defendant indicated he would comply with the officer\u2019s request to have a blood sample taken after the doctor represented in writing that he was not injured. However, even after being shown the medical report, defendant refused to permit the sample to be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">After the examination at the hospital defendant was taken to the Pompton Medical Center, which was a few minutes drive from the hospital, where the licensed director took a blood sample. It is undisputed that defendant offered no physical resistance to the test and did not affirmatively consent to the test. There is no allegation that physical force was used (not considering the act of insertion of a needle). The trial judge refused to allow testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>licensed director\u2019s qualifications or to take judicial notice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his expertise as to the taking of such samples. The trial judge, in suppressing the evidence, found the search was contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39: 4\u201450.2. He implied that even though there was no physical violence, the test was taken without consent, and he seemed to emphasize the discrepancy between the officer\u2019s not noticing any injury and the hospital\u2019s finding of a contusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The trial judge used a concept, not of actual physical force or violence, but rather the coercive effect of defendant being handcuffed and taken from the hospital, where he had refused the test, to the medical center. However, this is not the kind of force which prohibits the use of chemical tests in a drunken driving case. <em>State v. Macuk, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The trial judge erred in his interpretation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.2(d) when he construed that subsection to include the circumstances of being arrested for drunk driving and the ambiance of the situation. However, that section is limited to a prohibition when the chemical test or specimen is \"made or taken forcibly and against physical resistance.\u201d To apply the criterion used by the trial judge of a finding of coercion from the circumstances of an arrest situation would in effect mean that the statute broadly applies to all situations and to every chemical test taken after an arrest for drunk driving, and might be argued to negate implied consent even as to the breath test. The mere fact of arrest and being handcuffed is not a sufficient showing of coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Here, as in <em>State v. Macuk, supra, N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.2, in effect when defendant was arrested (and not affected by an amendment by virtue of <em>L. </em>1977, <em>c. </em>29), is limited in subsection (a) to samples of the breath when speaking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>implied consent. Justice Hall, speaking for a unanimous court in <em>State v. Macule, supra, </em>said in strong terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">Chapter 142, importantly, struck from N. <em>J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.1 the former requirement of consent to or request by the defendant for any chemical analysis or specimen with respect to driving \u2018under the influence\u2019. (And no such requirement was contained in N. <em>J. S. A. </em>39 :4-50.6 with respect to driving \u2018while impaired\u2019.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">Section 2 of the chapter, N. <em>J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.2, is the so-called \u2018implied consent\u2019 provision, relating only to the taking of samples of <em>breath. </em>It reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle on any public road, street or highway or quasi-public area in this State shall be deemed to have given his consent to the taking of samples of his breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in his blood; provided, however, that the taking of samples is made in accordance with the provisions of this act and at the request of a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that such person has been operating a motor vehicle in violation of the provisions of section 39:4r-50 of the Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">(b) A record of the taking of any such sample, disclosing the date and time thereof, as well as the result of any chemical test, shall be made and a copy thereof, upon his request, shall be furnished or made available to the person so tested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">(c) In addition to the samples taken and tests made at the direction of a police officer hereunder, the person tested shall be permitted to have such samples taken and chemical tests of his breath, urine or blood made by a person or physician of his own selection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">(d) The police officer shall inform the person tested of his rights under subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">(e) No chemical test, as provided in this section, or specimen necessary thereto, may be made or taken forcibly and against physical resistance thereto by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">It would appear that the provision was limited to a breath test and was made necessary because affirmative cooperation is required of the person being examined to \u2018blow up the balloon\u2019, whereas this is not so in the ease of a test by use of a blood sample. It also may be nolod that the implied consent provision applied where the police officer has arrested the driver upon reasonable cause to believe that he was cither \u2018under the influence\u2019 or that his driving ability was only \u2018impaired\u2019. [57 N. <em>J. </em>at 32-13]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-12\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.2 was thus construed to limit such consent to breath samples because of the necessity of voluntary cooperation. There is no requirement in this State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>for consent to the taking of physical examples such as fingerprints, photographs, bodily examinations for identifying characteristics, drunkometer tests and blood tests. They are beyond the privilege of self-incrimination because non-testimonial in character. <em>State v. Blair, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>43 ,(1965). Nontestimonial evidence is' not subject to objection on either Fourth Amendment search and seizure grounds or Fifth Amendment self-incrimination basis. <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384: <em>U. S. </em>757, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1826, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 908 (1966); <em>Breithaupt v. Abram, </em>352 <em>U. S. </em>432, 77 <em>S. Ct. </em>408, 1 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 448 (1957). In <em>State v. Macuk, supra, </em>it was also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">The upshot of our statutory provisions and their history and the holdings of the United States Supreme Court is this. There is a clear legal right to require a motor vehicle operator, arrested on probable cause for driving \u2018under the influence\u2019 or \u2018while impaired\u2019, to submit to a chemical test of bodily substances to determine the amount of alcohol in his blood, or, for that matter, to a physical coordination test. A breath test must, of course, be administered in accordance with the requirements of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.2 and a blood test in a medically acceptable manner and <em>environment. </em>The latter may be used on any occasion, but will be especially useful where the person is physically unable or has refused to take a breath test. Since such tests, properly undertaken, violate no constitutional safeguard and are permissible as in any other non-testimonial situation and since our statute no longer requires consent in any situation, acquiescence is not legally significant or necessary. See <em>State v. Tolbert, </em>100 <em>N. </em>J. <em>Super. </em>350 (Cty. Ct. 1968). [57 <em>N. J. </em>at 14-15]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In view of the foregoing, consent is not required to the taking of a blood sample, bnt the taking of such sample must be done in a medically acceptable manner and environment and without force or violence or the threat of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In addition to <em>Macuk </em>and <em>Blair </em>other cases have upheld the taking of blood samples without the express consent of a defendant. See <em>State v. Kraft, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>416, 418 (Cty. Ct. 1975); <em>State v. Amaniera, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>597, 601 (Cty. Ct. 1974); <em>State v. Tolbert, </em>100, <em>N. J. Super. </em>350, 357 (Cty. Ct. 1968); and <em>cf. State v. McMaster, </em>118 <em>N. J. Super. </em>476 (App. Div. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>It may also be noted that the Legislature made no substantive change in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :4-50.2 from the time of the decisions in <em>Macuk </em>and <em>Blair, </em>notwithstanding the enactment of <em>L. </em>1977, <em>c. </em>29, which merely added language to subsection (e) of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.2. Under these circumstances it can be assumed that the Legislature is thoroughly conversant with its own legislation and the judicial construction placed thereon. <em>Cf. State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N. J. </em>127, 137, n. 1 (1978); <em>In re Keogh-Dwyer, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>117, 120 (1965), and <em>Caldwell v. Rochelle Park Tp., </em>135 <em>N. J. Super. </em>66, 74 (Law Div. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We are aware that on April 24, 1978 (subsequent to argument in this case) Senate Bill S-49 (2dOOB) of 1978 was referred back to committee in the Assembly. This bill would amend various sections of <em>Title </em>39 in part to expressly incorporate certain aspects of the holding of <em>Slate v. Macuk </em>and extend the implied consent law. That bill would also have made additional amendments to the law, including expressly granting immunity from civil or criminal liability to medical personnel and to hospitals or other medical facilities taking breath, blood or urine samples and participating in the administering of such tests, as long as they were performed in a medically acceptable manner. However, the pendency of unadopted amendatory bills, legislative inaction, or even ultimate failure of passage of this unadopted bill, does not change and has no effect on the holding of <em>Macuk, </em>and does not provide a basis for any controlling inference as to legislative intent. See <em>Donaldson v. Bd. of Ed., </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>236, 240-241 (1974); <em>Moore v. Mercer Cty. Bd. of Freeholders, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>26, 29-30 (1962); <em>Kendall Bark Chapter of Deborah v. New Brunswick, </em>159 <em>N. J. Super. </em>249, 256 (App. Div. 1978), and <em>Hilton Acres v. Klein, </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>281, 294 (App. Div. 1960), mod. on other grounds, 35 <em>N. J. </em>570 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Reversed and remanded for trial in the municipal court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We note this director was the same individual who was the subject of <em>State v.
