J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AXq\">This is a Tong-arm\u201d jurisdiction matter. Plaintiffs visited the complex in Florida owned and operated by defendant while plaintiff Eiehard S. Serbin was there attending a convention of the New Jersey State Bar Association. While there, they allege they \u201cwere illegally and unreasonably detained and arrested for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20.00 bill.\u201d They first commenced an action against defendant in the United States District Court, we are told, but voluntarily dismissed that action to pursue their remedy in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction was denied and we granted leave to appeal. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The matter is wholly dependent upon whether defendant had sufficient \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the State of New Jersey \u201cthat the maintenance of the suit does not offend Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. </em>Washington, 326 <em>U. S. </em>310, 316, 66 <em>S. Ct. </em>154, 158, 90 <em>L. Ed. </em>95 (1945). The trial judge, relying almost exclusively on <em>Blessing v. </em>Prosser, 141 <em>N. J. Super. </em>548 (App. Div. 1976), determined that defendant\u2019s \u201cconscious attempt * * * to persuade others to come to * * * its place\u201d by \u201csupplying the information and/or brochures to the travel agency\u201d brought it within the <em>Blessing </em>rule. Three errors appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">First, the contractual commitments to AAA members of the advertiser in the AAA books considered in <em>Blessing </em>and the fee payment involved constituted \u201csubstantially more than a solicitation of business\u201d (141 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 549) or advertising or supplying information.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Second, the conclusion of the trial judge that defendant \u201cprobably supplied the brochure\u201d is not only not supported by the record but as we ascertained on oral argument is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>trary to fact. The Bar Association prepared the layout and circulation of the brochures and divided the cost with the travel agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Third, of the transactions which did occur among the Bar Association, the New Jersey travel agency acting with and for the Bar Association, and defendant, none of them took place in New Jersey, a fact we also confirmed at oral argument. All conferences with defendant were held by Bar Association and travel agency representatives in Florida. The arrangements with defendant on behalf of the Bar Association members were the result of Bar Association initiative, and the obligations of Bar Association members to defendant resulting from the extension of certain check cashing and credit privileges were underwritten by the Bar Association. In fact, it appears from an affidavit filed by a vice-president of Walt Disney World, which is not controverted, that while Walt Disney World</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">* * has sent informational material with respect to its entertainment complex to travel agents throughout the eastern United States, including travel agents in the State of New Jersey, on an annual basis, * * * it pays no commission whatsoever to any travel agents who book reservations to its entertainment complex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It appears from the same affidavit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">Walt Disney World Oo. is not qualified to do business in the State of New Jersey, has neither incurred nor paid taxes to the State of New Jersey, has not appointed an agent for the service of process in New Jersey, has never advertised in any local New Jersy media, is not listed in any New Jersey telephone directories, pays no commissions to any travel agent in New Jersey for the booking of reservations at its entertainment complex, has no assets, office or place of business in New Jersey, and has no officers, agents, employees, salesmen or representatives in the State of New Jersey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We are not unaware that the brochure mentioned above contained a statement (in very fine print under the word \u201cResponsibility\u201d which appeared in large boldface print) that \u201cRosenbluth Travel Agency acts only as agent for the hotels, airlines, or owners or contractors providing accommodations, transportation or other services * <em>* </em>We are entirely satisfied that, on the record before us, this statement does not result in the constitution of Rosenbluth Travel Agency as an agent of Walt Disney World (and thereby as a substantial contact of Walt Disney World with New Jersey). First,, the language itself of this proclamation, continuing extensively beyond the brief quotation above and marked with such disclaimers as \u201cThat Rosenbluth Travel Agency shall not he or become liable or responsible for any loss, injury or damage [etc.]\u201d or for \u201cany additional expense or liability,\u201d sounds far more like a renunciation of responsibility than like an assertion of agency. Additionally, interpretation of the statement to be an assertion of ag\u00e9ncy by Rosenbluth for Walt Disney World' would be inconsistent with the uneontroverted affidavit of the vice president of Walt Disney World, set forth in part above. Beyond this and conclusively significant, proof of agency cannot rest solely on the declarations of the person whose agency is sought to be proved, without other evidence. <em>C. B. Snyder Realty Co. v. Nat\u2019l Newark, etc., Banking Co., </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>146, 157 (1953); 2 <em>Restatement, Agency </em>2d, \u00a7 285 at 5 (1958). In -this case, at least-on the record before us, there is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>only an absence of such other evidence, but there is evidence bo the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">With respect to Walt Disney World, we do not find the minimal contacts in New Jersey necessary for jurisdiction. See <em>Kislak, Inc. v. Trumbull Shopping Park, </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>96 (App. Div. 1977). As was there noted, in a quotation from <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 <em>U. S. </em>235, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>1228, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1283 (1958), reh. den. 358 <em>U. S. </em>858, 79 <em>S. Ct. </em>10, 3 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 92 (1958), which we believe here appropriate as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">But it is a mistake to assume that this trend [i. <em>e., </em>a flexible and indulgent view leading to exercise of jurisdiction against nonresidents in many cases] heralds the eventual demise of all restrictions on the personal jurisdiction of state courts. See Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt, 354 U. S. 416, 418, 77 S. Ct. 1360, 1362, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1456, 1459. Those restrictions are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations of the power of the respective States. However minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the \u201cminimal contacts\u201d with that State that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him. [357 <em>U. S. </em>at 251, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1238]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">We reverse and enter judgment dismissing the complaint for want of jurisdiction. Needless to say, this is not a determination on the merits and so is without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\"> This affidavit appears in the appendix to the brief of defendantmovant-appcllant, and is entitled in the voluntarily dismissed District Court action. Neither party supported the statement of facts appearing in their respective briefs \u201cwith supporting references to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the appendix and the stenographic transcript.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:6-2(d). Neither party furnished the pleadings or moving papers from the motion here on appeal. See <em>R. </em>2:6-1 (a)(1) and (7). A review of the transcript leaves us not knowing whether this affidavit was before the trial court. Nevertheless, plaintiffs made no mention in their answering brief of any impropriety in its inclusion in defendant\u2019s appendix nor does any motion to strike appear. See <em>R. </em>2:5-5(a). Nor do they, in their responsive brief, attack at all the substance of the' affidavit. In such circumstances we are satisfied we are at liberty to - consider this affidavit, if we choose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
