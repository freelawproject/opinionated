The physician who attended appellee testified that his illness could have been caused by the injurious conditions existing at his working place but that there were a number of other causes which could produce the same result. Appellant\u2019s contention is that appellee must prove that the dangerous condition existing in his working place was the proximate cause of his sickness, and that where the testimony leaves that matter uncertain and shows that \u25a0any one of a number of things might have brought about his illness, for some of which his employer would be responsible and for others of which he would not, it was not for the jury to speculate as to what was the real cause of the injury to his health.</p> <p id=\"b247-4\" pgmap=\"247\">Appellant\u2019s theory would no doubt be a proper one in a case where the facts fully supported its premises but it is not applicable in this case for the reason that while the proofs show that the conditions existing at appellee\u2019s working place in the mine could have produced his illness, yet there is a total absence of any proof whatever tending to show the existence of any of the other conditions named by the physician which could have produced the same result. Under these circumstances the jury naturally and properly concluded that the failure of appellant to comply with the statute was the proximate cause of the injury to appellee.</p> <p id=\"b247-5\" pgmap=\"247\">Appellant complains of instruction No. 5 given for appellee, which was as follows: 1 \u2018 The court instructs the jury that they are, from the evidence and under the instructions of the court, the judges of all questions of fact in this case and the court does not intend by any instructions given, to tell the jury how they should find as to any question of fact in this case. \u2019 \u2019 Appellant insists this instruction is erroneous because its effect is to inform the jury they could determine the facts and evidence as they pleased, without the aid of the instructions and unrestrained by any rules of law the court might lay down. We are unable to appreciate the force of appellant\u2019s argument in this regard, for the reason that the instruction in controversy plainly told the jury that they were the judges of-all questions of fact \u201cfrom the evidence and under the instructions of the court,\u201d plainly indicating that in determining the questions of fact, they must do so in the light of the rules of law laid down by the court in the instructions.</p> <p id=\"b247-6\" pgmap=\"247(8) 248(133)\">Counsel for appellant, in support of their position, refer to the case of West Chicago St. E. E. Co. v. Shannon, 106 Ill. App. 120. In that case two instructions which told the jury they were the sole judges of the questions of fact in the case to be determined solely from the evidence, were criticised by the court. Those two instructions, however, were not like the one under controversy here, for the reason that they failed to contain the provision included in appellee\u2019s instruction No. 5 in this case, requiring the jury to determine the questions of fact both \u201cfrom the evidence\u201d and \u201cunder the instructions of the court.\u201d The instruction here given for appellee was wholly free from the vice of the instructions given in the case above referred to and was in no respect erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b248-5\" pgmap=\"248\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b248-6\" pgmap=\"248\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b248-7\" pgmap=\"248\">Mr. Justice Shirley</author> <p id=\"Ah8\" pgmap=\"248\">dissents on the ground that</p> <p id=\"ApZ\" pgmap=\"248\">the breach of duty complained of was not shown to be the proximate cause of appellee\u2019s illness.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
