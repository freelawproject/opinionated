The trial judge then conducted what has commonly, but incorrectly, become known in military jurisprudence as an inquiry into the \u201cprovidency\u201d of a plea of guilty. The term \u201cprovidency\u201d is not recognized by Mr. Webster, and although \u201cprovidence\u201d and \u201cprovident\u201d are recognized words, the correctness of their use in a judicial setting is doubtful. Be that as it may, and call it what you will, the trial judge, in attempting to list the elements of the offense of larceny, omitted the word \u201cwrongfully\u201d as it related to the taking of the stereo amplifier and the word \u201cpermanently\u201d as it related to the intent to deprive Larry McEnany of the use and benefit of the stereo amplifier.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">When a defendant enters a plea of guilty to an offense, the trial judge is required to \u201cexplain the elements\u201d. <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. 535, 541, 40 C.M.R. 247, 253 (1969). <em>Compare United States v. Kilgore, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 35, 44 C.M.R. 89 (1971) (trial judge not bound to \u201cseparately detail the elements\u201d) <em>with United States v. Pretlow, </em>13 M.J. 85 (C.M.A.1982) <em>(Kilgore </em>limited to the simplest of military offenses). When the trial judge separately lists the elements of larceny, is the omission of not one but of two essential words reversible error? That is the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">\n<em>Wrongfully take</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">In <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>43 C.M.R. 853 (ACMR) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>44 C.M.R. 25 (CMA 1971) this Court held that a plea of guilty to larceny was correctly accepted notwithstanding omission of the word \u201cwrongfully\u201d in the judge\u2019s listing of the elements. The Court reasoned that Wheeler, in responding to questions put by the trial judge, \u201cacknowledged a deep feeling of guilt, thus admitting the wrongful nature of the taking\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 855. So, too, in Footman\u2019s case the trial record reveals oral admissions by Footman that he \u201cstold\u201d [sic] the stereo amplifier and that he knew that he was not supposed to take the property of another. In addition, Footman entered into a written stipulation of fact which the trial judge discussed with him and wherein his actions in taking the amplifier were stated to be \u201cwillful, wrongful and unlawful\u201d. Thus, Footman, through his participation in the guilty plea inquiry, admitted the wrongfulness of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">\n<em>Permanently deprive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">We find that the second word omitted by the trial judge was also admitted to by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Footman during his participation in the inquiry. The stipulation of fact contains the admission that Footman stole the stereo amplifier \u201cwith intent to deprive PFC McEnany <em>permanently </em>of its use and benefit\u201d. (Emphasis added). But we do not rely solely on the stipulation in concluding that Footman knew of and admitted to having the requisite intent to permanently deprive. Not only did Footman admit that he \u201cstold\u201d the amplifier, he also orally admitted upon questioning that at the time he took it he intended to sell it; that he sold the amplifier for seventy-five dollars, took the money home and used it for his family\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In sum, although the trial judge did err when he failed to use the words \u201cwrongfully\u201d and \u201cpermanently\u201d in listing the elements of the offense of larceny, we are satisfied from the totality of the proceedings that the trial judge complied with the <em>Care </em>requirement that he \u201cexplain the elements\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Footman also requests that we overrule the case of <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>11 M.J. 542 (A.C.M.R.1981) which held that a trial judge is not disqualified from presiding over a bench trial merely because he also acted as magistrate regarding the defendant\u2019s pretrial confinement. That we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Senior Judge JONES and Judge McKAY concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
