He was sentenced to dismissal and confinement at hard labor for nine months. The convening authority approved the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">The trial judge failed to secure from counsel their explicit assurances that there were no <em>\u201csub rosa\u201d </em>agreements and that their understanding of the agreement comported with his interpretation, as required by the Court of Military Appeals in <em>United States v. Green, </em>1 M.J. 453 (C.M.A.1976). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>After the trial, however, counsel executed affidavits averring that there were no <em>\u201csub rosa\u201d </em>agreements and that their understanding of the agreement comported with the trial judge\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue we address is whether we may consider those affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In <em>United States v. Crowley, </em>3 M.J. 988 (A.C.M.R.1977) (en banc), this Court held that securing and considering affidavits from counsel regarding the possible existence of undisclosed agreements is a proper means for determining whether there were such agreements. Subsequently, however, in <em>United States v. King, </em>3 M.J. 458 at 459 (C.M.A.1977), a majority of the Court of Military Appeals stated that they declined \u201cto \u2018fill in\u2019 a record left silent because of a trial judge\u2019s omission\u201d with respect to the inquiries required by <em>United States v. Green, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The Court of Military Appeals may, as implied in <em>King, </em>decline to accept affidavits from counsel to clarify questions about pretrial agreements. Nevertheless, we do not find, in <em>King </em>or elsewhere, any prohibition against our doing so. This Court has fact finding and review responsibilities that the Court of Military Appeals does not have. Compare Articles 66 and 67, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 and \u00a7 867. Furthermore, in <em>United States v. Steck, </em>10 M.J. 412 (C.M.A.1981), the Court of Military Appeals sanctioned proceedings in revision as an appropriate means for rectifying trial judges\u2019 failures to comply with the inquiry requirements of <em>Green. </em>Were we to decline to consider counsel\u2019s affidavits in appellant\u2019s case, we would be put in the position of ordering a revision proceeding to determine uncontroverted facts that are established in those affidavits. Such a waste of time and resources is unnecessary, if not ludicrous. Accordingly, we adhere to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Crowley, supra</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that this Court may consider affidavits from counsel concerning possible undisclosed pretrial agreements with respect to guilty pleas, and further hold that this Court also may consider such affidavits with respect to the comportment of counsel\u2019s understandings and the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">After considering counsel\u2019s affidavits in appellant\u2019s case, as well as the record of trial, we are satisfied that his pleas of guilty were provident. The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Judge McKAY and Judge HANFT concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. We could find adequate compliance with the \u201ccomportment\u201d requirement of <em>Green </em>in the record of trial without reference to the affidavits. The terms of the written agreement were basically straightforward and simple. When the trial judge recited the essential provisions of the agreement in open court, counsel did not express any disagreement. We may infer from their silence that their understanding of the agreement comported with the trial judge\u2019s interpretation. <em>United States v. Hinton, </em>10 M.J. 136 (C.M.A.1981) and <em>United States v. Passini, </em>10 M.J. 108 (C.M.A.1980). Moreover, the terms of the agreement were moot because, with respect to the sentence, the convening authority had only agreed to suspend confinement if the confinement adjudged exceeded one year and one day. <em>Cf. United States v. Crawford, </em>11 M.J. 336 (C.M.A.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-13\">. <em>Crowley </em>has an interesting appellate history. Initially, the decision of this Court affirming the conviction was summarily reversed and a rehearing was authorized. 4 M.J. 170 (C.M.A.1977). Subsequently, a petition for reconsideration was granted. 4 M.J. 272 (C.M.A.1978). Finally, with each judge writing a separate opinion regarding the basis of his decision, none of which referred to the propriety of considering counsel\u2019s affidavits, the Court of Military Appeals unanimously affirmed the decision of this Court. 7 M.J. 336 (C.M.A.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
