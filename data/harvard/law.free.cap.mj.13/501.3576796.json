The case was referred to a general court-martial as a capital case. The appellant tendered pleas of guilty to both charges and specifications, but his pleas were rejected by the military judge, because a plea of guilty may not be received to a capital offense. Article 45(b), Uniform Code of Military Justice (hereafter cited as \u201cUCMJ\u201d), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(b) (1976); paragraph 70a, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition) (hereafter cited as \u201cMCM\u201d). The appellant then pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder, but guilty to the lesser included offense of unpremeditated murder, and not guilty to rape. He was convicted of premeditated murder and rape, and on 3 July 1979 he was sentenced to be put to death, to be dishonorably discharged, to forfeit all pay and allowances, and to be reduced to Private E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence. The case is before this Court for mandatory review pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The appellant has challenged the <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction of the court-martial, the adequacy of the record of the pretrial investigation, the qualifications of the court members and the military judge, the refusal of the military judge to accept the appellant\u2019s guilty pleas, the propriety of the trial counsel\u2019s opening statement, the failure of the prosecution to give proper notice of grants of immunity, the legality of admitting certain photographs of the victim, the sufficiency of the evidence, the propriety of his own counsel\u2019s opening statement and closing argument before the court members, the constitutionality of the death penalty, and the appropriateness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">I. FACTS OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The victim, Phyllis Jean Villanueva, worked as a librarian at the Camp Algiers library, located at Grafenwoehr, Federal Republic of Germany. The appellant was assigned to Battery B, 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery, which had arrived at Grafenwoehr during late January 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">At about 1500 hours on the afternoon of 27 February 1979, Private First Class Brian K. Taub and Private First Class Silvester A. Flores observed the appellant in the vicinity of the library, following Mrs. Villanueva and apparently attempting to engage her in conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Specialist Four Larry B. Lawson was in the library at about 1700 hours. He, the appellant and Mrs. Villanueva were the only persons in the library. Lawson observed the appellant talking to Mrs. Villanueva and leaning over her desk, at which she was seated. The appellant asked Mrs. Villanueva for a date, but she replied that she was a happily married woman. The appellant then asked Mrs. Villanueva for some \u201csexy books\u201d but she told him to obtain them from the post exchange book store across the street. When Specialist Lawson departed the library about 1720, the appellant was wandering around and appeared to be merely passing time.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">At about 1845 hours, Sergeant Mario Ledezma saw the appellant at the laundromat adjacent to the library, but he noticed nothing unusual. A short time later, Sergeant Ledezma tried to enter the library but found the entrance locked, which was unusual because the \u201cclosed\u201d sign was not posted and the library was usually open until 2000 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">During the early evening the appellant was observed by several soldiers as he entered his barracks wearing a white T-shirt, khaki pants over green sweat pants and white tennis shoes. He had blood on his shirt, pants, hands and arms. Specialist Four Mark A. LaRue saw the appellant enter and asked him if he had been in a fight, but the appellant did not respond. A few minutes later, the appellant asked La-Rue if he (the appellant) had blood on his face and LaRue answered in the negative. The appellant returned to his own area of the barracks where a group of soldiers gathered around, including Private Darrell D. Hughley. The appellant removed the bloody T-shirt and khaki pants and left them on the floor. Hughley picked up the T-shirt but the appellant snatched it away. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Hughley asked the appellant what had happened and the appellant replied that he had been in a fight off-post. Hughley, noticing the absence of any marks on appellant\u2019s face, told the appellant that he did not believe him. The appellant then said, \u201cI done killed this bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Specialist Four Jerome Turner, one of the soldiers gathered around the appellant, joined the conversation and the appellant told Turner that he \u201cjust went berserk.\u201d The appellant told Turner, \u201cI was stabbing her, I was f___ing her, I was stabbing her, I was f___ing her, I was stabbing her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Hughley and others told the appellant to take a shower, and appellant complied. He returned to his area wearing an Army-issue blue physical training uniform and combat boots. He was then observed trying to bum blood spots off the green sweat pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">During the conversations among the appellant and his fellow soldiers, the appellant asked Specialist LaRue to keep a bloodstained sweater for him, but LaRue ignored him. The appellant gave a watch, later identified as Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s, to Specialist Turner and asked him to hold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Later in the evening, Specialist Four James R. Bagwell approached the appellant, unaware of the earlier events, intending to borrow money from him. The appellant and Bagwell were from the same home town and were friends. The appellant was sitting on his foot locker and crying, saying his mother was sick. Bagwell asked to borrow some money and the appellant responded that he had none. At Bagwell\u2019s invitation they started walking toward the beer hall. As they were walking, the appellant told Bagwell, \u201cHome boy, I think I f___ed up again ... I think I killed the woman ... I stabbed her.\u201d Bagwell said he didn\u2019t want to hear about it. After they each drank a beer, the appellant said, \u201cI got to go back. I forgot something. I left a six-pack of beer.\u201d As they were walking back to the barracks from the beer hall, Bagwell asked the appellant to tell him what had happened. The appellant told Bagwell that he waited in the library until everyone had left and then began a conversation with Mrs. Villanueva. The appellant told Bagwell that Mrs. Villanueva had implied that she was interested in having sexual intercourse with him. The appellant said that he asked Mrs. Villanueva to obtain a book for him, and while she was obtaining it he locked the door and followed her to the back of the library. The appellant told Bagwell that he repeatedly poked Mrs. Villanueva in the ribs with a pair of scissors because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t move right.\u201d Then the appellant said, \u201cshe made me mad, and I just starts stabbing her all over, in her eyebrows ... I just stabbed her all over.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The appellant, followed by Bagwell, returned to the library and retrieved his six-pack of beer and some scissors. On the way back to the barracks, the appellant told Bagwell, \u201cI think she\u2019s dead, she didn\u2019t move.\u201d The appellant told Bagwell that he wore gloves while he was in the library earlier, but that the beer had his fingerprints on it. The appellant also remarked that his victim was a warrant officer\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">Back at the barracks the appellant put the scissors in a pair of socks. He took a pair of woman\u2019s panties from a brown paper bag, smelled them and offered to let Bagwell smell them. Bagwell noticed a pair of woman\u2019s shoes in the bag. There were no blood stains on either the panties or the shoes. The appellant also showed Bagwell his own underwear shorts, pointing out what the appellant said were semen stains. The appellant gave Bagwell a set of keys, later identified as Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s, a pair of scissors, and the bag containing the woman\u2019s shoes. The appellant placed the panties in his pocket. At the appellant\u2019s request, Bagwell threw away the keys and scissors and burned the shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">At about 2100 hours Chief Warrant Officer Candelario P. Villanueva, the victim\u2019s husband, became concerned because his wife was late returning home. He obtained a ride to the library from Staff Sergeant Larry Ealy, a neighbor. Mr. Villanueva found the library dark but the door unlocked. He entered, turned on the lights, and found his wife lying in a pool of blood, barefoot and naked below the waist. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Villanueva covered his wife\u2019s pubic area with a towel and asked Sergeant Ealy to summon an ambulance and the military police.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">As agents of the Grafenwoehr CID office entered the library, they noticed feces near the front entrance, near the librarian\u2019s desk, and against Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s right thigh, indicating that she had defecated while moving between the front entrance and the rear work area where the body was found. No blood stains were found beyond the rear work area.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Specialist Pour Robert S. Forry, returning from off-post late on the night of 27 February 1979, saw smoke and the remains of a smoldering fire next to the barracks. The next morning he found shoe soles, underwear, socks, and some plaid material, all partially burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On the morning of 28 February 1979, the appellant showed Private Hughley some Army gloves and told Hughley he was going to dip them in diesel fuel to get the blood off. The appellant asked Hughley to write a letter for him in order to obtain leave to visit his sick mother, and Hughley agreed. The appellant said he was too nervous to write the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The keys and scissors thrown away by Bagwell were later recovered by the CID with Bagwell\u2019s assistance. The scissors were found to contain blood and hair fragments consistent with the blood type and pubic hair of Mrs. Villanueva.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The appellant\u2019s green sweat pants were seized from his wall locker, and his tennis shoes were found on the roofs of two separate buildings. The sweat pants and tennis shoes were found to contain blood stains of the same type as Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s but unlike the appellant\u2019s. Several bloody foot prints at the library were found to have been made with the appellant\u2019s tennis shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">An autopsy was conducted on Mrs. Villanueva on 1 March 1979, which revealed 53 stab wounds, of which 6 were potentially fatal. There were a total of seven stab wounds in her left temple area. On her face were 13 stab wounds and a blunt force injury around her left eye. Based upon the amount of bleeding, the pathologist concluded that the wounds to the face probably were inflicted first. There were multiple neck wounds, including one fatal wound which pierced her jugular vein. There were six chest wounds, including two fatal wounds to her lungs and three fatal wounds to her heart. There were multiple non-fatal wounds in the abdomen, one in her pubic area, and several in her left back. Several \u201cdefensive\u201d wounds, of the type usually inflicted when a victim attempts to defend, were found on Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s hands. There were numerous superficial scratches on her face, pubic area and back. In addition, there was a large laceration of the vaginal wall, probably inflicted by a sharp instrument after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">The pathologist found sperm in Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s vagina, which he estimated to be three or four days old as of 1 March 1979, the date of his examination. The pathologist testified that sperm would be detectable for up to a week after intercourse, but usually was detectable only for a shorter period. Mr. Villanueva testified that he and his wife last had sexual intercourse on the Thursday before her death, which occurred on the following Tuesday.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">The appellant was evaluated by Major Larry D. Reed, a psychiatrist. Major Reed found that the appellant was free from substantial mental disease or defects and did not lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or the ability to control his conduct to the requirements of the law. However, Major Reed also found that the appellant has an IQ of 64,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> making him \u201cmildly retarded,\u201d and has an \u201cexplosive personality disorder.\u201d Although not schizophrenic, the appellant has opposing feelings of good and evil within himself. When he drinks, the evil side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>manifests itself. Because of his low intelligence, the appellant tends to think in concrete instead of abstract concepts. Consequently, he tends to react to perceived injustice by angry and violent behavior. The appellant told Major Reed that he drinks heavily and sometimes provokes fights with the intention of being killed. On cross-examination, Major Reed conceded that the appellant may have a \u201cdeath wish\u201d to be executed for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The appellant contends that the court-martial had no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over him because his enlistment was void <em>ab initio, </em>due to the misconduct of an Army recruiter. He contends that the recruiter, Sergeant Daryle Roberts, actively participated in obtaining his release from probation in violation of Army regulations; that Sergeant Roberts advised him to conceal a non-waivable disqualification for enlistment, <em>i.e., </em>his past history of alcoholism; and that Sergeant Roberts obtained a waiver of his moral disqualification <em>(i.e., </em>criminal record) for enlistment based upon incomplete documentation. <em>See generally United States v. Russo, </em>1 M.J. 134 (C.M.A.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Prior to his enlistment into the Army the appellant, then 19 years old, was arrested on 10 March 1976 for \u201cunlawful taking, receiving stolen goods, burglary, conspiracy, and resisting arrest.\u201d On 29 September 1976, at his request, the appellant was placed in the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) Program of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and was placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">On 5 January 1977, the appellant was interviewed by Miss Susan A. Pringle, a probation officer, who entered in her notes that the appellant was \u201cdefinitely a problem drinker \u2014 probably alcoholic.\u201d On 10 January 1977, the appellant voluntarily entered the Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Chester, Pennsylvania for in-patient treatment of his drinking problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">In May 1977, the appellant contacted Sergeant Roberts, an Army recruiter in Chester, Pennsylvania, and expressed interest in enlisting. At that time Sergeant Roberts informed the appellant that he could not enlist without a \u201cmoral waiver\u201d because of his civilian arrest and conviction record, and that he could not enlist while on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">At the trial, Sergeant Roberts testified that he contacted Miss Pringle, with whom he was acquainted from prior official contacts, told her that the appellant desired to enlist, informed her that he was prohibited from approaching anyone in an effort to terminate the appellant\u2019s probation, and advised her that he had directed the appellant to her so that the appellant could initiate action to terminate his probation. Sergeant Roberts testified that Miss Pringle advised him of her intention to ask the court to terminate the appellant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">On 9 June 1977, the probation office requested the court to dismiss the charges against the appellant, which had been held in abeyance as part of the ARD Program. They also requested early termination of the two-year probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">The request recited that the appellant\u2019s first day of military service would be 17 June 1977, a fictitious tentative date provided by Sergeant Roberts. Miss Pringle testified that she and Sergeant Roberts had worked out a system of using \u201ctentative enlistment\u201d dates to solve a \u201cCatch-22\u201d problem created by the fact that the court would not terminate probation until the appellant enlisted, yet the appellant could not be enlisted until the court terminated the probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">In accordance with Miss Pringle\u2019s request, the charges against the appellant were dismissed and his probation was terminated on 7 July 1977. The appellant enlisted in the U. S. Army Reserve on 15 July 1977 under a \u201cdelayed entry\u201d program. He then enlisted in the Regular Army and entered active service on 2 August 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">The appellant testified that he told Sergeant Roberts that he was an alcoholic, and that Sergeant Roberts advised him to conceal his alcoholism. The appellant also testified that he listed his treatment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>alcoholism on the initial medical history form which he completed in connection with his enlistment physical examination, but that the form must have been lost. The appellant testified that on two subsequent medical history forms he concealed his history of alcoholism because Sergeant Roberts had advised him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Miss Pringle testified that when Sergeant Roberts provided her with an Army form to be completed as part of the request for a moral waiver for the appellant, Sergeant Roberts told her not to \u201cgo into any of the problems,\u201d but simply to indicate that the charges had been dismissed. Although Miss Pringle at first testified that she had told Sergeant Roberts that the appellant was an alcoholic, when questioned by the military judge she stated that she merely \u201cassumed\u201d that she had advised Sergeant Roberts that the appellant had been treated for alcoholism, but that she had no specific recollection of having done so. Her testimony further reflects her belief that appellant\u2019s treatment had been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Sergeant Roberts testified that he was totally unaware of the appellant\u2019s alcoholism, that he would not have enlisted the appellant if he had known about it, that neither the appellant nor Miss Pringle mentioned it, and that he at no time advised the appellant to conceal treatment for alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing on the jurisdictional issue, the military judge made detailed findings of fact. First, he found that at the time of his enlistment the appellant met the minimum age and mental qualifications for enlistment. Next, he found that the moral waiver packet prepared as a result of the appellant\u2019s disclosure of prior criminal conduct was sufficient to support a valid waiver of the civilian arrest record even though Sergeant Roberts neglected to include a copy of the appellant\u2019s high school diploma among the supporting documents. He found that the only evidence that Sergeant Roberts knew about the appellant\u2019s alcoholism was the appellant\u2019s testimony which was counter-balanced by Sergeant Roberts\u2019 own testimony that he did not know about it. The military judge believed that, although it was doubtful that the appellant was an alcoholic as a matter of medical diagnosis, his conduct had led knowledgeable persons to conclude prior to his enlistment that he was an alcoholic.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The military judge found that the appellant was and is manipulative, deceptive and has a unique ability to enlist the aid and assistance of others to obtain his objectives. The judge noted that the appellant admitted in his own testimony that he had lied to every Army representative except Sergeant Roberts, obtained false character affidavits, persuaded his probation officer that he was rehabilitated and that enlistment was in his best interests, persuaded his probation officer to sign a less than truthful record, falsified each entry pertaining to alcoholism on all enlistment forms, and successfully withstood all attempts at all levels to determine whether any such disqualification existed. The judge concluded that the appellant would have been unlikely to disclose his alcoholism if he knew it would bar him from enlisting, unless he was certain that the person to whom he made the disclosure would be willing to violate the law to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The judge further found that, although Sergeant Roberts was willing to bend the rules by providing a fictitious date of prospective enlistment to permit a potential recruit to seek termination of probation, and although he may have told the appellant that an affirmative response to certain questions would either require a waiver or constitute a bar to enlistment, he did not assist the appellant in falsifying any enlistment forms, nor did he give the appellant any reason to believe that he would be willing to do so, and that the testimony of Sergeant Roberts was more credible than that of the appellant, although neither standing alone was totally persuasive. The judge believed that Sergeant Roberts\u2019 truthfulness was bolstered by the fact that he had prepared a \u201cmoral waiver\u201d packet in the appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Lastly, the judge found that the initiative to enlist was that of the appellant and not that of Sergeant Roberts, the Pennsylvania courts, the probation officer, or any other official, and that the appellant desired to be a soldier, accepted the benefits of military service, and never made any meaningful effort to be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Based on his findings of fact, the military judge concluded that at all times during the enlistment process the appellant possessed the capacity to enter a contract and assume military status; that the technical defects in the moral waiver packet were, at most, latent defects making the enlistment voidable rather than void; that Sergeant Roberts was guilty of no recruiter misconduct, although he may have been negligent; and that the appellant\u2019s false and fraudulent representations, not Sergeant Roberts\u2019 negligence, were the proximate cause of the appellant\u2019s enlistment. He further concluded that, notwithstanding the fabricated prospective enlistment date, there was no fraud perpetrated on the Pennsylvania courts, and that the appellant\u2019s probation was validly terminated prior to his enlistment. Lastly, he concluded that the appellant\u2019s enlistment was \u201cvoluntary\u201d in every sense; and that the enlistment was merely voidable rather than void.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We hold that the military judge correctly found that the appellant was subject to the jurisdiction of the court-martial. Two of appellants arguments can be disposed of without lengthy discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">With respect to the alleged violation by Sergeant Roberts of the prohibition against actively participating in the termination of probation, we find that Sergeant Roberts\u2019 conduct was within the apparent limits of the regulation. However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that his contact with Miss Pringle violated Army regulations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the cited paragraph does not establish a regulatory bar to enlistment of an individual, but merely establishes a rule of conduct for recruiters to avoid their being placed in a compromising or embarrassing situation. The qualifications and disqualifications for enlistment are treated in detail elsewhere in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Regarding the allegedly incomplete moral waiver packet, we do not believe that the negligent omission of the high school diploma defeats jurisdiction. At most, it amounts to an administrative irregularity which does not nullify the waiver granted by the reviewing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Under the controlling case law in effect prior to the effective date of the November 1979 amendments to Article 2, UCMJ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> recruiter misconduct designed to conceal a nonwaivable disqualification would defeat jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Russo, </em>1 M.J. 134 (C.M.A.1975). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>jurisdiction would be defeated only if Sergeant Roberts were aware of the appellant\u2019s alleged alcoholism prior to the enlistment and advised, counseled, or encouraged the appellant to conceal it. The trial judge was satisfied that Sergeant Roberts was unaware of the disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The trial judge rejected the appellant\u2019s testimony and believed Sergeant Roberts. He made no mention of Miss Pringle\u2019s testimony in his findings of fact, which we find understandable in view of the wavering and inconclusive nature of her testimony. Because of his superior opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and evaluate their credibility, the military judge\u2019s belief of Sergeant Roberts and rejection of the appellant\u2019s testimony on this issue should not be disregarded lightly. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c) (1976); <em>United States v. Frierson, </em>20 U.S.C.M.A. 452, 454, 43 C.M.R. 292, 294 (1971); <em>United States v. Albright, </em>9 U.S.C.M.A. 628, 631, 26 C.M.R. 408, 411 (1958); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>6 M.J. 577, 579 (A.C.M.R.1978); <em>pet. denied, </em>6 M.J. 239 (C.M.A.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We have independently reviewed the evidence and are satisfied that Sergeant Roberts was unaware of the appellant\u2019s alleged alcoholism at the time of appellant\u2019s enlistment. Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Sergeant Roberts was negligent in not discovering the appellant\u2019s possible disqualification, such negligence does not deprive the court-martial of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Valadez, </em>5 M.J. 470 (C.M.A.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Since we are satisfied that Sergeant Roberts was not involved in any deliberate concealment of a non-waivable disqualification, we need not decide whether the November 1979 amendments to Article 2, UCMJ, may be applied retroactively to cases, such as this one, tried prior to the effective date of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">III. FAILURE TO PROVIDE A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT OF THE ARTICLE 32 INVESTIGATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">The appellant contends that the refusal of the government to provide a verbatim transcript of the Article 32 hearing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to effective representation by counsel. We find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">The appellant has cited no legal authority for requiring a verbatim transcript and we have found none. The law requires only that \u201ca statement of the substance of the testimony taken on both sides\u201d be prepared. Article 32(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832(b) (1976); paragraph 34e(2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>5 U.S.C.M.A. 626, 18 C.M.R. 250 (1955); <em>United States v. Frederick, </em>7 M.J. 791, 796 (N.C.M.R.), <em>pet. denied, </em>8 M.J. 42 (C.M.A.1979); <em>United States v. Combs, </em>28 C.M.R. 866, 873 (A.F.B.R.1959). As the trial judge so aptly observed when the same issue was raised before him, \u201c[T]he court is required to consider not perhaps what would have been best, but whether what was done met the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Furthermore, we find appellant\u2019s contention that the lack of a verbatim transcript deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel without factual basis. The appellant was ably and vigorously represented by detailed counsel at the hearing. The Investigating Officer\u2019s Report, Item 2g, and Appellate Exhibit 7, the investigating officer\u2019s handwritten notes, reflect that, although the individual civilian counsel had been retained, he elected not to attend the hearing. The investigating officer\u2019s report also reflects that the detailed defense counsel coordinated the defense strategy at the hearing with the individual counsel. For example, the detailed counsel, after consultation with individual counsel, withdrew a request for defense witnesses. There is no legal requirement to take extraordinary meas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ures to assist individual counsel in trial preparation when he voluntarily foregoes the discovery opportunity provided by the Article 32(b) investigation. Nevertheless, the record reflects that the investigating officer in this case went to extraordinary lengths to insure that the individual counsel would receive as complete and detailed a report as possible. We are satisfied that the Article 32(b) investigation was conducted in full compliance with the law and that the appellant was fully afforded his right to representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">IV. DISQUALIFICATION OF COURT MEMBERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The appellant contends that the court members in this case were \u201cbiased and prejudiced against the accused in that they possessed explicit prior knowledge of all pertinent events of this case from the moment of the crime up to and through investigation and the actual Court-Martial proceeding.\u201d This contention is without factual support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">A searching voir dire by the military judge and counsel for both sides revealed that, of the ten court members detailed to hear the case, only two had any knowledge beyond vague recollection of news reports and casual conversations within the command indicating that a librarian at Camp Algiers had been raped and murdered, that someone had been charged, a trial had commenced, and a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial had been denied. All members clearly indicated their lack of predisposition or bias, as well as their willingness to withhold judgment until they had heard all the evidence and had been instructed on the law and to follow the military judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Two officers, Major Waits and Captain Everett, were challenged by the prosecution, but the challenges were opposed by appellant\u2019s counsel. Needless to say, we find it curious that the same counsel who opposed the challenges at the trial now predicates error on the failure of the military judge to excuse these same two members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">Major Waits, in his capacity as Deputy Adjutant General of the 1st Armored Division, had prepared the report of Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s death and letters of condolence to her next of kin. His knowledge was limited to the medical cause of death, identity of the victim and next of kin, and similar administrative information. Captain Everett had begun reading a newspaper account but stopped when he read the appellant\u2019s name. At that point he had read only that a woman had been raped and killed and that a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">The record clearly reflects that the court members had only vague and general knowledge that an incident characterized as a rape and murder had occurred. Their actual and specific knowledge about the reported facts of the case was less than the information on the charge sheet. We are satisfied from their responses on the record that all members were mentally free to render an impartial finding and sentence based upon the law and the evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the assigned error is without merit. <em>See United States v. McQueen, </em>7 M.J. 281 (C.M.A.1979); <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>7 M.J. 282 (C.M.A.1979); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>6 U.S.C.M.A. 274, 284-85, 19 C.M.R. 400, 410-11 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">V. FAILURE OF THE MILITARY JUDGE TO RECUSE HIMSELF.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The appellant contends that the military judge should have recused himself, <em>sua sponte, </em>after refusing to accept the appellant\u2019s tender of pleas of guilty to premeditated murder and rape. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">At the outset, this case must be distinguished from cases in which the military judge rejects a guilty plea after conducting an inquiry into the factual basis for the plea. In this case, the military judge summarily rejected the tendered plea without making any factual inquiry because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>prohibited from receiving a guilty plea to a capital offense. Article 45(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(b) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Even in a bench trial, a military judge is not required to recuse himself after rejecting a guilty plea if he has not gained factual knowledge of the offenses charged and has not been required to reach conclusions regarding the accused\u2019s factual and legal guilt. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>8 M.J. 5 (C.M.A.1979). Furthermore, even in cases where the military judge has become \u201ctainted\u201d by his involvement in a rejected plea of guilty, he has the option either to recuse himself or to direct a trial with members. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>7 M.J. 332, 334 (C.M.A.1979). Since this case was a trial with members, recusal was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We note that in this case the appellant persisted in his request for trial by judge alone even after the judge rejected the appellant\u2019s efforts to enter pleas of guilty. Of course, the military judge denied the request for a bench trial because of the jurisdictional limitations imposed by Article 18, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 818 (1976). Nevertheless, the appellant\u2019s persistence in a request for a bench trial demonstrates his absence of any real concern regarding the impartiality of the military judge during the trial. Our review of the record of trial convinces us that the military judge remained impartial and scrupulously fair throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the military judge did not err by failing to recuse himself after refusing to receive the appellant\u2019s pleas of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">VI. DENIAL OF THE RIGHT TO PLEAD GUILTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The appellant contends that he was denied his \u201cconstitutional right to plead guilty.\u201d There is no absolute constitutional right to plead guilty. <em>See Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 38, n. 11, 91 S.Ct. 160, 167, n. 11, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>Lynch v. Overholser, </em>369 U.S. 705, 719, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 1072, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962); <em>but cf. United States v. Gaskins, </em>485 F.2d 1046 (D.C.Cir.1973) (rejection of guilty plea under F.R.Crim.P. Rule 11 may be abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>43 C.M.R. 579 (A.C.M.R.1970) (arbitrary rejection of guilty plea without legal basis is abuse of discretion). Unlike the civilian federal courts, there is no statutory right to plead guilty in a military capital case. To the contrary, in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Congress has prohibited a guilty plea to a capital offense. Article 45(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(b) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">There was no possibility of an abuse of discretion with respect to the proffered guilty plea to premeditated murder because the military judge\u2019s discretion had been removed by Article 45(b). However, with respect to the charge of rape, the answer is less clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">In <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977), the Supreme Court held the death penalty to be disproportionate and excessive for rape of an adult woman. The case involved a Georgia statute making rape punishable by death if the jury found at least one of the following statutory aggravating circumstances: (1) that the rape was committed by a person with a prior record of conviction for a capital felony; (2) that the rape was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony, or aggravated battery; or (3) the rape \u201cwas outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">The prosecution alleged and the jury found the first two circumstances but not the third. Justices White, Stewart, Black-mun and Stevens concluded that the death penalty was excessive for the rape of an adult woman even though the jury had found two of the three statutory aggravating circumstances. Justices Brennan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Marshall concurred on the ground that the death penalty is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that a plea of guilty lawfully could have been received by the military judge, since the Supreme Court had effectively invalidated that portion of Article 120, UCMJ, making rape a capital offense. However, we find no abuse of discretion in the cautious approach taken by the military judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The essence of the appellant\u2019s complaint is that Article 45(b) precludes him from presenting himself to the sentencing authority as one who is contrite and has taken the first step toward rehabilitation. However, in this case the military judge instructed the court members that in their deliberations on the sentence they should consider, among numerous other factors, that \u201cthe accused in this case had, to the extent allowed by law, entered a plea of guilty. His plea of guilty may be considered by you as a manifestation of repentance and may be the first step towards rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In light of the military judge\u2019s instruction, we find the appellant\u2019s assertion that he was deprived of the opportunity to appear contrite and a good candidate for rehabilitation to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">VII. MOTION FOR MISTRIAL BASED UPON IMPROPER OPENING STATEMENT BY THE TRIAL COUNSEL.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The appellant contends that the military judge erred by denying a motion for mistrial based on inflammatory remarks by the trial counsel during his opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">In his opening statement, the trial counsel informed the court members of his intention to prove that the appellant had repeatedly expressed a desire to brutally rape a woman. The trial counsel further informed the court members of his intention to prove that the appellant tortured Mrs. Villanueva before killing her. Immediately at the conclusion of the trial counsel\u2019s opening statement and at several other times throughout the trial, the military judge cautioned the court members not to regard the trial counsel\u2019s assertions as evidence. Out of the presence of the court members, after the trial counsel\u2019s opening statement and the military judge\u2019s first cautionary instruction, the individual defense counsel moved for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">The question whether to declare a mistrial rests within the discretion of the military judge. A mistrial is an extreme remedy, but is appropriate when circumstances arise that cast substantial doubt on the fairness of the trial. When a request for mistrial is based upon information improperly brought before the court members, a mistrial should be granted if the effects of such information cannot be removed by an instruction to disregard it. Paragraph 56e(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">In his opening statement, a trial counsel is permitted to make a brief statement of the issues to be tried and what he expects to prove, but he must avoid \u201cincluding or suggesting matters as to which no admissible evidence is available or intended to be offered.\u201d Paragraph 44g(2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The opening statement should be limited to matters \u201cwhich the prosecutor believes in good faith will be available and admissible.\u201d American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 3-5.5 (2d ed. 1980). Where the evidence actually adduced falls short of the trial counsel\u2019s promises, we must consider all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the surrounding circumstances, including whether the matters referred to were significant, whether the trial counsel intentionally misstated the evidence and the likelihood that the statements would have influenced or inflamed the court members. <em>See United States v. Grandy, </em>11 M.J. 270, 275 (C.M.A.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">With regard to the trial counsel\u2019s assertion that he would prove that the appellant had \u201crepeatedly\u201d expressed a desire to \u201cbrutally\u201d rape a woman, it is clear that the trial counsel\u2019s proof fell short of his promises, proving neither that the statements were made \u201crepeatedly\u201d nor that they encompassed \u201cbrutally\u201d raping a woman. Unfortunately, the trial counsel was dependent upon Specialist Bagwell, a reluctant witness, a friend of the appellant, and an accessory after the fact, to prove his point. The most that the trial counsel could elicit from Bagwell was that, on one occasion approximately two weeks before the rape and murder, the appellant had stated that he would like to rape a woman, and that he had told Bagwell how he would like to do it. However, Bagwell did not relate to the court how the appellant said he would like to commit the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In view of the trial counsel\u2019s apparent good faith and the repeated admonitions by the military judge that statements of counsel are not evidence, we are satisfied that the military judge\u2019s curative instructions were an adequate remedy for the trial counsel\u2019s overstatement of his case, and that the military judge did not abuse his discretion by declining to invoke the drastic remedy of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As for the trial counsel\u2019s reference to torture, the military judge instructed the court members to disregard all references by the pathologist to \u201ctorture wounds\u201d because the pathologist could not testify with reasonable medical certainty, based upon his examination of Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s body, that the wounds were inflicted to torture her. However, the prosecution presented ample evidence, including the appellant\u2019s admissions to Bagwell, which would support an inference that Mrs. Villanueva was tortured before she was killed. Accordingly, we conclude that the reference to torture in the trial counsel\u2019s opening statement was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">VIII. NOTICE OF GRANTS OF IMMUNITY.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The appellant contends that he was not given reasonable notice of the grants of immunity to three prosecution witnesses. The three government witnesses, Specialist Turner, Specialist Hughley, and Specialist Bagwell, testified after they had been granted testimonial immunity. Each had declined to testify at the Article 32 investigation. All three grants of immunity were issued by the convening authority on 18 June 1979 and the defense was notified on the following day, which was two days before the trial commenced and nine days before the witnesses testified. Trial sessions were held on four of the intervening nine days.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The defense must be notified of a grant of immunity within a reasonable time before the witness testifies. The remedies for violation of this rule are to \u201cgrant a continuance until such time as is necessary to obtain compliance, prohibit testimony by the person to whom the grant of immunity has been given, or enter such other order as may be required.\u201d <em>United States v. Webster, </em>1 M.J. 216, 221 (C.M.A.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">In this case, the defense was provided with copies of the sworn statements of Turner, Hughley and Bagwell which were considered by the Article 32 investigating officer. At the trial, the individual defense counsel did not request a continuance. To the contrary, he informed the military judge that he did not consider any remedy short of dismissing the charges to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">We believe that, in this case, nine days was a \u201creasonable time\u201d between the required notification to the defense and the witnesses\u2019 testimony, especially in view of the fact that the court-martial was not in session on five of those days. We find this assignment of error without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>IX. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to prove that the murder of Mrs. Villanueva was premeditated. Since the appellant providently pleaded guilty to unpremeditated murder, the only factual issue presented to the court members was the issue of premeditation. The appellant argues that the testimony of Major Reed regarding the appellant\u2019s low intelligence, suicidal tendencies, explosive personality, alcoholism, as well as evidence that the appellant was drinking prior to the murder, and evidence of the appellant\u2019s failure to conceal his bloody clothing and hands after the murder, considered together are sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about his ability to premeditate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On the issue of intoxication, Private Hughley testified that the appellant had been drinking on the afternoon of 27 February. However, Specialist Turner, Specialist LaRue and Private Hughley all testified that the appellant did not appear intoxicated when they saw him shortly after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Although the appellant made no effort to conceal his blood-spattered appearance from his fellow soldiers in the unit, he took elaborate precautions to avoid detection by law enforcement personnel. He retrieved the six-pack of beer which he believed to bear his fingerprints, gave away Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s watch, attempted to bum the blood spots from his sweat pants, concealed his tennis shoes by throwing one shoe onto the roof of one building and the other shoe onto the roof of another building, asked Specialist LaRue to conceal a blood-stained sweater, and told Specialist Bagwell to throw away the scissors and Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s keys and to burn her shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The appellant\u2019s murder of Mrs. Villanueva was preceded by elaborate preparations. The appellant waited until the library was empty, tricked Mrs. Villanueva into walking to the back of the library, removed the entrance key from her desk, locked the entrance, and wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. Although he took precautions against leaving fingerprints, he made no effort to conceal his face, indicating that he did not intend to leave a victim who could identify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Lastly, the brutal nature of the attack on Mrs. Villanueva is evidence of premeditation. The evidence showed that Mrs. Villanueva, while partially unclothed and moving throughout the library, was sufficiently terrified to involuntarily defecate near the front entrance, in front of the librarian\u2019s desk, and again at the apparent place of her death. The bottoms of her feet were soiled, indicating that she had walked or run after her shoes had been removed. The appellant stated that Mrs. Villanueva made him angry because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t move right\u201d while he was raping her, and so he poked her with the scissors and stabbed her in the face. He hit her in the left eye with a blunt object, probably his fist. Finally, the appellant inflicted 53 stab wounds, including 6 lethal wounds, and after she was already dead, attacked her sexual organs with the scissors. \u201c[T]he vicious assaults resulting in multiple grievous injuries bespeak a premeditated design to kill.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>6 U.S.C.M.A. 736, 741, 21 C.M.R. 58, 63 (1956); <em>accord, United States </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>14 U.S.C.M.A. 336, 34 C.M.R. 116 (1964); <em>see generally </em>2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (14th Edition, 1979), \u00a7 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">We are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had a premeditated design to kill Mrs. Villanueva, as evidenced by his elaborate preparations as well as by the brutal manner in which she was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">X. ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VICTIM.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">The appellant contends that the military judge erred by admitting eight photographs of the victim, because \u201cthe only effect . . . was to appeal to the emotions of the court members and invite prejudice and bias toward the appellant.\u201d We find his contention without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Of the 19 photographs of Mrs. Villanueva proffered by the prosecution, only 8 were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Prosecution Exhibits 3 and 4 are black and white photographs of Mrs. Villanueva as she was found by her husband. They show her lying on her back in a pool of blood, barefoot and nude from the waist down. Her face, neck and chest are covered with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Prosecution Exhibits 14,16, 20, 23, 24 and 26 are color photographs of Mrs. Villanueva which were taken at the pathology laboratory after her body had been cleaned of blood and excrement.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Prosecution Exhibit 14 shows the stab wounds on Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s face, neck, chest and abdomen. Prosecution Exhibit 16 is a close-up of Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s face, showing the blunt force injury to her left eye, and stab wounds in the face and left side of the neck. Prosecution Exhibit 20 is a close-up of the fatal wound to the right side of the neck, a wound on the chin, and several other neck wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Prosecution Exhibit 23 is an extreme close-up of the stab wound and scratches in Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s pubic hair. Prosecution Exhibit 24 shows stab wounds in the side and back. Prosecution Exhibit 26 shows defense wounds on Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">We believe that the photographs were relevant because they tended to establish the appellant\u2019s premeditated design to kill. <em>See United States v. Ayers, </em>14 U.S.C. M.A. 336, 34 C.M.R. 116 (1964); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>6 U.S.C.M.A. 736, 741, 21 C.M.R. 58, 63 (1956); <em>United States v. Rig-gins, </em>2 U.S.C.M.A. 451, 9 C.M.R. 81 (1953) (viciousness of the attack may prove premeditated design to kill).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Furthermore, the photographs served to illustrate the testimony of the pathologist and to prove the nature of the wounds and the cause of death. <em>See United States v. Bartholomew, </em>1 U.S.C.M.A. 307, 314, 3 C.M.R. 41, 48 (1952); <em>United States v. Tua,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">4 M.J. 761 (A.C.M.R.1977), <em>pet. denied, </em>5 M.J. 91 (C.M.A.1978); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>33 C.M.R. 868, 877-78 (A.F.B.R.), <em>pet. denied, </em>33 C.M.R. 436 (C.M.A.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">Finally, we note that the military judge was extremely circumspect in his rulings on the admissibility of the photographs. The two photographs of Mrs. Villanueva as she was found by her husband are in black and white. The color photographs show Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s body in clinical surroundings after her wounds had been cleaned. They do not magnify or exaggerate the wounds. The military judge admitted only the minimum number of photographs necessary to. illustrate the testimony of the pathologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The admission of photographs is a matter within the military judge\u2019s discretion. His ruling should not be overturned unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>6 U.S.C.M.A. 92, 97, 19 C.M.R. 218, 223 (1955); <em>United States v. Bartholomew, supra; United States v. Tua, supra; United States v. Montgomery, </em>5 M.J. 832, 834 (A.C.M.R.), <em>pet. denied </em>6 M.J. 89 (C.M.A.1978); <em>United States v. Noreen, </em>48 C.M.R. 228 (A.C.M.R. 1973), <em>affirmed </em>23 U.S.C.M.A. 212, 49 C.M.R. 1 (1974); <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>36 C.M.R. 574 (A.B.R.1965), <em>pet. denied </em>36 C.M.R. 541 (C.M.A.1966). We believe that the military judge\u2019s rulings in this case were well within the limits of sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">XI. DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S CONCESSION OF THE APPELLANT\u2019S GUILT OF RAPE.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">In his opening statement, made after the prosecution had rested, the individual defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-17\">Under the law, he cannot plead guilty to rape as it is specified. However, I tell you candidly from the outset, Private Matthews does not in fact deny raping the victim on February 27 of this year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>So what you have before you is a situation where the accused comes before you admitting unpremeditated murder, and also admitting rape as specified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The defense tactic was simple: to focus on the issue of premeditation. The individual defense counsel had cross-examined the government psychiatrist at length to develop evidence tending to show that the appellant, because of his limited intelligence, acute alcoholism, explosive personality, and intoxication, could not and did not premeditate the murder of Mrs. Villanueva.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The defense case consisted of testimonial and documentary evidence of the appellant\u2019s history of alcoholism. In closing arguments, the individual defense counsel conceded that the appellant stabbed and raped Mrs. Villanueva, but concentrated his argument on the issue of premeditation, dwelling at length on the appellant\u2019s limited intelligence, alcoholism and personality disorders, characterizing the appellant as a person capable of \u201cdoing but not thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The appellant now contends that the military judge erred by allowing the individual defense counsel to admit the appellant\u2019s guilt of rape, contrary to appellant\u2019s plea of not guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We believe that, under the circumstances of this case, the individual defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics were not only proper but a realistic approach to a difficult case. Faced with overwhelming evidence, he wisely chose to focus the court\u2019s attention on what he perceived to be the weakest point of the government\u2019s case. Persuading the court that the murder was not premeditated was the appellant\u2019s only hope of avoiding a mandatory sentence to either life imprisonment or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, we do not believe that the military judge was required to question the appellant and obtain his express consent to his counsel\u2019s trial tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">This court previously has held that the defense \u201cmay in an appropriate case concede that the Government has met its burden on one of several charges in order to emphasize the asserted weakness of the remaining charges,\u201d so long as the defense counsel does not concede an issue contrary to the testimony of the accused and does not concede guilt in the face of a defense raised by the accused in his testimony. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>9 M.J. 534, 536 (A.C.M.R.1980); <em>see United States v. Henderson, </em>44 C.M.R. 553, 556 (A.F.C.M.R.), <em>pet. denied, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 599, 44 C.M.R. 939 (1971); <em>United States v. Buchanan, 37 </em>C.M.R. 927 (A.F.B.R.), <em>pet. denied, 17 </em>U.S.C.M.A. 646, 37 C.M.R. 470 (1967); <em>Turberville v. United States, </em>303 F.2d 411 (D.C.Cir.1962); <em>but see United States v. Smith, </em>8 U.S.C.M.A. 582, 25 C.M.R. 86 (1958) (concession improper where it conflicted both with plea of not guilty and accused\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Under appropriate circumstances, concessions by counsel \u201care not only proper, but highly commendable.\u201d <em>Tatum v. United States, </em>190 F.2d 612, 618 (D.C.Cir.1951). Although rape is a serious offense, it clearly was the less serious of the two offenses before the court in this case. To concede a lesser offense in an effort to avoid conviction of a greater offense is a proper and legitimate trial tactic. The fact that it was unsuccessful does not make it any less proper. <em>United States v. Caldwell, supra, </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">The appellant argues that his counsel conceded his guilt of a capital offense, thereby subverting the purpose of Article 45(b), which prohibits receiving a guilty plea to a capital offense. We disagree with the appellant\u2019s characterization of rape as a capital offense. As noted in Part VI of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>Article 120 authorizes the death penalty for rape, but the provision has been effectively invalidated by the United States Supreme Court holding that the death penalty is so disproportionate to the crime that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for the offense of rape of an adult woman. <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977). Accordingly, we are satisfied that conceding the appellant\u2019s guilt of rape did not contravene Article 45(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The appellant argues that the military judge should have conducted an inquiry to determine whether the appellant agreed with and understood his counsel\u2019s tactics. We do not believe that an inquiry was required in this case. The appellant cites the opinion of the Court of Military Appeals in <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>16 U.S.C.M.A. 304, 36 C.M.R. 460 (1966), in support of his argument. In <em>Hampton </em>the Court of Military Appeals observed that \u201cthe concession demanded interrogation of the accused concerning his agreement thereto, as well as his understanding of its meaning and effect as a virtual plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. However, in <em>Hampton </em>the Court was confronted with a total concession of guilt to the only specification before the trial court. The <em>Hampton </em>opinion relies heavily on <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), in which the defense counsel totally capitulated, presenting no evidence and cross-examining no witnesses. The defense counsel in <em>Brookhart </em>told the trial court at the outset that he would neither offer any evidence nor cross-examine any of the prosecution witnesses. The Supreme Court found that the defense counsel had improperly overridden his client\u2019s expressed desire to plead not guilty and had foreclosed his client\u2019s constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The <em>Hampton </em>decision subsequently has been interpreted as stopping short of establishing a <em>per se </em>rule requiring inquiry of the appellant in all cases involving concessions by counsel. See <em>United States v. Caldwell, supra, </em>at 536; <em>United States v. Buchanan, supra, </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Unlike the situations in <em>Brookhart </em>and <em>Hampton, </em>the appellant in this case retained and vigorously exercised his constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. Unlike <em>Brookhart </em>and <em>Hampton, </em>this case involved a tactical decision to concede a less serious offense in an effort to avoid conviction of a more serious offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Unlike <em>Brookhart </em>and <em>Hampton, </em>the appellant in this case attempted to plead guilty to the offense which his counsel conceded; unlike <em>Brookhart, </em>the appellant did not contradict his counsel\u2019s proposed tactics, even though he had ample opportunity to do so during the lengthy colloquy with the military judge regarding his plea of guilty to unpremeditated murder. The appellant in this case has never disavowed his counsel\u2019s concession of guilt. To the contrary, he argues before this court that he should have been permitted to enter a plea of guilty to rape. (Part VI of this opinion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The record in this case shows that (1) at the time of trial the appellant desired to plead guilty to rape; (2) the appellant was advised generally of the meaning and effect of a guilty plea in connection with his guilty plea to unpremeditated murder; (3) since the prosecution presented its entire case and the defense cross-examined the prosecution witnesses at length, it is clear that the appellant exercised rather than waived his constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination with respect to the charge of rape; and (4) the individual defense counsel, faced with overwhelming evidence, wisely chose to focus the court\u2019s attention on what he perceived to be the weakest point in the government\u2019s case, <em>i.e., </em>the issue of premeditation. Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the military judge did not err by permitting the defense counsel to concede the appellant\u2019s guilt of rape, nor did he err by failing to obtain the express personal consent of the appellant to his counsel\u2019s trial tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">XII. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE DEATH PENALTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The appellant contends that his death sentence violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishments, because the Uniform Code of Military Justice fails adequately to insure that the appellant falls into a category for which the legislature has prescribed death as a just penalty, the sentencing decision was not sufficiently controlled to avoid arbitrariness and discrimination, the court members were not given sufficient guidance regarding the factors which are rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>vant to sentencing, and there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing military cases in which the death penalty was imposed from those in which it was not. <em>See Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A. <em>Constitutional Standards for Imposing the Death Penalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">It is clear that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to prohibit the imposition of the death penalty in all cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Likewise, the drafters of the earliest American military legal systems contemplated that the death penalty would be imposed in certain cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is well settled that a sentence violates the Eighth Amendment proscription against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment if it is grossly disproportionate and excessive to the offense for which it is imposed. <em>Cf., Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 596 (1958) (loss of citizenship excessive punishment for desertion); Weems <em>v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 549, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910) (sentence to 12 years in chains with loss of civil rights for life excessive for falsifying public documents). A majority of the Supreme Court has recognized that the death penalty is not <em>per se </em>disproportionate for murder. Only two justices of the Supreme Court have taken the position that the death penalty is <em>per se </em>cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 257, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2735, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (Brennan, J., concurring), 314 (Marshall, J., concurring). Therefore, we decide this case on the premise that the death penalty is not absolutely prohibited by either the Eighth Amendment or Article 55 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, we must also decide whether the death sentence in this case was imposed in accordance with constitutionally acceptable procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">In <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), the Georgia and Texas procedures for imposing the death penalty were struck down as violative of the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishments. <em>Furman </em>involved three persons sentenced to death, one in Georgia for murder and one for rape, and one in Texas for rape. Each of the five Justices voting to strike down the Georgia and Texas procedures filed a separate opinion, leaving the state of the law unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Justices Brennan and Marshall found the death penalty <em>per se </em>unconstitutional for any criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Justice Douglas found that, because the procedures by which the death penalty was imposed allowed unfettered jury discretion, they were \u201cpregnant with discrimination and discrimination is an ingredient not compatible with the idea of equal protection of the laws that is implicit in the ban on \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256-57, 92 S.Ct. at 2735-36 (Douglas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Justice Stewart found that the Georgia and Texas procedures gave the jury unguided discretion, which permitted the death penalty to be \u201cso wantonly and so freakishly imposed.\u201d He found that death sentences were imposed under the Georgia and Texas laws then in effect in such a manner to be \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309-10, 92 S.Ct. at 2762-63 (Stewart, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Justice White found that no valid purpose was served by the death penalty under the laws in question because it was being used so rarely that it had ceased to be a credible deterrent. He was concerned that there was no apparent meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which the death penalty was imposed from the many in which a lesser sentence was imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 311-14, 92 S.Ct. at 2763-64 (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The <em>Furman </em>decision made it clear that a system of completely unguided jury discretion in imposing the death penalty was unconstitutional. However, the Court gave no clear guidance concerning what was required to survive constitutional muster.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">In <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976), the Supreme Court upheld a death sentence imposed under Florida law, revised in response to <em>Furman, </em>which prescribes a bifurcated trial at which, following a conviction of first-degree murder, a separate sentence hearing is required if the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder. First-degree murder includes premeditated murder, felony-murder, and murder resulting from heroin distribution. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 782-04(1) (Supp. 1976-77). At the sentence hearing, the jury is directed to determine whether the death sentence should be imposed by balancing specific statutory aggravating factors<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> against specific statutory mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ing factors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury determination is made by majority vote and is not binding on the judge, who actually imposes sentence. If a death sentence is imposed, the judge must make written findings regarding the aggravating and mitigating factors relied upon in imposing a death penalty. A death sentence is subject to automatic appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Justices Stewart, Powell and Stevens found that the Florida procedure adequately insured \u201can informed, focused, guided and objective inquiry\u201d into the question whether the death penalty should be imposed. Justice White, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist found that \u201calthough the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances [set out in the Florida statute] are not susceptible of mechanical application, they are by no means' so vague and overbroad as to leave the discretion of the sentencing authority unfettered.\u201d <em>Proffitt, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 260, 96 S.Ct. at 2970. Justice White also observed that \u201c[t]here is good reason to anticipate, then, that as to certain categories of murderers, the penalty will not be imposed freakishly or rarely but will be imposed with regularity . ... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice White was satisfied that the Florida statute eliminated his concern that the death penalty was neither a credible deterrent nor did it contribute to any other end of punishment in the criminal justice system. <em>See Furman v. Georgia, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 311, 92 S.Ct. at 2763 (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">In <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), the Supreme Court upheld a death sentence imposed after the Georgia procedures were revised in response to <em>Furman. </em>The revised Georgia procedure also provides for a bifurcated trial. However, in Georgia the jury\u2019s determination is binding. The sentencing authority must find at least one of ten statutory aggravating factors,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tied to consider any other relevant nonstatutory aggravating factor as well as any relevant mitigating circumstances. The mitigating factors are not specified by statute. Georgia provides for special appellate review to determine whether the death sentence was influenced by passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors; whether the evidence supports the sentencing authority\u2019s finding regarding the aggravating circumstances; and whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Georgia Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2537 (Supp.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The Court concluded that the Georgia statutory scheme, requiring a finding of at least one statutory aggravating factor, an opportunity to consider mitigating factors, and an expanded scope of appellate sentence review, was sufficient to overcome the <em>Furman </em>objections to the previous Georgia procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976) the Court upheld a death sentence imposed under procedures substantially different from Florida and Georgia. Texas procedure also prescribes a bifurcated trial. However, rather than specify aggravating factors to be considered after findings, Texas specifies five categories of murder as \u201ccapital\u201d: murder committed in the course of certain felonies, murder for remuneration, murder of a peace officer, murder committed while escaping or attempting to escape from a penal institution, and murder of a prison employee by a prison inmate. Tex. Penal Code, \u00a7 19.03 (1974). If a defendant is convicted of capital murder, then the jury may impose a death sentence only if it finds, by unanimous verdict, (1) that the conduct of the defendant was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result, (2) that there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society, and, (3) if raised by the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s conduct in killing the deceased was an unreasonable response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased. Texas Code Crim.Proc. Art. 37.071(b). In essence, the three jury questions require each juror to determine whether, because of the nature and circumstances of the offense as well as the background and character of the defendant,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the death penalty should be imposed. Like Florida and Georgia, Texas requires that a death sentence be subject to special appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">In <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) and <em>Bell v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 637, 98 S.Ct. 2977, 57 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1978), the Ohio death penalty was struck down. The Ohio statutes prescribed a bifurcated trial. A death penalty for murder was precluded when one or more of three mitigating factors was established by the defendant: that the victim induced or facilitated the killing, that it was unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for the fact that the defendant was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that the offense was primarily the product of the defendant\u2019s psychosis or mental deficiency, even though such mental condition was insufficient to establish the defense of insanity. Ohio Stat. \u00a7 2929.03-.04. The statute was interpreted by the Ohio court to require the death penalty if the defendant did not prove at least one of the mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. A plurality of the Court, consisting of Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart, Powell and Stevens concluded that the Ohio procedure was defective because it limited the mitigating factors to be considered to the three set out in the statute, and thereby precluded consideration of other relevant factors such as the defendant\u2019s age, previous record, cooperation with law enforcement authorities, and degree of participation in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The requirement that the sentencing authority consider all relevant mitigating factors was reiterated in <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), in which a death sentence was set aside because of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s difficult family history and emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) and <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325, 96 S.Ct. 3001, 49 L.Ed.2d 974 (1976), the Court struck down statutes mandating the death penalty for certain classes of cases. N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-21 (Cum.Supp.1975); La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 14:30 (1974 Supp.). Justices Stewart, Powell and Stevens found that a mandatory death sentence was contrary to contemporary standards for imposing capital punishment, that it amounted to an arbitrary, standardless imposition of the death sentence, and that it impermissibly precluded consideration of mitigating factors regarding the character and personal history of the defendant. Justices Brennan and Marshall adhered to their position that the death penalty was <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. at 306-07, 96 S.Ct. at 2992-93 (Brennan, J., dissenting), 307 (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. at 336, 96 S.Ct. at 3007 (Brennan, J., dissenting), 336-37, 96 S.Ct. 3007-08 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Several broad conclusions may be drawn from the Supreme Court decisions regarding the death penalty:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">First, wholly unguided jury discretion in imposing a death sentence is impermissible;</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">Second, a mandatory death penalty is impermissible;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">Third, specific focus upon aggravating and mitigating factors at the sentencing stage is constitutionally required;</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Fourth, proof of some relevant aggravating circumstance is a prerequisite for a death sentence, although the circumstance may be somewhat imprecise and subjective, <em>e.g., </em>that the offense was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman\u201d (Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2534.1(b)(7)), or \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d (Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(5)(h) (Supp. 1976-1977));</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">Fifth, the sentencing procedure may allow the aggravating circumstance to be found either in connection with findings or during the sentencing phase of the trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">Sixth, the sentencing procedure must allow consideration of all relevant mitigating factors, although it is not necessary that these be specifically enumerated by statute or otherwise;</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">Seventh, the Supreme Court looks with favor on a bifurcated trial, because it allows a more comprehensive basis for sentencing by relaxing the rules of evidence and by allowing a defendant to present mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase even though such evidence would have been detrimental to his case before findings;</p>\n<p id=\"b631-21\">Eighth, when sentencing is by a jury, the trial judge must provide guidance as to the factors which are relevant to the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>decision and the proper means for applying those factors to the determination of sentence; and</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Ninth, the Supreme Court looks with favor on a mandatory appeal system to safeguard against arbitrary, prejudicial, disproportionate, or inconsistent sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The drafters of the Model Penal Code have summarized the requirements as follows: \u201cWhat is required ... is a system that allows submission to court or jury of the evidentiary basis for whatever mitigation may exist. This opportunity, when coupled with a limitation of capital punishment for murder to certain specified circumstances of aggravation, apparently suffices to withstand constitutional scrutiny.\u201d American Law Institute Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1980 edition), \u00a7 210.6, paragraph 12d, p. 167. In short, \u201cthe requirements of <em>Furman </em>are satisfied when the sentencing authority\u2019s discretion is guided and channeled by requiring examination of specific factors that argue in favor of or against imposition of the death penalty, thus eliminating total arbitrariness and capriciousness in its imposition.\u201d <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 258, 96 S.Ct. at 2969.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">B. <em>The Military System.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Comparison of the requirements imposed by the Supreme Court for imposition of the death penalty with the procedures mandated by the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual for Courts-Martial <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> convinces us that the procedures mandated for courts-martial to impose a death sentence for premeditated murder are sufficiently focused and guided to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">In order to impose the death sentence for murder, a court-martial must find either that the murder was premeditated or that it occurred while the offender was \u201cengaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary, sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson.\u201d Article 118, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 918 (1976). All other forms of murder or homicide are punishable only by lesser penalties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">While in courts-martial the required aggravating circumstance must be found as part of the findings, similar to the Texas procedure, the Supreme Court has sanctioned such a procedure as the functional equivalent of a statutory aggravating factor to be considered during the sentencing phase of the trial. \u201cWhile Texas has not adopted a list of statutory aggravating circumstances the existence of which can justify the imposition of the death penalty as have Georgia and Florida, its action in narrowing the categories of murders for which a death sentence may ever be imposed serves much the same purpose.\u201d <em>Jurek v. Texas, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 270, 96 S.Ct. at 2955.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">A trial by court-martial is a bifurcated proceeding. The court members are not advised of the maximum sentence until after findings, meaning that they may not know that they are considering a capital offense until after findings, unless they are alerted by the questions during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">The court members are entitled to consider the facts and circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>offense as aggravating factors. Paragraph 76a (2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). This is comparable to the nonstatutory and unspecified aggravating factors which may be considered under the Georgia statute approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Regarding the character and background of the accused, the prosecution is limited to matters properly contained in the accused\u2019s personnel records. Records of previous military convictions or nonjudicial punishment are admissible only if the records show compliance with procedural rules, including those giving the accused an opportunity to consult with counsel and to obtain appellate review. Paragraph <em>75b, d, </em>MCM, 1969 (Rev.).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">On the other hand, the accused has broad latitude after findings to submit mitigating evidence, including evidence of good character and good military performance, as well as evidence regarding extenuating circumstances of the offense. The accused has broad rights of allocution, with the option of testifying under oath or avoiding cross-examination by making an unsworn statement, either in person or through counsel. Paragraph 75c, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The rules of evidence are relaxed during sentencing to permit the accused broad latitude in presenting extenuating and mitigating evidence. Paragraph 75c(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.); <em>see </em>Mil.R.Evid. 1101(c) (applicable to cases tried after 1 September 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Like the Georgia and Texas statutes, the UCMJ and the Manual for Courts-Martial do not specify which mitigating factors may be considered, although the Manual for Courts-Martial does contain nonexclusive examples of appropriate matters to be considered. <em>See </em>paragraph 76a(2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). In courts-martial an accused has virtual <em>carte blanche </em>to present whatever he desires in extenuation and mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">A military judge is required to instruct the court members prior to their deliberations on sentencing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> His instructions must be specific and tailored to the evidence. <em>See </em>paragraph <em>76b(l), </em>MCM, 1969 (Rev.). All court members must concur in a death sentence, and their decision is binding on the military judge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">After the trial, the command staff judge advocate, an experienced military lawyer, must review the proceedings and provide the general court-martial convening authority with a written review of the proceedings, which must include the staff judge advocate\u2019s opinion regarding the legal sufficiency of the proceedings, including the legality and appropriateness of the sentence, along with the reasons for his conclusions. Article 61, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 861 (1976); paragraph 85, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Prior to submitting his written review to the convening authority, the staff judge advocate must submit the review to the accused and his counsel for comment and rebuttal. <em>United States v. Goode, </em>1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">The convening authority has unfettered clemency authority, but may approve the sentence only if he is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused\u2019s guilt and is convinced that the sentence is appropriate. Article 64, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 864 (1976). The requirement for review and approval by the convening authority helps to assure that sentences for similar crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>will not be disproportionate within his or her command.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">If the convening authority approves a death sentence (or certain lesser sentences), the accused is entitled to several levels of automatic appellate review, with qualified counsel provided at government expense, in addition to any counsel provided by the accused. The case is first considered by a Court of Military Review, which has a broad mandate to approve only such findings and sentence \u201cas it finds correct in law and fact\u201d and \u201con the basis of the entire record, [finds] should be approved.\u201d Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866; paragraph 100a, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Unlike most civilian appellate courts, the Courts of Military Review have independent fact-finding authority. They may not affirm a finding of guilty based upon a conclusion merely that the findings of the trial court are reasonably supported by the evidence of record, but rather they must be convinced of the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Peek v. United States, </em>321 F.2d 934 (9th Cir. 1963); <em>cert. denied </em>376 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 973, 11 L.Ed.2d 973 (1964); <em>compare </em>Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 and paragraph 100a, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) <em>with </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(4) (Supp. 1976-77), Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2537(c)(3) (Supp.1975), and Tex.Code Crim.Proc. Art. 37.071(f) (Supp.1975-76). Also unlike most other appellate courts, the Courts of Military Review are charged with the review of the appropriateness of sentences. The legislative history of Article 66 clearly reflects Congressional intent that this power will be exercised to avoid excessive or disproportionate sentences throughout the armed forces for similar offenses. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.; S.Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in (1950) U.S.Code Cong.Service 2222, 2254; <em>see also United States v. Judd, </em>11 U.S.C.M.A. 164, 169-70, 28 C.M.R. 388, 393-94 (1960) (Ferguson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In cases involving a death sentence, we construe the mandate of Article 66 to require a Court of Military Review to be satisfied that (1) the statutory aggravating factor, as well as all other elements of the capital offense, have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by competent evidence of record; (2) the statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors in the case outweigh the mitigating factors; and (3) that the death sentence is not excessive or disproportionate, considering both the nature and circumstances of the offense, the aggravating and mitigating factors, and the background and character of the appellant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">If the death sentence is affirmed by the appropriate Court of Military Review, then review by the United States Court of Military Appeals is mandatory. Article 67(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 867(b). The Court of Military Appeals has a more restricted appellate role, but nevertheless serves as a check against arbitrary or capricious sentencing. <em>See United States v. Dukes, </em>5 M.J. 71, 72-74 (C.M.A.1978); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>Christopher, </em>13 U.S.C.M.A. 231, 236-37, 32 C.M.R. 231, 236-37 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Finally, even if a death sentence is affirmed by the courts, it may not be executed unless approved by the President. Article 71(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a). Unlike civilian jurisdictions where the sentence will be executed unless affirmative action is taken by the executive to stay or commute the sentence, in military cases the President must expressly and affirmatively approve a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Although Congress has specifically designated certain offenses as capital, it has not prescribed all the procedures for imposing a death sentence, but rather has delegated to the President the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure for courts-martial. Article 36, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836 (Supp.III 1979). The President has exercised that power by promulgating the Manual for Courts-Martial. Unlike state courts who look to the legislature for procedural rules, courts-martial look primarily to rules prescribed by the President. Such rules, of course, have the force of law so long as they are not inconsistent with the UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Although the Supreme Court has indicated that the legislature must determine what criminal acts shall be punishable by death, it has not required that all aggravating or mitigating factors be legislatively determined. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has held that relevant but unspecified non-statutory aggravating factors may be considered. The Court has approved the Georgia and Texas procedures, which permit consideration of non-statutory aggravating factors and which do not specify the mitigating factors. <em>See Gregg v. Georgia, supra; Jurek v. Texas, supra. </em>Furthermore, the Supreme Court has held that relevant non-statutory mitigating factors must be submitted to the sentencing authority even where the legislature has specified certain mitigating factors by statute. <em>Lockett v. Ohio, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Finally, the Supreme Court has held that state courts may define or redefine statutory criteria which are facially too vague or indefinite. Considering the Georgia statute, which permits a death sentence upon a finding that the offense was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman,\u201d the Court found that this criterion, as interpreted by the Georgia Supreme Court, was sufficiently precise to preclude arbitrary death sentences. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra. </em>However, four years later the Supreme Court struck down the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s application of the same standard as too broad, but did not invalidate the Georgia statutory procedure itself. <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980). The Supreme Court took a similar approach with regard to the vagueness of the aggravating and mitigating factors in the Florida statutes, relying on the Florida Supreme Court to apply them rationally and consistently. <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 255-56, 96 S.Ct. at 2968. On the other hand, the Supreme Court has construed the facially restrictive sentencing criteria of Texas in a manner broad enough to comport with constitutional requirements. <em>Jurek v. Texas, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 272-73, 96 S.Ct. at 2956-57.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">It is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Gregg, Jurek, Lockett, </em>and <em>Godfrey </em>that the procedural protections against arbitrary imposition of the death penalty need not be founded solely in legislative enactment but may rest in part upon judicial application of general legislative guidelines. Although the capital sentencing procedures considered by the Supreme Court have all been promulgated by the state legislatures \u2014 the only entities empowered to do so in civilian criminal systems\u2014 the Supreme Court has concerned itself with the substantive content of the procedural rules, not their source. Accordingly, we perceive no Constitutional infirmity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the fact that the procedures by which a court-martial imposes a death sentence are not prescribed entirely by legislative enactment, but are prescribed in part by executive order, which has the force and effect of law, and by appellate court decisions interpreting and applying the procedural rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">We are satisfied that the procedures prescribed for courts-martial in capital cases sufficiently guide and focus the sentencing decision to survive Constitutional scrutiny. A court-martial is required to find at least one statutory aggravating circumstance before it may consider imposing the death sentence for murder. During the sentencing phase of the bifurcated trial, the prosecution is entitled to present or draw attention to certain limited categories of non-statutory aggravating circumstances. The accused, on the other hand, has broad latitude in presenting extenuating and mitigating factors. The military judge is required to further focus the jury\u2019s attention by specific instructions tailored to the evidence. Lastly, if a death sentence is imposed, the sentence is subject to several levels of review to insure fairness and consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">These procedural safeguards are virtually identical to the Texas procedure, about which a plurality of the Supreme Court commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">We conclude that Texas\u2019 capital-sentencing procedures, like those of Georgia and Florida, do not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. By narrowing its definition of capital murder, Texas has essentially said that there must be at least one statutory aggravating eircumstance in a first-degree murder case before a death sentence may even be considered. By authorizing the defense to bring before the jury at the separate sentencing hearing whatever mitigating circumstances relating to the individual defendant can be adduced, Texas has ensured that the sentencing jury will have adequate guidance to enable it to perform its sentencing function. By providing prompt judicial review of the jury\u2019s decision in a court with statewide jurisdiction, Texas has provided a means to promote the evenhanded, rational, and consistent imposition of death sentences under law. Because this system serves to assure that sentences of death will not be \u2018wantonly\u2019 or \u2018freakishly\u2019 imposed, it does not violate the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\"><em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 276, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2958, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976). Accordingly, we conclude that the military criminal system provides a procedure for imposing the death penalty which, like the Texas procedure, does not violate the Constitution.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">The fact that the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual for Courts-Martial, unlike most state statutes, have not been amended in response to the Supreme Court decisions does not undermine their constitutionality. Military sentencing procedures have always been more focused and guided than civilian procedures. While it can be argued that special more restrictive rules should be prescribed for trials of capital cases by court-martial, the test that we apply in this case is whether capital sentencing procedures for courts-martial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>satisfy constitutional requirements, not whether they could be improved. Although the Supreme Court requires that the sentencing process in a capital case be carefully focused and guided, we do not read the Supreme Court decisions as requiring that capital sentencing be accomplished by procedures different from non-capital sentencing. The fact that lesser sentences are imposed with the same care as capital sentences does not necessarily affect the constitutionality of the capital sentencing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">C. Procedures Followed in this Case:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In this case the appellant was charged with and convicted of premeditated murder in violation of Article 118(1), UCMJ, an offense designated by Congress as a capital offense. Since the military judge was forbidden to receive a guilty plea to a capital offense, the prosecution was required to prove the statutory aggravating element, <em>i.e., </em>premeditation, beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant having pleaded guilty to unpremeditated murder, the issue of premeditation was squarely presented to the court members. After receiving proper instructions from the military judge, they found the element of premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The prosecution was then offered the opportunity to present other non-statutory aggravating factors authorized by the Manual for Courts-Martial, such as prior convictions or nonjudicial punishment. No such factors were presented. In accordance with paragraph <em>75b </em>of the Manual, the prosecution informed the court members of the appellant\u2019s age, length of service, term of service, marital status, pay, and the nature and duration of the pretrial restraint. In accordance with paragraph <em>75d </em>of the Manual, the prosecution then presented the appellant\u2019s DA Form 2 and DA Form 2-1, which summarized additional data in his personnel records such as assignments and promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">As required by <em>United States v. Hawkins, 2 </em>M.J. 23 (C.M.A.1976) and paragraph 75e of the Manual, the military judge advised the appellant of his right to present evidence in extenuation and mitigation and to testify, or to make an unsworn statement, oral or written, personally or through counsel, or to remain silent. The appellant chose to remain silent, but he did present the testimony of his sister, who testified about the appellant\u2019s deprived childhood, the death of his father, and his concern for his mother\u2019s poor health.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In argument on sentence, the individual defense counsel reminded the court members of the evidence received before findings regarding the appellant\u2019s mental state on the day of the murder, his alcoholism, his low intelligence, his personality disorder, and his suicidal tendencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">In his instructions, the military judge specifically informed the court members that they should consider the following extenuating and mitigating factors: the appellant\u2019s age, education, background, training, service record and family situation; the duration of his pretrial confinement; his pleas of guilty \u201cto the extent allowed by law\u201d; and the psychiatric testimony regarding his mental deficiency and personality disorders. Lastly, the military judge advised the court members that they should \u201cselect the sentence which would best serve the ends of good order and discipline, and the needs of the accused and the welfare of society.\u201d Although the military judge advised the court members that the maximum sentence included the death penalty, he advised them only of the aggregate maximum, not the sentences authorized for each offense. However, he did advise them of the statutory minimum sentence for premeditated murder. The appellant made no objection to the instructions, nor did he request additional instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Thereafter the court members, by unanimous vote, imposed the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">All of the mitigating factors highlighted by the military judge are specifically authorized by paragraphs 75 and 76 of the Manual. By way of comparison, only three of them are enumerated in the Florida statute approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Proffitt, </em>supra: the appellant\u2019s age (\u00a7 921.-141(6)(g)); lack of criminal record (\u00a7 921.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>141(6)(a)) and impaired mental ability (\u00a7 921.141(6)(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Because the military judge instructed the court members only on the aggregate maximum sentence, it is possible that the court members did not know whether the death penalty was authorized for each of the offenses or only for murder. However, the Supreme Court has refused to overturn death sentences based upon such theoretical uncertainty. <em>See Drake v. Zant, </em>449 U.S. 999, 101 S.Ct. 541, 66 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (certiorari denied after Georgia Supreme Court held that they would not set aside a death sentence even though one of the aggravating factors found by the jury was constitutionally defective); <em>but see Zant v. Stephens, </em>631 F.2d 397 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 90, 70 L.Ed.2d 82 (1981). Any likelihood that the court members in this case imposed the death sentence for rape instead of murder is purely speculative. At most, the court may have considered the rape as an aggravating circumstance of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We are satisfied that the sentencing decision in this case was properly focused and guided. The court was required to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the murder was accompanied by a statutory aggravating factor, i.e., premeditation. Having so found, they were then required to balance the seriousness of the offense against an exhaustive list of mitigating factors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Given a choice only of life imprisonment or the death sentence, they were required to vote on the less severe sentence first if any member proposed the lesser sentence. All members were required to concur in the death sentence. The range of relevant factors submitted to the court equals or exceeds that of the procedures found acceptable by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentencing decision in this case was sufficiently focused and guided to avoid the \u201cwanton\u201d or \u201cfreakish\u201d imposition of the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">XIII. SENTENCE APPROPRIATENESS.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">The appellant contends that the death sentence is not appropriate in this case because of his history of alcoholism and the fact that he was intoxicated when he raped and killed Mrs. Villanueva.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">Even in the absence of a specific request by an appellant to reduce the sentence, our statutory mandate requires us to independently evaluate the appropriateness of the sentence and to affirm only such sentence or such part or amount of the sentence as we determine should be approved. Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 (1976); paragraph 100, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). We have considered the facts and circumstances of the offenses, the appellant\u2019s age, family and educational background, military record, and mental and emotional condition, as well as the evidence of alcoholism and intoxication which was specifically urged for our consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">Our independent review of the record convinces us that, although the appellant apparently had been drinking on the afternoon of the incident, his degree of intoxication was insufficient to be noticed by witnesses who observed him shortly after Mrs. Villanueva was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-17\">Furthermore, the record clearly shows that the murder of Mrs. Villanueva was calculated and deliberate, as evidenced by the appellant\u2019s preparations before attacking her. His attitude shortly after the murder was callous, as evidenced by his references to her as \u201cthat bitch,\u201d his attack on her sexual organs after her death, his taking of items of her clothing, and his retention of her intimate apparel even after disposing of other evidence. Lastly, the murder is one of the worst to come before this court in terms of its depravity, brutality and viciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-18\">We are satisfied that the death penalty was not \u201cfreakishly\u201d and \u201cwantonly\u201d im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>posed. <em>See Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 309-10, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2762-63, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Stewart, Jr., concurring). We have no difficulty distinguishing this case from other cases in which a lesser sentence was imposed. <em>Cf., id. </em>at 311-14, 92 S.Ct. at 2763-64 (White, J., concurring). To the contrary, we are convinced that the death sentence is patently appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">XIV. APPLICATION OF FORFEITURES.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Having decided that the death penalty was lawfully imposed as well as appropriate in this case, we must turn to one of the ancillary aspects of a death sentence, <em>viz. </em>the appellant\u2019s entitlement to pay and allowances while awaiting the execution of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The convening authority in this case directed that the total forfeitures adjudged be applied to pay and allowances due on and after the date of his action. His action in this respect was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Forfeitures may be applied to pay and allowances accruing on or after the date of the convening authority\u2019s action only if the sentence which was adjudged and approved includes \u201cconfinement not suspended\u201d; otherwise, forfeitures may not take effect until the sentence is ordered executed. Article 57, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 857 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">A death sentence imposed by a court-martial does not include confinement by implication, although it may be commuted to confinement. An accused found guilty of a violation of Article 118(1) or 118(4) \u201cshall suffer death <em>or </em>imprisonment for life.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is well settled that criminal statutes must be strictly construed. <em>See United States v. Halseth, </em>342 U.S. 277, 280, 72 S.Ct. 275, 276, 96 L.Ed. 308 (1952); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Resnick, </em>299 U.S. 207, 209, 57 S.Ct. 126, 127, 81 L.Ed. 127 (1936); <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>236 F.2d 392 (9th Cir. 1956). The word \u201cor\u201d indicates alternative punishments, only one of which may be imposed. Although the word \u201cor\u201d may be interpreted as meaning \u201cand\u201d if necessary to give effect to legislative intent, there is no indication that Congress intended \u201cor\u201d to mean \u201cand\u201d in this situation. <em>See generally </em>73 Am.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 298; 82 C.J.S., Statutes, \u00a7 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The legislative history of Article 57 indicates that the Congress considered only the situation in which confinement and forfeitures were adjudged; they did not specifically consider the application of forfeitures in connection with a death sentence, nor did they consider whether both a death sentence and confinement could be adjudged. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.; S.Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in (1950) U.S.Code Congressional Service, p. 2249. The provision for the alternative sentences of death or imprisonment for life first appeared in the Articles of War of 1916. The apparent intent of Congress at that time was merely to incorporate the language of the United States Code into the Articles of War. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 229, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., Letter of Major General E. H. Crowder, The Judge Advocate General, dated 12 April 1912. There is nothing in the legislative history of the United States Code to indicate that the death penalty and life imprisonment were not intended to be alternative punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Jurisdictions which consider confinement to be part of the death sentence do so because their criminal statutes specifically provide for confinement of the accused while he or she awaits execution of the death sentence. <em>See, e.g., People v. Rittger, </em>55 Cal.2d 849, 13 Cal.Rptr. 406, 362 P.2d 38 (1961); <em>Wetzel v. Wiggins, </em>226 Miss. 671, 85 So.2d 795, <em>appeal denied </em>352 U.S. 807, 77 S.Ct. 80, 1 L.Ed.2d 39, <em>rehearing denied </em>352 U.S. 919, 77 S.Ct. 217, 1 L.Ed.2d 125 (1956); <em>In re Watts, </em>197 Cal. 611, 241 P. 886 (1925); <em>see also </em>24B C.J.S., Criminal Law, Sec. 2001. Where the criminal statute does not specifically provide for confinement of an accused sentenced to death, confinement is considered a necessary incident of a death sentence but not a part thereof. <em>See McGinn v. State, </em>46 Neb. 427, 65 N.W. 46 (1895); <em>see also </em>21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law, Sec. 606. Since Article 118, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>UCMJ, does not specifically provide for confinement of an accused sentenced to death, we conclude that confinement is a necessary incident of the death sentence but not a part of it. The appellant is not serving a sentence to confinement, but rather is being confined \u201cwhile being held for trial or the result of trial.\u201d Article 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 813; paragraphs 18h(3), 19d, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Confinement under the authority of Article 13 is imposed by a commander, not a judicial sentencing authority. Since the appellant is not serving a sentence to confinement, there is no authority to apply the forfeitures as of the date of the convening authority\u2019s action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We will set aside that portion of the convening authority\u2019s action in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">XV. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We are satisfied that the death penalty was imposed in accordance with the Constitution, the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual for Courts-Martial. We are further satisfied, for the reasons stated above, that the death sentence is appropriate. Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed. However, that portion of the convening authority\u2019s action purporting to apply total forfeitures to pay and allowances becoming due on and after the date of his action is contrary to law and is set aside.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Senior Judges CARNE and FULTON, and Judges MILLER, McKAY, LEWIS and COHEN concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Chief Judge HANSEN and Judge CLAUSE not participating.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-10\">.

The death penalty was retained in the American Articles of War of 1776 and each of the subsequent revisions of the Articles of War in 1806, 1874, 1916, 1920 and 1948. <em>Id., </em>Appendices X-XIII; 39 Stat. 630-70 (1916); 41 Stat. 759-812 (1920); 62 Stat. 627-44 (1948). When the Articles of War were replaced with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 107-49 (1950), the death penalty was retained, and was carried over into the 1968 revisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-940 (1968), which are currently in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b627-14\">.

Two of the dissenting justices in the <em>Furman </em>case opined that the capital punishment provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice may have been overturned by the plurality opinion.

Judge Foreman, writing for the majority, finds that a death sentence does not include confinement by implication, although it may be commuted to confinement. He also concludes that the conjunction in \u201cshall suffer death or imprisonment for life\u201d indicates alternative punishments, only one of which may be imposed. But it is the bold assumptions and conclusions regarding the absence of implied confinement when the death penalty is adjudged and the Congressional intent when the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted, that forces me to disassociate myself from the majority. Specifically, I question its conclusion that forfeitures cannot be withheld from Matthew\u2019s pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Where the language and purpose of the questioned statute is clear, courts, of course, follow the legislative direction in interpretation. Where the words are ambiguous, the judiciary may properly use the legislative history to reach a conclusion.

It would require language so clear as to leave room for no other reasonable construction to induce the belief that Congress intended that confinement not be an inherent part of every sentence to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Accordingly, I would find that there was authority to apply the forfeitures as of the date of the convening authority\u2019s action.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b641-6\">JONES, Senior Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">with whom Judge HANFT joins, dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">I believe the death penalty in this case was imposed under an impermissible sentencing procedure, one which violates both the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article 55 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 855.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">While I do not generally disagree with the majority\u2019s recitation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman v.

Georgia</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In direct response to <em>Furman, </em>the Georgia legislature enacted a statutory scheme<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which was upheld in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra. </em>The manner of sentencing under which Furman had been sentenced to death was not unlike that in any other capital case in the state. Unless the jury recommended mercy upon conviction of the capital offense, the sentence was death. The jury was so charged at the time it was instructed regarding the substantive offense. The Georgia courts had upheld this method against numerous attacks<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as not in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>fact, as the proper subject for the exercise of the jury\u2019s unfettered discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The defendant Gregg was convicted and sentenced under the new Georgia scheme. The legislature retained the former definition of murder including the authorized punishments, death or life imprisonment. As before, any person convicted of an unlawful killing with malice aforethought or of a killing in the commission of a felony could conceivably be sentenced to death. However, in contrast with the condemned practice, the sentencing authority (judge or jury) was required to hear additional evidence at a proceeding separate from the findings portion which preceded it, and to specifically consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances as they related to the death penalty. As a prerequisite to returning a death sentence, the sentencing authority had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of one or more of ten statutorily specified aggravating circumstances. The particular aggravating circumstance found had to be specified in writing. The statutory scheme additionally provided for mandatory appellate review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The Supreme Court found the new procedures facially consistent with the Eighth Amendment because, contrary to previous practice, the jury\u2019s discretion was circumscribed by legislative guidelines and channeled by consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors. The Court repeatedly emphasized that, unlike <em>Furman, </em>the jury\u2019s attention was properly focused on the nature of the particular crime and on the particular characteristics of the individual defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">B. Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Florida\u2019s capital sentencing procedure had been directly affected by <em>Furman. </em>On the same day it announced the decision in <em>Furman, </em>the Supreme Court vacated nine Florida death sentences and remanded the cases for further proceedings in accordance with that decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Florida\u2019s then existing method of sentencing in capital cases was nearly identical to that of Georgia. Upon convicting an accused of a capital offense the jury was required to make one of two recommendations, \u201cwith mercy\u201d or \u201cwithout mercy\u201d. The jury was so charged at the same time it was instructed regarding the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">In response to <em>Furman, </em>Florida changed slightly its definition of murder and created a separate sentencing proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Supreme Court addressed the new procedures in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>and compared them favorably with the Georgia enactments. Under the procedure, a jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>required to hear new evidence and make a recommendation as to the penalty, life or death, to the trial judge who actually determined the sentence. In so doing, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of one or more statutory aggravating circumstances and weigh that against any mitigating factors it found to exist, including but not limited to seven mitigating circumstances enumerated by statute. Upon receiving the jury\u2019s recommendation the judge had to weigh the same factors and on that basis determine sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the judge imposed the death penalty he had to set forth in writing the statutory aggravation he found sufficient to require the ultimate sanction, and the mitigation he found insufficient to outweigh that judgment. Automatic appellate review was required, but, unlike Georgia, it took no specific form.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">After reviewing the Florida statute and the decisions thereunder, Justice Stewart announced approval in <em>Proffitt:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">Florida, like Georgia, has responded to <em>Furman </em>by enabling legislation that passes constitutional muster. That legislation provides that after a person is convicted of first-degree murder there shall be an informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question of whether he shall be sentenced to death. 428 U.S. at 259, 96 S.Ct. at 2969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">C. Texas</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In a companion case to <em>Furman </em>the Supreme Court nullified the Texas capital sen-fencing procedure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In response, Texas totally and somewhat uniquely revised its procedural and substantive criminal law, including its definition of murder.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In reviewing the new scheme, the Supreme Court characterized the revision as a \u201c[narrowing of] the scope of its laws relating to capital punishment.\u201d <em>Jurek v. Texas, supra </em>428 U.S. at 268, 96 S.Ct. at 2954.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">Unlike Georgia where every murder (malice aforethought or felony killing) was a capital offense and Florida where only murders of the greatest culpability (premeditated design or in the commission or attempted commission of specific felonies) were designated as capital, Texas authorized death in a severely limited category of murder situations. Capital murder was defined as any murder of the highest culpable mental state (intentional or knowing) which occurs in one of five specific circumstances. Other intentional or knowing murders and any murder of lesser culpability are excluded at the findings stage from capital sentencing consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Upon convicting of capital murder, the jury hears at a separate proceeding, relevant evidence and argument for and against the death penalty. The jury is charged with answering two (or in some instances three) specific questions,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the responses to which mechanically determine the sentence. However, the jury\u2019s function in responding to these questions is not mechanical. The questions require that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>jury assess the individual offense and individual offender with consideration of all relevant mitigating factors. This assessment must include the reasons \u201cwhy a death sentence should be imposed\u201d and \u201cwhy it should not be imposed.\u201d 428 U.S. at 271, 96 S.Ct. at 2956.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The Supreme Court, in considering the Texas scheme,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> likened the narrowly specified category of capital murders to the statutory aggravating circumstances found in the Georgia and Florida procedures. Because the five specific categories of capital murder served the same purpose as the statutory enumeration of aggravating circumstances, i.e., placing a limit on the circumstances in which a murder offense justifies the death penalty, 428 U.S. at 270, 96 S.Ct. at 2955, and focusing the sentencing authorities\u2019 attention on the particularized nature of the crime, 428 U.S. at 271, 96 S.Ct. at 2956, they withstood attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Court further analyzed the manner in which the Texas scheme provided for consideration of mitigating circumstances. Because the \u201cTexas statute does not explicitly speak of mitigating circumstances,\u201d 428 U.S. at 272, 96 S.Ct. at 2956, the Court focused on one of the three statutory questions which had to be answered by the jury. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had interpreted the question of \u201cwhether there [was] a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society\u201d as allowing the presentation of any mitigating circumstances the defendant might be able to show. The Court found that, as interpreted by the state courts, the Texas procedure sufficiently provided for consideration of mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Supreme Court concluded that Texas\u2019 response to <em>Furman </em>was constitutionally sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">Texas law essentially requires that one of five aggravating circumstances be found before a defendant can be found guilty of capital murder, and that in considering whether to impose a death sentence the jury may be asked to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances the defense can bring before it ... [A]s in Georgia and Florida, the Texas capital s\u00e9nteneing procedure guides and focuses the jury\u2019s objective consideration of the particularized circumstances of the individual offense and the individual offender before it can impose a sentence of death. 428 U.S. at 273-4, 96 S.Ct. at 2957.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">D. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">While each state responded to <em>Furman </em>in a distinct manner, distinguishable in a number of respects from the other two, the Supreme Court in <em>Gregg, Proffitt, </em>and <em>Jurek </em>seized upon features common to all in upholding the imposition of death under the respective schemes. Each state moved from a unitary proceeding to a bifurcated one. In each system further evidence particularly relevant to sentencing may be presented at the separate sentencing hearing. Before the death penalty may be imposed, each state requires the sentencing authority to consider factors specified by statute which, if present, would tend to increase the severity of the offense, and to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one of those factors. This factor is required to be found in addition to finding the elements of murder as statutorily provided. Each state requires the consideration of evidence in mitigation, whether such mitigation is statutorily specified or not. Finally, each state requires that specific findings be made regarding the aggravating factor.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Although \u201ceach distinct system must be examined on an individual basis,\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra </em>428 U.S. at 195, 96 S.Ct. at 2935, it is significant that each of the approved systems corresponds to the approach suggested by the Court in <em>Gregg. </em>With this in mind we turn to an examination of the military system.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">A. Trial Procedures</p>\n<p id=\"ARP\">Murder is defined in Article 118 of the <em>Code:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Any person subject to this chapter who, without justification or excuse, unlawfully kills a human being, when he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">(1) has a premeditated design to kill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">(2) intends to kill or inflict great bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">(3) is engaged in an act which is inherently dangerous to others and evinces a wanton disregard of human life; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">(4) is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary, sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">is guilty of murder, and shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial may direct, except that if found guilty under clause (1) or (4), he shall suffer death or imprisonment for life as a court-martial may direct. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 918.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">In order to be considered as a candidate for the death penalty by a court-martial, a murder defendant must be found guilty of premeditated murder, Article 118(1), or of felony murder, Article 118(4).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">If an accused is convicted of premeditated murder, the court-martial will proceed with the sentencing phase of the trial. Sentencing in a capital case differs only insignificantly from sentencing in a non-capital case. In the separate sentencing proceeding, the prosecution must read personal data from the charge sheet, and may present evidence of previous convictions and matters from the accused\u2019s personnel records which reflect his past conduct and performance; evidence as to aggravating circumstances of the offense not introduced before findings may not be introduced at the sentencing phase; the accused is given great latitude to present matters in extenuation and in mitigation under relaxed rules of evidence; and after the presentation of evidence, both sides may argue for an appropriate sentence. <em>See </em>paragraph 75, <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, </em>United States, 1969 (Revised edition).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">The military judge is required to instruct the members of the court-martial regarding their sentencing responsibilities. <em>See </em>paragraph 76, MCM, 1969 (Rev. ed.). He must tailor the instructions to the facts and circumstances of the individual case and must instruct that the members may consider all matters in extenuation and mitigation, as well as in aggravation, whether introduced before or after findings. The judge is also required to state the maximum and lesser punishments authorized and to \u201cfully inform members of the court-martial on their sole responsibility for selecting an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph <em>76b. </em>In a capital case the court-martial is further advised that in order to return a sentence of death, the determination of the members must be unanimous. <em>Id., </em>paragraph <em>76b </em>(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">The majority today holds that these procedures sufficiently guide and focus the capital sentencing decision because: 1) \u201c[a] court-martial is required to find at least one statutory aggravating circumstance .. . \u201d\u2014 premeditation; 2) \u201c[djuring the sentencing phase of the bifurcated trial the prosecution is entitled to present or draw attention to certain limited categories of non-statutory aggravating circumstances\u201d; 3) \u201c[t]he accused .. . has broad latitude in presenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>extenuating and mitigating factors\u201d; 4) \u201c[t]he military judge is required to further focus the jury\u2019s attention by specific instructions tailored to the evidence\u201d; and 5) \u201cif a death sentence is imposed, the sentence is subject to several levels of review to insure fairness and consistency.\u201d In so holding, the majority finds the military procedures \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the Texas procedures upheld in <em>Jurek. </em>This conclusion misconceives the <em>Gregg, Proffitt </em>and <em>Jurek </em>opinions as well as that of <em>Furman v. Georgia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Furman v. Georgia </em>denounced standard-less sentencing discretion. In order to meet the concerns of <em>Furman, </em>a sentencing system must \u201cdefine the crimes for which death may be the sentence in a way that obviates \u2018standardless [sentencing] discretion\u2019.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 428, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 1765, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980), quoting <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>428 U.S. at 196, n.47, 96 S.Ct. at 2936, n.47. \u201cIt must channel the sentencer\u2019s discretion by \u2018clear and objective standards\u2019 that provide \u2018specific and detailed guidance\u2019, and that \u2018make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death\u2019.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, supra, </em>446 U.S. at 428, 100 S.Ct. at 1765. Because a system may not preclude the sentencing body from considering any relevant matter in mitigation which the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death, <em>Lockett v. Ohio, supra, </em>the channeling function must be served by standardization of aggravating criteria required to be considered by each capital sentencing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The majority equates the naming of premeditation in Article 118(1) with the statutory delineation of the five categories of capital murder in the Texas procedure. The five criteria in the Texas statute are roughly comparable to the aggravating criteria in the Georgia and Florida statutes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Each set of criteria further limits the type of murders which may be considered as deserving of the death penalty. Premeditation, as an aggravating criterion, is not the equivalent of one of the capital murder categories in <em>Jurek </em>or the functional equivalent of the statutory aggravation in <em>Gregg </em>and <em>Proffitt </em>because it does not limit the cases of \u201cfirst-degree murder\u201d in which \u201ca death sentence may be considered.\u201d <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. at 276, 96 S.Ct. at 2958. Furthermore, a particular criterion, in this case premeditation, cannot serve both to narrow the category of offenses for which the death penalty may be imposed and as the aggravating factor which justifies imposition of the death penalty within that narrowed category of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The Supreme Court has said of a statute similar to Article 118 that \u201cthe jury in its unbridled discretion could choose whether the convicted defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 285, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2982, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976). <em>Furman </em>and its progeny are a comment on the inadequacy of distinguishing between those murderers who deserve the death penalty and those who do not solely on the basis of traditional criteria (e.g., malice aforethought, premeditation). Traditional criteria permit the exercise of the unbridled discretion condemned by <em>Fur-man.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">As an aggravating criterion premeditation fails to channel the sentencing decision in an objective or rational manner. Because a pattern of arbitrary and capricious sentencing like that found unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>in <em>Furman </em>could occur using the premeditation criterion as a sentencing standard, that criterion is constitutionally inadequate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Premeditation is not a clear and objective standard, but an \u201camorphous\u201d concept, <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. at 290-291, 96 S.Ct. at 2984-2985, which does not provide specific and detailed guidance to the court-martial. <em>See Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 253, 96 S.Ct. at 2967.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">It is not denied that the military system generally satisfies the long recognized requirement that \u201cfor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires . . . that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and circumstances of the offender.\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra </em>428 U.S. at 189, 96 S.Ct. at 2932, quoting <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, </em>302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S.Ct. 59, 60, 82 L.Ed. 43 (1937). Bifurcation facilitates the fair operation of this requirement. 428 U.S. at 191, 96 S.Ct. at 2933. Sentencing procedures in the military system ensure that relevant information will be provided to the court-martial under fair procedural rules. But that alone is not sufficient to guarantee that the information will be properly used in the imposition of the death penalty. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra </em>at 192, 96 S.Ct. at 2934.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The military system is deficient in not providing specific guidance to court members on the question of an appropriate sentence in a capital ease. While the military judge must charge the court-martial that it may consider nonstatutory matters in aggravation, as well as in mitigation, he is neither required nor authorized to instruct as to what matters may be particularly aggravating in relation to the death penalty as opposed to any other punishment. Because there is a qualitative difference of constitutional dimension between a sentence of confinement and a sentence of death, there is a qualitative difference in those factors which may aggravate a sentence from one of years to one of life confinement and from one of life confinement to one of death.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In the context of the Eighth Amendment, a court-martial is provided with no guidance in determining an \u2018appropriate sentence\u2019 in a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">In contrast to the procedures found constitutionally sufficient, the military scheme has no mandatory factors that must be found; no mandatory weighing of specific aggravating factors against mitigating factors; no requirement that the members make specific findings or answer specific questions; and above all, no specific consideration is directed to be given to the death penalty. Except for the unanimity requirement for voting, there is no distinction made between the sentencing procedure in a death case and that in any other case. The irreversible nature of the death penalty demands more.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">B. Appellate Review</p>\n<p id=\"AWDE\">Where a method of imposing the death penalty is found to violate the Eighth Amendment, no degree of appellate review can cure the constitutional deficiency in that capital sentencing procedure. Nonetheless, I believe a few comments are in order concerning appellate review in the military system.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">The military scheme provides for an automatic appeal which is general in nature and without direction as far as capital cases are concerned. This Court \u201cmay affirm only such findings of guilty, and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact and determines on the basis of the entire record, should be approved.\u201d Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 (1976). The Court\u2019s function in reviewing the sentence is to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>mine its appropriateness. Such a nonspecific appellate review has been endorsed in capital cases only where the trial court received specific guideposts and the appellate court thus had definite, certain points to review. <em>See Proffitt v. Florida, supra </em>428 U.S. at 258-59, 96 S.Ct. at 2969-70. Where the trial court is given no focus, as in the military, there is no standard for the appellate court to review. That the death sentence might be appropriate in a particular case is not sufficient; it must be appropriate when compared to the sentence imposed in other capital murder cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">With my determination that the military scheme for the imposition of the death penalty is constitutionally infirm, I need not address the application of those procedures in this case. However, even if the military procedure had complied with constitutional requirements, its application in Matthews\u2019 trial would make the death sentence imposed an impermissible punishment. The deficiency lies in the instructions the military judge gave to the court members.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The <em>Manual </em>and the case law require the military judge to tailor his instructions on sentence to the law and to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Paragraph 76b(1), MCM 1969 (Revised edition). <em>United States v. Slaton, </em>6 M.J. 254 (CMA 1979); <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>17 U.S.C. M.A. 274, 38 C.M.R. 72 (1967). The military judge failed to do that here. No more perfunctory instruction could be imagined. The judge repeated the litany of considerations from the <em>Manual </em>but he did not personalize them to this case. The closest he came was in saying that the members could consider the testimony of the psychiatrist concerning appellant\u2019s behavior disorder. Presumably this would serve to mitigate the sentence, but the judge did not instruct the court to this effect.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Except for a listing of the maximum sentence as death and the minimum as life imprisonment, the instructions could just as easily have been applicable to a simple larceny case. There was nothing to focus the court on any specific consideration in imposing the ultimate penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">I would affirm a sentence only to a dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures, reduction to E-1, and confinement at hard labor for life.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">APPENDIX TO DISSENTING OPINION OF SENIOR JUDGE JONES</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">\n<em>Georgia Laws</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 26-1101 (1972) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ackq\">\u201cMurder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">\u201c(a) A person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being.

Any review for sentence appropriateness intrinsically calls for comparison of sentences imposed in similar cases. The Supreme Court has approved a statutory requirement for case comparison by the reviewing court, <em>see Gregg v.

However, the requirement that, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, a capital sentencing procedure must \u201cpromote the evenhanded, rational and consistent imposition of death sentences\u201d, <em>Jurek v.

I believe confinement for life is an inherent part of every sentence to death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b656-18\">O\u2019DONNELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzJ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">I agree with parts I-XI and XIV of Judge Foreman\u2019s opinion. I dissent with respect to the constitutionality of the death penalty as it relates to premeditated murder under Article 118(1) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I agree with Senior Judge Jones that the procedures followed in this case do not survive constitutional scrutiny because the standards for the sentencing authority did not provide for \u201can informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question of whether [the appellant] should be sentenced to death.\u201d <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 259, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 2969, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976) (plurality opinion of Justices Stewart, Powell and Stevens).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-20\">I would only add that in my view the standards must come in large part, if not completely, from the legislature. In the military system, Congress defines crimes which may be tried by court-martial. With respect to sentence, Congress has provided in Article 56 of the Code that the President shall prescribe the maximum punishment for non-capital offenses. Congress has reserved to itself the responsibility for determining what offenses may carry a death sentence. Consistent with this expression of legislative policy, I believe that Congress should likewise be the authority to specify the standards mandated by <em>Furman et al.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-21\">The only statutory standard in the instant case is that of premeditation. I agree with Senior Judge Jones that this is insufficient. In Article 118(1), Congress has provided that a person convicted of premeditated murder may be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Although the \u201cstandard\u201d of premeditation distinguishes first-degree (Article 118(1)) from second-degree (Article 118(2)) murder, it does not provide a meaningful standard for distinguishing between a first-degree murderer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>should be put to death and one who instead should be sentenced to life imprisonment. Congress should establish with greater specificity what kinds of premeditated murder might warrant imposition of the death sentence, such as the state legislatures did in Florida, Georgia, and Texas. This should include as a minimum specific aggravating factors which will minimize the risk of uncontrolled discretion on the part of the sentencing authority and provision for consideration of other aggravating and mitigating factors which would be relevant to the particular accused and to the particular crime. Consideration of all of these factors should focus not only on why death should be imposed but why it should not be imposed in the individual case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of the absence of adequate standards, I join with Senior Judge Jones in his dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-14\">. <em>Furman v.

The Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition), of course, sets forth at paragraph 75 certain factors that the sentencing authority should consider in determining an appropriate sentence in capital as well as non-capital cases. These \u201cstandards\u201d are insufficient either by themselves or in tandem with the \u201cstandard\u201d of premeditation as they do not provide for the \u201cinformed, focused, guided and objective inquiry\u201d contemplated by <em>Furman et al.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b657-5\">GARN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aye\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">I agree with Judge Foreman\u2019s disposition of the issues addressed in Parts II through XI of his opinion. However, I do not agree with his conclusions regarding the lawfulness of the death penalty and the application of the adjudged forfeitures.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I agree with Senior Judge Jones\u2019 conclusion that the appellant\u2019s sentence to death may not be affirmed. Judge Foreman\u2019s opinion implicitly, and I think correctly, concedes that the intent to kill is not a sufficiently narrow relevant aggravating factor to permit imposition of the death penalty for murder. In my view, neither is premeditation a sufficiently narrow relevant aggravating factor so as to permit imposition of that penalty. As a practical matter, the distinction between an intentional unlawful killing and a premeditated unlawful killing is too tenuous, and too difficult to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Furthermore, the members of the court-martial were not required to focus on the relationship between the premeditated nature of the killing and their decision regarding the death penalty. If premeditation is a sufficiently narrow factor so as to justify adjudging the penalty of death, the trial judge\u2019s instruction (or guidance) should have at least so informed the members, and required them to carefully weigh the nature and degree of the appellant\u2019s premeditation in their deliberations.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Finally, aside from the constitutional issues, and considering the drastic nature of the death penalty, I agree with Senior Judge Jones\u2019 view that under current military law, the trial judge\u2019s sentencing instructions did not sufficiently guide the members concerning the extenuating and mitigating evidence they should have considered in their deliberations on whether the death penalty should be imposed. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>17 U.S.C.M.A. 274, 38 C.M.R. 72 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">I also agree with Senior Judge Jones that confinement for life is an inherent part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>sentence to death. In my opinion the adjudged forfeitures will apply from the date of the convening authority\u2019s action unless, at the conclusion of all the reviews of his case, his sentence does not include either death or confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">I would affirm a sentence including a dishonorable discharge, confinement at hard labor for life, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the grade of Private E-l.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"><em> </em>In addition to the evidence of the appellant\u2019s having consumed alcoholic beverages, his low intelligence, and his abnormal mental processes and condition (which Dr. Reed characterized as a mental disease, at least for psychiatric diagnostic purposes), there is other evidence that the appellant\u2019s premeditated design to kill was not carefully calculated. He did not immediately attempt to hide or destroy the physical evidence clearly connecting him with the crime. When he did finally attempt to do so, his attempts were haphazard. He told several people about his crime, and his description of what he had done was rambling and sometimes incoherent. His repeated statements that \u201cI <em>think </em>I killed the [victim]\u201d, (emphasis added) and his statement \u201cI <em>think </em>she\u2019s dead\u201d (emphasis added) after he had returned to the library and seen Mrs. Villanueva\u2019s dead body, also indicate that his killing was not a carefully conceived plan. Had the members been required to concentrate on the nature and degree of the appellant\u2019s premeditation, it is more likely that they would have recalled and weighed the evidence indicating the lack of a cold, carefully considered, premeditated design to kill.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
