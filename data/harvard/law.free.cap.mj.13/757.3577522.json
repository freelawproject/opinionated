Shropshire, </em>20 U.S.C.M.A. 374, 43 C.M.R. 214 (1971), Judge Darden stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-17\">[E]very threat unexecuted involves some contingency, if none other than that the maker\u2019s purpose be not abandoned, or that execution by him be not prevented. <em>But if an utterance is conditioned on a variable that cannot occur, the condition negates the threat, </em>[emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkM\">This principle has its roots in English and American common law. For example, to lay one\u2019s hand on a sword, and say, \u201cIf it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you,\u201d does not constitute an assault. <em>Tuberville v. Savage, </em>86 Eng.Rep. 684 (KB 1669); neither is to raise and shake a cane at another, saying, \u201cIf you were not an old man, I would knock you down.\u201d <em>State v. Crow, </em>23 N.C. 375 (1 Ired). <em>See generally, </em>1 Anderson, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>section 332 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-18\">In the case before us the words constituting the alleged threat were \u201cif this were the civilian world ... he (accused) would take his .357 magnum and shoot him (victim) six times between the eyes.\u201d The accused stated further if he couldn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d the victim, he would \u201cget\u201d his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">The accused argues that the language which constituted the alleged threat was prefaced by the words \u201cif this were the civilian world.\u201d This, he contends, is a classic example of a conditional statement where the contingency was not reasonably possible of fulfillment, i.e., he was an active duty member of the Air Force, not a civilian. The Government maintains the accused could have been referring to his status after confinement and after the execution of a punitive or administrative discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-20\">We held in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>49 C.M.R. 278 (A.F.C.M.R.1974) that contingent words will neutralize threat declarations in situations where there is no reasonable possibility the uncertain events will occur. Applying the law to the facts, the accused\u2019s language did not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>communicating a threat. The setting in which the words were uttered could never be the \u201ccivilian world.\u201d Accordingly, the finding of guilty as to communicating a threat cannot stand. <em>Shropshire, supra; but cf. United States v. Johnson, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 279, 45 C.M.R. 53 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">However, we may properly affirm any lesser included offense supported by the evidence. Article 59(b), Code, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(b), <em>supra; United States v. Cagle, </em>12 M.J. 736 (A.F.C.M.R.1976), <em>pet. denied, </em>12 M.J. 332 (C.M.A.1982). The use of provoking words is a lesser included offense of communicating a threat. <em>United States v. Nicolas, </em>14 C.M.R. 683 (A.F.B.R.1954). The words must be those which tend to induce breaches of the peace. <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>24 C.M.R. 540 (A.F.B.R.1957), <em>pet. denied, </em>24 C.M.R. 311 (C.M.A.1957). We find that the language employed in this case was likely to induce a breach of the peace. Accordingly, we affirm a conviction of the lesser included offense of using provoking words in violation of Article 117 of the Code, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 917, <em>supra. United States v. Nicolas, supra; compare United States v. Noriega, </em>20 C.M.R. 893 (A.F.B.R.1955); <em>rev\u2019d </em>7 U.S.C.M.A. 196, 21 C.M.R. 322 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Only so much of the findings of guilty as find the accused guilty of the lesser included offense of using provoking words in violation of Article 117, Code, supra, are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence based on the modified findings of guilty and the entire record, we find appropriate only so much thereof as extends to three months confinement at hard labor, forfeiture of $367.00 per month for three months, and reduction to airman basic.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The findings of guilty and the sentence, both as modified here, are</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">POWELL, Senior Judge, and MILLER, Judge, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\"> The approved sentence extended to a bad conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for two months, forfeiture of $367.00 per month for six months, and reduction to airman basic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
