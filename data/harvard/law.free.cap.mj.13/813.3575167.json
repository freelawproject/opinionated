Since he was not brought to trial within 90 days he contends that a dismissal of all charges and specifications is required. <em>United States v. Burton, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 112, 44 C.M.R. 166 (1971). We disagree. The government proceeded with this ease in an orderly and prompt manner and the conditions of the accused\u2019s pretrial restraint did not trigger the <em>Burton </em>rule. <em>United States v. Walls, </em>9 M.J. 88 (C.M.A.1980); <em>cf., United States v. Schilf, </em>1 M.J. 251 (C.M.A.1976).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-20\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-15\"> Further, the accused made no demand for a speedy trial. <em>United States v.
