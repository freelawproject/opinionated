We hold that the military judge did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-28\">The appellant was charged with and ultimately convicted of larceny of an M \u2014 16 rifle.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> At trial the Government relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>the testimony of three principal witnesses, Privates Larry E. Johnson, Leo Lenneman, and Richard A. Likins. Johnson testified that on 28 March 1981 he had drawn his assigned M-16 rifle from the unit armorer. Because he was not going into the field until later, he stored the weapon in a room assigned to the appellant, Private Lenneman, and a third soldier. At the time he left the rifle in the room only the appellant was present. When he later returned both the appellant and the rifle were missing. Both Lenneman and Likins testified that the appellant had admitted taking the weapon. Likins recalled that the appellant had said he was going to sell the rifle. In defense the appellant claimed that he took the rifle and gave it to Likins in order to get Johnson into trouble. He believed that Likins would return the weapon to Johnson. The appellant maintained that he had not seen the rifle since he gave it to Likins. The rifle was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Major John T. Gendron was the executive officer in appellant\u2019s battalion and the individual responsible for coordinating the battalion\u2019s in-house investigation into the stolen weapon. During the investigation a telephone caller tipped him off that the appellant was about ready to turn the weapon in. The tip proved false. When requested at trial by defense counsel to disclose the caller\u2019s identity, Major Gendron refused. Counsel then moved the military judge to order Major Gendron to reveal the identity of the tipster. The Government responded that it would \u201cplay with privileges\u201d as to the identity of the caller. The military judge after inquiring into the materiality of the potential witness denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">In general, the Government has a privilege under Mil.R.Evid. 507(a) to withhold from disclosure the identity of individuals furnishing information of violations of law \u201cto a person whose official duties include the discovery, investigation, or prosecution of crimes.\u201d The purpose of the rule is to encourage citizens to communicate their knowledge of crimes to appropriate officials by preserving their anonymity and so serve the public interest in furthering effective law enforcement. <em>United States v. Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, 627, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). Section (b) provides that \u201can appropriate representative of the United States\u201d may claim the privilege at trial except where the prosecution objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">A limitation on the applicability of the privilege arises from fundamental requirements of due process under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Thus, section (c)(2) of the rule requires that the privilege give way if the informer\u2019s identity or the substance of his communication is relevant and material to the accused\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">First, appellant argues that the source who called Major Gendron was not an \u201cinformant\u201d because the communication was not made \u201cto a person whose official duties include the discovery, investigation, or prosecution of crime.\u201d Appellant suggests that this language should be construed to limit the scope of privileged communications to law enforcement officers and prosecutors, excluding generally command personnel. This argument is at odds with the drafter\u2019s analyses of the rule which provides that the rule \u201cincludes good citizen reports to <em>command </em>or police, as well as the traditional \u2018confidential informants.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition), Appendix 18-83; S. Saltzburg, L. Schinasi, D. Schleuter, Military Rules of Evidence Manual, 259 (1981). Moreover, construing the scope of the rule to include members of the command such as Major Gendron serves to foster the purpose of the rule by opening a natural channel of communication and encouraging the free flow of information in the military jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Appellant next argues that Major Gendron was not an \u201cappropriate person\u201d with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>in the meaning of section (b) to assert the privilege. This argument is rendered moot as we find that the Government\u2019s counsel intended to assert the privilege by stating it would \u201cplay with the privilege as to the identity of [the informant].\u201d Clearly, trial counsel is an \u201cappropriate person\u201d to assert the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Finally, appellant argues that the exception under section (c)(2) applies as disclosure of the identity of the source was necessary to the appellant\u2019s defense. As noted above, the appellant\u2019s counsel defended on the basis that he took the weapon as a prank in order to get Johnson into trouble. Appellant maintained that he gave the weapon to Likins and never saw it again. With this in mind, we fail to see how the testimony of the caller would be relevant or material to the appellant\u2019s theory. Instead, the caller had he testified, would have contradicted the appellant\u2019s testimony by placing possession of the weapon in the appellant rather than in Likins. The appellant carries the burden to establish the relevancy of the informant\u2019s testimony and this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>3 M.J. 903 (A.C.M.R.1977). The caller\u2019s communication to Major Gendron did not reveal that he participated in purloining the weapon or that he was personally aware of its whereabouts. So far as it appears, the source was a mere tipster and more is required before the privilege of nondisclosure must yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Judge MILLER and Judge LEWIS concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-18\">A violation of Article 121, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (1976). The appellant was additionally charged with, but acquitted of, wrongfully disposing of the M-16 rifle. He was also acquitted of larceny of a protective mask. His sentence provided for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>dishonorable discharge, confinement at hard labor for eighteen months, total forfeitures, and reduction to Private E-l. The convening authority reduced the confinement to twelve months but otherwise approved the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
