There is also a question as to the maximum punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">The first issue comes about by virtue of the provisions of Fort Campbell Regulation 190-5 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">2. DRUG PARAPHERNALIA. It shall be unlawful and a criminal offense for any person to possess, have under his control, or deliver any device, contrivance, instrument, paraphernalia, or any other item <em>with the intent </em>that such device, contrivance, instrument, paraphernalia, or other item be used, by any person, for unlawful administering, smoking, injecting, or otherwise using any controlled substance with [sic] the meaning of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. [Emphasis added.] The device in question, which appellant admitted possessing under circumstances amounting to a violation of the regulation, is described in the record (in lieu of having been attached as Prosecution Exhibit 7) as \u201ca smoking device, red in color with black top, bearing the words \u2018Big Hit.\u2019 \u201d The item was seized in an authorized search of appellant\u2019s family quarters at Fort Campbell shortly after he had, in those quarters, sold some lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) tablets and marihuana to a confidential informant and a member of the Fort Campbell Drug Suppression Team. Besides a large additional quantity of LSD, 39 grams of hashish and 8 grams of marihuana were seized from the coffee table in the living room. The smoking device was found on top of a dresser in the dining room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">In addition to offering to plead guilty to charges relating to the sales of LSD and marihuana, appellant offered to plead guilty to the charge of violating paragraph 2 of Fort Campbell Regulation 190-5 \u201cby wrongfully possessing 1 marihuana smoking devices [sic; a quantity of 4 had been alleged initially] brand name \u2018Big Hit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">Before accepting appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to this offense, the trial judge advised appellant that the first element of the offense was that there was in existence a certain lawful general regulation, namely Fort Campbell Regulation 190-5, from which the judge then read aloud to appellant. This reading included paragraph 2, quoted above, with its requirement that the device be possessed with the intent that it be used for unlawful use of a controlled substance. The second element of the offense, as stated by the judge, was \u201cthat you had a duty to obey this regulation.\u201d \u201cAnd the third element,\u201d the judge said, \u201cis that at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, on or about 23 January 1981, you violated this lawful general regulation by wrongfully possessing one marihuana smoking device, brand name \u2018Big Hit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">Later, in ascertaining whether there was a factual basis for pleading guilty, the judge said\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-17\">Now this smoking device; I earlier read that portion of the regulation to you, and are you convinced that this is the type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>smoking device which is covered by this regulation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Appellant replied that it was. The judge then added\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">That is, a device specifically designed to smoke marihuana or some other form of controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Appellant replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The trial judge might have explained more particularly the intent with which the device was required to be possessed in order for possession of it to constitute a violation of the regulation. Nevertheless, I do not believe that this court is now required to reject the plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">We deal in these cases, not with the explanation of law that must be given to triers of fact together with instructing them that conviction requires establishment of each element beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, we deal with assuring that an accused person, who already has consulted with counsel and decided upon a plea of guilty, understands the offense he is admitting and with assuring that there is a basis in fact for his belief that he is guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">There can be in this case no doubt that the device was intended to be used unlawfully, and, for that matter, no doubt about how it was to be used, for it was described throughout as a device for the smoking of marihuana. Appellant expressly admitted to the judge that it had such a purpose. At no time has he asserted that he did not intend that it be so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">As appellant\u2019s brief recognizes, this case differs from <em>United States v. Furtado, </em>43 C.M.R. 837 (ACMR 1971), in which a plea was held improvident, because here appellant was specifically informed of the prerequisite intent by virtue of having the regulation read verbatim to him. To require more under the circumstances of this case would adopt an unnecessarily \u201cstructured, formulistic interpretation of <em>United States v. Care.\u201d See United States v. Crouch, </em>11 M.J. 128, 129-30 (CMA 1981) (Cook, J.) (2-1); <em>cf. United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364, 367 (CMA 1980) (factual circumstances revealed by accused objectively supporting plea). I view the record as establishing that the plea of guilty was providently entered and properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The record before us reflects various calculations of the maximum punishment (i.e., as to the authorized term of confinement), which range from 16 years (according to the staff judge advocate\u2019s pretrial advice) to 10 years (the military judge\u2019s initial computation), to 9 years (the trial counsel\u2019s view) to 5 years (motion by the defense to limit punishment), all reflecting differing views on the matter of multiplicity for sentence purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Appellant had been charged with violating Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892 (1976), by wrongfully possessing 212 tablets of LSD (Charge I, Specification 1). Ten of these had been sold to Military Police Investigator Bailey in appellant\u2019s quarters, and an eleventh tablet had been given to Bailey at the same time, and two hundred one additional tablets were found when the quarters were searched a half-hour later. Accordingly, appellant was also charged with wrongful transfer of the 11 tablets to Bailey (Charge I, Specification 2), and wrongful sale of the 10 tablets to Bailey (Charge I, Specification 3). In the light of <em>United States v. Waller, </em>3 M.J. 32 (CMA 1977), these offenses were, under the circumstances, multiplicious for sentencing purposes, authorizing at most confinement for a maximum of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">Appellant also was charged with violating Article 134 of the Uniform Code, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1976), by wrongfully possessing five small blocks of marihuana in the hashish form (sold to Bailey with the LSD) together with thirty-nine grams of marihuana in the hashish form (found in the subsequent search of the quarters) (Charge II, Specification 1), wrongfully transferring the five blocks to Bailey (Charge II, Specification 2), and wrongfully selling the five blocks to Bailey (Charge II, Specification 3). Under <em>Waller, </em>those three specifications would likewise merge for punishment pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>poses, authorizing confinement for a maximum term of five years. A fourth specification of Charge II alleged the wrongful possession of eight grams of marihuana, not in the hashish form, also found along with the thirty-nine grams of hashish when the quarters were searched. We regard that specification as merging with the others of Charge II for punishment purposes. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>1 M.J. 346 (CMA 1976) (amphetamines, heroin, and hashish concurrently in accused\u2019s apartment); see <em>also United States v. Nelson, </em>47 C.M.R. 395 (ACMR 1973) (hashish and marihuana essentially are same drug).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We are left, however, with the questions whether the LSD offenses necessarily merge with the marihuana offenses for the purposes of punishment and whether the offense of wrongfully possessing drug paraphernalia (the smoking device), which was Specification 5 of Charge I (a Specification 4 of that Charge was dismissed) in violation of command regulations necessarily merges with the transactional offenses. Appellant contends that such is the case and that the maximum confinement imposable was a term of five years. The military judge believed that confinement for 12 years was authorized (he regarded the several possession offenses as merged for punishment and regarded the transaction offenses as merged, but did not regard the transactions as merging with the possessions; possession of the smoking device he considered separately punishable, too). However, as the prosecution was only contending that the maximum was nine years, based on a somewhat different version of multiplicity, the military judge acceded to that figure. He imposed a sentence that included three years\u2019 confinement, which was subsequently reduced to eighteen months by virtue of a plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Lacking any indication in the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding the events, or in the providence inquiry by the judge, that the sales of LSD and marihuana should be treated as separate events, we regard the correct yardstick for confinement to have been seven years rather than either five or nine. The drug offenses all merged to authorize but five years\u2019 confinement. The possession of paraphernalia in violation of command regulations we regard as separately punishable (two years). Since the defense contended that the maximum punishment was even less, no issue as to the providence of the guilty plea arises. <em>Cf. United States v. Harden, </em>1 M.J. 258 (CMA 1976) (plea improvident when accused believed possible punishment was substantially greater than was legally authorized). Nevertheless, since the wrong yardstick was used by both the military judge and the convening authority (the pretrial advice informed him it was 16 years; the post-trial advice, 9), we will grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the error noted and the entire record, the court affirms only so much of the sentence as provides for discharge from the service with a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for sixteen months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the grade of private E-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Judge COHEN concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b675-11\">McKAY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">I dissent. The subject regulatory provision proscribes possession of any device with the intent, in this instance, of smoking any controlled substance within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. (marihuana is such a controlled substance). Simple and plain possession of such a device is not prohibited by the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">During the providence inquiry, the military judge read the pertinent regulation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and the following dialogue took place between him and the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">MJ: Now this smoking device; I earlier read that portion of the regulation to you, and are you convinced that this is the <em>type </em>smoking device which is covered by this regulation? [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">ACC: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">MJ: That is, a <em>device specifically designed </em>to smoke marijuana or some other form of controlled substance. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">ACC: Yes, Sir.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Further, while explaining the elements of the offense to appellant the military judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">And the third element is that at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, on or about 23 January 1981, <em>you violated this lawful general regulation by wrongfully possessing </em>one marijuana smoking device, brand name \u2018Big Hit.\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The military judge made no further inquiry into the appellant\u2019s intent with respect to his possession of the \u201cBig Hit\u201d smoking device. In view of the particular wording of the specification, which is misleading in that it appears to allege a violation of the regulation merely by wrongful possession,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I believe the inquiry into the providence of the plea was inadequate. In my opinion the military judge confused the appellant by stressing possession of a smoking device of a particular design or type as opposed to possession of a smoking device with a specific intent to use it. Thus he not only misled appellant but failed to establish the factual basis for a violation of the subject regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">In <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. 535, 40 C.M.R. 247 (1969), the Court of Military Appeals required that the military judge inquire of the accused into the facts and circumstances of the act charged in order to establish a factual basis for his determination of guilt. The factual circumstances, as revealed by the accused himself, must objectively support his plea. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364 (CMA 1980). Intent, not possession, is the gravamen of the offense in appellant\u2019s case. The inquiry of the military judge fell short and established only simple possession of the smoking device. The required specific intent to use the device for smoking marihuana was not established in the inquiry. Thus the military judge failed to comply with <em>Care. As </em>that is the sole responsibility of the military judge, establishment by the defense counsel that the required intent was present and its significance understood by the appellant does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">The majority opinion relies on the Court of Military Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>11 M.J. 128 (CMA 1981), in its conclusion that the military judge\u2019s inquiry was adequate because it established appellant\u2019s possession of the \u201cBig Hit\u201d smoking device with the knowledge that he had a duty to obey the regulation. This reliance is misguided. In <em>Crouch </em>the inquiry clearly established a factual basis that the appellant there intended to aid and abet the criminal acts of his co-actors. The issue in that case was not the failure to establish a factual basis upon which the guilty plea could be accepted, but was whether the failure of the military judge to specifically inquire about his intent without having defined the law of criminal responsibility as an aider and abettor to the appellant rendered his plea improvident.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-17\">Finally, I note that the specification alleges \u201cwrongful possession\u201d and that it could be argued that the appellant\u2019s acknowledgment that his possession was wrongful infers or even admits the required intent. It could be just as easily concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>however, that he was referring simply to possession of a device designed to smoke marihuana, particularly in view of the wording of the specification and the manner in which the trial judge questioned and explained the regulation to appellant. Therefore, without further development of the facts, I cannot accept the military judge\u2019s inquiry as having been adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">I would disapprove the findings of guilty to Specification 5, Charge I, approve the other findings of guilty and reassess the sentence using as a yardstick a maximum imposable sentence of a dishonorable discharge, confinement for five years, total forfeiture of pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\">.
