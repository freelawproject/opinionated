The record disclosed that the victim, Sergeant Camacho, knew the accused and used marijuana with him numerous times. Once, while Camacho was waiting for his car pool, the accused offered him a ride. After some casual conversation, the accused asked Camacho if he \u201cplanned on talking.\u201d When Camacho said no, the accused replied \u201che was glad because he\u2019d hate to see any bloodshed.\u201d Camacho was uneasy over the accused\u2019s statement and discussed it with a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-15\">The accused argues this language was not a threat as it was made in the context of a friendly conversation and did not affect Camacho\u2019s amicable relationship with the accused. The thrust of the accused\u2019s position is that Camacho did not perceive the statement to be a threat and would have talked to the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-16\">The administration of justice is possible only where potential witnesses are protected against violence to their persons. <em>United States v. Le Sage, </em>22 C.M.R. 853 (A.F.B.R.1956). We attribute little significance to the circumstance that the accused\u2019s statement would not have deterred Camacho from cooperating with law enforcement authorities; otherwise, a witness could be harassed with impunity if that individual simply ignored the remark or refused to be frightened by it. Likewise, the accused\u2019s friendship with Camacho does not lessen the impact of the remark or the nature of the threat. That Camacho related the incident to a third person and was \u201cuneasy\u201d over it belies any assertion that Camacho considered the remark to be friendly banter or made in jest. We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused\u2019s guilt. <em>Cf. United States v. Johnson, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 279, 45 C.M.R. 53 (1972); <em>see generally, United States v. Caudill, </em>10 M.J. 787 (A.F.C.M.R.1981); <em>United States v. Chodkowski, </em>11 M.J. 605 (A.F.C.M.R.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Next, the accused maintains that the offenses of wrongfully possessing, using and transferring marijuana (Specifications 1, 2 and 3, Charge I) are multiplicious for sentencing. Basically, he argues the substance of the offenses was the contemporaneous possession, use and transfer of the <em>same </em>quantities of marijuana at various times over the course of a year. We disagree as the record does not support this conclusion. There is ample evidence that the offenses differed in time, place, and amounts of marijuana involved. For example: the accused possessed marijuana in his house in August 1980, and at Eielson Air Force Base on 16 January 1981; he used marijuana in January 1981 at Moose Creek, Alaska, and at parties at his house at North Pole, Alaska, at various times between January \u2014 April 1980; and made transfers of marijuana to different individuals in different amounts during the summer and fall of 1980. As we said in <em>United States v. Shealy, </em>9 M.J. 842 (A.F.C.M.R.1980), \u201cEach case must be analyzed within its own factual context, and the facts in each case are controlling.\u201d The offenses are separate for punishment purposes, and the military judge did not err in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">Finally, appellate defense counsel urge that the sentence is too harsh and hence inappropriate and direct our attention to the numerous clemency requests submitted on behalf of the accused.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In summary, the accused acknowledges the seriousness of his conduct, but asks that we consider his family situation and his wife and two sons who are totally dependent upon him for financial and emotional support. He seeks partial reinstatement of the forfeitures and a reduction of the period of confinement at hard labor to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"AHF\">, To use a position of trust in a manner as the accused did is inexcusable. We will not ignore that the accused, as a commander, was trafficking in drugs to members of his command at a profit to himself. Nor will we overlook that he encouraged the use of marijuana among the members of his command and Air Force personnel in general. Upon consideration of the entire record, we find the sentence appropriate. The findings of guilty and the sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">POWELL, Senior Judge, and MILLER, Judge, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">. He was acquitted of additional allegations of wrongfully introducing marijuana onto an Air Force base for the purpose of use, and failing to take action on an official investigation in which the United States had an interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">. The accused\u2019s MOTION TO FILE ATTACHED DOCUMENT (Letter from Mrs. Sandra Wall) for determination of sentence appropriateness is DENIED. <em>United States v. Castleman, </em>10 M.J. 750 (A.F.C.M.R.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
