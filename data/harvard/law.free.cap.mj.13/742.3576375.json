In addition, he was tried on charges of assaulting a commissioned officer in the execution of his office and both willfully disobeying and being disrespectful to that officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Appellant was acquitted of the charges of disobedience and disrespect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At issue in this review of his conviction and sentence are (1) whether his effort to destroy evidence was correctly regarded as constituting the offense of obstructing justice in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1976), and (2) whether the military judge properly convicted him of resisting apprehension in violation of Article 95, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 895 (1976), when the specification on which he was tried alleged an assault on an officer in execution of his office in violation of Article 90 of the Code, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">The specification pertaining to destroying evidence alleged that appellant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-17\">[D]id ... wrongfully and unlawfully endeavor to destroy evidence, to wit: by throwing a plastic bag of marihuana out of a barracks window, which evidence had been properly seized by Lieutenant Patrick Snyder, the Staff Duty Officer, for the purpose of being used in a trial by court-martial in the case of <em>United States v. Ridgeway </em>and <em>United States v. Parks.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3B\">Specification 1 of Charge III (Violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 134).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">Stated below are the elements of the offense as the military judge enumerated them to the appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-19\">The first would be that on or about the 4th of January of 1981, here at Fort Hood, Texas, that you wrongfully and unlawfully tried to destroy evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>which was expected to be used in a court-martial against you and an individual by the name of Parks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">Secondly, the \u2014 they would have to prove that this evidence was involved in your\u2019s and Parks\u2019 case and that you had reason to believe that some sort of criminal proceeding was pending in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">Third, they would have to prove that you did this by grabbing a bag of marihuana and throwing it out of a barracks window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">Fourth, they would have to prove that this was done with the intent to impede the due administration of military justice. And when I say \u2018impede\u2019, that means to in some way keep justice from running its course or to in some way deter or prevent justice from being accomplished. And, finally, they would have to prove that under the circumstances such conduct would be to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces or of such a nature as to tend to bring discredit on the Armed Forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Transcript at 13-14; cf. U. S. Dep\u2019t of Army, Pamphlet 27-9, Military Judges\u2019 Guide para. 4-165 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">As appellant described the related events to the military judge, a Lieutenant Snyder, detailed as the staff duty officer, had entered appellant\u2019s room and seized marihuana. While the seized marihuana was bagged and lying on a bed, appellant said, \u201cHe turned his back and I panicked and whatnot and I threw it out the window.\u201d Appellant\u2019s affirmative response to questions indicated he knew the marihuana could be used against himself and Parks (who was present in the room) in some possible criminal proceeding. Asked what his intent was when he threw the marihuana from the window, appellant replied, \u201cPossibly keeping him from getting \u2014 keep me out of trouble, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">The appellant contends that two facts necessary to establish the offense of \u201cobstructing justice\u201d are missing. First, there were no criminal proceedings pending when he took the bag of marihuana and threw it from the window. Second, it was not shown that a specific intent to impede criminal proceedings was the object of his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Underlying both arguments is the concept that the elements of the offense depicted in the Manual for Courts-Martial as \u201cobstructing justice\u201d are governed by the elements of the offense defined in section 1503 of title 18 of the United States Code (1976 ed.), because that statute was adopted as a guide for the model specification used in the Manual and as the basis for the maximum confinement authorized. Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition) at 25-16, A6-24; U. S. Dep\u2019t of Army, Pamphlet 27-2, Analysis of Contents; Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969, (Revised edition) at 25-15, A6-4 (1970). In view of our holding, in regard to the second contention, that his specific intent to impede criminal sanctions was sufficiently evidenced in appellant\u2019s replies to the questions of the military judge concerning his actions, we discuss the effect of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 upon the military offense only in relation to his first contention; namely, that criminal proceedings must be shown to have been pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>To begin with, we agree that the pendency of criminal proceedings of some sort is essential to successful prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. Otherwise, it would not have been necessary for the Congress to enact 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1510, which was done in 1967, so as to extend the prohibitions of \u00a7 1503 (e.g., intimidating witnesses) to Federal criminal investigations. Act of 3 November 1967, Pub.L. 90-123, 81 Stat. 362; H.R.Rep.No.658, 90th Cong., 1st Session, <em>reprinted in </em>1967 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1760.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, as the authorities previously cited indicate, \u00a7 1503 clearly served as a model for alleging the military offense denominated by the catchline \u201cobstructing justice\u201d in the Manual for Courts-Martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">(2, 3] When a specific Federal statute is used as the basis for a charge under the third clause of Article 134, which authorizes punishment of \u201ccrimes and offenses not capital,\u201d the elements of the Federal statute are controlling as to the definition of the offense alleged. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 264, 267, 45 C.M.R. 38, 41 (1972); <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>47 C.M.R. 259, 263-64 (A.F.C.M.R.) (en banc), <em>pet. denied, </em>22 U.S.C.M.A. 635, 48 C.M.R. 1000 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such is not the case here, however.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant was not prosecuted under the third clause for violation of the Federal code, but was instead prosecuted for violation of those clauses of Article 134 proscribing \u201cdisorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline\u201d or \u201cconduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\u201d Uniform Code of Military Justice, article 134, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1976). The use of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 as a guide to the drafting of specifications does not dictate that the offense of obstructing the administration of military justice in violation of the first or second clauses of Article 134 be thereafter limited to only the conduct or elements within the purview of the Federal statute. <em>See United States v. Chodkowski, </em>11 M.J. 605 (A.F.C.M.R.1981); <em>United States v. Caudill, </em>10 M.J. 787 (A.F.C.M.R.), <em>pet. denied, </em>11 M.J. 342 (C.M.A.1981); <em>United States v. Delaney, </em>44 C.M.R. 367 (A.C.M.R.1971); <em>United States v. LeSage, </em>22 C.M.R. 853 (A.F.B.R.1956); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number><em>United States v. Maze, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 260, 263-64, 45 C.M.R. 34, 37-38 (1972); <em>cf. United States v. Wysong, </em>9 U.S.C.M.A. 249, 251-52, 26 C.M.R. 29, 31-32 (1958) (determination of maximum punishment when none prescribed in Manual for Courts-Martial).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In support of his contention that the pendency of judicial proceedings was an element of the military offense required to be shown, appellant relies primarily upon an Air Force Board of Review decision in <em>United States v. Daminger, </em>30 C.M.R. 826 (A.F.B.R.1960) (Daminger I), in which the board, emphasizing the use of the term military \u201cjudicial\u201d system in the Court of Military Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>United States v. Long, </em>2 U.S.C.M.A. 60, 6 C.M.R. 60 (1952), concluded that the pendency of judicial proceedings was a necessary element of the offense of obstructing justice by means of intimidating witnesses and that a \u201cpreliminary inquiry\u201d as authorized by the Manual for Courts-Martial constituted \u201cjudicial proceedings,\u201d but that a military criminal investigation for general law enforcement purposes did not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">This Court, however, does not view <em>Long </em>as necessitating a conclusion that the offense of obstructing military justice in violation of the first or second clauses of Article 134 requires that judicial proceedings previously have been instituted. The <em>Long </em>court spoke in terms of judicial proceedings because the facts before it involved assault upon a person who had testified before a summary court-martial and the initial question facing the court was whether a summary court-martial was a \u201ccourt of the United States\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, under which the charge specifically was laid. The court did not decide that question, however, because it reasoned (a) that the essence of the offense charged was \u201cobstruction or interference with the administration of justice in the military system,\u201d (b) that such an offense could be prosecuted under the first or</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">second clauses of Article 134, and (c) that intimidating a witness in a court-martial constituted the offense. <em>Cf. United States v. Delaney, </em>44 C.M.R. at 368 (construing <em>Long </em>in relation to nonjudicial punishment proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Accordingly, and having in mind both the broad definition of obstructing justice as a common law crime and the complex of Federal statutes needed and existing in the absence of a common law of Federal crimes, we regard the offense with which appellant was charged \u2014 in essence the removal or destruction of evidence with the intent to impede the administration of military justice \u2014 as cognizable under the first or second clauses of Article 134 even though no proceedings had formally begun, the requisite knowledge underlying appellant\u2019s intent being supplied by the fact that he knew the evidence had been seized under official authority. <em>See United States v. Chodkowski, </em>11 M.J. 605 (A.F.C.M.R.1981). The military judge\u2019s inclusion of the pend-ency of criminal proceedings as an element of the offense was superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that no specific intent on his part to obstruct the administration of justice was shown, he only having thrown the marihuana from the window because, as he termed it, he \u201cpanicked.\u201d \u201cPanic\u201d may indeed connote a loss of rationality (instead of mere fear or alarm), but there is no indication that such was meant or was the case here. To the contrary, appellant conceded that he knew that the marihuana possibly would be used against him in a criminal proceeding and said his intent in removing it was to keep himself \u201cout of trouble.\u201d Accordingly, we regard his plea as properly accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">The element of prejudice to good order and discipline or discredit to the armed forces having properly been taken into account, as indicated by the military judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>description of the elements, appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to the offense charged may stand. <em>Cf. United States v. Almendarez, </em>46 C.M.R. at 816 (no indication judge considered prejudice to order and discipline or service discredit).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Appellant\u2019s second assigned error is more meritorious. He was charged with violating Article 90 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890 (1976), in that he \u201cdid .. . strike First Lieutenant Patrick Snyder, his superior commissioned officer, who was then in execution of his office, on the chin with his fist.\u201d He pleaded not guilty. After hearing the only evidence, which was presented by the prosecution, the military judge found appellant not guilty of violating Article 90, but guilty of violating Article 95, indicating by means of exceptions and substitutions shown in the specification below that the appellant\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">[D]id . . . strike [resist being lawfully apprehended by] First Lieutenant Patrick Snyder, his superior commissioned officer, who was then in the execution of his office,-on-the-chin with his fists.</p>\n<p id=\"ApDY\">Appellant now contends that it was improper to convict him of resisting apprehension, although that is a distinctly lesser offense in terms of maximum punishment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He contends that, even supposing the proof reasonably raised the included offense, the specification was insufficient to give fair notice that lawful apprehension was involved. <em>See United States v. Thacker, </em>16 U.S.C.M.A. 408, 410, 37 C.M.R. 28, 30 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The Government\u2019s response is twofold. First, that the specification meets the standards for post-trial attack. <em>See United States v. Sell, </em>3 U.S.C.M.A. 202, 206, 11 C.M.R. 202, 206 (1953). Second, that the error had insufficient impact to warrant consideration for the first time on appeal. <em>Cf. United States v. Stringer, </em>4 U.S.C.M.A. 494, 398-99, 16 C.M.R. 68, 72-73 (1954). We decide this assignment on a different basis, however: the Court is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was resisting apprehension when the violence that was charged occurred. The evidence indicates that appellant already had been apprehended and taken into custody when the assault, which grew out of his attempt to destroy evidence, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Disapproval of the finding of guilty does not in itself require sentence relief, however, because, despite having reservations as to their multiplicity, the military judge acceded to a defense request that he consider the \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d and the \u201cresistance\u201d as merging for purposes of punishment and said that he would consider all of the offenses as multiplicious for sentencing, thereby merging them with the five-year offense of wrongfully possessing marihuana. Transcript at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The findings of guilty of Specification 1 of Charge II and Charge II are set aside and the charge is dismissed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The remaining findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the error noted and the entire record, the Court affirms the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Judge CLAUSE and Judge COHEN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\">. Convicted of the two offenses of which he had pleaded guilty, and of resisting apprehension (in lieu of assaulting the officer), appellant was sentenced to reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement at hard labor for nine months, and discharge from the service with a bad-conduct discharge. The sentence was approved by the convening authority. Article 66 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 (1976), mandates review by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">.

We are not called upon to decide whether this spells preemption of such conduct so as to be cognizable only under the third clause (\u201ccrimes and offenses not capital\u201d) of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1976). <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>19 U.S.C.M.A. 539, 542, 42 C.M.R. 141, 144 (1970) (military offense not preempted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2387 (1976)); <em>cf.

As for lesser included offenses, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>19 U.S.C.M.A. 539, 42 C.M.R. 141 (1970). A rule similar to that stated in the text applies to prosecutions under the Assimilative Crimes Act. <em>United States v.

Under certain circumstances, destruction of evidence falls within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (1976), provided the record establishes the pendency of a judicial proceeding. <em>E.g., United States v. Walasek, </em>527 F.2d 676, 678-81 (3d Cir. 1975) (destroying records subpoenaed by grand jury). Appellant could have been charged under the \u201ccrimes and offenses not capital\u201d clause of Article 134 with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2232 (1976) (destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2233 (1976) (rescue of seized property). <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Fishel, </em>12 M.J. 602, 606 (A.C.M.R.1981), <em>pet. denied, </em>13 M.J. 20 (C.M.A.1982) (\u00a7 2232); <em>United States v.
