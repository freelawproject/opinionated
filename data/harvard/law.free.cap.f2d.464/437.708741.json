Judge Weinstein complied with this direction in a 63-page opinion (dated November 5, 1971) which included 126 specific findings of fact (Findings 1-126) and 16 conclusions of law (Conclusions 127-142). Opinion unreported. In an opinion of 72 pages (dated October 21, 1971) relating to the class action aspect of the case, Judge Weinstein made 85 specific findings of fact (Findings 1-85) and 16 conclusions of law (Conclusions 86-101). 53 F.R.D. 664, 671-686. The lengthy prior proceedings are to be found in Dolgow v. Anderson, 438 F.2d 825; 43 F.R.D. 21 and 472; 45 F.R.D. 470; and 53 F.R.D. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">To characterize the decision of Judge Weinstein as on a motion for summary judgment in the sense that \u201csummary judgment\u201d is customarily used would be a misnomer. In actuality it was a decision rendered after plaintiffs had had protracted discovery for more than a year, entailing examination of thousands of pages of documents, depositions of top officers of Monsanto, examination of scores of volumes of minutes of the Board of Directors, minutes of the Executive and Finance Committees of Monsanto, 1,000 press releases and some 7,600 pages of internal corporate memoranda and documents, three days of evidentiary hearings of Monsanto officers and others at which ten witnesses were produced (some 10 volumes), almost two years of fact exploration by plaintiffs and after remand three days of examination and cross-examination (485 pages) of an expert witness called by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also submitted an affidavit on remand. The court found that neither the expert\u2019s affidavit nor three days\u2019 testimony nor counsel\u2019s affidavit added \u201cany material facts or presented] any genuine issue of material fact to be tried.\u201d Findings 46, 47, Summary Judgment Decision. It was on the basis of the evidence produced at what was virtually a full scale trial that Judge Weinstein after a meticulous review of the evidence concluded that \u201c137. Construing every scrap of evidence adduced or that might be ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>duced in a way most favorable to plaintiffs, no reasonable jury could find that defendants, or any of them, have committed the offenses alleged in the complaints as supplemented by the affidavits and further charges of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In our remand we had suggested that \u201capparent issues pointed out in our opinion may in fact have been considered by the trial court to have been denuded of substance by evidence before it, such as the extent of review of the raw data by others than defendants, and the evidence as to revelation of start-up costs, investment tax credit and treatment of proceeds of sale of land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">These facts and all other material facts were considered by Judge Weinstein. Under the sub-heading \u201cReporting of the Investment Tax Credit, Start-up Costs, and the Disposition of Certain Real Estate\u201d, he made specific findings with respect to these items. Findings 92-94 (investment tax credits) ; Findings 95-98 (start-up costs); and Findings 99-102 (sale of land). His conclusion was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201c141. Any apparent issues, including those referred to in the opinions of the Second Circuit dated September 2, 1970 and January 18, 1971 [United States v. Fairhurst], 388 F.2d 825, 833, regarding the extent of review of the raw data by others than the individual defendants and the revelation of start-up costs, investment tax credit and treatment of proceeds of sale of land are without merit and present no genuine issues of material fact to be tried.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The trial judge has thus satisfied himself that based upon all the material specified in Rule 56(c) plus six days of evidentiary hearings in which plaintiffs had full opportunity for examination and cross-examination that \u201cThere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d including the two issues made the subject of our remand. He also considered the class action aspect of the ease \u201cwithout respect to whether summary judgment is granted\u201d and concluded that the \u201caction shall not be maintained as a class action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\"> In the light of Judge Weinstein\u2019s compliance with our remand, his findings of fact and conclusions of law and our reconsideration, we affirm the order of October 21, 1971, holding that the action \u201cshall not be maintained as a class action\u201d and the order of November 5, 1971, that summary judgment be entered dismissing the action with prejudice in favor of each of the defendants, with costs to defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
