Code \u00a7 1515(a) (1967) is challenged on these appeals by persons convicted thereunder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That statute provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-21\">Whoever is found in ... an establishment where . . . any narcotic drug is sold, administered, or dispensed without a license shall, if he knew it was such an establishment and if he is unable to give a good account of his presence in the establishment, be imprisoned. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>We now hold, on the basis of our prior decision in Ricks v. District of Columbia, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 201, 414 F.2d 1097 (Ricks I) and Ricks v. United States, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 414 F.2d 1111 (1968) (Ricks II), that \u00a7 1515(a), which makes criminal liability turn upon a defendant\u2019s ability to give a \u201cgood account\u201d of himself, is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">It is unnecessary here to retrace the thorough analysis of Judge Robinson in <em>Ricks </em>I, which found the concept of \u201cgood account\u201d to be \u201cmuch too loose to satisfy constitutional requirements.\u201d 134 U.S.App.D.C. at 208, 414 F.2d at 1104. <em>See generally </em>134 U.S.App.D.C. at 204-209, 211-214, 218-223, 414 F.2d 1100-1105, 1107-1110, 1114-1119. Although formulated in the context of a separate but related statute, the analysis applies equally here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the light of this conclusion, it is also unnecessary to reach appellants\u2019 additional claims that the statute is overbroad, and that it infringes First Amendment rights of association and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">In United States v. McClough, note 2 <em>supra, </em>the DCCA thought to make \u00a7 1515(a) constitutionally invulnerable by construing \u201cgood account\u201d as providing an affirmative defense rather than as constituting an element of the offense. However, we are unable to perceive how this transformation, which merely shifts the burden of proof from the Government to the criminal defendant, in any way makes the statutory offense more precise. Whatever constitutional significance such a construction may have with respect to a defendant\u2019s claim of privilege against self-incrimination, the constitutional requirement that statutes be written with sufficient precision that men do not have to \u201cguess at their meaning\u201d is unrelated to the technicalities of burden of proof. Connally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). While a construction that would have narrowed \u201cgood account\u201d to require proof merely that the defendant was not trespassing or had no intent to participate in the illegal narcotics activity might conceivably have rendered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>statute sufficiently precise, the DCCA has expressly rejected these alternatives. Wells v. United States, 281 A.2d 226 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The Government has made no real effort to justify the manifest infirmities of the phrase \u201cgood account,\u201d but rather urges this court, despite our conceded jurisdiction to resolve these appeals on their merits, to defer to the decisions of the DCCA upholding the statute. If the DCCA had not yet had the opportunity to rule on the issues here, or if the question involved only the construction of a statute unrelated to constitutional considerations, sound policy might support this request. Here, however, the position of that court on the constitutional question is clear. Appellants Holly and Jones have been convicted under the statute, and appellant Mc-Clough faces trial under it. Thus we are not persuaded to reject their appeals in the teeth of our own views as to the merits of their constitutional claim\u2014 views which were shaped and made known as long ago as 1968 in <em>Ricks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The judgments appealed from are reversed, and the cases are remanded for disposition consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-12\">. Although appellants Holly and McClough were also charged under 33 D.C.Code \u00a7 416(2) (1967), both appellants have conceded in their reply brief that the issue as to that statute is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b852-5\">. This was the conclusion reached by the Superior Court, in the case of appellant McClough, in granting a pretrial motion to dismiss the criminal charge. On appeal the DCCA reversed. United States v. McClough, 263 A.2d <em>48 </em>(1970).</p>\n<p id=\"AfW\"><em>Ricks </em>I and II involved, respectively, the District of Columbia \u201cgeneral vagrancy\u201d and \u201cnarcotics vagrancy\u201d laws, which punished those defined by the statute as \u201cvagrants.\u201d The \u201cgeneral vagrancy\u201d statute, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 3302-3306 (1969), defined as a vagrant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU\">(1) Any person known to be a pickpocket, thief, burglar, confidence operator, or felon, either by his own confession or by his having been convicted in the District of Columbia or elsewhere of any one of such offenses or of any felony, . . . and having no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source, <em>and not giving a good account of himself </em>when found loitering around in any park, highway, public building, or other public place, store, shop, or reservation, or at any public gathering or assembly. * * * (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATU\">(8) Any person who wanders about the streets at late or unusual hours of the night without any visible or lawful business <em>and not giving a good account of himself, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOE\">The \u201cnarcotics vagrancy\u201d statute, 33 D.O.

Our silence as to the validity of these sections does not indicate any reservation about extending our holding to cover them in appropriate cases.\u201d 134 U.S.App.D.C. at 214, 414 F.2d at 1110.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b853-11\">. We deferred our decision in the appeals now before us pending action by the Supreme Court on a pending petition for certiorari in <em>Wells, </em>which involves the same statute. The Supreme Court declined review on March 21, 1972. 405 U.S. 995, 92 S.Ct. 1271, 31 L.Ed.2d 464.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b853-8\">TAMM, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AQCt\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">I join in the court\u2019s opinion today solely because these cases fall squarely within our decisions in Ricks v. District of Columbia, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 201, 414 F. 2d 1097 (1968); Ricks v. United States, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 414 F.2d 1111 (1968). Were it not for the constitutional issue involved I would have preferred to have this court stay its hand in these cases in deference to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. It is because of these constitutional issues alone that I join in the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The need for reorganization of the courts in the District of Columbia was a foregone conclusion by the time that the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (July 29, 1970), took effect on February 1, 1971. In March 1970 the House District Committee observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-13\">[t]he fact is that the diversity of Federal and local interest [in the District of Columbia] has led to the jurisdictional disarray which presently exists \u2014 the local court handles some federal misdemeanors, the Federal court has jurisdiction of local felonies and concurrent jurisdiction over local misdemeanors; the local court makes determinations as to certain administrative procedures appeals, the Federal court hears others without apparent distinction as to local-Federal interest ; the Federal court tries cases that would elsewhere be within the state system. And then there is the overall problem of concurrent jurisdiction, producing delays in the disposition of criminal matters, described as \u201cping-pong\u201d, in derogation of the public and federal interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">H.R.Rep.No.907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1970). As a result of feelings of inefficiency, confusion, and lack of effectiveness of the local courts Congress enacted the Court Reform Act. Under the terms of one section of that Act, 11 D. C.Code \u00a7 102 (Supp. Y 1972), \u201cThe D. C. Court of Appeals is declared by Congress to be the \u2018highest court of the District of Columbia\u2019 whose final judgments and decrees are reviewable by the Supreme Court of the United States [pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 (1970)] in the same manner as such review is accorded the highest court of a State.\u201d Kern, The District of Columbia Court Reorganization Act of 1970: A Dose of the Conventional Wisdom and a Dash of Innovation, 20 Am.U.L.Rev. 237, 241 (1970-71).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>In M. A. P. v. Ryan, 285 A.2d 810 (D.C.App.1971) the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-4\">As this court on February 1, 1971 became the highest court of the District of Columbia, no longer subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals, we are not bound by the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals rendered after that date. <em>With respect to decisions of the United States Court of Appeals rendered prior to February 1, 1971, we recognize that they, like the decisions of this court, constitute the case law of the District of Columbia. </em>As a matter of internal policy, we have adopted the rule that <em>no division of this court will overrule a prior decision of this court or refuse to follow a decision of the United States Court of Appeals rendered prior to February 1, 1971, and that such result can only be accomplished by this court en banc.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 312. (Emphasis added.) As .Judge Wright succinctly stated in United States v. Thompson, 147 U.S.App.D. C. 1, 10, 452 F.2d 1333, 1342 (1971), \u201c[t]he overriding purpose which emerges from the [Court Reform] Act is to put the District\u2019s judicial system on a par with those of the states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">It is equally obvious that the transitional period, in which shifts of jurisdiction occur, will be a difficult one. As one law review author expressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">[T]he transitional period will require that the courts in the District, local and federal, adopt a self-imposed hierarchy for the resolution of competing notions of local law, a new doctrine of abstention in yet another exercise of judicial discretion and restraint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXD\">Williams, District of Columbia Court Reorganization, 1970, 59 Geo.L.J. 477, 497 (1971). The realities of the situation require the judges of this court to abstain from acting in cases now within the ambit of review by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. It is only through such restraint and abstention that we can make the jurisdictional realignment of the local courts a reality and assure the realization of the goals set out by the Court Reform Act. We must be willing to realize and appreciate the role that the respective courts are now to play.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-9\">The Court Reform Act unequivocally distributed the \u201cjudicial power in the District of Columbia\u201d between the federal courts and the District of Columbia courts, allotting to each its own sphere and making neither subservient to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">M. A. P. v. Ryan, <em>supra, </em>285 A.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Our willingness to accept this change in the local court organization is, of course, important to the ultimate success of the Court Reform Act. Change is nothing new to the law \u2014 this is a profession based on the proposition of orderly change \u2014 and it is change which both gives strength to the law and allows it to remain a viable and living <em>force in </em>our modern and complex society. As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated in his first State of the Judiciary address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As2\">I have great confidence in our basic system and its foundations, in the dedicated judges and others in the judicial system, and in the lawyers of America. Continuity with change is the genius of the American system, and both are essential to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFZH\">Burger, The State of the Judiciary\u2014 1970, 56 A.B.A.J. 929, 934 (1970). Only by living up to the Chief Justice's confidence can we satisfy the ultimate goal of an efficient system of justice for the District of Columbia.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
