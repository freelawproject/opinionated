Mays v. Nelson, 323 F.Supp. 587, 588-589 (N. D.Cal.1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">(1) The error regarding the charge went uneorrected because, although appellee was informed of the general allegation that he had violated a condition of his parole requiring him \u201cto obey all municipal, county, state, and federal laws, and ordinances,\u201d he was not informed of the particular offense the Adult Authority believed he had been charged with \u2014 information counsel could have obtained. The erroneous information was contained in the report of appellee\u2019s parole officer to the Adult Authority. Under the Adult Authority\u2019s procedures, this report is usually the only information before the Adult Authority at the initial \u201chearing\u201d where the decision is made to suspend parole. No testimony or other evidence is received at this \u201chearing\u201d; the parolee receives no notice of the \u201chearing\u201d and does not appear. There is no provision that the parolee shall be given a copy of the parole officer\u2019s report or be advised of its contents, and in this case he was not. California Interim Committee on Criminal Procedure, Parole Revocation Procedures, at 2 (1970); C.E.B., California Criminal Law Practice \u00a7 23.158 (1969); Van Dyke, Parole Revocation Hearings in California: The Right to Counsel, 59 Calif.L.Rev. 1215, 1220 (1971). A decision to suspend parole made at this initial stage is tantamount to final revocation. In an estimated 98 per cent of the cases in which suspension was ordered, parole was revoked in the subsequent revocation hearing. Comment, Parole Revocation Hearings, Pro Justicia or Pro Camera Stellata, 10 Santa Clara Law. 319, 323 (1970); Calif. Interim Committee on Criminal Procedure, Parole Revocation Procedures, <em>supra; </em>Van Dyke, <em>supra, </em>59 Calif.L.Rev. at 1221. In subsequently revoking appellee\u2019s parole, the Adult Authority relied in part upon the erroneous belief that appellee had been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Appellee learned of this fact only when he later secured legal assistance and his attorney obtained access to his file.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">(2) Verification of mitigating facts relating to the offense, and of facts re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lating to changes that had occurred in appellee\u2019s living and working arrangements, was not received because the Adult Authority declined to hear from members of appellee\u2019s family \u2014 whose written statements could have been submitted to the Authority by counsel. Members of appellee\u2019s family appeared at the initial \u201chearing\u201d when appellee\u2019s case was first scheduled for consideration but, in accordance with procedures referred to above, were denied an opportunity to testify. At the subsequent revocation hearing, appellee requested and was denied assistance of counsel, the opportunity to call witnesses in his behalf and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and a written decision stating the evidence relied upon. This denial was also in accordance with the settled practice of the Adult Authority. <em>See </em>In re Tucker, 5 Cal.3d 171, 95 Cal.Rptr. 761, 486 P.2d 657, 666 (1971) (Tobriner, J., dissenting) ; California Assembly Interim Committee on Criminal Procedure, <em>supra, </em>at 4; Comment, <em>supra, </em>10 Santa Clara Law. at 322-23; Van Dyke, <em>supra, </em>59 Calif.L.Rev. at 1221. However, the Adult Authority would have received and considered a written presentation by counsel had one been offered. California Criminal Law Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23.-159.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The recited deficiencies related to issues that were important to the Adult Authority\u2019s determination of whether to continue appellee on parole, as his parole officer recommended, or to revoke his parole, refix his sentence at the maximum, and return him to prison. The procedures followed by the Adult Authority in this case were not designed to be, and were not, effective to expose the critical factual issues and enable the Adult Authority to obtain the information required for their proper resolution without the assistance of counsel. The failure to provide such assistance therefore violated due process. M\u2019Clary v. California Adult Authority, 466 F.2d 1122 (9th Cir. 1972); Griffin v. California Adult Authority, 464 F.2d 602 (9th Cir. 1972); Dennis v. California Adult Authority, 456 F.2d 1240 (9th Cir. 1972); Wilburn v. Nelson, 458 F.2d 502 (9th Cir. 1972). <em>See also </em>Bearden v. South Carolina, 443 F.2d 1090, 1094-1095 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Appellee also contends that he was denied due process because he was denied the opportunity to present favorable witnesses and to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and because the Board failed to render a written decision stating the evidence relied upon. The district court expressly withheld ruling on these issues. 323 F.Supp. at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The Supreme Court recently held that each of these procedural protections must be afforded a parolee before his parole may be revoked. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). \u201cIn our view, however, <em>Morrissey </em>is not to be applied retroactively.\u201d M\u2019Clary v. California Adult Authority, <em>supra, </em>466 F.2d at 1124. It will apply, of course, to any new revocation hearing held pursuant to the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\">. The district court\u2019s decision was based upon the petition and the response to order to show cause, both of which were supported by attached exhibits. In substance the court\u2019s order constituted a grant of summary judgment. Appellants have not contested the factual assumptions reflected in the district court\u2019s opinion, upon which we rely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
