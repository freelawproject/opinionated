He was sentenced to serve five years in Alabama state prisons. He has now filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, claiming that the State\u2019s failure to provide him with a free transcript of his preliminary hearing constituted a violation of due process of law and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. He unsuccessfully sought similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>relief in a petition for writ of mandamus filed in the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and in a petition for a writ of certiorari filed in the Supreme Court of Alabama successively. His appeal on the merits from his conviction is presently pending and undecided in the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. The District Court correctly held that he had failed to exhaust state remedies. The judgment is affirmed. See Williams v. Bailey, 5 Cir., 1972, 247 F.2d 463 which decided the same issue adversely to appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b615-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12), the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
