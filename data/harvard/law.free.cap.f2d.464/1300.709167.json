Tenney, Judge, 331 F.Supp. 945, enjoining defendants from reducing the scope or extent of care in the New York State Medicaid program by implementing Chapters 113 and 131 of the Laws- of 1971 and Administrative Letters No. 71-PWD-17 and No. 71-PWD-19 unless and until such reductions were approved by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare pursuant to \u00a7 1902(d) of the Social Security Act. The court is advised that such reductions were so approved on September 15, 1971, subject to the State\u2019s performing the commitments for implementation of its plan made to HEW. The case is therefore remanded to the District Court with instructions to vacate the temporary injunction and to dismiss the complaint as moot. In light of this disposition this court has no occasion to pass upon the correctness of Judge Tenney\u2019s holding with respect to jurisdiction. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
