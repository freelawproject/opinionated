After having exhausted his state remedies, Commonwealth v. Marino, 213 Pa. Super. 88, 245 A.2d 868 (1969); Commonwealth v. Marino, 435 Pa. 245, 255 A.2d 911 (1969), appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The only issue presented in that petition was whether a pretrial voice identification procedure was so \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to be violative of due process. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 302, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1969). After an evidentiary hearing was held, the petition was denied, 328 F.Supp. 1154. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-22\"> Judge Fullam\u2019s conclusion that the voice identification procedure did not, in fact, violate due process, was based on his extensive findings of fact concerning the circumstances in which the procedure occurred. Our standard of review of those findings is carefully circumscribed and the District Court\u2019s factual determinations will not be set aside unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d See Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 52(a), United States v. Archie, 452 F.2d 897 (3d Cir. 1971); Andrews v. Chemical Carriers, 457 F.2d 636 (3d Cir. 1971). After a careful review of the record we believe that the pertinent findings of fact were not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and on the basis of those facts, agree with Judge Fullam that the voice identification procedure did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-23\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
