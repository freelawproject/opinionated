Beto, 5 Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 816 and Harrison v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 633. The appeal from that order is therefore summarily dismissed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without prejudice to reasserting all points therein involved in any proceeding instituted in the Federal Court subsequent to the action of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-24\">In the telephone and oral conferences with both counsel, the Attorney General of Texas agreed with our reading of the order-opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals that since the Federal proceedings have now been terminated by the District Court\u2019s order of July 14, 1972 (and the present dismissal of the appeal therefrom) the Court of Criminal Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>peals will now review the merits of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims on the present record, including that made on the post-conviction hearing before the Texas State Trial Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Of course the rule of comity contemplates that the state court entertaining constitutional claims will act with dispatch. This Court is confident that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals recognizes this and will decide petitioner\u2019s appeal without any undue delay. On such expectations in these circumstances comity dictates that the Federal appeal be dismissed. We therefore decline to enlarge petitioner on bail and remit his cause to a determination by the Courts of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">This order is without prejudice to petitioner\u2019s filing appropriate new proceedings in the Federal District Court if the remedies available in the Texas Courts do not assure an adequate and prompt determination of petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims. 28 U.S.C.A; \u00a7 2254(b); Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Bail pending appeal denied. Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-16\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this case summarily. See Groendyke Transportation, Inc. v. Davis, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1158.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
