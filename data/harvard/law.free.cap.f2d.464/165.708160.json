We remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">On February 6, 1970, this Court decided the first appeal in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Black v. Curb, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 656. In 1965 black residents of Hale County, Alabama, brought a class action in the district court against the county jury commissioners. The plaintiffs alleged systematic exclusion of blacks from the county jury rolls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court found \u201ca pattern and practice of exclusion of Negroes from jury service\u201d and ordered relief. Black v. Curb, S.D.Ala., 1966, 261 F.Supp. 542. The district court eventually approved a jury list with 17.9 percent blacks, although, at the time, blacks constituted 62 percent of the eligible population. This Court, on appeal, disapproved the jury list and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">On September 23, 1970, after informal attempts to carry out this Court\u2019s mandate had failed, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court seeking further relief. On November 5, 1970, the district court issued an order enjoining the defendant \u201cfrom engaging in any act or practice which involves or results in discrimination by reason of race or color in the selection of jurors for jury service in Hale County, Alabama\u201d, and outlining procedures for jury selection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order included a provision allowing plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to inspect and copy all records, but it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>provide that the reports required by the order should be served on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On May 21, 1971, the district court issued an order approving the previously filed jury list. No hearing was held prior to this approval. And the plaintiffs never received a copy of the list prior to its approval by the court. The population of Hale County, Alabama, is approximately 69 percent black;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 60 percent of those adults eligible for jury service under Alabama law are black.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury list, as approved, contained the names of 1305 persons of whom 460 or 35 percent are black.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Alabama\u2019s jury selection procedure is governed by statute. Ala.Code, Title 30, \u00a7 1 et seq. (1958 and 1969 Supp.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Governor appoints a three-member jury commission from each county. \u00a7\u00a7 8-10. The commission employs a clerk who is charged with the duty to \u201cscan the [voter] registration lists, the lists returned to the tax assessor, any city directories, telephone directories and any and every other source of information from which he may obtain information, and to visit every precinct at least once a year\u201d in order to obtain a list \u201cof every citizen of the county over twenty-one and under sixty-five years of age and their occupation, place of residence and place of business\u201d. \u00a7\u00a7 15-19, 24. From this list, the jury commission compiles a list of eligible, non-exempt jurors and a jury box for use by the judges. \u00a7\u00a7 20-24. The jurors may not be under twenty-one years of age, \u201can habitual drunkard\u201d, unfit because \u201cafflicted with a permanent disease or physical weakness\u201d, \u201cconvicted of an offense involving moral turpitude\u201d, unable to read English (unless a freeholder or householder), or over sixty-five years of age (unless \u201cwilling\u201d to serve).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u00a7 21. In addition, the jurors must be \u201ccitizens of the county who are generally reputed to be honest and intelligent men and are esteemed in the community for their integrity, good character and sound judgment\u201d. \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">It has long been settled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the systematic exclusion of blacks from jury service. \u201c[Discriminating in the selection of jurors . . . against negroes because of their color, amounts to a denial of equal protection of the laws . . . \u201d . Strauder v. West Virginia, 1880, 100 U. S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664, 666. <em>See </em>Ex parte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Virginia, 1880, 100 U.S. 313, 25 L.Ed. 667; Patton v.

Jury Commission of Greene County, 1970, 396 U.S. 320, 90 S.Ct. 518, 24 L.Ed.2d 549 and cases cited in footnotes 8-10; Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (April 3, 1972). Although \u201cneither the jury roll nor the venire need be a perfect mirror of the community or accurately reflect the proportionate strength of every identifiable group\u201d, Swain v. Alabama, 1965, 380 U.S. 202, 208, 85 S.Ct. 824, 829, 13 L.Ed.2d 759, \u201ctoken summoning of Negroes for jury service does not comply with equal protection\u201d, Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 471, 73 S.Ct. 397, 414, 97 L.Ed. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Disproportionate statistics\u2014 black population as against black jurors \u2014constitute \u201ca prima facie case of purposeful discrimination\u201d. Whitus v. Georgia, 1967, 385 U.S. 545, 551, 87 S. Ct. 643, 647, 17 L.Ed.2d 599, 604. <em>See also </em>Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (April 3, 1972); Turner v. Fouche, 1970, 396 U.S. 346, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567. \u201cOnce a prima facie case of invidious discrimination is established, the burden of proof shifts to the State to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by showing that permissible racially neutral selection criteria and procedures have produced the monochromatic result\u201d. Alexander v. Louisiana, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 1226 (April 3, 1972). <em>See also </em>Turner v. Fouche, 1970, 396 U.S. 346, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567; Whitus v. Georgia, 1967, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599. The plaintiffs may, of course, answer the State\u2019s rebuttal by establishing that the state officials applied different standards or that excluded individuals possessed requisite qualifications. <em>See </em>Swain v. Alabama, 1965, 380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L. Ed.2d 759. <em>See generally </em>our previous discussion in Black v. Curb, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In the present case, the figures speak eloquently. While approximately 60 percent of the eligible adults are black, only 35 percent of those on the jury list are black. The figures are more disproportionate than in Turner v. Fouche, <em>supra </em>(60%-37%) or Carter v. Jury Commission of Greene County, <em>supra </em>(65%-32%).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The prima facie statistical showing in the present case shifts the burden to the State to \u201cexplain the disparity or establish that the excluded persons are not qualified\u201d. Black v. Curb, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 656, 659. In the present case, the district judge incorrectly placed the burden of proof. By not holding a hearing before approving the list submitted by the jury commissioners, the district judge accepted the commissioners\u2019 reasons for disqualifying voters as presumptively correct. In view of the prima facie case of discrimination based on the statistics, the burden is, however, properly <em>on the State </em>to justify the disqualification of the large number of blacks as eligible voters. We must remand the case to the district court for a hearing at which the State must sustain its burden of proof. If practicable, the plaintiffs must be provided, in advance, with copies of lists used by the commissioners (or if this is impracticable, given access to lists) to facilitate rebuttal of the State\u2019s proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">One additional comment is in order. The jury commissioners disqualified six hundred and fifty-three potential jurors because they were \u201cunknown\u201d to members of the jury commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Of these, 80 percent were black. In view of the commissioners\u2019 duty to fill the jury rolls with \u201call citizens of the county\u201d who possess the requisite qualifications, Alabama Code, Title 30 \u00a7 21 (1969 Supp.), the commissioners have an affirmative duty to inquire into the eligibility of those citizens unknown to them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">In the face of the commissioners\u2019 unfamiliarity with Negroes in the community and the informality of the arrangement by which they sought to remedy the deficiency in their knowledge upon recompiling the jury list, we cannot assume that inquiry would not have led to the discovery of many qualified Negroes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Turner v. Fouche, <em>supra, </em>396 U.S. at 360, 90 S.Ct. at 540. <em>See also </em>Whitus v. Georgia, 1967, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599; Cassell v.

Clayton, 5 Cir. 1966, 359 F.2d 13. \u201c[AJffirmations of good faith in making individual selections are insufficient to dispel a prima facie case of systematic exclusion\u201d. Alexander v. Louisiana, 92 S.Ct. 1226. <em>See also </em>Turner v. Fouche, <em>supra, </em>396 U.S. at 361, 90 S.Ct. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The order of the district court approving the jury list is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">.
