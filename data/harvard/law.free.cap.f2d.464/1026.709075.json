Finding no clear error in the ruling below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-26\">In the district court, Durham sought $90,000 for accident compensation and back pay arising out of an alleged injury which resulted from his work assignment in the prison's Basket Shop. He claimed that his back was injured sometime between November 16, 1970, and November 20, 1970, when he lifted a 235 pound sewing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-27\">After correctly concluding that Durham had the right to seek judicial review from the FPI\u2019s denial of his claim (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 702, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 1967, 387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681), the district court held that \u201cin the absence of a showing that the FPI rendered its decision in disregard of compelling medical evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>dence, its decision must stand.\u201d 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">On the basis of all the medical reports filed in response to the complaint, and Durham\u2019s failure to produce any objective proof of an injury resulting from his industrial work assignment, the district court did not err in its denial of relief under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301. The denial of Durham\u2019s claim for back wages was similarly proper since the record shows that Durham\u2019s own pleadings belie his contention that he has not been paid his industrial wage during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
