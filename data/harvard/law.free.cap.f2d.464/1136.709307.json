In late 1958 and early 1959, Exchange financed several ventures of Edmund Cantillon and Alvin Rabalais, who were in the business of developing real property, mostly in Orange County, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-27\">Cantillon and Rabalais operated via different legal entities \u2014 sometimes as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>co-partnership under the name, West-port Development Co. (Westport), sometimes through either of two corporations, Associate. Fundings, Inc. (Associate) or Brentwood Downs, Inc. (Brent-wood). They negotiated an arrangement with Farrell whereby Exchange would loan funds at 10% interest to one or more of the Cantillon-Rabalais legal entities, with trust deeds as security. In addition, Farrell personally was to receive 50% of the net profits on each tract financed by Exchange. During 1958 and 1959, Exchange financed development of seven tracts under this arrangement. In every situation, the secured loan with 10% interest was set forth in one document and the agreement to share profits with Farrell was set forth in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">On December 18, 1960, Exchange was adjudicated bankrupt. In July 1961, Cantillon and Rabalais filed with the bankruptcy referee two claims related to loans on two of the seven tracts. On July 29, 1966, the trustees, after acquiring both Farrell\u2019s and Exchange\u2019s interests,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a counterclaim, praying that the referee dissolve the Cantillon-Rabalais \u201cjoint ventures\u201d with Farrell and order payment to the trustees of 50% of the profits earned on the five tracts which were not included in the claims filed by Cantillon and Rabalais. Based upon certain documents, an audit of the profits on the five tracts and a stipulation of facts, the referee ordered the joint ventures to be dissolved and ordered Westport, Associate and Brent-wood to turn over 50% of the net profits on the tracts. The district judge affirmed the order and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-9\">I. <em>Filing Claims as a Basis for Summary Jurisdiction on Counterclaim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">The trustees contend that the referee correctly exercised summary jurisdiction over their counterclaim, based upon Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966), wherein the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe [Bankruptcy] Act does confer summary jurisdiction to compel a claimant to surrender preferences that under \u00a7 57, sub. g would require disallowance of the claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 335, 86 S.Ct. 476. The trustees would have us interpret <em>Katchen </em>broadly to confer summary jurisdiction to determine counterclaims based on transactions which are separate<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the subject matter of creditors\u2019 claims. We decline to interpret <em>Katchen </em>in such a broad manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">The Court emphasized in <em>Katchen </em>that an objection to a claim under \u00a7 57g is \u201cpart and parcel of the allowance process\u201d 382 U.S. at 330, 86 S.Ct. at 473, and as such subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy referee. Also, as \u201cpart of the process of allowance and disallowance of claims, it is triable in equity.\u201d 382 U.S. at 336, 86 S.Ct. at 476, and thus no right to jury trial exists.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>After a review of the language of the Bankruptcy Act and the underlying policies, we believe that the referee had no jurisdiction over a counterclaim, unrelated to the transaction upon which a creditor\u2019s claim is based. The Act does not make counterclaims a subject of objection to a claim. In Peters v. Lines, 275 F.2d 919 (9th Cir. 1960), this circuit ruled that the filing of a claim constitutes a consent to summary jurisdiction of the referee and enables the referee to render affirmative relief on a trustee\u2019s counterclaim arising out of the same transaction as a claim submitted by the creditor. Settlement of the transaction itself had already been tendered to the referee. Thus, in \u201csubmitting one side of a controversy for resolution logic dictates that the entire controversy should be open for resolution.\u201d 275 F.2d at 925. The distinction between such a ease and an unconnected counterclaim was carefully noted. 275 F.2d at 925, fn. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">The trustees have not persuaded us that <em>Katchen </em>requires that we abandon the distinction we established in <em>Peters. </em>That the referee lacked jurisdiction over the trustees\u2019 counterclaim may be expressed in affirmative terms: Cantillon and Rabalais, i. e., their legal entities, had a right to have their interests in the dispute (stemming from the five unrelated transactions) adjudicated in a plenary action rather than in a bankruptcy proceeding. <em>See </em>2 Collier on Bankruptcy jf23.08[l], pp. 530-531. Therefore, we hold that the bankruptcy referee did not have summary jurisdiction over the trustees\u2019 application for dissolution of the Cantillon-Rabalais joint ventures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Financing of these five tracts was separate from the transaction that constituted the subject matter of the Cantillon-R\u00e1balais claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">II. <em>Consent to Summary Jurisdiction by Waiver of Right to Object.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-10\">Ordinarily, a challenge to summary jurisdiction in bankruptcy must be asserted by a creditor to the referee at an early stage in the proceedings. Otherwise, the creditor is deemed to have waived the right; he is deemed to have consented to the summary jurisdiction. <em>See 2 </em>Collier on Bankruptcy, jf 23.-08 [4], pp. 536-547.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-11\">Section 2, sub. a(7) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 11(a) (7), the source of the consent jurisdiction, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-12\">\u201c. . . and where in a controversy arising in a proceeding under this Act an adverse party does not interpose objection to the summary jurisdiction of the court of bankruptcy, by answer or motion filed before the expiration of the time prescribed by law or rule of court or fixed or extended by order of court for the filing of an answer to the petition, motion or other pleading to which he is adverse, he shall be deemed to have consented to such jurisdiction;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-14\">The trustees contend that Cantillon and Rabalais waived this right by failing to object to summary jurisdiction in a timely manner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-15\">On October 7, 1966, at the request of the trustees, the referee in bankruptcy held a hearing to \u201cpre-try\u201d the controversy and \u201cnarrow the issues.\u201d. At that time, counsel for Cantillon and Rabalais filed an answer which raised several defenses not including lack of summary jurisdiction. However, counsel made oral objection to the jurisdiction of the referee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An amended answer was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>on February 8, 1967, raising the additional defense of lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Rule 12(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that all defenses \u2014 including lack of personal jurisdiction \u2014 not raised by preliminary motion or by answer are waived, with certain exceptions not applicable here. The waiver rule is modified by liberal allowances for leave to amend under Rule 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">Fairly read, we believe that the colloquy quoted in the margin indicates that the referee granted leave to amend, when counsel for Cantillon and Rabalais orally objected to summary jurisdiction at the pretrial hearing. However, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to bankruptcy proceedings only insofar as they do not contradict other special bankruptcy rules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is therefore necessary to examine what has historically been a very thorny problem for bankruptcy practitioners, the courts and Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-16\">Congress adopted \u00a7 2, sub. a(7) of the Bankruptcy Act in 1952 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in order to modify the rule of Cline v. Kaplan, 323 U.S. 97, 65 S.Ct. 155, 89 L.Ed. 97 (1944), that an adverse party could object to the summary jurisdiction of a bankruptcy referee so long as the objection was \u201cformal\u201d and was made at any time before the entry of a final order in the proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-17\">The trustees contend that Cantillon and Rabalais waived the right to object to summary jurisdiction because they did not comply with Local Bankruptcy Rule 203 of the United States District Court (C.D.Cal.), which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-18\">\u201cA respondent desiring to contest a summary proceeding against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>shall serve and file not less than two (2) days before the hearing a written answer, objection or other responsive pleading which shall be verified if it sets up matters of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">We are thus faced with the issue of whether the local rule\u2019s requirement of a written objection is subject to leave to amend. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 2, sub. a(7) clearly indicates that Congress passed the provision to deter forum shopping by adverse claimants, by requiring that an objection to summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy referee be made in an explicit .manner at an early stage in the proceedings. The section specifically states that the time for a written objection may be \u201cextended by order of the court.\u201d This authorizes the bankruptcy referee to grant leave to amend when an oral objection is so made as to leave little doubt about the basis of the objection and at a time when the opposing party has not incurred substantial costs by proceeding in more than one forum. <em>Accord: </em>In re Perspectron, Inc., 422 F.2d 576 (7th Cir. 1970); Cf. Hall v. Goggin, 148 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1945); 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, 23.-08 [4] p. 546, n. 53. Compare Honeyman v. Hughes, 156 F.2d 27 (9th Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">Here, counsel for Cantillon and Rabalais made his oral objection to summary jurisdiction at a pretrial hearing only minutes after filing an answer which did not raise the objection. The objection was just as timely as if it had been in the answer. The trustees were not misled. Leave to amend was wholly appropriate in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">In sum, the bankruptcy referee did not have summary jurisdiction over the legal entities of Messrs. Cantillon and Rabalais. The trustees\u2019 counterclaim stemming from separate transactions was not within the referee\u2019s jurisdiction, and the creditors raised this defense in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">. In November, 1962, trustees for Exchange acquired Farrell\u2019s interest in 50% of the profits of the ventures. This was the result of a compromise of a controversy between the trustees on the one hand and Farrell, his wife and various Farrell entities on the other hand. The controversy was also occasioned by the divorce of Farrell and his wife. The agreement was embodied in an order of compromise, which consolidated the holdings of Farrell and Exchange under the auspices of the trustees in bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">. Although the contracts for each tract were identical and later ones were routinely executed without further negotiation, the referee found that the parties treated the financing for each tract as a separate transaction. The determination is not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and we abide by it in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1192-13\">. The Supreme Court did not consider in <em>Katchen </em>the issue presented by the instant case. At the court of appeals level, the Tenth Circuit ruled that a bankruptcy referee does not have jurisdiction to hear counterclaims arising out of separate transactions. Katchen v. Landy, 336 F. 2d 535 (10th Cir. 1964). Unfortunately, the trustee did not appeal this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 decision. Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 326, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">.

We are certainly objecting to the \u2014 you pointed out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>that it hasn\u2019t been pleaded.

It will save an awful lot of trouble; and all of this is without prejudice to your objection to jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1194-12\">.
