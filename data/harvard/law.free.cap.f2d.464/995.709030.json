Benefit payments for Merry Lou were terminated as a consequence of her marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>on June 11, 1960, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(D), and for Arlee on her becoming eighteen in December, 1963. In consequence of an automobile accident in 1964, Mrs. Mills, who had theretofore been gainfully employed, suffered a nearly total loss of vision and a crippling leg injury which rendered her unemployable and entitled her to disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. Eligibility for these benefits has never been at issue. The payments for Gloria were technically terminated in April 1968 on her becoming 18, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(E) and (g)(1). However, when the Administration determined that Gloria was a full-time student, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(E), benefits were immediately reinstituted without any period of non-receipt. Later Mrs. Mills sought reconsideration of Gloria\u2019s entitlement to survivor\u2019s benefits, without regard to age or student status, on the basis of disability due to mental retardation. She was notified on August 6, 1969 of favorable reconsideration of Gloria\u2019s claim, and on September 19 that this entitled her to mother\u2019s payments for having a disabled adult child in her care. She was sent a check covering the latter item for the 16 months beginning April 1968, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(s) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">On July 11, 1969, Gloria married a man who also was mentally retarded and was consequently unemployable. Mrs. Mills\u2019 complaint alleged that she then contacted the Ithaca, N. Y., branch of the Social Security Administration to inquire whether Gloria\u2019s marriage would affect the payments being received and was informed that it would not so long as Gloria\u2019s husband was <em>not </em>also receiving Social Security Benefits. Allegedly also Mrs. Mills continued to apply the payments in respect of Gloria for the latter\u2019s use and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">On February 15, 1971, Mrs. Mills received a letter from the Social Security Administration that she would receive no further disability payments until April 1973, since a large overpayment of other benefits had to be recouped. Although the complaint reads as if this notice were a bolt from the blue and appellant\u2019s brief on appeal maintains that it was the \u201cfirst indication to Mrs. Mills that her benefits were to be suspended,\u201d the affidavit submitted on behalf of the defendant indicates that it was the end result of fruitless correspondence stretching over 18 months. Having learned of Gloria\u2019s marriage, the Ithaca District Office wrote Mrs. Mills on August 26, 1969, that this would terminate both the child\u2019s survivors benefits and mother\u2019s insurance benefits unless Gloria had married someone who <em>was </em>receiving Social Security benefits, 42' U.S. C. \u00a7 402(d)(5), (g)(1); it asked that, if Gloria had not married someone entitled to such benefits, the August 3, 1969 check be returned and said that if it was not, the office might have to suspend Mrs. Mills\u2019 benefits. Mrs. Mills answered that she had not received a check since June 3, and had been told that Gloria\u2019s benefits were terminated. In fact, due partially to a lack of coordination with the New York payment center, the payments continued (save for Gloria\u2019s July, 1969 payment) for a considerable time. In August, 1970, Mrs. Mills was notified that she had thus received an overpayment of $2,053.20, which she was required to refund unless she could bring herself within 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b), which provides there shall be no adjustment of payments in the case of \u201cany person <em>who is without fault </em>if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience\u201d (emphasis supplied), and the regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4\u00d34.506-.515, which the Secretary had issued to implement this. Although Mrs. Mills did not respond, the Ithaca District Office sought to elicit facts that might support her retention of the payments ; the County Welfare Department informed it that Mrs. Mills had not turned over any social security benefit cheeks to Gloria (who apparently was receiving welfare payments) and that Mrs. Mills had told the Welfare Department she was receiving only $118.80 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>month from the Social Security Administration, this being her own disability payment. In the absence of any communication from Mrs. Mills showing entitlement to the relief provision of \u00a7 404(b), the Social Security Administration finally wrote the letter of February 11, 1971, availing itself of the rights to recover overpayment provided in \u00a7 404(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The Administration\u2019s letter precipitated this action. The complaint, filed on April 29, 1971, began by announcing that it was a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Social Security Administration\u2019s procedures for recouping alleged prior over-payments of Title II benefits \u201cto plaintiff and all other persons similarly situated without giving notice of the grounds upon which said adjustments or suspensions are proposed or the opportunity for plaintiffs to be heard prior to the time a decision is made to make such adjustments or suspensions.\u201d The complaint went on to allege many of the facts recited above. It also claimed that \u201cAt no time was plaintiff given an opportunity to be heard prior to defendant\u2019s ex parte decisions that overpayments had been made to her and her daughter and that said overpayments should be recouped by suspending her disability benefits for two years\u201d and that \u201cAt no time did defendant inform plaintiff of the manner in which she might seek review\u201d of that decision or the grounds thereof. After reciting that Mrs. Mills\u2019 only income (apart from the then suspended disability payments) was $129 per month under the federal category of Aid to the Disabled from the New York Department of Social Services, the complaint elaborated its class action theory. The class was now stated to be \u201call those persons who receive Old Age Survivors and Disability Payments under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq., and who are subject to a summary suspension, modification or adjustment in said payments without notice or an opportunity for a due process hearing prior to such determination affecting such payments.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There followed a statement of the constitutional claims and requests for a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 and injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Prior to January 14, 1971, the Social Security Administration\u2019s procedures did not require that an overpaid beneficiary be notified of the waiver provisions of the statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b), if the files conclusively established that the beneficiary <em>was </em>with fault in receiving the overpayments. On that date the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration approved procedures with respect to notices of termination and reduction or suspension of benefits which removed the above qualification from the recoupment process and made other substantive modifications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These new procedures, reflected in the current Social Security Administration Claims Manual, provide that when it is determined that an incorrect payment has been made, the person liable should be given a written notice stating:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-10\">(1) The incorrect payment made, how, and when it occurred. (If the overpayment resulted from the entitlement of another beneficiary, the adversely affected individual (s) must be informed of the name, relationship to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>the WE, and basis for entitlement of the new beneficiary.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-4\">(2) The right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-5\">(3) The required recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-6\">(4) The proposed adjustment or the demand for repayment where adjustment is not possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-7\">(5) The waiver provisions of the law (Social Security Act, secs. 204(b) or 1870(c)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-8\">(6) The availability of partial adjustment or partial refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-9\">(7) The need to notify the DO promptly if he feels that the circumstances in his case would justify waiver, partial adjustment, or partial refund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">The revised Manual also provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-11\">Before we start to adjust the overpayment against the benefits due a beneficiary, he or his payee will normally be given reasonable opportunity to contest the correctness of the determination or to establish that a basis exists for waiver or partial adjustment. The notice to the beneficiary will advise him that adjustment will be deferred 30 days. However, actual adjustment may at the discretion of the reviewing office be extended to a longer period when the facts in a given case, including but not limited to time case is being worked, cutoff dates, mailing time, etc., indicate that a 30-day period would be inadequate for consideration of the matter and reply by the beneficiary and reviewing office processing time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">Beyond this, the Manual states: <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-13\">If the person responds raising some question about the correctness of the determination of overpayment, or raises a' question about recovery, waiver or partial adjustment, the DO will obtain the necessary evidence and prepare a recommendation to the reviewing office for disposing of the case. <em>Thus, if the person liable requests reconsideration of the substantive determination and, it appears that the determination will be affirmed, the DO will develop the possibility of waiver of adjustment or recovery of the overpayment at the same time it receives evidence to resolve the request for reconsideration. This is necessary since, if the substantive determination is affirmed the Reconsideration Determination will cover both issues </em>(\u00a7 8737).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-16\">Where reconsideration of the overpayment determination, waiver, or partial adjustment development is initiated, withholding to recoup the overpayment will be further deferred and payment will be continued until development has been completed, if the beneficiary is otherwise entitled to benefits. If development will not be completed before the expiration of the 30-day period, the DO will utilize teletype to advise the reviewing office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-17\">[Wjhere the beneficiary did not respond until after the deferral period, if the beneficiary requests either waiver, partial adjustment, or reconsideration of the overpayment determination and benefits are otherwise payable, the DO will immediately notify the reviewing office to initiate payment of benefits effective with- the current operating month until such time as the issue has been resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6F\">The Manual contains various other compassionate provisions too numerous to mention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-18\">The Government also advises us that a determination of overpayment and inapplicability of the waiver provision is considered to be an initial determination, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.905(b) (4) (1971). This is reviewable initially by reconsideration, \u00a7\u00a7 404.909 and 404.910. If that should be adverse, a claimant may request an evidentiary hearing before an examiner, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.915, 404.917, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>with review by the Appeals Council, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.945, and ultimate review in a district court, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Procedures subsequent to adverse determination on reconsideration, including any requested oral hearing, will normally be after effectuation of the recoupment begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">In light of the new procedures and the fact that, in violation of them, Mrs. Mills was improperly denied notice of her right to request reconsideration, the Administration informed her on June 10, 1971 that her disability benefits were being restored; that a check for $363.70, representing benefits through May, would be sent shortly and checks would be sent monthly thereafter; that an investigation in regard to the overpayment would be undertaken; and that she should cooperate with a representative of the Social Security Administration when contacted. She also was encouraged to telephone or visit the district office of the Administration if she had any questions. The $363.70 check was received and disability payments were resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Upon this record Judge Port dismissed the complaint on the ground that the ease was moot. We have no reason to doubt that on the facts then before him, he was correct in not proceeding with the ease. Not only had the plaintiff been promised the return of the withheld payments, but the issue of waiver of recoupment was to be re-examined under the new procedures. <em>Cf. </em>Richardson v. Wright, 405 U.S. 208, 92 S.Ct. 788, 31 L.Ed.2d 151 (1972). However, a development which was brought to our attention after the appeal was argued in this court has materially changed the situation in that regard. On June 5, 1972, the Social Security Administration wrote Mrs. Mills of the result of its reconsideration. After recomputing the overpayment as $1,950.60 rather than $2,053.20, the Administration found that it could not determine that Mrs. Mills was not at fault since the August 26, 1969, letter placed her on clear notice that Gloria\u2019s marriage to someone not receiving social security benefits terminated both Gloria\u2019s entitlement to survivor\u2019s benefits and Mrs. Mills\u2019 own entitlement as mother of a disabled child in her care; despite this, Mrs. Mills had refused to comply with the request for return of the August 3 check and had continued to receive cheeks to which she should have known she was not entitled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">Our request for a response from the Government produced a rather unenlightening letter stating that whereas \u201crecoupments would ordinarily be initiated immediately following such an adverse reconsideration,\u201d nevertheless \u201cbecause of the pendency of plaintiff\u2019s appeal in this Court and in deference to the Court\u2019s current consideration of the appeal,\u201d the Department of Justice had \u201cadvised the Social Security Administration against placing the recoupments in effect pending disposition of the present appeal.\u201d If we read this aright, it means that should we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal, recoupment, in some form, would commence prior to any evidentiary hearing which Mrs. Mills might request. That being so, the case is no longer moot, see United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). Accordingly, we vacate the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings. In doing this, we think it not amiss to make some observations, arising from our study of the case, which may be of assistance to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">The first is that, under William Jameson &amp; Co. v. Morgenthau, 307 U.S. 171, 173-174, 59 S.Ct. 804, 83 L.Ed. 1189 (1939) and Sardino v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 361 F.2d 106, 114-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>116 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 898, 87 S.Ct. 203, 17 L.Ed.2d 130 (1966), we do not believe this to be a case requiring the convocation of a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282. Although plaintiff does challenge the constitutionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404 with respect to recovery or adjustment of overpayments, the statute itself is silent on how the Secretary shall proceed to make the finding of overpayment, and the only theory of constitutional invalidity is that it fails to provide specifically for an evidentiary hearing prior to the initiation of recoupment. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is directed essentially at the failure of the regulations issued under the authority of 42' U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) to provide for an evidentiary hearing in advance of recoupment, as Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed. 2d 287 (1970), allegedly requires.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">A second observation is that the <em>Goldberg </em>doctrine applies only \u201cwhere important decisions turn on questions of fact.\u201d 397 U.S. at 269, 90 S.Ct. at 1021. So far as now appears, there is here no question of fact with respect to the overpayments; the only issue concerning which there may be such a question is whether Mrs. Mills was disqualified by \u201cfault\u201d from the benefits of the waiver provision of \u00a7 404(b). Even as to that, we doubt that the principle of <em>Goldberg </em>would require the Social Security Administration to hold an evidentiary hearing under circumstances where summary judgment would be appropriate in a civil action because of failure to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\u201d F.R. Civ.P. 56(e). Even accepting the allegation of the complaint as to what Mrs. Mills was told when she contacted the Ithaca office in July, 1969, this may well be such a case in light of the subsequent notifications. Indeed, we might be disposed so to decide except for our doubt, see fn. 1, <em>supra, </em>whether plaintiff was sufficiently apprised that defendant was seeking dismissal on the merits. Finally, we must add with regret, the plaintiff may be facing an insuperable obstacle in the requirement of a $10,000 jurisdictional amount, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, unless the action were held to fall under 28 U.S,C. \u00a7 1361.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Clearly Mrs. Mills\u2019 own claim does not meet the jurisdictional amount, and it seems doubtful that, even if the district court were to deem class action designation appropriate under F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), aggregation of the claims of those members of the class against whom recoupment had been initiated for \u201cfault\u201d in the receipt of overpayments would be permissible under Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S. 332, 89 S.Ct. 1053, 22 L.Ed.2d 319 (1969). Of course, Mrs. Mills would face none of these obstacles if she should choose to follow the administrative and judicial review procedures described above; the Administration might well consider a method of recoupment less Draconian than total suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">The order is vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">. The hearing was on plaintiffs motion for the convening of a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 and designation as a class action. The affidavit can be read either as going to the merits, or as a suggestion of mootness, or as both. Plaintiff suggests the latter issue was not raised by the defendant-appellee by motion until the hearing, and there is nothing in the record on appeal which indicates that the plaintiff liad notice, other than defendant\u2019s answer filed on the same day as the hearing, that she faced a possible dismissal on the merits at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">.

Also there was more basis in that case for viewing the constitutional attack as aimed at the statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 425, which specified that the Secretary might suspend disability benefits solely \u201con the basis of information obtained by or submitted to him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1055-12\">.
