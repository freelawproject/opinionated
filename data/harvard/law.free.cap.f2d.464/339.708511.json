Bell, a former officer and director of MCI, was the President of Missile both when the alleged misrepresentation was made and at the time of the sheriff\u2019s auction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>sale. Other claims made by the appellants were grounded upon alleged violations of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The District Court dismissed the action, insofar as it pertained to alleged violations of the federal securities laws in the auction sale transaction, because appellants were neither purchasers nor sellers of the Missile stock. Jurisdiction of the state law claims was retained, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and the diverse residence of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">This interlocutory appeal is from the dismissal of the federal claim. Leave to take the appeal was granted pursuant to the District Court\u2019s certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">I. THE PURCHASER-SELLER LIMITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The District Court\u2019s recognition of the \u201cpurchaser-seller\u201d limitation is here attacked with a two-edged sword. The thrust of the appellants\u2019 argument is that the \u201cpurchaser-seller\u201d requirement, first espoused in Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952), and recently reaffirmed in Iroquois Industries, Inc. v. Syracuse China Corp., 417 F.2d 963 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 909, 90 S.Ct. 2199, 26 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970), has been so eroded by other decisions of the Second Circuit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that it no longer truly represents the correct law, even in that Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Another line of attack is advanced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its brief as amicus curiae. Taking the position that <em>Birnbaum </em>was incorrectly decided in the first instance, the Commission contends that the District Court\u2019s application of the \u201cpurchaser-seller\u201d doctrine to our present case \u201cwas an unduly narrow construction of Rule 10b-5, and that this Court should refuse to follow the <em>Birnbaum, </em>and <em>Iroquois </em>cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">In essence, we are urged to adopt a literal interpretation of the Act and the Rule so that \u201cany person\u201d who alleges that he was injured by reason of a \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,\u201d occurring \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\u201d has standing to maintain an action for damages under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">Upon careful examination, the edges of the sword appear quite dull, and we therefore reject both of the specified arguments. In our view, there has been no erosion of <em>Birnbaum. </em>Rather, the doctrine formulated therein has been interpreted and applied \u201cflexibly, not technically and restrictively,\u201d Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971), thus promoting the Congressional purpose in the enactment of this remedial legislation. <em>See </em>Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967); SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963); Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787, 798 &amp; n.14 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 41, 27 L. Ed.2d 50 (1970). Moreover, while neither Section 10(b) nor Rule 10b-5 expressly requires engrafting a \u201cpurchaser-seller\u201d limitation upon suits brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>thereunder, there are substantial and compelling reasons why standing to sue for money damages under these provisions should be so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Since securities transactions are conducted on a nationwide scale, often without regard for geographical boundaries,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we attach significant importance to the fact that every other Court of Appeals that has considered this issue has adopted the \u201cpurchaser-seller\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet the desirability of national consistency in the interpretation of the federal securities laws is not the principal motivating force behind our adoption of the <em>Birnbaum </em>principle. Rather, it is the compelling logic of the opinions in Iroquois Industries, Inc. v. Syracuse China Corp., 417 F.2d 963 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 909, 90 S.Ct. 2199, 26 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970), and Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1970), that impels us to the same conclusion as that reached by our Brothers in the other Circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">In <em>Iroquois, </em>the Second Circuit reexamined its holding in <em>Birnbaum </em>and reaffirmed, on three grounds, the continuing vitality of the purchaser-seller limitation. First, the court directed its attention to one basis for the <em>Birnbahtm</em>decision \u2014 the expressed purpose of the SEC in enacting Rule 10b-5 \u2014 and concluded that the <em>Birnbaum </em>court was correct in assessing that purpose as affording to <em>sellers </em>the same remedies as were then available only to defrauded <em>purchasers </em>of securities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Next, the <em>Iro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>quois </em>court undertook to illustrate that decisions subsequent to <em>Birnbaum </em>had not relaxed the purchaser-seller rule, but had all adhered to the doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The final basis for retaining the limitation on standing was the court\u2019s recognition of the unquestionably sound principle espoused in Blau v. Lehman, 368 U.S. 403, 413, 82 S.Ct. 451, 457, 7 L.Ed.2d 403 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201cCongress can and might amend [the Act] if the Commission would present to it the policy arguments it has presented to us, but we think that Congress is the proper agency to change an interpretation of the Act unbroken since its passage, if the change is to be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Although this language was directed to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b), we agree with our colleagues of the Second Circuit that it applies with equal force to Section 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Subsequent to <em>Iroquois, </em>the highly persuasive opinion of the Fifth Circuit in Herpich v. Wallace was issued. Judge Ainsworth\u2019s thorough examination of the issue of standing under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \u201cwithin the framework of Article III of the United States Constitution, which restricts federal judicial power to \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018controversies\u2019,\u201d 430 F.2d at 805, resulted in the holding \u201cthat for a plaintiff to establish his standing to maintain a Rule 10b-5 action for damages, he must be a purchaser or seller of the securities involved in connection with the alleged rule violation.\u201d 430 F.2d at 806. The rationale of <em>Herpich </em>therefore adds another dimension to the <em>Birnbaum </em>doctrine \u2014 the purchaser-seller limitation is not only deemed a desirable manner for effectuating the Congressional and administrative purposes to be furthered by the anti-fraud provisions, but it also becomes required as a matter of constitutional necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Neither the appellants nor the Commission offer sufficient rebuttal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>carefully reasoned opinions discussed above. In fact, the only judicial support relied upon by appellants is found in isolated, conclusory statements phrased in the statutory language. Typical examples are the following quotations from the most recent Supreme Court opinion dealing with Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201cSection 10(b) outlaws the use \u2018in connection with the purchase or sale\u2019 of any security of \u2018any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">* * \u2022* \u25a0\u00bb -X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c. . . . Since there was a \u2018sale\u2019 of a security and since fraud was used \u2018in connection with\u2019 it, there is redress under \u00a7 10(b), whatever might be available as a remedy under state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 10, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 168, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971). These statements, standing alone, might seem to support a literalistic approach to the statute. Yet when they are read in context, it becomes apparent that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion lends more credence to our view than to that of the appellants. Throughout the <em>Bankers Life </em>opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas repeatedly emphasized that Manhattan, the claimant there, was to be afforded standing under the Act because of its status as a defrauded \u201cseller\u201d of securities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Of more significance is the fact that the Court explicitly declined to rule on the purchaser-seller question. <em>See id. </em>at 13 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. at 165 n. 10. This express reservation, taken in conjunction with the principle set forth in the above quotation from Blau v. Lehman, <em>supra, </em>provides very solid additional support for our adoption of the <em>Birnbaum </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">Having decided that the District Court correctly concluded that the purchaser-seller limitation applies in our Circuit, we now examine that court\u2019s determination that the appellants did not fall within the protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">II. PLAINTIFFS AS PURCHASERS OR SELLERS</p>\n<p id=\"b398-18\">The question here is whether .the appellants, under their pleading, could have proved any set of facts which would have entitled them to relief by reason of federal law. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed. 2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-19\">The critical factual allegations of the complaint, by which the appellants sought to establish their standing as \u201cpurchasers,\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-20\">\u201cOn or about April 29 and April 30, 1964, in the Central District of California, the defendant, O. M. Bell, represented to [plaintiffs] that the shares of stock of Missile to be sold at public auction on April 30, 1964, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>currently worthless and would in the future be worthless, and that plaintiffs should not bid on and purchase said shares at the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cThe representations so made by the defendant, O. M. Bell, were, in fact, false. The true facts were that the shares of Missile were not worthless then, nor would be worthless in the future, but, to the contrary, Missile was a corporation that had been awarded several contracts prior to April of 1964, and had a backlog of orders to fill and had an extraordinary potential for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201c25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cWhen defendant, O. M. Bell, made said representations, he knew them to be false; such statements were made by him with the intent to defraud and deceive the plaintiffs and to induce the plaintiffs to act in the matter herein alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201c26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\u201cPlaintiffs, at the time said representations were made, were ignorant of their falsity, but believed them to be true. In reliance thereon, plaintiffs were induced to and did refrain from bidding on and purchasing the aforementioned shares; had plaintiffs known the true facts, they would not have taken such action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">These allegations clearly reveal that appellants never actually purchased or sold the Missile stock. Yet that circumstance does not end our inquiry, for under the liberal interpretation that has sometimes attended the application of the <em>Birnbaum </em>doctrine, there have been cases in which standing has been afforded to persons who, even though not actual purchasers or sellers, have been deemed to have the required status. <em>See e. g., </em>Dudley v. Southeastern Factor &amp; Finance Corp., 446 F.2d 303, 306-308 (5th Cir. 1971); Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F.2d 792, 806-810 (5th Cir. 1970); Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787, 797-798 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 91 S. Ct. 41, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970); Commerce Reporting Co. v. Puretec, Inc., 290 F.Supp. 715, 718-719 (S.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">One category in these cases, aptly characterized as enunciating an \u201caborted purchaser-seller doctrine,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> involves transactions that are analogous to the transaction in this case. The similarity is that in each case, the plaintiffs alleged that they had sought to enter a securities transaction as purchasers or sellers, but that the transaction was aborted as a result of the fraud of the defendants; See Opper v. Hancock Secs. Corp., 367 F.2d 157 (2d Cir.), aff\u2019g 250 F.Supp. 668 (S.D.N.Y.1966); Commerce Reporting Co. v. Puretec, Inc., supra; Goodman v. H. Hentz <em>&amp; </em>Co., 265 F.Supp. 440 (N.D.Ill.1967); Stockwell v. Reynolds &amp; Co., 252 F.Supp. 215 (S.D.N.Y. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">While the courts employed varying rationales to arrive at the conclusion that the plaintiffs in these actions qualified as \u201cpurchasers\u201d or \u201csellers\u201d under <em>Birnbaum, </em>there is a common link between the cases which explains the unanimity of the results. This unifying element, lacking in the present ease, is the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties which elevated the plaintiffs to the status of statutory purchasers or sellers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The importance of the plaintiff being a party to a prior agreement to purchase or sell the securities is indicated by the Act itself. In section 3(a) (13) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a) (13), a \u201cpurchase\u201d is defined to \u201cinclude any contract to buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire.\u201d Similarly, in section 3(a) (14), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a) (14), a \u201csale\u201d is deemed to encompass \u201cany contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.\u201d Hence, when the plaintiff enters an agreement to purchase or sell securities, he becomes a statutory purchaser or seller, and thus possesses standing to maintain an action for money damages under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See, e. g., </em>Herpich v. Wallace, <em>supra </em>at 809; Commerce Reporting Co. v. Puretec, Inc., <em>supra </em>at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"> The lack of a prior contractual relationship,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> therefore, is fatal to the contention of the appellants here that they should be afforded standing as \u201cpurchasers\u201d under the rationale of the \u201caborted purchaser-seller\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Another case urged upon us by appellants as support for their view is Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 41, 27 L. Ed.2d 50 (1970). While there is language in <em>Crane </em>paralleling the expressions that we have quoted from the <em>Bankers Life </em>opinion,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we believe that the <em>Crane </em>decision, read in its entirety, conclusively demonstrates that the present appellants can not be considered \u201cpurchasers\u201d or \u201csellers\u201d of the Missile stock. The plaintiff corporation in <em>Crane </em>alleged that its tender offer was defeated by defendants\u2019 manipulation of the market price of the target company\u2019s stock. This allegation is comparable to that wherein the appellants here alleged that they were precluded from purchasing the Missile stock by Bell\u2019s misrepresentation. The <em>Crane </em>court, however, recognizing the validity of the <em>Iroquois </em>decision, did not afford the Crane Company standing as a \u201cpurchaser.\u201d To the contrary, the court held that the <em>Crane </em>plaintiff\u2019s standing under the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 was attributable to its status as a \u201cforced seller\u201d of the securities, relying on the holding to that effect in Vine v. Beneficial Finance Co., 374 F.2d 627 (2d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 970, 88 S.Ct. 463, 19 L. Ed.2d 460 (1968). In this case, however, there is absolutely no basis for application of the \u201cforced seller\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>doctrine,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, as we read <em>Crane, </em>it does not at all support the appellants\u2019 argument that they, as \u201cpurchasers,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> possessed the required standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Since we perceive no possible theory under which the appellants could be regarded as either \u201cpurchasers\u201d or \u201csellers\u201d of the Missile stock, the challenged judgment of the District Court must be, and it hereby is,</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\">. Section 10(b) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of 'interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\"><em>\u00a1f: </em>jj; * jfc ;#!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\">.

Specifically, appellants rely upon the decisions in Mutual Shares Corp. v. Genesco, Inc., 384 F.2d 540 (2d Cir. 1967); A. T. Brod &amp; Co. v. Perlow, 375 F.2d 393 (2d Cir. 1967); Vine v. Beneficial Finance Co., 374 F.2d 627 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 970, 88 S.Ct. 463, 19 L.Ed.2d 460 (1967); and SEC v. Broad-wall Secs., Inc., 240 F.Supp. 962 (S.D. N.Y.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">They also contend that the Second Circuit\u2019s explanation of these decisions in Iroquois Industries, Inc., v. Syracuse China Corp., 417 F.2d 963, 967-969 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 909, 90 S.Ct. 2199, 26 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970), does not resolve this issue because of a subsequent decision of another panel of that court which they view as conflicting with Iroquois.

Loss, Securities Regulation 1469 (1961) ; 6 <em>id. </em>3617 (Supp. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">While not urged upon us by the appellants, we feel compelled to comment upon an interesting aspect of the <em>Birnbaum </em>court\u2019s analysis which apparently was not noticed by the court in <em>Iroquois.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUS\">When it formally adopted Rule 10b-5, the SEO issued the following explanation of its action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afz\">\u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the adoption of a rule prohibiting fraud by any person in connection with the <em>purchase </em>of securities. The previously existing rules against fraud in purchase of securities applied only to brokers and dealers. The new rule closes a loophole in the protections against fraud administered by the Commission by prohibiting individuals or companies from <em>buying </em>securities if they engage in fraud in their <em>purchase.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX3\">SEC Securities and Exchange Act Rel. No. 3230 (1942) (emphasis added) ; <em>see 8 </em>SEC Ann. Report 10 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">The <em>Birnbaum </em>court inferred from this statement of administrative purpose that, in extending the Rule\u2019s <em>prohibitions </em>to \u201cpurchasers,\u201d the SEC intended to afford the available remedies to \u201csellers.\u201d Earlier opinions of our court, while not considering the issue of standing now before us, evince an identical understanding of the Rule\u2019s purpose. <em>See </em>Ellis v. Carter, 291 F.2d 270, 273 (9th Cir. 1961); Matheson v. Armbrust, 284 F.2d 670, 674-675 (9th Cir. 1960); Errion v. Connell, 236 F.2d 447 (9th Cir. 1956); Fratt v. Robinson, 203 F.2d 627 (9th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The <em>Birnbaum </em>court, relying upon its assessment of the SEC\u2019s purpose, thus held that the SE'C intended to limit the class of persons who could avail themselves of the private remedies available under the Rule to \u201cpurchasers\u201d or \u201csellers\u201d of securities. At the time <em>Birnbaum </em>was decided, this holding was wholly reasonable. In light of the express language of the SEC\u2019s explanation of the Rule, quoted above, the court could validly have concluded that the class of prospective defendants was limited to fraudulent \u201cpurchasers\u201d and \u201csellers.\u201d Since the notion that \u201cprivity\u201d was required in private causes of action under the securities laws was viable at that time, <em>see, e. g., </em>Joseph v. Farnsworth Radio &amp; Television Corp., 99 F.Supp. 701, 706-707 (S.D.N.Y. 1951), aff\u2019d per curiam, 198 F.2d 8S3 (2d Cir. 1952), it was logical for the <em>Birnbmim </em>court to conclude that the class of plaintiffs in a Rule 10b-5 action for damages should be similarly limited to defrauded \u201cpurchasers\u201d and \u201csellers.\u201d Certain judicial developments subsequent to <em>Birnbaum, </em>however, preclude us from now assigning the same weight to the quoted SEC Release. It is now clear that a defendant in a private action for damages, in contrast to a plaintiff, need not be a \u201cpurchaser\u201d or \u201cseller\u201d of securities <em>See, e. g., </em>Heit v. Weitzen, 402 F.2d 909, 913 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1740, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969); <em>cf. </em>Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971). In addition, the \u201cprivity\u201d requirement, if it ever existed, has, for all practical purposes, been discarded. <em>See </em>3 L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1767-71 (1961); 6 <em>id. </em>3890-97 (Supp.1969). We have noted the foregoing only to record our view that controlling significance should not be attached to the <em>Birnbmim </em>court\u2019s interpretation of administrative intent insofar as that interpretation may have come from the application of outdated legal doctrines. We think the preferable approach is the historical analysis in Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b397-14\">. <em>See </em>417 F.2d at 967-969. The court\u2019s disposition of this argument serves as the principal ground for our rejection of the identical contention advanced by the appellants here.

An alternative argument made in the District Court was that by virtue of MCI\u2019s ownership of 44% of the stock of Strato Industries, Inc., appellants had standing of \u201cforced sellers\u201d of the Missile stock. In this respect, however, we note that appellants at no time sought to maintain their suit in a derivative capacity, on behalf of Strato.

In the three customer-broker cases, orders to buy or sell securities were placed with the broker by the customer, but the orders were never actually carried out because of the broker\u2019s deception. <em>See </em>Goodman v. H. Hentz &amp; Co., 265 F.Supp. 440 (N.D.Ill.1967); Opper v. Hancock Sec. Corp., 250 F.Supp. 668 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 367 F.2d 157 (2d Cir. 1966); Stockwell v.

Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen, 397 F.2d 727 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"A1c\">The District Court recognized the vitality of the \u201caborted purchaser-seller\u201d cases, and after carefully analyzing the factual situations therein in comparison <em>to the </em>appellants\u2019 factual allegations, found them to be distinguishable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABd\">\u201cbecause in our case there is no certainty that but for defendant\u2019s actions MCI would have been the purchaser of the Missile stock sold at the sheriff\u2019s sale. That was contingent not only on their bidding, but also on their making the highest bid. <em>Plaintiffs were not parties to any agreement to purchase Missile shares. </em>Plaintiffs were not even induced to refrain from accepting an outstanding offer. Plaintiffs here were induced merely to refrain from making a bid at a public auction where, had their bid proved to be the highest made, they would have been able to become purchasers.\u201d (emphasis added) While we agree with the District Court that the claim of the appellants is highly speculative, that circumstance alone could not necessarily deprive them of the opportunity to prove a set of facts entitling them to relief. <em>See </em>Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). The lack of an agreement, however, does distinguish the present case from those decisions which permit aborted purchasers and sellers to maintain an action for damages.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\">. We recognize that the term \u201ccontract\u201d in Sections 3(a) (13) and 3(a) (14) must be given a broad, liberal interpretation. <em>See </em>Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971); Dasho v. Susquehanna Corp., 380 F.2d 262, 266 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 977, 88 S.Ct. 480, 19 L.Ed.2d 470 (1967). Yet however flexibly that word might be construed, there is simply no basis, on the record here, for a conclusion that the appellants were parties to a \u201ccontract\u201d to purchase or sell the Missile stock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b400-17\">. <em>See </em>419 F.2d 797-798.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b401-17\">. In note 9, <em>supra, </em>we noted the appellants\u2019 theory that they could be deemed \u201cforced sellers\u201d of the Missile stock. In rejecting this argument, the District Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">\u201cThis argument fails however because there is no causal connection between Strato\u2019s sale of the Missile shares and defendants\u2019 misrepresetations. Rule 10b-5 protects shareholders induced to sell by the fraud of a third party. However, in the present case Strato sold its shares of Missile not in reliance upon Bell\u2019s misrepresentations, but pursuant to a judicial order of execution of a judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">The District Courts reasoning was not wholly correct. It is now clear that if the alleged misrepresentation had the effect of decreasing the amount Strato received for the Missile shares, Strato, but not its individual shareholders, might state a valid federal claim against the perpetrators of the fraud. <em>See </em>Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 10-13, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-20\">The proper reason for denying MCI standing as a \u201cforced seller\u201d is that it never owned any Missile shares. <em>Com</em>pare Dudley v. Southeastern Factor &amp; Finance Corp., 446 F.2d 303 (5th Cir. 1971); Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 41, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970). Having chosen not to maintain this action in a derivative capacity on behalf of Strato, the actual seller, the appellants cannot now, at this late time, bootstrap themselves into the position of \u201cforced sellers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b401-25\">. AVhile the divergent results in <em>Grane </em>and <em>Iroquois </em>have led some observers to view the eases as conflicting, <em>see e. g., </em>38 U.S.L.W. 1101 (1970); <em>supra </em>note 3, we do not agree with that assessment. We reiterate that the <em>Crane </em>court explicitly adhered to the purchaser-seller rule and distinguished <em>Iroquois </em>by applying the \u201cforced seller\u201d rationale of <em>Vine. </em>More importantly, however, in the context of the instant case, is the circumstance that neither <em>Crane </em>nor <em>Iroquois </em>considered the plaintiffs to be \u201cpurchasers,\u201d even though the plaintiffs in both cases had alleged that the fraudulent practices of the defendants had precluded them from purchasing securities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
