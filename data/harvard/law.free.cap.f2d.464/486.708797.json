Appellants\u2019 complaint was filed May 26, 1971, but no motion for preliminary injunction was filed until August 10, 1971. This was after the site had been selected, after the builder had been selected, after he had purchased the site, after he had secured a building permit, after he had let seven subcontracts, and after substantial work had been done on the site.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The District Judge held hearings on the motion for preliminary injunction and entered an order denying it on September 17, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">On October 14, 1971, appellants filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s conclusion to deny the motion for preliminary injunction and further motions and proceedings were terminated by an order denying temporary injunction and disposing of other motions entered on December 23, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Appellants\u2019 notice of appeal was filed January 14, 1972, but no motion for stay of proceedings or preliminary injunction was ever filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">As of the date of hearing on this appeal on June 2, 1972, the court was advised that the project as to which the restraining order and preliminary injunction were sought has been completed, with the exception of some interior work, which is still proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The thrust of appellants\u2019 brief and oral argument on appeal is that the location of this housing project in a \u201cneighborhood\u201d asserted to be \u201c95% Negro\u201d is a violation of the fair housing standards of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601, 3608(d) (5) (1970), which will be subsequently referred to and quoted in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">The District Judge, taking into account the total housing project proposed by defendant housing authority, which included 48 units to be built in a largely white neighborhood, as well as these 48 units to be built in North Avondale, found an insufficient showing on appellants\u2019 part of such violations of the standards of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 as to suggest that appellants had \u201cborne the burden of \u2018probable success\u2019 on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">At oral hearing of this appeal counsel for appellants conceded that the project had been constructed and was very near completion. Asked what relief this court could render under these circumstances, he ultimately proposed the entry of an order finding the statutory violations referred to above and requiring the destruction of the housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">The issue as to whether or not there have been violations of either the Civil Rights Act of 1968 or the Fair Housing Acts or regulations relied on by appellants will be squarely before the District Court on trial of the principal complaint and we see no need for this court to pass on these issues at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">At the hearing upon the merits, the past history of the Metropolitan Housing Authority\u2019s site selection and tenant selection policies may be shown. Likewise, the tenant selection policies contemplated for the housing projects herein referred to may be shown. If violations of national standards are shown, the District Judge has remedial powers to order a plan developed and implemented \u201cto provide, within constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>al limitations, for fair housing.\u201d 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 3601 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Petitions for preliminary injunctions are addressed in the first instance to the judicial discretion of the District Judge. In determining on appeal whether that discretion has been abused, four standards have been suggested:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">1) Has petitioner made a strong showing of probable success at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">2) Has petitioner shown irreparable injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">3) Would issuance of the preliminary injunction cause substantial harm to others ?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">4) Where lies the public interest? Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Assoc. v. Federal Power Commission, 104 U.S. App.D.C. 106, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (1958); Hamlin Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 337 F.2d 221, 222 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">We believe that this record mandates a negative answer as to the first of these, and inconclusive answers as to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The District Judge found on this record that there is a serious housing shortage in the Cincinnati area, and there is evidence to support his finding. We reject the suggestion that this court should order destruction of these homes at this stage of the proceedings and before a full evidentiary hearing has been held as to the claimed violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with the statutory standards set out below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">\"\u00a7 3601. It is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">\u201c\u00a7 3608(d).
