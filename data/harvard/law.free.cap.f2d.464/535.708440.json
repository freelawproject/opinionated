Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6). The complaint refers to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and seeks money damages from two state justices of the peace, the district attorney of Westmoreland County and his two assistants, a court administrator, appellant\u2019s former attorney, and the attorney for his former wife, an adversary in a divorce case. The appellant is dissatisfied with the handling of the' divorce proceedings and other domestic disputes. Even when judged by the less stringent standards by which we judge pro se pleadings, Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), Marshall v. Brierley, 461 F.2d 929 (3d Cir., filed 1972), the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The judicial officers are immune from damage suits growing out of their official duties. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 553-554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); Redding v. Walsh, 449 F.2d 1301, 1302 n. 1 (3d Cir. 1971); Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 460 (3d Cir. 1969). The prosecutors are similarly immune. Kauffman v. Moss, 420 F.2d 1270 (3d Cir. 1970); Bauers v. Heisel, 361 F.2d 581 (3d Cir. 1966). Moreover, the complaint fails to allege in what manner the appellant could have been damaged by the refusal of the prosecuting authorities to bring criminal proceedings against a third party. The claims against appellant\u2019s own attorney are essentially malpractice contentions and do not allege a deprivation of civil rights under color of state law. The allegations against the former wife\u2019s attorney do not even rise to the level of malpractice contentions, but are merely complaints about the advice given to that client. The district court proceeded in due compliance with the notice provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and properly granted the appellees\u2019 Rule 12(b) (6) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
