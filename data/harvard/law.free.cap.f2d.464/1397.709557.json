Counts Two and Four charged the receipt and concealment of the vehicles involved in Counts One and Three, respectively, in violation of Title 18, U.S.C., Section 2313. The government\u2019s proof of guilt was overwhelming and no claim of insufficiency of evidence is advanced on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-29\">The contentions on appeal are: (a) that the trial court erroneously allowed the government to impeach one of its own witneses, Iven Miles; (b) that the court below erroneously allowed the government to cross-examine said witness; (c) that the court below erroneously permitted the government to elicit testimony of past criminal activities and bad character of the appellant despite the fact that he did not take the stand and did not introduce any evidence of his good reputation and character; and (d) that the trial court committed error in denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial based on the fact that his past criminal activities had been brought to the jury\u2019s attention by the prosecution. After careful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>scrutiny of the record we find none of these contentions to be supported thereby-</p>\n<p id=\"A8V\">The judgment of the conviction is in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1451-31\">.
