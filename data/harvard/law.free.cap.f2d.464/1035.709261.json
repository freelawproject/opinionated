Citizens Casualty Co. of New York, et al.,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1089-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1089-23\">This is an appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the federal sentence of appellant Jose Manuel Franchi. We vacate the ruling below and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-24\">In 1964 appellant was convicted of violating the federal marijuana laws, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744(a). He served a two year sentence. In 1969 he was convicted of the sale, etc. of cocaine, which is prohibited by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a) and was sentenced to ten years. Two years later appellant\u2019s 1964 conviction was vacated by this Court, Franchi-Alfaro Negrin v. United States, 5th Cir. 1971, 445 F.2d 320. Subsequently, this \u00a7 2255 action was commenced attacking the 1969 sentence. Appellant asserted that he had been sentenced as a second offender and that since the first offense had been vacatd he should be resentenced as a first offender. The court below, the same judge who sentenced appellant in 1969, denied relief, stating that appellant had not been sentenced as a recidivist for the cocaine conviction and thus was not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-25\">The district court\u2019s opinion, although making it clear appellant was not sentenced on the basis of the recidivist information filed by the Government, indicates nevertheless the possibility that the invalid 1964 conviction was considered by the trial court in sentencing appellant. Such consideration is imper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>missible under United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">In view of the broad discretion permitted trial courts in sentencing and of the fact that appellant was sentenced to only half the maximum term provided by the statute, we are somewhat reluctant to remand this action. However, it appears \u201cthat the sentencing judge gave specific consideration to the [appellant\u2019s] previous conviction before imposing sentence upon him.\u201d United States v. Tucker, <em>supra, </em>92 S.Ct. at 592. <em>Tucker </em>thus requires that appellant be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
