(Key) are from so much of the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as sustained the oppositions by Kelite Chemicals Corp. (Kelite) to Key\u2019s applications to register \u201cKEY-MIX\" <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> both for \u201ccleaning compounds\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>Kelite\u2019s opposition is chiefly predicated on ownership and prior use of its registered mark \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a \u201cChemical compound which, when dissolved in water, is used in the treatment of steel to inhibit oxidation or corrosion and to provide a bond for paint\u201d. To a lesser extent, Kelite also relies on its registered marks \u201cKELITE\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for \u201csteam cleaning machines for cleaning automobiles, heavy machinery, and building fronts\u201d; \u201cKE-SONIC\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for \u201cemulsion cleaners\u201d; and \u201cKELITE\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in association with a key design for the goods mentioned in connection with \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d and also for \u201cIndustrial cleaning compounds \u2014 namely, cleaning powder, cleaning paste, cleaning fluids and soaps, and rust and scale solvents\u201d. Kelite is of the view that it will be damaged by the registrations sought because \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d and \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d so resemble the above-registered marks as to be likely, when applied to Key\u2019s goods, \u201cto cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\u201d. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">With one major exception, which we treat below, appellant has not raised any serious question regarding the manner in which the board dealt with the nature of the parties\u2019 respective goods, channels of trade, modes of advertising and class of customers. Consequently, we need not reiterate the board\u2019s factual analysis here, beyond noting that the record shows that both Kelite and Key are engaged in selling of specialized cleaning compositions for use in removing dirt, soil, rust, scale and the like from industrial machinery and equipment. Kelite sells these products on a nationwide basis, while Key sells the products principally in the Delaware Valley area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">The board specifically found that Kelite and its predecessors have promoted, advertised and sold industrial cleaners and metal treating agents under its \u201cKE-LITE\u201d house mark, as well as under various secondary marks, including \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d and \u201cKE-SONIC\u201d; that the description of goods for which Key seeks registration \u2014 \u201ccleaning compounds\u201d\u2014 encompasses Kelite\u2019s products as set forth in its \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d registration; and that \u201cthe goods of the parties must be considered, for purposes herein, as being identical in kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">Against this factual background, the board considered that \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d, when applied to applicant\u2019s cleaning compounds, differed sufficiently in appearance, sound and connotation from opposer\u2019s \u201cKELITE\u201d and \u201cKE-SONIC\u201d marks as to obviate a likelihood of confusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, in comparing applicant\u2019s \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d and \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d with opposer\u2019s \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d, the board felt otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-14\">Considering the marks \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d and \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d, it is apparent that both marks have the identical initial portion followed by a descriptive term. The salient and characterizing feature of these marks is the term \u201cKEY\u201d, a wholly arbitrary term as applied to the goods here involved. We conclude that applicant\u2019s mark \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d, in its entirety, so resembles opposer\u2019s mark \u201cKEYKOTE\" as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-15\">* * * * -x- -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-16\">The marks \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d and \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d are substantially similar in sound and, of course, both include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>the term \u201cKEY\u201d. In our opinion \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d so resembles opposer\u2019s, previously registered and used mark \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d as to be likely, when applied to cleaning compounds, to cause confusion or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">As a preliminary matter, appellant-Key contends that the board erred factually in determining that the goods of the parties are the same. It alleges, contrary to the board\u2019s findings, that Kelite\u2019s mark \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d is not used on, or registered for, a cleaning composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">There is substantial evidence, however, to support the board\u2019s finding that Kelite has promoted and advertised an industrial cleaning composition under the \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d mark. Thus, Kelite\u2019s Exhibit 35, a trade magazine advertisement reproduction not commented on by appellant, extols the virtues of \u201cKEYKOTE <em>cleaning </em>and phosphating chemicals\u201d [emphasis added] which are employed in conjunction with Kelite\u2019s combination steam cleaning and phosphatizing machinery for use in preparing the surfaces of various metal products for painting. From this, it would appear that some of Kelite\u2019s goods advertised and promoted under the \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d mark actually possess functions that go beyond the purpose ascribed to them in the \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d registration. Likewise, it appears from the record that some of Key\u2019s goods sold under its \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d and \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d marks also possess functions in addition to the mere \u201ccleaning\u201d function recited in its applications. Thus, literature submitted with Key\u2019s \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d application to illustrate how that mark is actually used shows that a liquid cleaning composition sold under that mark also \u201chelps prevent rust\u201d, a function identical to that expressed in Kelite\u2019s \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d registration, i. e., to inhibit oxidation of steel. Similarly, the record establishes that cleaning compositions which Key has sold under the \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d mark have been used to remove or clean rust and scale from ferrous metals, a function which, if not identical, is at least complementary to the function of the goods covered by the \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\"> In any event, it is not necessary, as appellant seems to assume, that the parties\u2019 goods must be identical in order to sustain a finding of likelihood of confusion or mistake. United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc. v. R. A. Products, Inc., 56 CCPA 751, 404 F.2d 399 (1968). In this connection, cleaning compounds for removing dirt, rust and scale from metals, and metal-treating compositions for inhibiting corrosion and rust, are related items which a single manufacturer might be expected to make and sell; which Kelite in fact does make and sell; and which are sold to the same class of purchasers. In such circumstances, when the same or similar marks are applied to such goods, purchaser confusion is likely to occur. Hence, in the final analysis, we must conclude that the board did not err in determining that a purchaser familiar with Kelite\u2019s line of \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d metal-treating compositions would, on encountering \u201cKEY-MIX\u201d or \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d cleaning compounds, be likely to assume by reason of confusion or mistake that a common source or origin existed. Any doubt on that score is resolved against the newcomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Nor is our conclusion altered by the presence in the record of about 40 third-party registrations which embody the word \u201cKEY\u201d. The great majority of those registered marks are for goods unrelated to those in issue, and there is no evidence that they are in continued use. We, therefore, can give them but little weight in the circumstances present here. Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc. v. Gerson Stewart Corp., 54 CCPA 751, 367 F.2d 431 (1966), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">Finally, Key argues that the registration of \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d it now seeks will not damage Kelite as a matter of law in view of Key\u2019s ownership of an incontest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>able, subsisting registration<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d for various inorganic, organic and specialty chemicals, including, inter alia, \u201cinhibited powdered sulfamic acid cleaners\u201d. At oral argument, appellant cited Joseph &amp; Feiss Co. v. Sportempos, Inc., 59 CCPA 742, 451 F.2d 1402 (1971), in support of its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">We see little merit in this argument. As the board pointed out, the registration presently sought is for \u201ccleaning compounds\u201d broadly, whereas the registration already owned by appellant includes but a single, specific cleaner. This is to be contrasted with <em>Sportempos, </em>supra, and Morehouse Mfg. Corp. v. J. Strickland Co., 56 CCPA 946, 407 F.2d 881 (1969), cited therein, where the goods covered by the applicant\u2019s previous registrations were found to be, for all intents and purposes, identical to the goods of the later applications. Considering the far broader recitation of goods in Key\u2019s present application, vis-a-vis the recitation of goods in its previous registration of \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d, and the fact that at least some of the goods Key presently sells under its \u201cKEY CHEM\u201d mark apparently do possess rust inhibiting properties in common with those sold under Kelite\u2019s \u201cKEYKOTE\u201d mark and specifically covered by its registration, we think opposer might well be damaged by the registration sought over and above any reason it might have asserted at one time against Key\u2019s now incontestable registration. In short, in our view, a trademark owner cannot by normal expansion of its business extend the use of its trademark to goods not covered by its previous registration, where the result would be a likelihood of confusion caused by similarity of that mark to a mark already registered by a prior user for the same or similar goods. See Breck, Inc. v. Armand Co., 42 CCPA 1099, 225 F.2d 246 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">LANE, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1094-15\">.
