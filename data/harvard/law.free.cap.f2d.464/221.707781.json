The evidence showed that they burglarized the Cass Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The government produced only two witnesses: Arthur Shelton, a co-participant in the burglary, \u00aend Thomas M. Urban, an officer of the savings and loan. The convictions depended totally on Shelton\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The defendants contend (1) that the court should have given a cautionary instruction on the testimony of an informer, and (2) that Shelton\u2019s testimony was so incredible as to be insufficient to sustain the convictions. These contentions are totally devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The defendants state that the court should have instructed the jury on the testimony of an informant, because Shelton had been \u201cbought off\u201d by the prosecution, by having certain charges dismissed. This argument is frivolous. There is no proof in the record of why these matters were disposed of as they were, and no showing of a link between Shelton\u2019s testimony and the alleged \u201cpayoff\u201d. The trial court amply protected the defendants by giving an instruction on the testimony of an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is clear that a conviction may rest upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. Hanger v. United States, 398 F.2d 91 (8th Cir. 1968); Wood v. United States, 361 F.2d 802 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 978, 87 S.Ct. 520, 17 L.Ed.2d 439 (1966); Williams v. United States, 328 F.2d 256 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 969, 84 S.Ct. 1651, 12 L.Ed.2d 739 (1964). Attempts to impeach Shelton on cross-examination failed. Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 allegations that Shelton had been \u201cbought off\u201d and his answer to those allegations were fully aired before the jury. If the jury believed Shelton, his testimony was sufficient to sustain the convictions. See, United States v. Mechanic, 454 F.2d 849 (8th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 929, 92 S.Ct. 1765, 32 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972); United States v. White, 451 F.2d 351 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
