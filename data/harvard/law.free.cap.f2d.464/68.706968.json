We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On September 11, 1970, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Lebman and two others charging seventeen counts of violations of Chapter 44, title 18, United States Code, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-928, and one count of conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Lebman was named in the first ten substantive counts and in the conspiracy count. Lebman entered a guilty plea on the first three substantive counts. The counts, all arising from the same transaction, charged Lebman with (1) aiding and abetting a licensed firearm dealer to sell and deliver a firearm \u201cto a person not residing in the State of Texas whom he then and there knew and had reasonable cause to believe did not reside in the State of Texas, where such licensed firearms business was located, in violation of Section 922(b) (3), title 18, United States Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) aiding and abetting a licensed firearm dealer to sell and deliver a firearm \u201cto a purchaser and to fail to note in records required to be kept pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923, the name, age, and place of residence of such purchaser, in violation of Section 922(b) (5), title 18, United States Code\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) aiding and abetting a licensed firearm dealer \u201cto make a false entry in records kept pursuant to Section 923, Title 18, United States Code, and regulations promulgated thereunder . in violation of Section 922 (m), title 18, United States Code\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lebman\u2019s guilty plea was accepted and a judgment of conviction entered. After entry of the conviction, but prior to sentencing, Lebman filed a \u201cMotion in Arrest of Judgment\u201d urging grounds similar to those raised on this appeal. The motion was denied, and Lebman received a fine of five hundred dollars and a sentence of twelve months on each count to run concurrently. The sentences were suspended, and Lebman was placed on five years\u2019 unsupervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">On appeal, Lebman challenges the constitutionality of the statutory provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>under which he was convicted. He argues, first, that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(b) (3), 922(b) (5), and 922(m) (see footnotes 1-3) are not supported by the commerce power of Congress in that the statutes do not require the proscribed conduct to have any relation to interstate commerce. Stated otherwise, Lebman contends that Congress may not, by criminal sanctions, regulate this intrastate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Lebman is, however, incorrect in his assertion that the power of Congress to regulate commerce under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution does not extend to intrastate transactions. \u201c[I]f it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze\u201d. United States v. Women\u2019s Sportswear Mfrs. Ass\u2019n., 1949, 336 U.S. 460, 464, 69 S.Ct. 714, 716, 93 L.Ed. 805, 811.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. See M\u2019Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421, 4 L.Ed. 579. Cf. United States v. Ferger, 250 U.S. 199, 39 S. Ct. 445, 63 L.Ed. 936.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">United States v. Darby, 1941, 312 U.S. 100, 118, 61 S.Ct. 451, 459, 85 L.Ed. 609, 619. <em>See </em>Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824, 9 Wheat. 1, 22 U.S. 1, 6 L.Ed. 23; National Labor Relations Bd. v.

United States, 1971, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686; Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 1964, 379 U.S. 241, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L. Ed.2d 258.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lebman seeks to rely on United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (December 21, 1971) as authority for his argument that Congress was acting beyond its commerce power if it sought, by the statutory provisions at issue here, to regulate intrastate transactions. In <em>Bass, </em>the defendant was convicted of possessing a firearm in violation of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a) (App.) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He argued that Section 1202(a) required that he possess a firearm \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce\u201d. The Court, after concluding that \u201cthe statutory materials are inconclusive on the central issue of whether or not the statutory phrase \u2018in commerce or affecting commerce\u2019 applies to \u2018possesses\u2019 and \u2018receives\u2019 as well as \u2018transports\u2019 92 S.Ct. at 522, adopted the narrower reading of the statute \u2014 \u201cthe phrase \u2018in commerce or affecting commerce\u2019 is part of all three offenses, and the present conviction must be set aside because the Government has failed to show the requisite nexus with interstate commerce\u201d. 92 S.Ct. at 522.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">In United States v. Nelson, 5 Cir. 1971, 458 F.2d 556, this Court, in a case dealing with the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) (6),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> distinguished <em>Bass </em>with language equally applicable to the statutory provisions at issue in the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">The instant case differs from <em>Bass </em>in several respects. First, appellant was convicted under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(a) (6) [see footnote 9], which, in contrast with \u00a7 1202(a) (1) that was at issue in <em>Bass, </em>contains no language referring to interstate commerce. The statute is thus not ambiguous on its face, unlike \u00a7 1202(a) (1). Secondly, \u00a7 922 is part of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The legislative history of this Title is fairly extensive and convinces us that \u2022 Congress intended to reach appellant\u2019s conduct irrespective of its immediate nexus with commerce. The statutory provisions facing the Supreme Court in <em>Bass </em>is part of Title VII of the same act. The legislative history of Title VII is, as noted by the Court in <em>Bass, </em>virtually nonexistent. The Court was, therefore, left with only minimal legislative guidance. Thirdly, the Congressional Declaration of Purpose set out in \u00a7 901 of the Omnibus Crime Act clearly indicates Congress\u2019 purpose to regulate the acquisition of firearms by felons without regard to the nexus of each individual acquisition with interstate commerce. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apj\">It seems clear from the language of \u00a7 922(a) (6), from its legislative history, and from the declaration of Congressional purpose that Congress meant to regulate all sales of the types of firearms covered by the Omnibus Crime Act, not just those sales in which the Government can prove some specific connection with interstate commerce. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">Moreover, we believe that acquisition of firearms is more closely related to interstate commerce than mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>possession. Therefore, while the Supreme Court in Bass impliedly expressed some reservations about Congress\u2019 power to regulate possession of firearms, we entertain no doubt that it has the power to regulate their acquisition without requiring proof of a nexus with interstate commerce in each individual case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><em>See also </em>United States v. Menna, 9 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 982. As in <em>Nelson, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(b) (3), 922(b) (5), and 922(m), unlike \u00a7 1202(a), are unambiguous on their face, in that they contain no reference to interstate commerce, and are accompanied by legislative history and a statement of purpose<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and findings indicating a desire to reach intrastate transactions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statutory interpretation of an ambiguous statute in <em>Bass </em>does not preclude the result we reach in the present case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">Assuming that Congress, as we have held, could constitutionally enact the challenged statutes under the commerce power and intended to reach intrastate transactions under the statutes, Lebman argues that Section 922(b) (3) (see footnote 1), the basis of count one, is constitutionally defective in other respects. Lebman argues that the statute unconstitutionally inhibits the nonresident firearms purchaser\u2019s right to travel. <em>See </em>Shapiro v. Thompson, 1969, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Assuming, but not deciding, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Lebman has standing to raise the constitutional objection of a non-resident firearms purchaser, his argument must, nevertheless, fail. We are unable to discern any inhibition on the non-resident firearms purchaser\u2019s right to travel occasioned by a statute regulating the sale of firearms to a non-resident by a licensed dealer. Nor do we find that the distinction in Section 922(b) (3) between residents and non-residents is \u201cwholly irrelevant to the achievement of [Congress\u2019s] . . . objective\u201d. McGowan v. Maryland, 1961, 366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393, 399. This is particularly true in light of the explicit Congressional finding that \u201cthe sale or other disposition of concealable weapons ... to nonresidents of the State in which the licensees\u2019 places of business are located, has tended to make ineffective the laws, regulations, and ordinances in the several States and local jurisdictions regarding such firearms\u201d. (See footnote 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Lebman also argues that Section 922(b) (3) is unconstitutionally vague and indefinite in that it employs the scienter requirement \u201cknows or has reasonable cause to believe\u201d. Again assuming, but not deciding, that Lebman possesses the requisite standing to raise this contention on appeal, it was charged under the indictment, and a guilty plea was entered, that Lebman \u201cknowingly and unlawfully did aid and abet and <em>wilfully cause </em>a firearms dealer to sell and deliver a firearm to a person not residing in the State of Texas whom he then and there knew <em>and </em>had reasonable cause to believe did not reside in the State of Texas. . . . \u201d Lebman has no grounds to complain of this scienter standard under which he was charged and plead guilty. He was charged and convicted under an admittedly acceptable scienter standard providing that he \u201cknew\u201d the facts specified in the statute. He cannot complain when the Government chose to <em>add </em>to this acceptable scienter standard the challenged \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d standard. We, therefore, need not and do not decide the propriety of an indictment and conviction under the \u201cknows <em>or </em>has reasonable cause to believe\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">We have carefully examined Lebman\u2019s other arguments on appeal and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b) (3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">It shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector to sell or deliver\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">(3) any firearm to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in (or if the person is a corporation or other business entity, does not maintain a place of business in) the State in which the licensee\u2019s place of business is located, except that this paragraph (A) shall not apjily to [exceptions not here relevant].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b) (5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-15\">It shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector to sell or deliver\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-19\">(5) any firearm or ammunition to any person unless the licensee notes in his records, required to be kept pursuant to section 923 of this chapter, the name, age, and place of residence of such person if the person is an individual, or the identity and principal and local places of business of such person if the person is a corporation or other business entity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-20\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(m) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-21\">(m) It shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector knowingly to make any false entry in, to fail to make appropriate entry in, or to fail to properly maintain, any record which he is required to keep pursuant to section 923 of this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">. Chapter 44, title 18, United States Code, was added by title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of <em>1968, </em>Pub.L. 90-351. Title IV was approved on June 19, 1968, and was to become effective on December 16, 1968. The Congressional findings as to the effect on interstate commerce of the proscribed conduct were contained in \u00a7 901(a) of title IV (see footnote 5). Prior to the effective date of title IV, on October 22, 1968, Congress approved the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-618.

The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV is likewise a limitation upon the states. <em>See </em>Slaughter-House Cases, 1873, 83 U.S. (16 Wall) 36, 21 L.Ed. 394; Chambers v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R., 1907, 207 U.S. 142, 28 S.Ct. 34, 52 L.Ed. 143; Whitfield v. Ohio, 1936, 297 U.S. 431, 56 S.Ct. 532, 80 L.Ed. 778; Toomer v. Witsell, 1948, 334 U.S. 385, 68 S.Ct. 1156, 92 L.Ed. 1460. In <em>Shapiro, </em>the Court relied on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to strike down the District of Columbia waiting-period requirement \u201ceven though it was adopted by Congress as an exercise of federal power\u201d. 394 U.S. at 641, 89 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>1335. Lebman apparently relies on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and its \u201cincorporated\u201d equal protection requirements, <em>see </em>Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884, as the basis for his \u201cright to travel\u201d challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b128-12\">CLARK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIr\">(concurring specially).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">I concur in all of Judge Wisdom\u2019s opinion except the penultimate paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Under this circuit\u2019s holding in United States v. Jacobs, 451 F.2d 530 (5th Cir. 1971), the conjunctive indictment did not increase the government\u2019s burden under the disjunctive statute to prove more than that Lebman had \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that the person to whom he sold firearms was a nonresident of Texas. For this reason I would hold that Lebman possesses the requisite standing to mount a constitutional attack on this proviso of the act. However, I would hold the proviso to be sufficiently clear and definite to pass constitutional muster. The statute\u2019s coverage of dealers who \u201cknow\u201d the purchaser is a non-resident is really not attacked, and rightly so. The precision of this requirement is beyond cavil. The alternative incrimination of those who have \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d he to whom they sell is a nonresident does not, in the language of the Supreme Court, fail to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by statute, United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1953), nor does it encourage arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions. Papachristou v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). The statute unmistakably forbids only a sale by one who though he is \u201cin some manner aware\u201d that the buyer is a nonresident, nevertheless completes a knowing, \u201ccalculated\u201d sale. <em>See </em>Ginsberg v. State of New York, 390 U.S. 629, 643-644, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 1283, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968). Under this circuit\u2019s recent decision in United States v. Featherston, 461 F.2d 1119 (5th Cir. 1972), the challenged scienter requirement did not expose Lebman to prosecution without first fairly warning him of the nature of the proscribed conduct. <em>See, </em>Rowan v. U. S. Post Office Dept., 397 U.S. 728, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 25 L.Ed.2d 736 (1970). <em>See also </em>United States v. Decker, 446 F. 2d 164 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
