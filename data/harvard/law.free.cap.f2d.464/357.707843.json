We agree and affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-23\">Prohibition of illegal gambling businesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-24\">(a) Whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-25\">(b) As used in this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-26\">(1) \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHo\">means a gambling business which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-u3\">(i) is a violation of <em>the law of a State </em>or political subdivision in which it is conducted * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-28\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-29\">These two cases hinge on the construction of the phrase, \u201cthe law of a State.\u201d Relying on United States v. Howard, 352 U.S. 212, 77 S.Ct. 303, 1 L.Ed.2d 261 (1957), the government\u2019s basic position is that a business may be a violation of \u201cthe law of a State,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1955, without being a violation of the State\u2019s criminal laws. The government\u2019s reliance on United States v. Howard, <em>supra, </em>is misplaced. In <em>How</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>ard </em>a violation of the applicable regulation of the Florida Game Commission was punishable as a crime. Here a violation of the applicable Nevada Gaming Commission regulation can lead only to civil sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">As used in \u00a7 1955, the pivotal words, \u201cthe law of a State,\u201d suffer from ambiguity. Those words can reasonably be construed to cover gambling businesses that are only in violation of state penal laws, or to embrace gambling businesses that are in violation of any state law\u2014 criminal or civil. In United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) the Supreme Court said: \u201cThus, where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d That principle applies here. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
