All three telecasts were primarily concerned with Garrison\u2019s alleged criminal activities and asserted connection with members of the underworld. During those newscasts, several references were made to plaintiff, Peter J. Casano, which arguably suggested that he was connected with members of the underworld. Casano filed this diversity action seeking $1,000,000 general and $1,000,000 punitive damages. The district court, per Judge Nixon, 313 F. Supp. 1130, denied defendant\u2019s pretrial motion for summary judgment. Judge Cox presided over the trial, and at the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, granted WDSU-TV\u2019s motion for directed verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 1964, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, the Supreme Court announced a first amendment privilege inuring to the press and news media when involved in commenting upon public officials and figures. Because of the importance attributable to a forum for robust discussion concerning any such individual, he may recover in a libel action against the press or news media only when the defendant has defamed him with <em>malice </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>with knowledge of falsity or in reckless disregard for the truth. In Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 1971, 403 U.S. 29, 91 S.Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296, the Court expanded the privilege to protect comment on purely private figures who are involved in matters of public or general concern. See also Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., 5 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 858; Time, Inc. v. McLaney, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Defendant contends that any references to Casano contained in the broadcasts at issue were substantially true. Aside from any constitutional privilege, in Mississippi truth is an absolute defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Moreover, it is argued that in any event the statements concerning Casano were not maliciously made as required by <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Rosenbloom, supra. </em>The district court found, as a matter of fact and based upon the testimony of Casano\u2019s witnesses, that the references to Casano were substantially accurate with the possible exception <em>of </em>the statement that Casano was a \u201cMar-cello connected attorney.\u201d Marcello is reputedly the Don of New Orleans\u2019 Cosa Nostra. We are in agreement with the district judge\u2019s view and are unable to discern any error in his findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Moreover, said the district judge, even if Casano was not actually a \u201cMarcello connected attorney,\u201d WDSU-TV\u2019s characterization of him was made without malice. In support of - that finding the judge first noted that there was no evidence of any acquaintance between WDSU and Casano or between the WDSU reporter, Iris Kelso, and Casano, and that there was no vindictive motive. Furthermore, there was testimony by Kelso that she had undertaken to investigate Casano\u2019s relationship with. Marcello and had learned: (1) that Casano was a law partner of the Occhipinti brothers, whose connection with Marcello was amply authenticated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) that Casano had engaged in dealings with Leon Salloum, who thereafter was charged with a crime <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and whose relationship with Marcello was also well established. On the basis of that knowledge, said the district court, WDSU\u2019s connection of Casano with Marcello <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>was not shown to be malicious. <em>We </em>agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"> To prove malice Casano must show malice, actual or constructive, with \u201cconvincing clarity.\u201d Bon Air Hotel, Inc., <em>supra, </em>426 F.2d at 864. Casano has failed to meet that burden. At most, any error of WDSU was the result of \u201cinvestigatory failure,\u201d which is not tantamount to malice. Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 1967, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We are in harmony with the district judge\u2019s sympathetic statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff is unquestionably a very high class lawyer and enjoys an excellent reputation, but he unfortunately had some colorable business connections in the New Orleans area at the time of a very hot political race in New Orleans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">(App. 400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-5\">.
