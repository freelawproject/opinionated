He contends that his conviction was based on identification by an eyewitness who had picked him out of a line-up and had so testified; that appellant had requested and been denied counsel at the time of the line-up. He relies on United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">The line-up, however, was prior to indictment (or other initiation of adversary judicial proceeding) and right to counsel had not attached. Kirby v. Illi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>nois, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"> Further, findings of the District Court after a full evidentiary hearing render <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>inapplicable. The court found that the in-court identification was completely independent of the line-up identification. United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 240-241, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967). <em>See also, </em>United States v. Breaux, 450 F.2d 948 (9th Cir. 1971). This finding was not clearly erroneous. Indeed, it was overwhelmingly supported by the record. Any testimonial reference to the line-up at the time of trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 272-274, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
