Title 28 U.S. Code Section 1343(3) as amended is [sic] herein after more fully appears, and the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-24\">Plaintiff, a diabetic who demonstrated symptoms of intoxication when he was involved in an automobile accident, contends that in the process of a police investigation of that accident, he was physically assaulted in a Philadelphia police station. He remembers nothing of the incident or occurrences for ten days thereafter, allegedly because of his diabetic condition. He relied upon an eye witness to describe the alleged beating, and introduced no testimony, lay or medical, delineating the nature or the extent of personal injuries he allegedly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-25\">This appeal admits of no easy resolution. It is a procedural <em>tour de force, </em>and the paucity of testimony introduced at trial before a jury did not simplify the task of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-27\">Initially, we must determine the precise nature of the civil action before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>trial court. This was not a <em>pro se </em>proceeding. Plaintiff was represented by private counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who, on several occasions, orally indicated that she intended to proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an application to amend his complaint, plaintiff made reference to \u00a7 1983, and the court order permitting the amendment explicitly referred to this statute, but the written complaint and amendment thereto were limited to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), described therein as \u201cthe Civil Rights Statute\u201d and the Eighth Amendment. Amended paragraph 1(a) averred: \u201cThe jurisdiction of this court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. Section 1343(3) being action authorized by law to redress the deprivation, under color of statute, laws of this State, ordinances, regulations, custom, and usage of any right, privilege or immunity secured to plaintiff by the first and fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d The claim for relief asked for \u201credress under the Civil Rights Act as mentioned.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">There exist many indications, however, that this proceeding was viewed as an action under \u00a7 1983. The defendants attacked the amendment, by citing \u00a7 1983 cases construing statutes of limitations. In discharging the jury, the court reported: \u201cThis case is brought under the Civil Rights Act, a recent Act of Congress passed in 1966, with some amendments since, I believe, but it goes back to an Act of 1873 or \u201974 known as the Civil Rights Act, which says, very briefly, that any person who deprives another of his constitutional rights acting under color of law is in violation of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Initially, we observe that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) is jurisdictional only. It does not supply a basis or a claim for relief. Where there is a deprivation of constitution\u00e1l rights by state officers the appropriate source of explicit statutory relief is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">To construe these written pleadings, literally founded upon \u00a7 1343, as constituting an action under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, would be comparable to the action of the Supreme Court in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), where the Court held to be sufficient a complaint against <em>federal </em>officers alleging naked Fourth Amendment deprivations and relying on the federal question jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Similarly, it would ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>pear that a complaint resting upon \u00a7 1343(3) and averring an Eighth Amendment deprivation would also suffice against <em>federal </em>officers. What is before us here is an action to redress an alleged invasion of federal constitutional rights by <em>state </em>officers, acting under color of state law. Since the cruel and unusual punishment clause has been held applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), we are at least conceptually consistent with the <em>Bivens </em>doctrine, even recognizing the difference that here there are state, rather than federal, officers. Whatever sovereign is served, the law enforcement officer asserting a state or federal authority occupies a formidable role vis-avis a private citizen. \u201cThe mere invocation of [state or] federal power by a [state or] federal law enforcement official will normally render futile any attempt to resist. ... \u2018In such cases there is no safety for the citizen except in the protection of the judicial tribunals, for rights which have been invaded by the officers of the government, professing to act in its name. There remains to him but the alternative of resistance, which may amount to crime.'\" <em>Bivens, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 394-395, 91 S.Ct. at 2004. Although, in the view we take, we do not meet and decide the question, the complaint filed in these proceedings bears a comfortable relationship with that filed by Mr. Bivens. \u201cIt is for the federal courts \u2018to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief\u2019 where federally secured rights are invaded. \u2018And it is also well settled that where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\u2019 Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, 777, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).\u201d J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">We therefore look beyond the pleadings here because the district court and all of the litigants proceeded as if this were a \u00a7 1983 proceeding. F.R.Civ.P. 15(b) provides \u201c[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\u201d The instant action appears to represent the paradigm case of an issue not raised in the pleadings, but tried with the implied consent of the parties and the express consent of the court as a \u00a7 1983 action for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">So construing these proceedings, it becomes necessary to determine the precise federal statutory violation or unconstitutional deprivation relied upon by plaintiff. We experience difficulty construing this action as one postulated on the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We view reference to these amendments in paragraph 1(a) of the amended complaint as descriptive only of the contours of the jurisdictional statute relied upon. Indeed, there was not a scintilla of proof elicited at trial evidencing any denial of free expression protected by the First Amendment. On the contrary, the record indicates that a possible cause of the difficulty experienced by Howell emanated from his refusal or inability to speak at the time of his arrest and during the ensuing investigation. Howell offered no proof of lack of probable cause for arrest, unlawful search and seizure, or improper questioning without counsel. Indeed, his entire case is predicated upon the hypothesis that he was involved in an auto accident at a time he was undergoing diabetic symptomatology, a condition resembling intoxication and productive of amnesia. The thrust of his complaint is that the officers used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>unnecessary and excessive force under the mistaken impression that he was uncooperative when the reality was that he was in the throes of some phase of a diabetic coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In addition, in paragraph XII of both the original and amended complaints, the constitutional deprivation appeared limited to an allegation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">[t]hat the defendants acted with malice and were wilful and wanton in their acts hereinabove mentioned using excessive force although unnecessary for which punative [sic] damages should be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">This specific averment seems consistent with the opening paragraph of both the original and amended complaints:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A89\">This action arises under the Civil Rights Statute, the Act of June 25, 1942, 62 Stat. 932 Title 28 U.S. Code Section 1343(3) as amended is [sic] herein after more fully appears, and the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Paragraph XI of the original and. amended complaints provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">That as a proximate result of the acts and doings of the defendants and their associates, plaintiff has been injured and also has been depreived [sic] of the equal protection of the laws of the United States. The plaintiff has been compelled to incur the expense of attorneys fees and other legal costs due to the action of defendants herein, all to his damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">On the basis of these allegations, we find that the specific pleadings are consistent with an allegation of an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment as proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the specific manner with which plaintiff\u2019s attorney made her opening statement, presented the evidence, and made her final argument to the court <em>in </em>response to the motion for directed verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">Now that we have determined the precise nature of this action and the constitutional deprivation asserted, we must ascertain which of these named defendants are legally cognizable parties to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">Initially, we find that the district court properly dismissed the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>against the defendant City of Philadelphia. A municipality is not a party within the context of \u00a7 1983. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961); Hunter v. City Solicitor, City &amp; County of Philadelphia, 444 F.2d 1395 (3d Cir.1971); Bush v. Robinson, 442 F.2d 393 (3d Cir.1971); United States ex rel. Gittlemacker v. County of Philadelphia, 413 F.2d 84 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Further, we agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action against defendants Captain Keane of the 25th Police District, Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo, and Mayor James H. J. Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The incident giving rise to this action occurred on December 21, 1966. These individuals were not named in the original complaint, but were added as defendants in the amended complaint, filed May 30, 1970, over three years and five months after the accident. We do not reach the question of whether these defendants can be held liable without proof that they acted personally in the deprivation of plaintiff\u2019s rights, <em>cf., </em>Bennett v. Gravelle, 323 F.Supp. 203, 214 (D.Md.1971); Sanberg v. Daley, 306 F.Supp. 277, 279 (N.D.Ill.1969), because we hold that the action against them was barred by operation of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The applicable period of limitations in a \u00a7 1983 action is that which the state, courts would apply if the action were brought in a state court under state law. Butler v. Sinn, 423 F.2d 1116 (3d Cir. 1970); Hileman v. Knable, 391 F.2d 596 (3d Cir.1968). Had this action been brought by plaintiff as a tort action in the Pennsylvania courts, as to these defendants, it would have been barred by the applicable statute of limitations, Act of June 24, 1895, P.L. 236 \u00a7 2; 12 Pa. Stat.Anno. \u00a7 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-17\">Every suit hereafter brought to recover damages for injury wrongfully done to the person, in case where injury does not result in death, must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done and not afterwards. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">Essentially then this appeal resolves itself to whether a <em>prima facie </em>case of cruel and unusual punishment was made out against the police officers identified as actually participating in the incident. Clearly, not all tortious conduct subject to liability under state law constitutes \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d under the Federal Constitution. Moreover, this court has already stated: \u201cNor are we able to perceive that a tort committed by a state official acting under color of law is, in and of itself, sufficient to show an invasion of a person\u2019s right under the Act.\u201d Kent v. Prasse, 385 F.2d 406, 407 (3d Cir. 1967). Thus, an averment of improper medical treatment was held insufficient by this court to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983, Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1 (3d Cir.1970); Fear v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 413 F.2d 88 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 278, 24 L.Ed.2d 234 (1969); as was an averment of inferior medical treatment facilities for treatment of an ear infection, Kontos v. Prasse, 444 F.2d 166 (3d Cir.1971); as was an averment of being forced to work in prison on a press which was dangerous and unfit and which had previously been condemned, Kent v. Prasse, <em>supra, </em>385 F.2d at 407.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>It becomes important to delineate that conduct which is actionable in state courts as a tort, and that which is actionable in federal courts under \u00a7 1983. The two rights of action do not always stand <em>in pari materia. </em>Some common law and statutory torts, although actionable in a state forum, do not rise to constitutional dimensions. The converse is equally true. Conduct may be actionable as a deprivation of constitutional rights where no force and violence has been utilized, and there exists no orthodox counterpart of state common law or statutory relief available. Certain violations of the Fourth Amendment illustrate this principle; and former Chief Justice Warren, in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958) (concurring opinion), described the act of denationalization as offensive to the Eighth Amendment: \u201cThere may be involved no physical mistreatment, no primitive torture. There is instead the total destruction of the individual\u2019s status in organized society.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">A right to relief under \u00a7 1983 is not exclusively predicated upon a breach of duty imposed by the law of torts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The seminal case of <em>Monroe </em>did not conceptualize the right as one that tracks exclusively the footprints of tort law. Only in the context of distinguishing the element of \u201cwilfully,\u201d found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, the criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1983, did Mr. Justice Douglas suggest that the civil action \u201cshould be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.\u201d 365 U.S. at 187, 81 S.Ct. at 484. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Delerme, 457 F.2d 156 (3d Cir. 1972). \u201cThe injuries inflicted by officials acting under color of law, while no less compensable in damages by those inflicted by private parties, are substantially different in kind. . \u201d <em>Bivens, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 409, 91 S.Ct. at 2011 (Harlan, J., Concurring). \u201c[A] deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from and more serious than a violation of a state right and therefore deserves a different remedy even though the same act may constitute both a state tort and the deprivation of a constitutional right.\u201d Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>365 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>at 196, 81 S.Ct. at 488 (Harlan, J., Concurring) .</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The rights protected by \u00a7 1983 are public ones, created or adopted by the Federal Constitution or by Congress. By comparison, \u201c[a] tort is an act or omission which unlawfully violates a person\u2019s right. ... It will be observed that the right violated is private not public. This differentiates tort from crime.\u201d Burdick, Law of Torts, 1st Ed. pp. 4-5. These federal rights are therefore publicly created, but subject to private vindication. In theory they are akin to the private rights governing the law of torts established either by common law or by statute. But unlike the varying strictures of private tort law, there is a public policy of broad interpretation of the rights sought to be protected. Valle v. Stengel, 176 F.2d 697, 702 (3d Cir. 1949). \u201cThe\" Act prescribes two elements as requisite for recovery: (1) the conduct complained of must have been done by some person acting under color of law; and (2) such conduct must have subjected the complainant to the deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d Basista v. Weir, <em>supra, </em>340 F.2d at 79. Once there is recognition of the right sought to be vindicated, the proof of the deprivation proceeds \u201cagainst the background of tort liability.\u201d Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>365 U.S. at 187, 81 S.Ct. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Thus, although proof of specific intent to deprive a person of his federally protected rights is not required, there must be at least proof of the \u201ccondition usually demanded by the law for liability in an action of tort [which] is the existence of either wrongful intention or culpable negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d Salmond, Law of Torts, 6th Ed. 1924, p. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Emphasizing that we are not dealing with a tort <em>qua </em>tort, but with an invasion of a constitutional protection, and recognizing that an examination of that protection and the invasion thereof requires the application of \u201cthe background of tort liability,\u201d we must now decide whether the evidence here amounted to an Eighth Amendment dep-N rivation. This would require proof of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">1. Intentional performance of conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">2. Amounting to punishment which is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">a. cruel, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">b. unusual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">The plaintiff proved that he was a diabetic, having in his possession on that day a card reading, \u201cI am a Diabetic. My behavior during reactions to therapy may resemble that of an intoxicated person.\u201d His physician testified that \u201cmedical literature ... is filled with cases of mistakes between a low blood sugar and the type of irregular behavior that is seen in acute alcoholism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Although diagnosed as \u201ca brittle diabetic,\u201d and having the potential of going into shock at any time even with regular administrations of insulin, the plaintiff, incredibly, continued to operate an automobile on the streets of Philadelphia. On December 21, 1966, he collided with an automobile driven by witness MeGraw and, as previously observed, plaintiff has no present recollection of this event or of anything subsequent for a ten-day period thereafter. MeGraw testified that plaintiff ran into the back of his car, that the police came, that they told him that Howell \u201cwas so drunk he was incoherent,\u201d that \u201cthey tried to get Mr. Howell into the police car but he couldn\u2019t bend over or he wouldn\u2019t bend over,\u201d and that Howell \u201cwas just standing there smiling, a big smile, and looking straight ahead and smiling. He wasn\u2019t saying anything or doing anything ... so they told me, well, they will have to call a wagon, and then a wagon came and four officers picked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>him up and put him in the patrol wagon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">McGraw described the assault at the police station, revealing that there were six police officers present, including the two defendants. He testified that Howell</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">was handcuffed behind his back and there was an officer under each elbow holding him up like this (indicates), you know, under his elbows holding him up, and they walked him up to the counter and then one officer took his hands behind Mr. Howell\u2019s head and smashed it to the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Well they pulled Mr. Howell away from the counter and one hit him in the stomach and he went down on the floor and the other officer had a black jack and he hit Mr. Howell on the head with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">* * *\u2022 -X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">Then the other two officers that were in the car when it happened, they were standing there and one picked Mr. Howell and one had a wooden club and started banging on his shins, and this went on for it seemed like a long time, for a few minutes or so, until Mr. Howell stopped squirming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">* -X- * * -X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">A. They asked him if he had enough and he didn\u2019t' say nothing. He sort of crying, smiling and crying. And they picked him off the floor. They lift him up and two officers were holding him again and they pushed him over on the counter and they unhandcuffed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">, Q. And unhandcuffed him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">A. Yes. Took the handcuffs off and the one officer held his wrist or his hands and then the bigger officer, he stepped back, he was holding his head down, and as he stepped back he sort of shoved him and pulled his hand right back real quick too, like to psyche the man I figured, you know they didn\u2019t have to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-15\">\u2022X- * * -X- -X- #</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">In Anderson v. Nosser, 438 F.2d 183 (5th Cir. 1971), the Fifth Circuit was faced with a \u00a7 1983 claim that plaintiffs were arrested, assaulted, and subjected to the grossest and most humiliating of human indignities by law enforcement personnel in Natchez, Mississippi. In holding that plaintiffs had been denied rights protected by the Eighth Amendment, the court emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-17\">The cruel and unusual punishment clause is a nonstatic, moral precept designed to curb treatment which offends contemporary standards of decency. Until the early part of this century, the ban on cruel and unusual punishment has been interpreted to apply only to outrageous and barbarous practices. <em>See generally </em>Goldberg &amp; Dershowitz, Declaring the Death Penalty Unconstitutional, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1773 (1970); Note, The Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and the Substantive Criminal Law, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 635 (1966). The concept has now expanded, but its precise boundaries are still unclear. Wilkerson v. Utah, 1878, 99 U.S. 130, 135136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (\u2018Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent of the constitutional provision which' provides that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted. ' <em>* * </em>* \u2019); Trop v. Dulles, 1958, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630. Courts have relied upon such imprecise measures as the protection of \u2018the dignity of man,\u2019 Trop v. Dulles, <em>supra, </em>356 U.S. at 100, 78 S.Ct. 590, or \u2018developing concepts of elemental decency,\u2019 Jordan v. Fitzharris, <em>supra </em>[D.C.] 257 F.Supp. [674] at 679, 438 F.2d at 190-191.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">We subscribe to Judge Goldberg\u2019s characterizations of the cruel and unusual punishment clause in <em>Anderson </em>as \u201ca nonstatic, moral precept\u201d rather than as a prohibition of grievous tortious conduct. If construed as the latter, there would be a tendency to conceptualize it as something measured by the degree of injuries inflicted, as, for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ample, the upgrading of simple assault and battery to aggravated assault and battery. We do not believe that the extent of injuries received necessarily determines whether unconstitutional punishment was inflicted to one in custody the police. We therefore deem as immaterial the absence of any medical testimony, either lay or expert, concerning the injuries sustained by Howell. This is not to say that the extent of injuries may not be important in another context in construing the cruel and unusual punishment clause, where, for example, the use of force is grossly excessive to that necessary under circumstances where some application of force is necessary or required. Nor is this to suggest that the use of a wooden club or blackjack by police officers may not be appropriate outside the confines of a jail or prison under limited circumstances, <em>e. g., </em>for proper self-protection, escape prevention, or riot control.</p>\n<p id=\"APP\">Where, as here, however, the plaintiff was handcuffed, was inside a police station, was at worst a suspected misdemeanant, and was surrounded by six officers, other considerations should dominate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Conceding that answers to basic investigative questions, such as identification, should have been given the police, conceding that Howell was uncooperative, either by reason of intoxication or diabetic coma, or both, conceding that he was resisting his incarceration or restraint, we nevertheless con-elude that the physical force inflicted upon him under the circumstances amounted to a <em>prima facie </em>case of cruel and unusual punishment against the identifiable, participating officers. Even though \u201capplied in pursuit of a legitimate penal aim\u201d- \u2014 control of an unruly prisoner \u2014 the force applied by the participating officers, <em>i. e., </em>smashing his head against the counter, hitting him on the head with a blackjack, banging his shins with a wooden club, kicking him, went far beyond the pale of permissible police conduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">[A] punishment may be cruel and unusual when, although applied in pursuit of a legitimate penal aim, it goes beyond what is necessary to achieve that aim; that is, when a punishment is unnecessarily cruel in view of the purpose for which it is used. Weems v. United States [217 U.S. 349] at 370, 30 S.Ct. 544 [54 L.Ed. 793]; Robinson v. California, [370 U.S. 660] at 677, 82 S.Ct. 1417 [8 L.Ed.2d 758] (concurring opinion of Douglas, J.). .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F.Supp. 674, 679 (N.D.Cal.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">Nor was it necessary, to bring this claim within the locutions of the Eighth Amendment, for plaintiff to prove that the actors intended to \u201cpunish\u201d him. Although that Amendment proscribes the infliction of cruel and unusual \u201cpunishment,\u201d clearly it was their conduct which pierced the constitutional shield, not their motive. All that is required is proof that the conduct was intentional. There is no requirement of proof of a further objective toward which the conduct is directed. \u201cWhile a specific intent to deprive a person of his constitutional rights is required under criminal sections of the Civil Rights Acts, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242, neither specific intent nor purpose to deprive an individual of his civil rights is a prerequisite to civil liability under the civil provisions of the Civil Rights Act. See Stringer v. Dilger, 313 F.2d 536 (10 Cir. 1963).\u201d Basista v. Weir, <em>supra, </em>340 F. 2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">Thus, although what \u201cconstitutes a cruel and unusual punishment has not been exactly decided,\u201d Weems v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>States, 217 U.S. 349, 368, 30 S.Ct. 544, 549, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910), \u201c[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,\u201d Trop v. Dulles, <em>supra, </em>356 U.S. at 101, 78 S.Ct. at 598 (1958) (concurring opinion, Warren, C. J.). We are not unaware of the commonplace rhetoric: \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d And we have heretofore observed that not every application of force by a police officer, even in a prison or police station, offends the law or the Constitution. But where the application of that force exceeds that which is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, and also \u201cviolates standards of decency more or less universally accepted,\u201d State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 469, 67 S.Ct. 374, 379 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947) (concurring opinion, Frankfurter, J.), such conduct clearly extends beyond the pale. We find, therefore, that the force visited upon plaintiff by the participating police officers did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Our inquiry, however, does not end here. Only two of the six police officers, Cataldi and Kinsella, were named as defendants in these proceedings. The district court found that there was insufficient identification testimony to link these men to the affray. At the time the plaintiff rested, the sole testimony was that of Mr. McGraw who, describing the affray at the police station, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">Then the two officers that were in the car when it happened they were standing there and one picked Mr. Howell and one had a wooden club and started banging on his shins, and this went on for it seemed like a long time, for a few minutes or so, until Mr. Howell stopped squirming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">This is the only time either Cataldi or Kinsella was linked to the beating. Clearly, without more, this evidence was insufficient-to identify Cataldi and Kinsella as participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The next day, over objection, the court permitted plaintiff to reopen his case, at which time admissions from the pleadings were read into the record, viz., that Cataldi and Kinsella were police officers, that they answered the call to an automobile accident on the date, that plaintiff was involved in the accident, and that \u201can argument ensued between the answering defendants and the plaintiff. . \u201d The defendants were the only police officers in the car, others arrived in a \u201cpaddy wagon.\u201d It can properly be said that a link was established connecting these defendants with Mr. McGraw\u2019s reference to \u201ctwo officers that were in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">We then must decide whether the combination of the admission and the statement was sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case against either or both defendants. McGraw testified that \u201cone picked Mr. Howell\u201d arid \u201cone had a wooden club\u201d\u2019 The statement that one \u201cpicked Mr. Howell\u201d is an extremely fragile reed upon which to impose liability. We have heretofore emphasized that it was necessary to prove that the conduct of the participants was intentional or purposeful. But prerequisite to a determination that one acted intentionally or purposefully is an ascertainment that the individual charged was the perpetrator of the constitutional deprivation. Mere presence of a person, when an assault and battery is committed by another, even though he mentally approves of it, but without encouragement of it by word or sign, is not sufficient of itself to charge him as a participator in the assault. 6 C.J.S. Assault and Battery \u00a7 27. Conceivably, use of the word \u201cpicked\u201d in another context-could have brought this actor within the orbit of liability, if, for example, there had been more than one prisoner involved in the affray. The act of \u201cpicking\u201d the plaintiff, in the sense of choosing or selecting, could have thus been construed as encouraging by word or sign the assault by others. Where there is only one victim, however, and he was described as having been \u201cpicked,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>word in itself becomes achromatic and totally meaningless insofar as imputation of liability is concerned.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Insofar as the two defendants are concerned, one of them is free of liability. There was no proof, as to him, of intentional or purposeful conduct to inflict cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Thus, we do not have conduct rendering two or more actors liable. We are left with but one actor, in the words of witness McGraw, the \u201cone [who] had a wooden club and [who] started banging\u201d on Howell\u2019s shins.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">There is no proof that Cataldi wielded the club or that Kinsella did; all that was said was that one of the two did. Reliance on 433 B of Restatement of Torts 2d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is therefore misplaced because explicit in this concept is proof of collective tortious conduct of <em>two </em>or more actors. At best, there was proof of wrongful conduct of <em>one, </em>identified only as one of two possible actors, without an explicit identification as to which of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In Negrich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213, 215 (3d Cir. 1967), we dismissed a \u00a7 1983 complaint as insufficient because of \u201cits failure to state facts in support of its conclusions. The charges of beatings and cruel and unusual punishment are made against the defendants generally and not against any particular defendant.\u201d Moreover, this court has been extremely cautious about imposing individual criminal liability where there are multiple actors in an assault and the identification testimony is ambiguous. In United States v. Barber (Appeal of Loper), 429 F.2d 1394, 1397 (3d Cir. 1970), Chief Judge Hastie stated, \u201cSomething of significance beyond the fact of presence is necessary to justify a conviction.\u201d Out of the same affray came an appeal by Brunswick to this court in United States v. Barber, 442 F.2d 517, 523-524 (3d Cir. 1971), wherein we reversed his conviction because of the ambiguity generated by the use of the word \u201cone\u201d by an eye witness describing one of two F.B.I. agents who were victims of a mass assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">Although acquitted of the Grant assault [Count 1] and conspiracy counts, Brunswick was found guilty of assault upon Snyder [Count 2] and assisting the prisoner to escape. Catherine Wright testified that Brunswick was trying to get at the agent on the ground (Grant) \u201cwith his hand.\u201d She and Debbie Price also said that Brunswick participated in the assault upon agent Grant. The only testimony implicating Brunswick in the Snyder assault came from Miss Price: \u201cThere was a car there and there was one man against the car. And he [there?] was three boys and with each on him [and] he [they?] was holding his arms * * * Mowbray, Barber, and Brunswick were holding him <em>* </em>* * they were holding him and they had him stretched out * * * Barber was the one who was hitting him.\u201d Standing alone, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>testimony would have generated a jury question on the Snyder assault count. When considered with other testimony, however, including that of Miss Price, that Brunswick played an active role assaulting agent Grant at about the same time the assault on agent Snyder was being perpetrated, this fragment of testimony, that Brunswick was \u201cholding\u201d \u201cone man against the car,\u201d cannot, without a more specific identification of the \u201cone man,\u201d be considered sufficient to sustain a conviction on Count 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI3\">Recognizing that our analogy has been directed to criminal cases where identification must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt as contrasted with civil cases where the proof need only rise to a preponderance of the evidence, we hold that here plaintiff failed to meet his burden. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err when it directed a verdict in favor of Cataldi and Kinsella because of plaintiff\u2019s failure to make an appropriate identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\">.

As I read the record of the trial, the following evidence required the district court to deny the motion for a directed verdict at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">The eyewitness testified that two officers entered the police station with plaintiff \u201cand they walked him up to the counter and then the one officer took his hands behind Mr. Howell\u2019s head and smashed it into the counter\u201d (N. T. 45). Plaintiff pushed back from the counter and the two officers then threw him to the floor and hit him with their fists and a blackjack (N. T. 46). At this point, as noted at page 282 of the majority opinion, defendants Cataldi and Kinsella, whom the jury could have found \u201cwere the two officers in the car when it happened,\u201d were referred to as participants in the assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All four of the officers then held plaintiff down. Later plaintiff was picked up from the floor and pushed over on the counter, when they took off his handcuffs. He was again hit and knocked down. The eyewitness then testified that plaintiff was assaulted by the four policemen (two of whom were Cataldi and Kinsella, being the two officers \u201cin the car when it happened\u201d) and two additional officers, using this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">\u201cThey were hitting him with the clubs and the blackjacks and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>were kicking him. His arms were bleeding, his pants were ripped where his legs were bleeding from both shins, and then he squirmed a little more this time so two officers jumped over the counter from out front. That made six, and they <em>all </em>jumped on him until he stopped squirming, and then they lifted him up and took him into the cell block, but that lasted longer the second time than it did the first time.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Since \u201call\u201d six officers participated in this assault, the defendants Cataldi and Kinsella must have taken part in it also.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Under these circumstances, the following principle contained in \u00a7 433B(3), Restatement of Torts 2d, and the totality of the evidence shifted the burden of proof to the defendants to go forward with evidence at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, since the jury was entitled to accept the above evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201c(3) Where the conduct of two or more actors is tortious, and it is proved that harm has been caused to the plaintiff by only one of them, but there is uncertainty as to which one has caused it, the burden is upon each such actor to prove that he has not caused the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9U\">\u201cComment on Subsection (3):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cf. ...

As in the ease of Subsection (2) the reason for the exception is the injustice of permitting proved wrongdoers, who among them have inflicted an injury upon the entirely innocent plaintiff, to escape liability merely because the nature of their conduct and the resulting harm has made it difficult or impossible to prove which of them has caused the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cg.
