Edelstein, <em>Chief Judge, </em>finding him guilty of selling heroin hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173 and 174 (1964).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 11, 1972, Judge Edelstein sentenced Ross, a second offender, to the mandatory minimum term of ten years, required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) (1964). On appeal, Ross contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction and that the court erred in imposing the mandatory minimum sentence. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, as we must at this juncture, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80 (1942), the evidence presented at trial adequately supported appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The government established that on February 14, 1968, at approximately 5:30 P.M., John Coursey, a federal narcotics agent acting in an undercover capacity, was introduced by an informant to Ross at the latter\u2019s home in the Bronx. Ross told Coursey that he would not be able to consummate a heroin sale at that time, as his supplier had left prior to Coursey\u2019s arrival. Coursey and the informant agreed to wait for Ross at another address.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Following the departure of Coursey and the informant, Agent Raphael Halperin maintained surveillance on Ross\u2019 home. At approximately 5:40 P.M., Agent Halperin observed Ross emerge from his home and walk away.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">At about 6:00 P.M., Ross arrived at the address where Agent Coursey and the informant were waiting. There Ross told Coursey that he had contacted his \u201cman\u201d and asked Coursey and the informant to meet him at his house at 7:00 P.M. Coursey and the informant returned to Ross\u2019 house at the appointed hour, at which time Ross sold Coursey five spoonfuls of white powder for $500. This powder was later determined to consist of 15.9 grams of 49.6% pure heroin and manitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Agent Halperin arrested Ross two months later, on April 19, 1968. At trial Halperin testified that, at the time of Ross\u2019 arrest, he \u201cexpressed a willingness to cooperate . . . [and] spoke in fact about the case in question.\u201d Halperin further testified that, at a pre-arraignment interview by an Assistant United States Attorney, Ross \u201cgave an approximation of the strength of the narcotics that he sold to Agent Coursey.\u201d Ross estimated that the heroin was 49.6% pure. Ross also admitted selling heroin by the spoonful for $500 an ounce.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">At trial Agent Coursey was unable to identify Ross as the man who had sold him heroin on February 14, 1968. Coursey\u2019s inability to identify Ross nearly four years after the event, however, is not fatal to the government\u2019s case. Halperin\u2019s testimony and in-court identification of Ross, when combined with Coursey\u2019s testimony and Ross\u2019 own admissions, supplied sufficient evidence to support Judge Edelstein\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">Ross\u2019 principal contentions on appeal relate to his being sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">First, he challenges his sentence on the ground that, since the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (the 1970 Act), which became effective May 1, 1971, repealed various federal narcotics laws, including the provisions under which Ross was sentenced,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, since his sentence was imposed after the effective date of the new Act, he was entitled to the benefits of its more liberal sentencing provisions, which, unlike the repealed laws, do not provide for a mandatory ten year minimum term of imprisonment for second offenders. Our Court, however, has specifically rejected this argument. United States v. Singleton, 460 F.2d 1148, 1155 (2 Cir. 1972); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>United States v. Fiotto, 454 F.2d 252, 254-55 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 918 (1972). See also United States v. Caraballo, 334 F.Supp. 843 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). While the Ninth Circuit has decided otherwise, United States v. Stephens, 449 F.2d 103 (9 Cir. 1971), we believe that there are cogent reasons for adhering to our previous decisions in <em>Fiotto </em>and <em>Singleton.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The 1970 Act specifically provided that \u201c[p]rosecutions for any violation of the law occurring prior to . FMay 1, 1971] shall not be affected by the [repeal] ... [of former 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d)] . . . or abated by reason thereof.\u201d Pub.L.No. 91-513, \u00a7 1103(a), 84 Stat. 1201. Ross argues, and the Ninth Circuit held, that this saving clause does not apply to former \u00a7 7237(d), because prosecution ends with a judgment of conviction and sentencing is an entirely different procedure. It does violence to logic, we believe, to suggest that Congress did not intend \u201cprosecutions\u201d to include sentencing. An essential ingredient of any prosecution is sentencing. Indeed, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that a judgment of conviction must set forth the defendant\u2019s sentence, in addition to the plea, the verdict and the adjudication. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b). Moreover, for purposes of appeal, a prosecution is not complete until sentence is imposed. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 1103(a) of the 1970 Act required the district court to sentence Ross to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to former \u00a7 7237(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">This conclusion is buttressed by 1 U. S.C. \u00a7 109 (1970), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cThe repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall expressly so provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">It seems clear that this statute also required the district court to sentence Ross pursuant to \u00a7 7237(d). The 1970 Act did not expressly extinguish mandatory minimum sentences. While it may plausibly be argued that \u00a7 109 refers only to persons already sentenced, the contrary construction seems to us more reasonable. Furthermore, we cannot accept the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning that the granting of probation or parole, which was not possible under \u00a7 7237(d), is not a release or extinguishment of a penalty. United States v. Stephens, <em>supra, </em>449 F.2d at 106. It seems illogical to suggest that making parole or probation available as alternatives to prison is not a release or extinguishment of a penalty. While it is true that the granting of probation or parole does not extinguish a defendant\u2019s penal obligation, one would be hard pressed to find a prison inmate who did not view the unavailability of parole as a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">We also find unpersuasive Ross\u2019 argument, accepted by the court in United States v. Stephens, <em>supra, </em>449 F.2d at 105-06, that \u00a7 7237(d) is not the type of statute which \u00a7 109 was intended to save. Ross essentially contends that, since \u00a7 7237(d) does not make certain conduct criminal or define offenses as to which prosecution need be sustained and abatement avoided, the statute merely provides for a \u201cremedy\u201d, as distinguished from a substantive liability. Ross further argues that the object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the federal saving provision, \u00a7 109, has never been thought to require the perpetuation of remedies or procedures. See Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218 (1910); United States v. Obermeier, 186 F.2d 243, 254-55 (2 Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 951 (1951). We do not believe, however, that the provision for mandatory minimum sentences can be termed a \u201cremedy\u201d. Rather, as indicated above, we consider \u00a7 7237(d) as a statute providing for a penalty. The federal saving statute specifically provides that the repeal of any statute shall not extinguish \u201cany penalty or liability incurred under such statute. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We also reject Ross\u2019 argument that \u00a7 109 was intended to prevent only technical abatement and was not intended to apply to a situation such as the instant one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ross\u2019 reliance on Hamm v. Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306 (1964), for this analysis of \u00a7 109 is misplaced. There, in dicta, the Supreme Court indicated that \u00a7 109 would not preclude the abatement of a prosecution for violating a hypothetical federal criminal trespass statute in the face of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. As the opinion pointed out, that case involved a superseding noncriminal statute which gave the appellants hitherto unenjoyed substantive rights to public accommodations. Thus, stated the Court, if the trespass statutes had been federal laws, prosecutions under them could not be continued after the enactment of the 1964 Act. The Court said that \u00a7 109 would not have saved the hypothetical statute, because the federal saving provision \u201cwas meant to obviate mere technical abatement. .\u201d 379 U.S. at 314. In reaching this conclusion, the Court in <em>Hamm </em>relied on United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 222-24 (1934), where the Court had held that, despite the federal saving statute, the ratification of the twenty-first amendment repealing prohibition abated a prosecution under the National Prohibition Act. Somewhat analogous to the situation in <em>Hamm, </em>the ratification of the twenty-first amendment had the effect of restoring a substantive right, the exercise of which previously had been the object of criminal sanctions. The instant case is entirely different. The conduct for which \u00a7 7237(d) required mandatory minimum sentences continues to be a crime under the new Act. Thus, the prosecution of Ross for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173 and 174 clearly was saved by \u00a7 109. Moreover, since we hold that sentencing is an integral part of the prosecution of an accused, \u00a7 109 also saved the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 7237(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">An earlier decision of our Court supports our conclusion that the district court was required to sentence Ross pursuant to former \u00a7 7237(d). In United States v. Kirby, 176 F.2d 101, 104 (2 Cir. 1949), the defendants were convicted under a mail robbery statute. The offense was committed prior to the effective date of a superseding statute, but sentence was imposed after that date. On the basis of \u00a7 109, as well as language in the superseding statute similar to \u00a7 1103(a), our Court held that sentencing under the old, superseded provisions, pursuant to which the prosecutions were initiated, was proper. See also United States v. Taylor, 123 F. Supp. 920 (S.D.N.Y.1954), aff\u2019d, 227 F.2d 958 (2 Cir. 1955), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 961 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"AlK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Ross also attacks his sentence on the ground that the district court erred in not considering him for disposition under Title II of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4251-55 (1970). Disposition under NARA, however, is available only for addicts. Here the preponderance of the evidence indicated that Ross was not in fact addicted at the time of sentencing. True, the government stipulated that Ross was an addict at the time of his arrest in February of 1971. But the government never conceded that Ross was an addict at the time of sentencing. Ross himself testified at trial that he was not an addict in 1971. Furthermore, Ross remained in custody from his arrest in February of 1971 until his sentencing in January of 1972. When one considers Ross\u2019 incarceration for eleven months prior to sentencing, together with his own contention that he had conquered his addiction by 1971, the government\u2019s stipulation regarding Ross\u2019 condition in February of 1971 is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Our view that Ross was not entitled to consideration under NARA is buttressed by defense counsel\u2019s failure specifically to request disposition under this Act. During the course of the proceedings, defense counsel did request rehabilita; tive sentencing, but we read these pleas, and we believe the district court reasonably interpreted them, as directed solely at the issues of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and treatment for his mental illness. There are cases which have held that where it is obvious that the defendant is an addict, the court must consider the options under NARA on its own initiative, and failure to do so requires a remand for resentencing. See United States v. Williams, 407 F.2d 940, 945 (4 Cir. 1969). The <em>Williams </em>decision was premised on the belief that a convicted defendant who is clearly addicted is entitled to have the court exercise its discretion as to whether to use the rehabilitative provisions of the Act. Where, as here, however, there is substantial evidence that the defendant was not in fact addicted at the time of sentencing, the district court cannot be faulted for not exercising its discretion in the absence of a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Finally, Ross contends that imposing mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. This claim has been repeatedly rejected. United States v. Lozaw, 427 F.2d 911, 917 (2 Cir. 1970); United States v. Drotar, 416 F.2d 914, 917 (5 Cir. 1969); Sperling v. Willing-ham, 353 F.2d 6, 7 (7 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 962 (1966); Stewart v. United States, 325 F.2d 745, 746 (8 Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 937 (1964). Despite the fact that the sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) have been in effect for a long time, Ross is unable to cite a single case, and we have found none, where these provisions have been held constitutionally invalid. We decline the invitation to rule to the contrary at this late date.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">We likewise see no merit in Ross\u2019 claim that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional as applied to him because it provided for no treatment for his drug addiction or mental illness. As indicated above, there was substantial evidence that Ross was not addicted at the time of his sentencing. Furthermore, while there was testimony that Ross was suffering from some form of mental illness, there are facilities and personnel available under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Prisons \u2014 including Lewisburg where Ross presently is incarcerated \u2014 to assist him with his mental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-16\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-966 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4251-55 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-18\">. Sections 173 and 174 were repealed by Pub.L. No. 91-513, \u00a7 1101(a) (2), 84 Stat. 1291 (1970). By the terms of \u00a7 1105(a), the repealer became effective on May 1, 1971. However, as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>the repealer contained a saving provision, \u00a7 1103(a), as to prosecutions under \u00a7\u00a7 173 and\u2019174 for violations committed prior to May 1, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) (1964). If \u00a7 7237(d) did not apply, parole and probation would be available to Ross even though the provisions of the new Act did not apply to him. Absent \u00a7 7237(d), the general provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651 (1970) would apply. That section authorizes the suspension of sentence and grant of probation as to any offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">. Ross argues that <em>Fiotto </em>is not controlling, because Ross\u2019 conviction, unlike Fiotto\u2019s, occurred after the effective date of the new Act. That Ross\u2019 second conviction came after the effective date, however, is irrelevant. <em>Fiotto </em>and <em>Singleton </em>hold that former \u00a7 7237 must apply when the crime was committed prior to the effective date of the new Act. Moreover, in <em>Singleton, </em>which was decided after oral argument of the instant case, appellant was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of five years for a first offender as required by \u00a7 7237 (b) and (d), even though he was convicted after the effective date of the new Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b434-6\">. The term \u201ctechnical abatement\u2019\u2019 is used to describe the effect at common law of repeal of a statute on a ponding action. The repeal of a statute or change in the definition or punishment of an offense abrogated the statute and abated any prosecution commenced thereunder, unless the repealing statute expressly provided to the contrary. For example, in Norris v. Crocker, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 429 (1851), the Supreme Court held that the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 repealed a penalty granted masters under an act of 1793 and barred an action for recovery of the penalty prescribed in the act of 1793, even though the action was pending at the time of repeal. Furthermore, in United States v. Tynen, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 88 (1871), the substitution of a new statute with a greater schedule of penalties was held to abate a previous prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
