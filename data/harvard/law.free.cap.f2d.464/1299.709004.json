The district court accepted the factual determination of the California state courts that Jarvis validly waived his constitutional right to remain silent, after the proper warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, had been given by the interrogating officers, and that the statements given by Jarvis thereafter were voluntarily made and properly admitted into evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>dence at his trial for robbery and assaulting a police officer. People v. Jarvis, 1969, 276 Cal.App.2d 446, 80 Cal. Rptr. 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">A federal court may rely in a habeas corpus proceeding on the state court\u2019s factual determinations under certain conditions established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Relying on that statute, the court below found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-5\">\u201cThis Court has reviewed the transcript of the proceedings in the trial court and has concluded that petitioner received a fair hearing with full opportunity to develop the material facts related to his claim, that the material facts were adequately developed, and that there is sufficient evidence in support of the state trial and appellate court determinations that petitioner\u2019s statement was properly admitted into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">Jarvis\u2019 other contention does not raise a federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
