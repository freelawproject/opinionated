Giles sued the Sheriff of Hinds County, Fred Thomas; two of his deputies, Pal R. Jones and P. P. Lamburth; United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, as surety on the official bond of Thomas; J. W. Richardson, Justice of the Peace of the Fifth Justice of the Peace District, Post 2, of Hinds County; USF&amp;G as surety on Richardson\u2019s official bond; Jackson Apartments, Inc., the owner of Giles\u2019 rental unit and the complex in which it was located; H. C. Bailey, Realtor, a partnership employed to manage the apartment complex for Jackson Apartments, Inc.; and Jack Partridge, an employee of Bailey who in 1968 had charge of renting apartments in the complex where Giles lived. She sought $100,000 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-20\">On September 20, 1968, Partridge signed an affidavit in the Justice of the Peace court of Richardson, on behalf of Bailey, asserting that Giles was in arrears in payment of her rent. On the basis of this affidavit, Richardson issued a summons to Giles, in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>with Mississippi law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requiring her to show cause why she should not be removed for default in her rental payments, This summons contained the erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>return date of September 27, 1970 \u2014 erroneous in that Mississippi law requires such a summons to be returnable in not less than three or more than five days. On September 25, a default judgment was issued by Richardson against Giles. By October 2, 1968, Giles paid Bailey $40 of her unpaid rents, but did not at that time pay the court costs from the default proceeding. Mississippi law requires the payment of court costs, plus rent, to stay proceedings for the removal of a tenant. Miss.Code, Recompiled \u00a7 957. Partridge, on behalf of Bailey, went forward with removal proceedings and on the evening of October 7, 1970, Giles was set out of her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Partridge testified that he was asked by Giles to speak with her lawyer on the telephone at the time of the eviction. The details of this conversation were excluded from evidence on.Giles\u2019s objection. After the conversation, the undisputed evidence shows that Partridge and Giles reached an understanding. Giles would pay the court costs of nine dollars incurred in the justice of the peace proceedings, and she would be allowed to return to the apartment. Partridge would return to Giles nine dollars \u2014 the exact sum owing as court costs \u2014 to pay for the cost of moving her furniture back into the apartment. Partridge wrote a receipt, signed by Giles and himself. Partridge acknowledged receipt of the $9 for court costs and Giles acknowledged receipt of $9 for the cost of moving her furniture back into the apartment. Parttridge testified that the nine dollar exchange was made with' the mutual understanding that Giles would move back into the apartment and that her moving back \u201cwould end the matter completely\u201d. Deputy Sheriff Lamburth substantiated this testimony, but Giles herself denied she had agreed to take no further action. On the same evening, October 7, Giles was put back in possession of her apartment and her furniture moved back inside the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">At the trial below, the court submitted to the jury only two questions: first, whether the $9 exchange and receipt constituted a binding settlement of* Giles\u2019s . rights against the defendants ; and second, whether Giles sustained . any damages and in. what amount. The court instructed as a matter of law'that those defendants' acting in official capacities could not be held\" liable on the facts of the case. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. \u2022 On this app\u00e9al, Giles raises a number of objections to the'action of the trial court, but we find it unnecessary to consider each of those arguments since there was abundant evidence to support the jury\u2019s necessary conclusion that the $9 exchange constituted a full settlement of Giles\u2019s claims against the private parties defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> , The settlement agreement may not have extended to Giles\u2019s possible claims against the Justice of the Peace, the Sheriff, and their employees, but the trial court was correct in ruling that those defendants were immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>from suit as judicial officers under the circumstances of this case.

See Boeing Company v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365 (en banc). We see no merit in Giles\u2019s argument that the agreement found by the jury to be a release or settlement was entered into by Giles for no consideration. For agreeing to \u201cend the matter\u201d, Giles received from Partridge, on behalf of the private defendants, the assurance that she would not have to endure the inconvenience, the uncertainty, and the expense of securing reinstatement in her apartment and reimbursement of her \u201ccourt costs\u201d through litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">We note further that there is no allegation by Giles that she was misled or coerced into the settlement agreement with Partridge. Indeed, as the evidence shows, Giles was in touch with her lawyer just prior to her agreement with Partridge. Nor is there any suggestion that the defendants have reneged on their part of the agreement, for the record reveals that Giles returned to her apartment on the evening when she was evicted and continued to reside there at least until the date when she filed this action in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
