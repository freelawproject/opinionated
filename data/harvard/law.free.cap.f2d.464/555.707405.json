The district court denied relief after a full evidentiary hearing and on written findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">There is no merit whatever in the assignments of error based on (a), (b), (c) and (d). As to the improper sentences claim, appellant was charged in one indictment in three counts arising out of the burglary of the Pasadena National Bank. He was charged in another indictment in three counts arising out of the burglary of the Spring Branch Savings and Loan Company. The respective counts in each indictment charged violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a), (b) or (c). In view of the holdings of this court in Rose v. United States, 5 Cir., 1971, 448 F.2d 389, and United States v. White, 5 Cir., 1971, 440 F.2d 978, appellant\u2019s convictions based on pleas of guilty must be vacated and the cause remanded so that he may be resentenced on one count only in each of the two indictments involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Affirmed in part; vacated in part with direction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
