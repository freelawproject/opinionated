The Act extends a measure of protection to persons who comply with this require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>ment. It provides that information obtained by the government in consequence of the mandatory disclosure of oil discharges may not be used \u201cin any criminal ease\u201d against the persons who make the disclosure. The central issue on this appeal is whether, in the defense of a prosecution under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, 33 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 407, 411,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the corporate owner of an onshore facility may avail itself of this statutory immunity. The district court held that the corporate owner may not. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Mobil Oil Corporation owns a plant near Vanderbilt, Texas. In May, 1970, simultaneous malfunctions in independent regulatory mechanisms caused tanks at the Vanderbilt plant to discharge approximately 150 barrels of oil into Venado Creek, a navigable waterway of the United States. It was stipulated that Mobil discovered the discharge and notified the Coast Guard through one of its employees. The Coast Guard, which had <em>no </em>prior knowledge of the accident, initiated an investigation. After this investigation the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas filed an information against Mobil. This information was based solely on facts that the government obtained by exploiting the notification given by Mobil. The information charged that Mobil had violated the federal prohibition against the discharge of refuse into navigable waters of the United States. In due course Mobil was prosecuted, convicted, and fined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">Mobil argues that the notice of the discharge into Venado Creek was given in accordance with the requirements of the WPCA and that the immunity conferred by statute extends to facts the government obtained by exploiting this notification. Because the information against Mobil was based solely on facts that were obtained in this way, the subsequent conviction, Mobil contends, was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>The government argues that the information against Mobil, a corporate owner, was proper despite the necessary facts having been obtained through exploitation of the notice. Conceding that statutory immunity would otherwise bar the use of such facts, the government asserts that immunity does not bar their use in this ease, for the Mobil Oil Corporation is not, the government contends, within the class of persons to whom the immunity extends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The statutory language that bears upon these contentions is found in \u00a7 1161(b) (4), supra, Fn. 1, of the WPCA. That section imposes the duty of disclosure upon \u201c[a]ny person in charge of a vessel or of an onshore facility or an offshore facility.\u201d The section further provides that the \u201cinformation obtained by the exploitation of such notification shall not be used against any such person in any criminal case . . . .\u201d Whether Mobil is entitled to the statutory immunity conferred depends, in turn, on whether Mobil was a \u201cperson in charge\u201d of the Vanderbilt facility within the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">While the WPCA does not describe the character of the proprietary function signified by the phrase \u201cin charge,\u201d it does describe the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the provisions of \u00a7 1161 extend. Under the Act a \u201cperson\u201d is any \u201cindividual, firm, <em>corporation, </em>association, or partnership\u201d (emphasis supplied). 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1161(a) (7). Thus the Mobil Oil Corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the WPCA. It remains to be decided whether Mobil, as owner of the Vanderbilt plant, was \u201cin charge\u201d of the facility at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">The answer to this question emerges from a consideration of the logic of the statute and the congressional purposes that give it form and substance. The structure of \u00a7 1161 suggests that the persons who are entitled to immunity are the persons who are required to make disclosure in the first instance. Thus, while the narrow issue presented on this appeal concerns entitlement to the statutory immunity, that issue is to be resolved in light of the policy and the scope of the statutory obligation. By requiring that certain persons disclose information concerning oil discharges, Congress took steps to ensure the timely discovery of abatable hazards and to facilitate the implementation of measures calculated to minimize pollution damage. Absent a requirement to report, discharges of small amounts of oil such as is the case here, might well go undetected or, at least, the possibility of abatement would be lessened.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This policy bears heavily on question of the class of persons to whom the provisions of the statute extend\u2014 that is, the \u201cpersons in charge\u201d of vessels and facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">The owner-operator of a vessel or a vacility has the capacity to make timely discovery of oil discharges. The owner-operator has power to direct the activities of persons who control the mechanisms causing the pollution. The owner-operator has the capacity to prevent and abate damage. Accordingly, the owner-operator of a facility governed by the WPCA, such as the Mobil facility here, must be regarded as a \u201cperson in charge\u201d of the facility for the purposes of \u00a7 1161. A more restrictive interpretation would frustrate congressional purpose by exempting from the operation of the Act a large class of persons who are uniquely qualified to assume the burden imposed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">We conclude that an owner-operator is \u201cin charge\u201d of his facility within the meaning of \u00a7 1161. It necessarily follows that a corporate owner, a \u201cperson\u201d within the statutory definition, is a \u201cperson in charge\u201d of the facilities it owns and operates and is thus entitled to the statutory immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>The government cites legislative history in support of its contention that a contrary result must be reached in this case. We view this history as inconclusive. Some of the materials asserted to be relevant in fact deal with the meaning of language which is not contained in the statute. Thus, materials which allegedly support the view that \u00a7 1161 extends only to natural persons (e. g., foremen, supervisors, individuals who are \u201coperationally in charge\u201d of vessels or facilities) were developed in respect of language contained in the House Bill, which spoke in terms of \u201cindividuals in charge\u201d, not \u201cpersons in charge.\u201d <em>See </em>H. Rep. No. 91-127, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 10 (1969) ; H. Rep. No. 91-940, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, p. 2691. Of course, the latter, broader phrase, which must be read in light of the comprehensive statutory definition of \u201cpersons,\u201d was the language finally adopted by Congress. Further, to the extent that legislative history does shed light on the meaning of \u201cpersons in charge,\u201d it suggests at the very most that Congress intended the provisions of \u00a7 1161 to extend, not to every person who might have knowledge of an oil discharge (mere employees, for example), but only to persons who occupy positions of responsibility and power. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 91-351, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1969); H. Rep. No. 91-940, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 34 (1970). Nothing in the legislative history suggests that owner-operators of vessels and facilities are not members of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The government contends further that for the purposes of determining the scope of the statutory immunity a corporate owner should be treated differently from an owner who is a natural person. The government maintains that this differentiation is warranted because the immunity provision of \u00a7 1161 is designed to insulate the enforcement of the statutory duty from the operation of Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Corporations, of course, do not enjoy that privilege. George Campbell Painting Corp. v. Reid, 1968, 392 U.S. 286, 88 S.Ct. 1978, 20 L. Ed.2d 1094. For this reason the government maintains that the statutory immunity should not be held to extend to corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">This argument ignores a second function of the immunity provision. Immunity insulates enforcement of the statutory duty from the operation of the constitutional privilege, but it also provides a valuable incentive for disclosure in the first instance. Thus, even where the constitution would permit the prosecution of a corporate owner on the basis of information the owner was compelled to disclose, the statute provides the assurance that the owner will not be harmed by incriminating evidence which the government obtains by exploiting the mandatory notice. Thus the immunity provision encourages the owner to comply with his statutory duty. The provision is an essential feature of the statutory scheme. To preserve the provision to the full extent of its intended function, the scope of statutory immunity must be held to extend to all persons covered by \u00a7 1161, whether they enjoy the constitutional privilege or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">Finally, we observe that nothing in this interpretation of the scope of the statutory immunity impairs the operation of substantive criminal prosecutions against the discharge of refuse into navigable waters of the United States. The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 remains intact. Indeed, it is preserved by a savings clause in the WPCA. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1174. We hold only that government may not, in the prosecution of offenses defined by the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, rely upon information obtained solely from the notice mandated by \u00a7 1161 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>from the exploitation thereof. Under the facts stipulated here, where there is no evidence against Mobil save what it disclosed or that which flowed from the disclosure, the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1161(b) (4) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-11\">(4) Any person in charge of a vessel or of an onshore facility or an offshore facility shall, as soon as he has knowledge of any discharge of oil from such vessel or facility in violation of paragraph (2) of this subsection, immediately notify the appropriate agency of the United States Government of such discharge.
