Appellant claims that the hemispherical items should be classified as other articles of metal which are not more specifically provided for elsewhere in the tariff schedules under item 657.20. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">The schedules and headnotes involved read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-5\">Schedule 6, Part 2, Subpart B:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-6\">\n<em>Subpart B headnotes:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-7\">1.

The tank heads were made by cutting a sheet of steel plate in a cold condition to a circular shape and then pressing the circular shape in a hydraulic press, with male and female dies, into a hemispherical shape. The resulting flange was cut off leaving a hemispherical article for subsequent use as tank heads or ends of 500-gallon pressure tanks. The imported articles are described on the entry invoice as steel plates, specifications ASTM A-285-C, cut and pressed to hemispherical shape. The above brief description of the imported tank heads and their method of manufacture is fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-30\">Appellant contends that the common meaning and the commercial meaning of the term \u201cangles, shapes, and sections\u201d in item 609.80 excludes articles such as the imported tank heads. It is appellant\u2019s position that the term \u201cangles, shapes, and sections\u201d is limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>to hot rolled and cold formed products of a basic steel mill. The trial court found, and we agree, that the purpose of part 2 of schedule 6 was to cover completely in an organized systematic manner, the classification of base metals. Headnote 3 (j) defines angles, shapes, and sections as products which do <em>not </em>conform completely to the respective specifications specifically set forth in the headnotes for blooms and billets, slabs and sheet bars, bars, wire rods, plates and sheets, strip, wire, rails, joint bars, or tie plates, and states that angles, shapes, and sections do not include any tubular products. The schedule for item 609.80 specifies angles, shapes, and sections, all of the foregoing, of iron or steel, hot rolled, forged, extruded, or drawn or cold formed or cold finished, whether or not drilled, punched, or otherwise advanced, and does not mention \u201cbasic steel mill.\u201d We find, as the evidence establishes, that the hemispherical product in this litigation is a \u201ccold formed shape.\u201d We further conclude that the tariff meaning in this case is plainly manifest, simple and clear. It is not necessary in such a situation to resort to dictionaries, textbooks, scientific treatises, governmental publications, the Tariff Classification Study, or the provisions of the Brussels Nomenclature. F. L. Smidth &amp; Co. v. United States, 409 F.2d 1369, 56 CCPA 77, C.A.D. 958 (1969). We find that the language of item 609.-80 is unambiguous in its coverage of the instant merchandise. The plain words of the statute, particularly the inclusion of cold formed shapes, refute appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cangles, shapes, and sections\u201d are limited to articles produced in a basic steel mill. The record contains ample evidence that angles, shapes, and sections may be formed in a rolling mill, and it is also clear that \u201cshapes\u201d may be produced by forging, extruding, drawing, and may be cold formed or cold finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Appellant also contends that the imported tank heads cannot be classified under Item 609.80 because they are not of uniform cross-section throughout their length and do not weigh over 0.29 pound per linear foot. The lower court weighed the conflicting testimony on this point and found that the presumption that the imported hemispherical shapes meet the TSUS weight specification was not overcome. We find that there is substantial evidence to support the lower court\u2019s finding on this issue and that its determination is not clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence. We will not disturb this finding. United States v. F. W. Myers &amp; Co., Inc., 45 CCPA 48, 52, C.A.D. 671 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">The presumption of correctness attaching to the classification in the instant case has not been overcome by appellant. The evidence here does not establish the impropriety of that classification nor does it establish the applicability of the specified alternative miscellaneous classification. United States v. National Starch Products, Inc., 318 F.2d 737, 50 CCPA 1, C.A.D. 809 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 923, 83 S.Ct. 1525, 10 L.Ed.2d 422 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">WORLEY, C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
