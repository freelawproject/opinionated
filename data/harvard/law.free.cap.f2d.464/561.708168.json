Noriega-Arjona argues that he is eligible for parole or for resentencing under the provisions of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse, Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Public Law 91-513. We disagree and affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-28\">Noriega-Arjona was convicted on February 4, 1970 under a five-count indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ment of illegal importation and sale of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a). On March 5, 1970 he was sentenced to five years in prison without possibility of parole on each of the five counts, the sentences to run concurrently. Five years\u2019 imprisonment without the possibility of parole was then the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">On October 27, 1970 Congress passed the Comprehensive Drug Act, which repealed the statutory provisions denying parole and imposing a minimum five-year sentence under which Noriega-Arjona was sentenced. However, the Act\u2019s effective date was May 1, 1971. And although the Act\u2019s sentencing provisions are available to narcotics offenders who ar\u00e9 sentenced after May 1, 1971, prisoners who were sentenced prior to the effective repeal of \u00a7\u00a7 174 and 7237 are still ineligible for a suspended sentence and probation or for parole. Compare United States v. Fithian, 452 F.2d 505 (9th Cir. 1971) and United States v. Stephens, 449 F.2d 103 (9th Cir. 1971), in which the prisoners were sentenced after May 1, 1971, with United States v. Pregerson, 448 F.2d 404 (9th Cir. 1971), in which the prisoner was sentenced before May 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
