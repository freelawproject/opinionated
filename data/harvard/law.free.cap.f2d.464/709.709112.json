United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 and Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Comm. of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 92 S.Ct. 1670, 32 L. Ed.2d 234. These decisions overrule this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination in immunity cases. Accordingly, we withdraw our order of February 3, 1972, and substitute this opinion and judgment. <em>See </em>United States v. Cropper, 5 Cir. 1971, 454 F.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">On August 19, 1971, a jury found Jon Joseph Kelly guilty on four counts <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1) (a) which prohibits unlawful interception of wire communications. On September 9, 1971, Kelly was sentenced to three years imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed by this Court on June 12, 1972.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">On December 6, 1971, the Government subpoenaed Kelly to appear before a federal grand jury on December 9, 1971. Kelly appeared at the appointed hour and was questioned by an Assistant United States Attorney. The grand jury was investigating possible violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511, and the questions propounded to Kelly concerned the acts which led to Kelly\u2019s substantive conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1) (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Kelly refused to answer, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>On the same day, the Government filed, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> an \u201cApplication for Order Compelling Testimony\u201d. On December 13, 1971, after two hearings, the district court issued an order requiring Kelly to answer the Government\u2019s questions before the grand jury and granting him immunity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kelly appeared before the grand jury the same day and again refused to answer questions, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The Government filed with the district court a \u201cMotion to Confine Recalcitrant Witness\u201d. On January 3, 1972, the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 found Kelly in contempt of court and ordered him confined during the term of the grand jury or until he agreed to testify. The district court stayed its own order until January 11, 1972. A notice of appeal was filed on January 4, 1972, and, on January 7, 1972, this Court stayed the district court\u2019s order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 requires the Court to decide Kelly\u2019s appeal within thirty days. On February 3, 1972, this panel, Judge Godbold dissenting, issued an order announcing its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">On appeal, Kelly argued that the district court\u2019s order did not grant him full transactional immunity in that it did not preclude the Government from retrying him \u2014 in the event of reversal of his substantive conviction. The Government\u2019s brief does indicate that the grant of immunity would not necessarily have pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>tected Kelly from retrial. Kelly contended that a grant of immunity which did not protect him from retrial was in reality only a grant of \u201cuse immunity\u201d rather than \u201ctransactional immunity\u201d, which was required to protect his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In Kastigar v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine \u201cwhether the United States Government may compel testimony from an unwilling witness, who invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, by conferring on the witness immunity from use of the compelled testimony in subsequent criminal proceedings, as well as immunity from use of evidence derived from the testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 92 S.Ct. 1653. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">We hold that such immunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, and therefore is sufficient to compel testimony over a claim of the privilege. While a grant of immunity must afford protection commensurate with that afforded by the privilege, it need not be broader. Transactional immunity, which accords full immunity from prosecution for the offense to which the compelled testimony relates, affords the witness considerably broader protection than does the Fifth Amendment privilege. The privilege has never been construed to mean that one who invokes it cannot subsequently be prosecuted. Its sole concern is to afford protection against being \u201cforced to give testimony leading to the infliction of \u2018penalties affixed to criminal acts.\u2019 \u201d [Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 438-439, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956), quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 634, 6 S. Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886)]. Immunity from the use of compelled testimony and evidence derived directly and indirectly therefrom affords this protection. It prohibits the prosecutorial authorities from using the compelled testimony in any respect, and it therefore insures that the testimony cannot lead to the infliction of criminal penalties on the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">92 S.Ct. 1661.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">We hold that the immunity order issued by the district court in the present case was, under <em>Kastigar, </em>sufficient to protect Kelly\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">We emphasize, however, as the Supreme Court did in <em>Kastigar, </em>that the Fifth Amendment requires not only that the compelled testimony not be used against the witness but imposes a \u201ctotal prohibition on use . . . barring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the use of compelled testimony as an \u2018investigatory lead,\u2019 and also barring the use of any evidence obtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosure.\u201d 92 S.Ct. 1664.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">A person accorded this immunity . and subsequently prosecuted, is not dependent for the preservation of his rights upon the integrity and good faith of the prosecuting authorities. As stated in <em>Murphy </em>[Murphy v. Waterfront Comm., 378 U.S. 52, 84 S. Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201cOnce a defendant demonstrates that he has testified, under a state grant of immunity, to matters related to the federal prosecution, the federal authorities have the burden of showing that their evidence is not tainted by establishing that they had an independent, legitimate source for the disputed evidence.\u201d 378 U.S., at 79, n. 18 [84 S.Ct. at 1609],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">This burden of proof, which we reaffirm as appropriate, is not limited to a negation of taint; rather, it imposes on the prosecution the affirmative duty to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">92 S.Ct. 1665.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Kelly contended, next, that the immunity order, even if use immunity is constitutionally acceptable, was insufficient to protect his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in that it did not even provide for use immunity. He argued that the Government may not, even under a grant of use immunity, compel a witness to testify about acts which led to a substantive conviction which is on appeal at the time the witness is compelled to testify. Kelly contended that in effect he would be forced to aid the prosecution in preparing its appellate case against him. This, Kelly argued, is what the Fifth Amendment privilege was designed to prevent, citing Frank v. United States, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 392, 347 F.2d 486, 491, cert. dismissed 382 U.S. 923, 86 S.Ct. 317, 15 L.Ed.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Kelly\u2019s argument, and his reliance on Frank v. United States, supra, is precluded by footnote 3 in Katz v. United States, 1967, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576. Footnote 3 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-13\">We find no merit in the petitioner\u2019s further suggestion that his indictment must be dismissed. After his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, he testified before a federal grand jury concerning the charges involved here. Because he was compelled to testify pursuant to a grant of immunity, 48 Stat. 1096, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409(7), it is clear that the fruit of his testimony cannot be used against him in any future trial. But the petitioner asks for more. He contends that his conviction must be vacated and the charges against him dismissed lest he be \u201csubjected to [a] penalty ... on account of [a] . . . matter . . . concerning which he [was] compelled ... to testify . . . .\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409(f) Frank v. United States, [120 U.S.App. D.C. 392], 347 F.2d 486. We disagree. In relevant part, \u00a7 409(0 substantially repeats the language of the Compulsory Testimony Act of 1893, 27 Stat. 443, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, which was Congress\u2019 response to this Court\u2019s statement that an immunity statute can .supplant the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination only if it affords adequate protection from future prosecution or conviction. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 585-586, 12 S.Ct. 195 [206-207], 35 L.Ed. 1110, 1121, 1122. The statutory provision here involved was designed to provide such protection, see Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41, 45-46, 79 S.Ct. 539 [543-544], 3 L.Ed. 2d 609, 613, 614, not to confer immunity from punishment pursuant to a pri- or prosecution and adjudication of guilt. Cf. Reina v. United States, 364 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>U.S. 507, 513-514, 81 S.Ct. 260 [264-265], 5 L.Ed.2d 249, 255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">389 U.S. at 349, 88 S.Ct. at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Footnote 3, when read in the context of this Court\u2019s treatment of the <em>Katz </em>case, refutes Kelly\u2019s contention. After his substantive conviction in California, Katz was subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida. He claimed the privilege against self-incrimination and was granted immunity under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409 <em>(l). </em>When Katz refused to answer questions before the grand jury, he was brought before the district court, where his counsel insisted, relying on Frank v. United States, that Katz was entitled, under the grant of immunity, to an assurance or stipulation by the Government that the Ninth Circuit conviction be vacated and the indictment be dismissed with prejudice. The district judge ruled to the contrary and judged Katz in contempt. On appeal, this Court, to which Frank v. United States was cited and to which arguments identical with those made in the present case were made, denied a motion for a stay. When the grand jury was dissolved, Katz was released and after a new grand jury was impaneled, he was again summoned to appear. This time, he appeared and testified under the previous grant of immunity. On appeal from the substantive conviction to the United States Supreme Court, Katz again relied on Frank v. United States. The Supreme Court answered with footnote 3. <em>See also </em>Federal Trade Commission v. Gladstone, 5 Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Because our decision relies upon a Supreme Court decision at odds with the previous law of this Circuit, we suggest to the district court that it consider giving Kelly an opportunity to purge himself of contempt by answering the Government\u2019s questions before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The Court\u2019s order in this cause dated February 3, 1972, is vacated. The Appeal is dismissed and the district court\u2019s order of January 3, 1972, reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\">. \u00a7 1826.

Whenever in the judgment of a United States attorney the testimony of any witness, or the production of books, papers, or other evidence by any witness, in any case or proceeding before any grand jury or court of the United States involving any violation of this chapter or any of the offenses enumerated in section 2516, or any conspiracy to violate this chapter or any of the offenses enumerated in section 2516 is necessary to the public interest, such United States attorney, upon the approval of the Attorney General, shall make application to the court that the witness shall be instructed to testify or produce evidence subject to the provisions of this section, and upon order of the court such witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, papers, or other evidence on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture.

The phrase \u201cuse immunity\u2019\u2019 is shorthand used to describe a statute under which the grant of immunity to the witness guarantees only that his testimony (or other information derived from that testimony) will not be used against him in any future criminal prosecution. Use immunity statutes do not, however, prohibit future criminal prosecutions. If independent evidence of guilt is found by the government, the witness can be tried and convicted of the crime about which he was questioned under the grant of immunity. Transactional immunity statutes, on the other hand, grant an absolute immunity from any future prosecution for crimes arising from any transaction about which the witness is questioned and testifies.
