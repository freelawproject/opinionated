They alleged (i) denial of the right to have legal documents notarized in their presence and to retain such notarized documents in their possession, (ii) denial of outdoor yard, movie and canteen privileges, (iii) denial of clean razors and shaving mirrors, and (iv) de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>nial of the right to assemble together for religious services. The District Court, finding the allegations frivolous, denied permission to file the complaint in forma pauperis. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\"> When a State prisoner asserts a claim which, if proven, could potentially evolve into a substantial Federal question of constitutional proportions, he is ordinarily entitled to an opportunity to prove his allegations. Williams v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1972, 461 F.2d 1080 and companion cases. Here, however, even conceding the truth of each of the allegations, we cannot conclude that any of them involve actual or potential constitutional significance. If corrections are required, they must be implemented by the appropriate prison officials. Granville v. Hunt, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 9, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-14\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this case summarily.
