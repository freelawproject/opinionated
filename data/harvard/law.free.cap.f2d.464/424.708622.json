Carson appeals from his convictions, following a jury trial, for conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in furtherance of bribery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and for perjury before a federal grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While our decision to affirm appellant\u2019s convictions turns on the interpretation of technical language of the criminal code, the result obtaining has certain precedential value concerning interrelationships of influence between the Congress and the Executive. Thus we review the pertinent facts of the ease with some particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In the fall of 1970, co-defendant Joseph Bald and one Michael Hellerman discovered they were under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York in connection with certain stock transactions. At Hellerman\u2019s suggestion and with the help of co-conspirator Harold Blond, Bald in November 1970 met with a New Yorker named Edward \u201cEddie\u201d Adams, an older gentleman who supposedly carried a lot of political influence in Washington, to attempt to arrange a \u201cfix\u201d on the investigations. Adams was agreeable, but indicated the \u201cfix\u201d would be costly ($50,000-$100,000) and that he, Adams, would need \u201cfront\u201d or \u201cseed\u201d money of between $2,000 and $2,500. Bald, however, would not part with seed money until there was assurance that some success to the venture would be in the offing. Adams then said he would try to introduce Bald to appellant Carson, who was the Administrative Assistant to United States Senator Hiram Fong, and he indicated that the big money would go to Senator Fong<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cto individuals in the Justice Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">As a result of Adams\u2019 effort, in mid-November Bald and Hellerman met in Washington, at Senator Fong\u2019s office and at the Senate cafeteria, with Carson. Hellerman allegedly told Carson of the investigations, that indictments were expected shortly, and that if Carson could \u201csquash\u201d all the SEC matters, \u201cwe will pay you $1,000,000.\u201d Carson inquired about the identity of the Assistant United States Attorney who was involved and whether the indictments could be delayed. Hellerman told him the name and that delay was unlikely. Indeed, in November 1970 an indictment charging various violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the Southern District of New York [United States v. Dioguardi, 70 Crim. No. 967 (S.D.N.Y., filed Nov. 19, 1970)] against Hellerman, 15 other defendants and Bald as a co-conspirator. The next day Adams related to Blond that Carson had informed him that he (Carson) was disturbed about the people indicted and, at best, that he could help only Hellerman and Bald.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">On November 24, 1970, appellant Carson met with (then) Deputy Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>General Richard Kleindienst at the Department of Justice in Washington. At Carson\u2019s trial, Kleindienst testified that the meeting lasted 15 minutes, the first minute or two of which he described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">Well, after we had exchanged pleasantries, Mr. Carson sat down in a chair in front of my desk and said that he had a friend in New York who was in trouble, and that if I could help him with respect to his trouble, his friend was a man of substantial means and would be willing to make a substantial contribution of between fifty and one hundred thousand dollars to the reelection of President Nixon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">I asked him what kind of trouble this man had. Mr. Carson said that he was under indictment for federal offenses, and I said that under no circumstances could I do anything about the matter, even look into it, as a result of the fact that a grand jury had returned an indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">That was just about all the conversation that existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">We immediately thereafter \u2014 we turned the subject matter to other matters [which Kleindienst thereafter testified concerned a judicial appointment from the State of Hawaii]. . <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Not long after the filing of the indictment, Hellerman informed Bald that he had someone who would furnish the large sum necessary to fix the case and that he wanted that person to meet Adams. Again through the intercession of Blond, Bald and Adams held a meeting, at which Bald said that Adams should forget about the 15 defendants, helping only Bald and Hellerman, and that he wanted Adams to meet the money man, who would be willing to pay $200,000. Adams again wanted \u201cseed money,\u201d but Bald put him off; thereafter, a rendezvous was arranged for November 29, 1970, at LaGuardia Airport, to discuss the fix.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Bald, Blond and Hellerman arrived at the airport before Adams did, and Hellerman, now aiding the Government, brought with him FBI Special Agent Paul Brana, whom he introduced to the others as Paul Bicera, the sponsor of the fix. Brana pretended skepticism of Adams\u2019 influence, which Blond offset with name-dropping and a tale of Adams\u2019 political influence record in Washington. Blond also told Brana that Senator Fong was a member of the Judiciary Committee and could handle the matter; that at the first meeting of Carson, Bald and Hellerman, Hellerman was mistaken in mentioning $1 million; and that a fix on the pending indictment and any future indictments would cost $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Adams then joined the other four at the airport and explained to Brana that he knew all about the case, that Carson had not had time to act on the first indictment, that Senator Fong was indeed influential as a member of the Judiciary Committee and that both Senator Fong and Attorney General Mitchell had given their handshakes on the matter. Brana again portrayed skepticism, and Adams said he would set up a meeting between Carson and Brana so the latter could be personally persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">On December 1, 1970, Blond, Adams and Brana, who was wearing a recording device, flew from New York to Washington and met with Carson in Senator Fong\u2019s office. Following introductions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Carson stated that he had previously been told that \u201che [apparently Heller-man] had a means in which he could hold off the prosecutor\u201d on the indictment. Had they been successful, he added, \u201cwe might have been able to do something. The next day it hit the papers and for us to ask for the case from New York after it hit the papers then all of the newspapers would wonder why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The tape from the recording device on Brana\u2019s person then revealed a conversation between Brana and Carson, in which Carson convinced Brana that nothing could be done about the matter owing to the involvement of the other defendants and of the Assistant United States Attorney, which made the case \u201ctoo hot.\u201d In the following taped discussion, Carson alluded to possible future leniency and to his earlier talk with the Deputy Attorney General:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">Brana: In other words it\u2019s a dead issue. Is that what you are saying in fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Carson: Later on we might be able to do something for these two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">Brana: But as far as the two fellows we are interested in there is no chance to get it squashed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">Carson: No, and that\u2019s from the top man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">Brana: That\u2019s from the top man? Okay, what more can we say. We tried and we appreciate your efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-15\">Carson: . . . [I]f he feels that he wants me to make inquiries, my advice right now is don\u2019t waste your energy and your money, save them for the possibility that sometime you might be doing some good with it. I don\u2019t care who you go to now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-17\">After the meeting Brana told Adams that the $200,000 had not been deposited in a bank as previously arranged. Adams left Blond and Brana, who returned to New York; on the trip Brana first learned that he was supposed to have brought $2,000 to give to Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">On December 22, 1970, Bald, Heller-man and Brana met at a New York restaurant. Bald told Brana that he was concerned about the possibility of new indictments and that Brana should make the $200,000 bank deposit in anticipation of another meeting in Washington that Adams was going to arrange. Two days later Brana met with Hellerman and Adams in New York; Adams reported that Carson could take care of the new indictments and that \u201cthe new price for the handling of the indictments would be $100,000 and that a schedule could be worked out between Mr. Carson and [Brana] depending upon what Mr. Carson could do for us.\u201d Brana then gave Adams $200 expense money that Adams requested of him, and also showed him $2,500, which was to be given to Carson. Arrangements were made for making another appointment with Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\">On December 29, 1970, Brana, again equipped with a recording device, flew to Washington and met Adams at a hotel. There Adams asked him for another $200 expense money and for the $2,500 for Carson. Brana gave both to Adams after Adams said he would give the $2,500 to Carson in Brana\u2019s presence. Upon meeting Carson in Senator Fong\u2019s office, Adams immediately handed him the $2,-500 cash. Carson asked, \u201cFor the [inaudible on the tape] Senator?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">Carson testified that the $2,500 was a campaign contribution for Senator Fong from one Robert Brinsmade. The cash payment, according to Carson, was made after he [Carson] had earlier returned as improper a corporate check made payable to \u201cCash,\u201d signed by Brinsmade and given to Carson by Adams. Brinsmade was not called to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">The defendant contended at the trial that the tape then disclosed Adams\u2019 voice saying \u201cMr. Carson,\u201d with Carson replying, \u201cFine, thank you very much.\u201d The Government\u2019s version of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tape, supported by the testimony of Agent Brana, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">Adams: Mr. Carson, for you sir</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">Carson: Fine</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Adams: For Christmas</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">Carson: Thank you</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">Adams: Look</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">Carson: Very much</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Thereafter a discussion ensued in which Brana explained that he was there for the same purpose as before, but that new indictments were expected. He stated that the leniency Carson had discussed at their first meeting would surely be impossible if the men were indicted again. Carson switched the subject for a moment, and then inquired about the status of the new charges, particularly against Bald. Brana stated that Bald thought he was going to be indicted, and said to Carson: \u201cNow Mr. Adams indicated that you could possibly work through, you know, whoever handles those matters, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Carson replied, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know and you don\u2019t want to know [inaudible on tape].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">Carson then indicated that he was not sure that he could do anything for Brana\u2019s friends as the matter might be \u201cover my head,\u201d and in view of the involvement of the \u201cUnited States Attorney\u2019s office up in New York.\u201d He stated, however, that he needed to know whether the new indictments had been handed down, and when Brana told him Bald thought they were in preparation, Carson said, \u201cLet me work on that,\u201d and, \u201cWell we\u2019ll find out what we can do, if we can do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Thereafter the subject turned to money, and the tapes revealed the following conversation: <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">Brana: a lot of money involved right, we\u2019re not talking $10,-000 right, we just put 2500 down, we\u2019re talking, you know you originally come to me and were talking $200,-000 right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-16\">Adams: No, No,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhC\">Brana: That was the original figure that was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzRI\">Adams: Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q\">Brana: quoted to me</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-\">Adams: No, hundred</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUK\">Brana: Now it\u2019s a hundred thousand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWy\">Carson: Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azx\">Brana: and this actually what it is an investment. We\u2019re putting up front money but ah</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYr\">Carson: Well I don\u2019t want [inaudible] any strings attached</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGM\">Brana: No, no strings attached whatsoever, the only you know, I mean you\u2019re trying to do something for us and uh but you know I\u2019d like to get some idea as to how, uh you know, like supposen that you can handle it, the indictments, the SEC indictments and there\u2019s leniency and maybe the guy does six months, I\u2019d like to know what the arrangements would be for payments or what you would expect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2P\">Carson: It will be all spelled out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASE\">Brana: OK. Very good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-26\">The next day, December 30, 1970, Carson was served with a subpoena to appear before a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York on January 6, 1971. As a witness before the grand jury Carson was told that the investigation concerned potential crimes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>conspiracy and bribery of public officials, and was advised of his constitutional rights and that he may be a target of the investigation. In his testimony Carson denied knowing Hellerman, Bald, Adams and Bicera (Agent Brana\u2019s undercover name), and, when shown a pho-. tograph of Brana, denied recognizing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In this court, appellant\u2019s principal attack is directed toward the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury concerning conspiracy to commit bribery<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and especially its failure to define clearly the term \u201cofficial act\u201d as found in the bribery statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its main charge on the conspiracy count, the court read 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b), which applies-to the offering or giving of a bribe, and \u00a7 201(c) which applies to soliciting or receiving a bribe, but did not read the definition of or otherwise define \u201cofficial act\u201d as found in \u00a7 201(a) and used in \u00a7 201(b) (1). The court further instructed the jury that it could find the existence of a conspiracy if it found, <em>inter alia, </em>a purpose of the conspiracy was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">to influence either Mr. Robert Carson, as Senator Fong\u2019s administrative assistant, or Mr. Kleindienst as Deputy Attorney General, or any other official of the Department of Justice to do anything to discontinue or attempt to quash ... a prosecution of a case pending ... in the Southern District of New York, and it was the intention to do that either by offering or giving money to Carson or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>by Carson\u2019s taking of money to give to anyone else, or to use as a political contribution ....<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdW\">After deliberating for approximately 13 hours, the jury sent a note to the trial court requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>clarification of the definition of bribery and the role played therein by the term \u201cpublic\u201d (meaning \u201cofficial\u201d) act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Following a discussion of the jury\u2019s questions and his proposed answers with counsel, the court in a supplemental charge read to the jury 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b) and the \u201cofficial act\u201d definition from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a). In response to jury question number 4, note 8 <em>supra, </em>which was directed to the scope of the term \u201cofficial act,\u201d the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">It is not necessary to find that the action or result sought by whoever hypothetically gives the bribe is something that was in fact within the power of the official in question. It would not be possible, on the other hand, for you to find a case of bribery if the action sought was so far outside the purview of the official\u2019s duties or possible power or possible authority that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>be unreasonable for any reasonable man to have supposed he could have done anything about that particular subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The court also presented hypothetical situations involving bribery and the conduct of official acts. Shortly after the giving of the supplemental charge, the jury brought in its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Appellant\u2019s principal claim, in summation of all the foregoing, is that he was improperly convicted because the charge permitted the jury to convict if it found solely that a purpose of the conspiracy was to influence Carson, as an Administrative Assistant, by the offer of money to him for the purpose of quashing the prosecution or obtaining leniency. Carson does not deny that on the evidence he properly could have been convicted of conspiring to bribe the Deputy Attorney General to quash the prosecution. He contends, rather, that he may have been convicted for conspiracy to take a bribe to exert his personal influence as a congressional aide to achieve the illegal objective. Personal influence, he claims, is not within the scope of the bribery statute, for it is inconsistent with the term \u201cofficial act.\u201d Appellant, therefore, contends that the court should have charged the jury to acquit if the action sought were \u201cso far outside the purview of the official\u2019s <em>official </em>duties or possible <em>official </em>power . . . \u201d and should have emphasized that the mere fact that one is an official and has <em>political </em>or other type of <em>unofficial, </em>personal influence does not satisfy the requirements of the bribery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The Government rightfully asserts that appellant\u2019s attack on the court\u2019s charge is untimely. He did not request a charge defining \u201cofficial act\u201d or distinguishing between \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cpersonal\u201d influence; his only objection on point at the close of the main charge was so general as to be unavailing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he consented to the reading of the bribery statute and its definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d in the supplemental charge, and he did not take an exception at the close of the supplemental charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ordinarily, of course, appellant would thus be precluded from objecting to instructions for the first time on appeal. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30; <em>see </em>United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965) (en banc), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">We do inquire, however, whether the charge was plainly erroneous under Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). The parties agree that appellant properly could have been convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b), that is, for conspiring to offer a bribe to Kleindienst for the purpose of terminating or otherwise influencing the prosecutions. If, however, the jury believed Carson\u2019s recollection of his conversation with Kleindienst, see note 3 <em>supra, </em>which would no doubt lead them to disbelieve the Government\u2019s theory that Carson had conspired to bribe Kleindienst, both of which draw support from the jury\u2019s questions, see note 8 <em>supra, </em>appellant\u2019s conviction could be based only upon the charge under \u00a7 201(c), that Carson himself conspired to take a bribe in return for exerting his own influence for the illegal purposes. In the same light, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>while a conviction under \u00a7 201(c) (2) (based on fraud) would nevertheless be quite proper on the evidence, the same under \u00a7 201(c) (1) or (3) would necessitate a clear understanding on the part of the jury of the meaning of \u201cofficial act\u201d [(1)] and \u201cact in violation of his official duty\u201d [(3)].</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The wording of the statutory definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d (which was read to the jury) nearly upsets appellant\u2019s argument at the start. Such an act is \u201cany decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d at any time which might \u201cby law be brought before any public official, in his official capacity, or in his place of trust or profit.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a). Yet appellant contends that any bribe he might have been found to have taken could only be one in return for his being influenced in his personal or political capacity and in the performance of a personal act. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c) (1), note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The terms of the written definition of official act have not been altered to any substantial extent since their origin in the Act of July 13, 1866, ch. 184, \u00a7 62, 14 Stat. 168. In 1962 Congress consolidated the various prior criminal statutes dealing with bribery into section 201, with the stated purpose of making, in the words of the Senate Report, \u201cno significant changes of substance and, more particularly, [not restricting] the broad scope of the present bribery statutes as construed by the courts.\u201d 1962 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 3852, 3853.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">There is no doubt that federal bribery statutes have been construed to cover any situation in which the advice or recommendation of a Government employee would be influential, irrespective of the employee\u2019s specific authority (or lack of same) to make a binding decision. <em>See </em>United States v. Heffler, 402 F.2d 924 (3rd Cir. 1968), cert. denied, Cecchini v. United States, 394 U.S. 946, 89 S.Ct. 1280, 22 L.Ed.2d 480 (1969); Parks v. United States, 355 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1965); United States v. Labovitz, 251 F.2d 393 (3rd Cir. 1958); Wilson v. United States, 230 F.2d 521 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 351 U.S. 931, 76 S.Ct. 789, 100 L.Ed. 1460 (1956); Krogmann v. United States, 225 F.2d 220, 225 (6th Cir. 1955); Hurley v.

The policy foundation on which this interpretive approach rests is central to the administration of justice at all levels of representative democracy :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">It is a major concern of organized society that the community have the benefit of objective evaluation and unbiased judgment on the part of those who participate in the making of official decisions. Therefore, society deals sternly with bribery which would substitute the will of an interested person for the judgment of a public official as the controlling factor in official decision. The statute plainly proscribes such corrupt interference with the normal and proper functioning of government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">United States v. Heffler, <em>supra, </em>402 F.2d at 926, quoting United States v. Labovitz, <em>supra, </em>251 F.2d at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">While \u201c[n]ot every person performing any service for the government, however humble, is embraced within the terms\u201d of the bribery statute, Krichman v. United States, 256 U.S. 363, 366, 41 S.Ct. 514, 515, 65 L.Ed. 992 (1921), appellant, as an administrative assistant to a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, clearly is, in a situation in which his influence in connection with federal criminal charges or penalties is sought. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a). The United States Supreme Court, in United States v. Birdsall, 233 U.S. 223, 230-231, 34 S.Ct. 512, 514, 58 L.Ed. 930 (1914) (citations omitted), has written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">Every action that is within the range of official duty comes within the purview of these sections [antecedents of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b), (c)]. . To constitute it official action, it was not necessary that it should be prescribed by statute; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>was sufficient that it was governed by a lawful requirement of the Department under whose authority the officer was acting. Nor was it necessary that the requirement should be prescribed by a written rule or regulation. It might also be found in an established usage which constituted the common law of the Department and fixed the duties of those engaged in its activities. ... In numerous instances, duties not completely defined by written rules are clearly established by settled practice, and action taken in the course of their performance must be regarded as within the provisions of the above-mentioned statutes against bribery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Appellant testified that as a part of his job and under the applicable \u201cprocedure that goes on at Capitol Hill,\u201d he as an administrative assistant to Senator Fong would exert influence \u2022 on various agencies and branches of the Government \u201cwithout any strings attached.\u201d This would be done on behalf of the Senator\u2019s constituents and political contributors and their friends to help them with their problems. In this case, however, appellant argues that if he did accept a bribe to help the \u201cfriends\u201d here involved, through the use of influence, he was embarking not on an official act but merely on a \u201cpersonal frolic of his own,\u201d quoting the unrelated case of United States v. Cho Po Sun, 409 F.2d 489, 491 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 864, 90 S.Ct. 140, 24 L.Ed.2d 118 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention is misguided. That administrative assistants as part of their \u201cduties\u201d exert the influence inherent in their employment relationship with members of Congress appears \u201cclearly established by settled practice,\u201d in the language of United States v. Birdsall, <em>supra, </em>233 U.S. at 231, 34 S.Ct. 512.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the objective of the use of influence here might be categorized as \u201cpersonal,\u201d the determinative factor is that the primary source of any conceivable influence on the Justice Department was the official position held by appellant, enhanced as it was by the status of his employer\u2019s membership in the one most powerful congressional committee affecting that Department\u2019s operations. It cannot be forgotten that the Attorney General\u2019s authority over federal criminal prosecutions is the broadest, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 509, 516, but also involves ultimate responsibility for the administration of \u201call Federal penal and correctional institutions.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">It is the corruption of official positions through misuse of influence in governmental decision-making which the bribery statutes make criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The evidence, especially the tape recordings of December 29, convinces us that it would not be unreasonable for the jury to have believed that Carson conspired to accept a bribe in return for an unlawful exertion of the influence inherent in his official position as a member of the staff of a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Apparently he, and those bribing him, thought he had access to the Justice Department through his position that would enable him to alleviate, if not altogether quash, pending Justice Department action or bring about lenient post-conviction treatment. Thus, while the court\u2019s charge as to official act may have been narrow in terms of what it could have been if the language of <em>Birdsell, supra, </em>233 U.S. at 230-231, 34 S.Ct. 512, had been utilized, we hold that the charge was in no manner misleading and that appellant\u2019s conduct herein constituted an official act within the meaning of the bribery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Also in relation to the conspiracy-count (Count One), appellant maintains that the moving papers were duplicitous in that the single count charged both (1) that the defendants conspired to quash an investigation and a pending indictment by offering a $100,000 political contribution to the Deputy Attorney General of the United States ;\u2022 and (2) that the conspirators agreed to pay $2,500 to appellant to obtain leniency for Joseph Bald and to prevent further indictments. A pretrial objection on this ground was made in a motion to dismiss, and appellant requested on the eve of trial that the Government be required to elect which conspiracy it would prosecute. The court below denied the motion and the request, results with which we agree. It is well settled that \u201c[t]he allegation in a single count of a conspiracy to commit several crimes is not duplicitous, for \u2018The conspiracy is the crime, and that is one, however diverse its objects.\u2019 \u201d Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 54, 63 S.Ct. 99, 102, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942) (citations omitted); cf. United States v. Barash, 412 F.2d 26, 34-37 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 832, 90 S.Ct. 86, 24 L.Ed.2d 82 (1969). See also United States v. Lubomski, 277 F.Supp. 713, 716-719 (N.D.Ill.1967); 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 142, at 306-10 &amp; cases cited 310 n. 20 (1969). Count One set forth two means, which fell within alternative provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, by which the Government contended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the conspiracy statute, was violated; hence, it was not duplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Another of appellant\u2019s contentions is that he was deprived of a fair trial as a result of certain testimony given by then Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst. Apparently to convince the jury that appellant had not attempted to offer a bribe to Kleindienst on November 24, 1970, defense counsel on cross-examination elicited from Kleindienst that he had made no report of that day\u2019s conversation with Carson until a week later, after he had been shown, on December 1, 1970, a memorandum from the Director of the FBI to the Attorney General about an investigation involving Carson. Kleindienst then testified that on November 24, 1970, he did not think that in their conversation Carson had offered him a bribe, and that had he thought so, he would have reported it immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">On redirect examination the trial judge disallowed questions relating to the nature of the information contained in the FBI memorandum. Kleindienst then responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cAfter learning what you learned on December 1, 1970 with regard to the fact that there was an investigation involving Mr. Carson, did you then consider what had happened on November 24th to have been a bribe offer?\u201d Although defense counsel made no objection to this testimony at the time it was given, appellant now argues that because it was based on hearsay and called for Kleindienst\u2019s opinion as to whether appellant was guilty of the crime charged, the testimony was so extremely prejudicial and violative of appellant\u2019s sixth amendment confrontation rights as to deny him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The question on redirect, unlike that on cross-examination, undoubtedly was prejudicial; furthermore, it called for a statement of opinion based not upon personal observation but upon inadmissible hearsay evidence, <em>i. e., </em>the government memorandum. Hence, the answer elicited was not qualified by knowledge and was objectionable. <em>See </em>2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 657, at 762 (3rd ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">We do not find plain error in this admission, however. The question arose on redirect. It was in rebuttal to a matter probed on cross-examination, seeking to cast doubt on the witness\u2019s credibility at trial. It ill behooves the defense to argue prejudice here, having failed to object to the improper question on redirect, when the reach of the cross-examination invited, if not required, explana\"<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tion by the witness of his failure to recognize in the first instance an approach which the Government now was prosecuting as an attempt to bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Appellant raises two novel claims to defeat his conviction for perjury. The first is that his invocation of his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination before the grand jury, just after his perjurious testimony, amounted to an implicit recantation of those prior responses. This argument is wholly devoid of substance. There is no real evidence that appellant testified mistakenly <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or carelessly, and hence United States v. Norris, 300 U.S. 564, 57 S.Ct. 535, 81 L.Ed. 808 (1937), stands squarely in his way; moreover, as the Government correctly points out, assertion of the fifth amendment privilege does not by itself imply any fact. <em>See </em>Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 415-424, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The second claim is that since the prosecution had the tape recordings of the conversations held in Senator Fong\u2019s office as well as the testimony of Brana and Hellerman, there was no doubt whatsoever that appellant had met the persons inquired about, and therefore appellant\u2019s answers to the questions were not material to the grand jury investigation. Appellant misunderstands the purpose and operation of the perjury statute, 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 1621. \u201cEssentially, the statute punishes lying under oath before a federal official or tribunal . . . . To be within the reach of section 1621, the lies must be material, which in this case means that \u2018the false testimony . . . [must have] a natural effect or tendency to influence, impede or dissuade the grand jury from pursuing its investigation.\u2019 \u201d United States v. McFarland, 371 F.2d 701, 703 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 906, 87 S.Ct. 1689, 18 L.Ed.2d 624 (1967); United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653, 665 (2d Cir. 1965). The \u201cnatural effect or tendency\u201d obviously flows from an assumption on the part of the speaker that the tribunal will believe what he says. On this basis materiality refers to the connection between the words said only by the accused and the objective of the investigation; other testimony which the grand jury has heard, except as it may tend to delimit the objective of the inquiry, is therefore irrelevant to a determination of materiality. And we think it equally obvious that had appellant\u2019s false statements been believed, the natural effect would have been to impede the grand jury\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Appellant raises several additional claims which do not warrant extended discussion. His claim that the refusal of the trial court to sever the perjury count from the remaining counts of the indictment deprived him of a fair trial is controlled by United States v. Sweig, 441 F.2d 114, 118-119 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 2256, 29 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971). There as here the. commonality of proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permitted joinder of the offenses under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a) and denial of appellant\u2019s Rule 14 pretrial motion for severance. Furthermore, since appellant failed to renew his motion for severance of the counts on the eve of the trial, there is authority that he may not raise the claim on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Appellant next asserts, with reference to the tape recordings and transcripts of them, that the trial court erred: (1) in admitting the tapes into evidence; (2) in not instructing the jury that they could reject the tapes in whole or in part because portions were inaudible; and (3) in allowing the jury to retain the transcripts during the trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">Prior to trial the court ordered counsel for both parties to listen to the tapes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>determin\u00e9 where they disagreed as to the words heard on the tapes. An <em>in camera </em>hearing was later held, prior to the introduction of the tapes or transcripts into evidence, and three transcripts were made of the tapes. The parties agreed that the transcripts accurately reflected the words on the tapes, with certain exceptions as to which it was agreed that the transcripts would contain the version believed accurate by each party. The Government agreed with most of the changes sought by defense counsel, and on the most damaging tape, that of the December 29th meeting, agreed to delete certain words and substitute the word \u201cinaudible.\u201d An explanation of how the tapes were made was given to the jury, and the tapes and transcripts were admitted; it is undisputed that the tapes played to the jury contained no deletions, splices or additions.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The court having taken these precautions, we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the tapes and transcripts into evidence nor error to allow the jury to retain the transcripts during the trial and their deliberations. United States v. Koska, 443 F.2d 1167, 1169 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 852, 92 S.Ct. 92, 30 L.Ed.2d 92 (1971); see United States v. Weiser, 428 F.2d 932, 936-937 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 1606, 29 L.Ed.2d 119 (1971); United States v. Kaufer, 387 F.2d 17, 19 (2d Cir. 1967). We also find that the trial judge\u2019s instructions regarding the use of the tapes were proper and hold that appellant\u2019s requested instructions correctly were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Appellant\u2019s contentions concerning the propriety of the Government\u2019s summation at trial and the involvement of the chief trial prosecutor in the preceding investigation are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\">. Carson was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 18 months on the conspiracy and perjury counts and was fined $5,000 on the conspiracy count.

Bald testified for the Government and was later sentenced to imprisonment for two years, 20 months of which were suspended.

Appellant, on the other hand, contended at the trial that the meeting was arranged primarily to discuss the judicial appointment, and gave this testimony concerning his friends\u2019 problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">I said to Mr. Kleindienst that a couple of men had talked to me about a problem they had, and that they were willing to make a contribution to the Republican party in the amount of $50,000 or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-17\">Subsequent to their talking to me, 1 saw in the papers where there was an SEC indictment.
