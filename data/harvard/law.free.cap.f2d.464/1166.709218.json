HIGGINS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4e\">Clerk</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1221-13\">McALLISTER, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AZm\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-14\">From the views of my colleagues that the case should be remanded for findings of fact, I cheerfully dissent, being of the opinion that certain evidence upon which the conviction was based should have been suppressed because of an unlawful search and seizure, and that the ease should have gone to the jury on the evidence of eye-witness testimony, of films taken by hidden cameras during the reopening of the bank, and on the other evidence offered by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-16\">The facts are as follows: Appellants were tried and convicted of robbing, by force and intimidation, a federally-insured bank in Nashville, Tennessee, in-' violation of Title 18 U.S.C.A., Section 2113(d). They were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment under the provisions of Title 18 U.S.C.A., Section 4208 (a) (2), under which the Board of Parole may determine eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-17\">They were arrested near Pensacola, Florida, and both asked for a preliminary hearing before Honorable James M. Crossgrove, United States Commissioner. After the hearing, the Commissioner recommended that a warrant be issued for their removal to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, in which Nashville is located, where the robbery of the federally-insured bank took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-18\">On the trial of the case in the District Court in Nashville, appellants filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that such evidence, on which the Government relied to prove the bank robbery in question, was secured by an unlawful search and seizure, without a warrant, on the part of the state officers of Florida, and the agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-19\">The man, whose premises were searched and whose briefcases were also unlocked and searched, and the evidence therein used on the trial of the ease to convict appellants, was found unconscious by the roadside near Pensacola. The first officer on the scene stated he thought the man might be a diabetic because of a small emblem he wore suspended from a chain around his neck; and that a number of persons who were there and saw the man in that condition thought he might be a diabetic. The emblem worn by the man is well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>known to emergency departments of hospitals, and by officers of police departments; and when they see such an emblem, they immediately identify the wearer as a diabetic. These emblems may be purchased at almost any drug store throughout the country. The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn when a man is found suffering a seizure, and is wearing a diabetic emblem around his neck would be that he is a diabetic suffering from a diabetic seizure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">The transcript of the evidence and testimony of the witnesses before the Commissioner in Pensacola was introduced in evidence on the hearing in the District Court in Nashville. After due consideration, and upon reviewing the transcript of the evidence taken before the Commissioner, the District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was not well taken. The trial then proceeded and resulted in the conviction and sentence of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">The evidence sought to be suppressed consisted of thousands of dollars in bills found in locked attach\u00e9 cases, which were found in appellant Dunavan\u2019s immediate possession. These bills had been taken in a hold-up of a national bank in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">The evidence of money found in the attache cases was only part of the evidence used to convict. There was testimony from a number of eye witnesses that appellants were the men who held up the Nashville bank, and there were \u2022films taken, by hidden cameras, during the hold-up that purported to show appellants were the hold-up men. Accordingly, the evidence sought to be suppressed was only part of the evidence against appellants; and it is only the search of the premises of appellants and of their attach\u00e9 cases upon which the motion to suppress is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">The Government contends that the search came within one of the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment since it was made by officers confronted with an emergency in an effort to save the life of one of the appellants; that the search was carried out in an attempt to locate information as to the nature of his illness, and of his identity; and that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">Appellants contend that the search of their rooms did not fall within one of the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment, requiring a search warrant; that when the officer who arrived at the scene and found that the man, who is one of the appellants, was unconscious and was wearing a chain around his neck with an emblem such as diabetics wear, he had every reason to know that the man was suffering a diabetic coma or seizure; that the hospital to which the man was transported, saw the man and found the chain around his neck holding the diabetic emblem, knew he was in a diabetic coma; and that there was no need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>of a search of appellants\u2019 premises and a search of his locked dispatch cases to secure information in order to telephone the hospital and inform those in charge that the man was a diabetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">It further appears from the records kept by the deputy sheriff, who first arrived at the scene where he found appellant in a coma, that appellant had been discharged from the hospital, immediately arrested, and booked for the offense of not having a valid driver\u2019s license, before any search of appellants\u2019 premises or attach\u00e9 cases was carried out by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">The whole issue in the case is whether the search without a warrant, and seizure of the evidence by the Florida State officers and the agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were in violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment as constituting an illegal search and seizure, requiring that such evidence be suppressed on motion of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">We are of the opinion that the search and seizure of the evidence used to convict appellants was a search and seizure in violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment, and that the evidence seized as a result of such search should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">In McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 453, 69 S.Ct. 191, 192, 93 L.Ed. 153, the Supreme Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-8\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution provides: \u2018The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u2019 This guarantee of protection against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to the innocent and guilty alike. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-9\">\u201cWe are not dealing with formalities. The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals. Power is a heady thing; and history shows that the police acting on their own cannot be trusted. And so the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the desires of the police before they violate the privacy of the home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">This strange case starts with the testimony of Sergeant Gearen of the Air Force before Commissioner Crossgrove in Pensacola on the preliminary hearing. Sergeant Gearen was sightseeing with his family along the beach at Pensacola and was driving his car out to Fort Pickett when he saw a car coming toward him \u201cgoing off and on the road on both sides of the road.\u201d Sergeant Gearen had to take the right shoulder to keep from getting hit. The other car went by him on his side of the road, and as he watched it in the rear-view mirror \u201cit kept going in the sand and back on the road.\u201d Sergeant Gearen then went on down to the main gate at Fort Pickett and asked the gate guard to call the police. He then got into his car, turned around and followed the other car. When he had gone \u201cup the road a piece,\u201d the other car had run off the road into the sand, and stopped while the motor was still running. Sergeant Gearen backed his car off the road and \u201cjust sat there awhile. I wanted to go but my wife didn\u2019t want me to. It was plain to see something was wrong with the driver. He wasn\u2019t acting right. I saw the fire underneath the front of the ear. Grass caught on fire. I told her I was going anyway. Got to take the driver out of the car. Another car parked behind me and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>asked this guy if he would go with me. He said, yes, he would go. * * * He asked the girl to bring the fire extinguisher. He put the fire out underneath the car and I opened the door and took the guy out of the car. * * * I opened the car door, and as I opened the car door he kind of turned his head toward me. I said, \u2018Hey, buddy, get out of the car.\u2019 He said, \u2018what is happening, Babe?\u2019 I put my hands under his arms to pull him out. He had his grip * * * on the steering wheel. I broke his grip on the steering wheel and pulled him out. * * * I think I reached in and turned the ignition on the car off. First thing the other guy put the fire out. The other guy came around to where I was at. Didn\u2019t know what was happening with [the driver]. Seemed like he was choking. <em>I knew he was either diabetic or epileptic. </em>* * I set him up first because I was afraid he would choke on his tongue.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Sergeant Gearen testified that the man was wearing something like a religious medal around his neck. Another man who came up helped Sergeant Gearen \u201ccheck\u201d the pockets of the man with the seizure, and found about nine hundred dollars. Gearen, in the company of another man, removed the keys from the ignition and opened the trunk of the car. They saw two attach\u00e9 cases, and closed the trunk without removing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">In the hearing before Commissioner Crossgrove, Deputy Sheriff Lewis A. Davis of the Escambia County Sheriff\u2019s Department, testified that he had received a call at his station at 4:06 P.M. and arrived at 4:12 P.M. at the scene where the man with the seizure was on a blanket supported in an upright sitting position by \u201ca witness at the scene.\u201d Saliva was coming out of his mouth, his eyes were rolled back into his head. The man who was in this condition was appellant Dunavan. Deputy Sheriff Davis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-7\">\u201cI checked the chain, he had a chain with a little emblem around his neck, because diabetics carry that sometimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">He was asked by the District Attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Ut\">\u201cQ. Did you think he might be a diabetic ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-11\">\u201cA. Yes sir. A number of people saw him and thought he might be in that condition from a diabetic condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">Deputy Davis testified he was not suspicious of anything when he found more than $900.00 stuffed in appellant Dunavan\u2019s pockets. He testified that he checked Mr. Dunavan\u2019s pockets. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-13\">\u201cIn his left front pocket, I believe his left front pocket, there was a money clip with five one hundred dollar bills, tens, fives and twenties. In his left rear pocket I found a number of bills just folded up and stuck down inside his pocket, but no identification. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-14\">\u201cQ. You were a little suspicious when you found that nine hundred something dollars on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-15\">\u201cA. No, sir. <em>Not necessarily, </em>as a matter of fact a lot of people lose that much money up there on the beach at one whack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-16\">\u201cQ. <em>You were a little curious when you started driving to that motel room [Dum/oan\u2019s], weren\u2019t you, that possibly there was a good more to this?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-17\">\u201cA. <em>I wouldn\u2019t think I was a good law enforcement officer if I wasn\u2019t a little bit curious.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-18\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact he had become a suspect at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-19\">\u201cA. No, sir. I wouldn\u2019t say a suspect. If he had been a suspect he would have had a little more security on him and so forth, something like that.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-20\">Deputy Davis further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-21\">\u201cQ. If he had been a suspect would you have gotten a search warrant to search that motel room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>\u201cA. If he had been a suspect I certainly would have gotten a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-5\">\u201cQ. Since you felt he wasn\u2019t a suspect you didn\u2019t feel like you needed- a search warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-6\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t feel like I needed a search warrant to save somebody\u2019s life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">However, on the hearing of the motion to suppress, Deputy Davis was examined by Government counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Davis, all of this investigation occurred over a very short period of time, did it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-10\">\u201cQ. I take it you were in a pretty big hurry, is that correct? Is that a correct statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-12\">\u201cQ. <em>Primarily to determine what was wrong with this man Dunavan and to identify these people, is that correct ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-13\">\u201cA. <em>That\u2019s correct.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">Sergeant Gearen was the first person on the scene and lifted Mr. Dunavan out of his car. In so doing, he had a good look at appellant and thought he might be a diabetic or an epileptic, or \u201con a trip.\u201d He also noticed the emblem around Mr. Dunavan\u2019s neck but he didn\u2019t recognize it as the kind diabetics wear. He said he thought it was a religious medal, while Deputy Davis had every reason to believe that Mr. Dunavan was a diabetic because of the chain with a little emblem around his neck \u2014 such as diabetics sometimes carry. Deputy Davis testified that a number of people who saw Mr. Dunavan at the time thought he might be in that condition because he was a diabetic. With all of this as a foundation for his belief that Mr. Dunavan was suffering a diabetic seizure, the investigation of Deputy Davis became directed to identifying Mr. Dunavan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">According to Deputy Davis, two officers checked the vehicle and found a rental contract with the name of \u201cJames Mitchell\u201d for the rental of the car; and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adl3\">\u201calso found a wallet containing a temporary social security card which lists the name of Robert Dunavan on it. * * * So, during this time I had a first aid vehicle from the beach come to the scene to possibly assist the man until the ambulance could arrive. After it arrived we decided to transport him back on to meet the ambulance due to his physical condition. * * So, during this time they had opened the trunk of the ear and observed two briefcases in there. * * .* So, I was given the keys to the car by Mr. Jones and * * * I * * * removed the two briefcases from the trunk of the car and put them in my car and went to a restaurant out on the beach, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-18\">In further testimony before Commissioner Crossgrove, Deputy Sheriff Davis stated that he caused the Dunavan car to be \u201ctowed in,\u201d and said that, afterward he proceeded to a restaurant \u201cout on the beach, the Sunway Restaurant,\u201d where he used the telephone. Lt. Rose of the Sheriff\u2019s Department called him there in response to a radio dispatch previously sent out by Deputy Davis asking Lt. Rose to get in touch with him there. Deputy Davis told Lt. Rose that he had found a key in Mr. Dunavari\u2019s pocket to a room in the Ramada Inn, and that \u201cthere might be possibly someone at the motel that could tell us something about the man, and give us some information on him.\u201d They were concerned, in their conversations, with only who the man at the hospital might be. Lt. Rose suggested that he go to the Ramada Inn and attempt to contact somebody, and testified that he met Deputy Davis afterward at the Ramada Inn. Deputy Davis stated that when he and Lt. Rose arrived at the Ramada Inn, they discussed what they should do \u201cand we decided to go in.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-19\">Lt. Rose testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-20\">\u201cQ. I assume then the fact that there was a large amount of money on this man with no identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>aroused your suspicion as police officers somewhat, did it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVjk\">\u201cA. Well, curiosity more than suspicion. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-4\">* X * -X X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-5\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t [it] rather unusual for a man to have that large an amount of money on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-6\">\u201cA. Yes, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Lt. Rose further testified that \u201cwhen we got to the Ramada Inn we decided to enter the room <em>since we had the request from the hospital </em>as to identity and anything we could learn about the man.\u201d This request from the hospital \u201cas to identity and anything we could learn about the man,\u201d obviously came before Lt. Rose and Deputy Davis met at the Ramada Inn, and before they used the key to enter his room and search his premises and attaeh\u00e9 cases. In any event, a request from the hospital as to identity \u201cand anything we could learn about the man,\u201d was no justification for a search of his premises and effects, without a warrant. All of this search, according to the conversations between them, concerned only the desire of Lt. Rose and Deputy Davis to find out who the man at the hospital was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">Deputy Davis testified as to the search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-9\">\u201cWhen we, Lt. Rose and I, got to the room * * *, we knocked on the door and called out and no one answered. So we decided to go on in the room and see if we could find some identification or information or something to give the hospital about Mr. Dunavan. * * * So then, of course, we walked on into the room looking for some identification or something, and as I walked past the suitcase sitting immediately on my left I observed a pistol laying in the open suitcase. Then there was a coffee table or stand between the two beds. * * * So, on this table there was some keys, some small keys. So, we brought the briefcases up to check the briefcases assuming actually since they were in his immediate possession and so forth there should be something with identification and so forth. So, I brought the briefcases up and used the keys to unlock one of the briefcases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">The testimony of the officers discloses that the search of Mr. Dunavan\u2019s room and effects was not directed to finding out what was wrong with Mr. Dunavan. Lt. Rose testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-12\">\u201cQ. You say you found some insulin or needles in the bathroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-13\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-14\">\u201cQ. <em>Was that right away after you got into the room?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. It was.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-16\">But, although this was soon after the officers entered the room, it was not soon enough to prevent a search of appellant\u2019s attaeh\u00e9 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">Deputy Davis was asked on cross examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-18\">\u201cQ. The attaeh\u00e9 cases were opened, x x x before anyone looked in the bathroom to see if there was anything in there, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-19\">\u201cA. Yes. One was opened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-20\">When the briefcase (attaeh\u00e9 case) was opened, they found thousands of dollars in bills packed in. They then sent another man to the hospital to get the key to the other briefcase; and, in some way, he got the key from the hospital, and they then opened the second briefcase. Both briefcases were filled with money that had been taken in a hold-up of a bank in Nashville. It was this search of Dunavan\u2019s motel room, and the search of the briefcases that appellants contend was illegal and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against unlawful searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-21\">Deputy Sheriff Davis further testified from his records. He was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-22\">\u201cQ. Now, Lt. Davis, do your records indicate at what time on Sunday afternoon Mr. Dunavan was booked into the jail there in Pensacola ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>\u201cA. That he was actually booked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-5\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApE\">\u201cA. Well, the records don\u2019t show that Mr. Dunavan was actually booked at the jail. Robert Arnold Diamond, one of the names that Mr. Dunavan was using, was booked there at 4:59.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsaE\">\"Q. Four fifty-nine. It is the same man that you were talking about here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As7\">\u201cA. Yes. This is the time that this appendix was made out. The charge was placed against him, in other words. I can\u2019t say positively exactly when he was brought in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHL\">\u201cQ. The charge was placed at 4:59?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avp7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOKy\">* * * * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahj\">\u201cQ. Do you have any record of what time it was that you made contact with Lt. Rose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8lX\">\u201cA. Lt. Rose, I believe I do have. In conversation I talked to him at about 4:45. I contacted him at 5:15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4eP\">\u201cQ. You contacted him at 5:15, do you mean you saw him at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjL\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That's right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFK\">\u201cQ. Now, when you talked with Lt. Rose first you had not gone to the motel at that time, had you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax5Q\">\u201cQ. Do your records reveal when you arrived at the motel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">\u201cA. Five-fifteen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az8\">On redirect examination, Deputy Sheriff Davis testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3\">\u201cQ.. <em>When was Mr. Dunavan arrested?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af0x\">\u201cA. When was he arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABm\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">\u201cA. <em>When he was released from the hospital.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZdP\">\u201cQ. Do you have a record of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2J\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATE3\">\u201cQ. When is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHV\">\u201cA. <em>Well, he was actually booked on the </em>\u2014 i:59 <em>p. m. on the 17th day of 'May.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-6\">\u201cQ. He was booked at the police station at 4:59 p. m?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, this is when the appendix was drawn up. This is the time that was \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-8\">\u201cQ.

Do you mean, Mr. Davis, that you came upon this man at 4:12 p. m. whom you thought was going to die <em>and at A:59 he was in the police station going to jail?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-11\">\n<em>\u201cA. I\u2019m not sure if he was actually there at the station or not but he wasn\u2019t at the hospital too long after they gave him some shots.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-12\">(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">According to the foregoing, the records from which Deputy Davis was testifying showed that Mr. Dunavan had been charged with the offense of not having a valid driver\u2019s license, released from the hospital and arrested by the police at 4:59, and thereafter booked for the offense. This time period of 4:59 P.M. was before Deputy Davis and Lt. Rose met at the Ramada Inn, which was at 5:15 P.M. after which they used Mr. Dunavan\u2019s key to open the door of his room, and proceeded to search the room and the attach\u00e9 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">In view of the fact that Mr. Dunavan already had been released from the hospital and was in the hands of the police, who were booking him, there could have been no conversation over the telephone between Mr. Davis, Lt. Rose, or any other members of the police <em>informing the hospital authorities mth a view to helping Mr. Dunavan recover from his unconsciousness, or treating his illness at the hospital, as Mr. Dunavan was no </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number><em>longer at the hospital. </em>As Deputy Davis said, \u201che wasn\u2019t at the hospital too long after they gave him some shots;\u201d and the hospital, after Mr. Dunavan was released, might have informed the police officers at the Ramada Inn that \u201che was feeling better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Up to this time we do not know what charge was made against Mr. Dunavan. The examination continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-5\">\u201cQ. What charge was sworn out against Mr. Dunavan or Diamond at 4:59?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-6\">\u201cA. Failure to have vehicle under control. No driver\u2019s license was the actual charge. No valid driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-8\">\u201cQ. Who pressed this charge of no driver\u2019s license against Mr. Dunavan ? Did you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-9\">\u201cA. I charged him, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-10\">\u201cQ. Was he ever tried on that charge ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-11\">\u201cA. I believe the case was dismissed or withheld after he was charged with bank robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-12\">\u201cQ. (Deputy) Davis, did you charge him with no driver\u2019s license so that you would be sure you could hold him in case he got well enough to leave the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-13\">\u201cA. He was driving a car and he didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. And so I charged him with no valid driver\u2019s license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">Deputy Davis had never spoken a word to Mr. Dunavan and considered that he was unable to speak at the time he charged him with the offense of not having a valid driver\u2019s license. He never asked whether he had a valid driver\u2019s license. Under the circumstances, it seems unlikely that Deputy Davis would file such a charge against a man to whom he had never spoken and who, he supposed, was in an unconscious state at the hospital, unless it was to hold him in case he got well enough to leave the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-15\">The examination of Deputy Davis continued :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-16\">\u201cQ. Now, when you arrived at the Ramada Inn with these other officers, was Lt. Rose there at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-18\">\u201cQ. And was it at his direction that you opened the door to the motel room and went in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-19\">\u201cA. The two of us discussed what we should do and we decided to go in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-20\">\u201cQ. And by this time you had already charged him with, Mr. Dunavan with no driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-21\">\u201cA. This was at about the time of the known violation. This was when it was decided that there had been a violation and he would have actually, in other words; when he should\u2019ve been taken into custody for this. This is about the time, in other words, should\u2019ve been about the time that we had an officer go to the hospital where Mr. Dunavan was and I believe we had an officer there with him probably from that time on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-22\">Deputy Davis, testifying from his records, said that he had charged Mr. Dunavan with the offense of not having a valid driver\u2019s license at 4:59 P.M. So this charge was made against Dunavan before Deputy Davis and Lt. Rose searched his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-23\">Representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called into the case by the state officers, and one of them opened the second attach\u00e9 case containing the money secured by the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-24\">Finally, Deputy Davis was questioned by counsel for appellants, and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-25\">\u201cQ. Actually, his recovery had been made, I take it, before you ever went to search the motel room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-26\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Counsel for the Government objected to the question asked, as leading, because Deputy Davis had been called as a witness by counsel for the defense. Judge Gray agreed that the question was leading and \u201cpretty speculative, too.\u201d At the time the question was asked, Judge Gray was right in saying it was speculative. But this was before any evidence had been introduced in which Deputy Davis and Lt. Rose admitted they did not meet at the Ramada Inn until 5:15, and afterward unlocked the door to appellant\u2019s room, and proceeded to search the premises. This took place after Mr. Dunavan had been released from the hospital, arrested, and booked by the police. So the actual fact was that Mr. Dunavan\u2019s recovery had been made before the officers ever searched his motel room and attach\u00e9 cases, if recovery from a diabetic shock is to be judged from the fact that, after the necessary \u201cshots\u201d had been administered to him, and he was feeling better, the hospital had released him. It is unreasonable to conclude that when a hospital had received a diabetic suffering from shock, and had administered the necessary treatment for his recovery, it would discharge the man before recovery from the shock. No doctors, nurses, or hospital attendants were called upon to give evidence by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">The sole justification for the action of Deputy Sheriff Davis and Lt. Rose in using the key found in Mr. Dunavan\u2019s pocket to unlock the door to his room, and to search the room and appellants\u2019 locked attach\u00e9 cases, was because of an exigency that made such a search permissible as an exception to the Fourth Amendment due to an emergency in which they were attempting to save the life of Mr. Dunavan, who they thought was dying. It was claimed they were trying to secure information that would enable the hospital to know from what Mr. Dunavan was suffering, and to use medical science and care to save him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">There was no emergency at the time of the search which was carried out after 5:15 P.M. Mr. Dunavan\u2019s life was not in danger at that time, since he had recovered from the diabetic coma, and had been released from the hospital at 4:59 P.M. and was arrested and booked by the police as soon as he was released from the hospital, according to the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">Repeatedly it was testified to by Deputy Davis that appellant Dunavan was released from the hospital and arrested at 4:59 P.M.; and repeatedly it was testified to by Deputy Davis that he and Lt. Rose did not commence the search of appellants\u2019 premises and locked attach\u00e9 cases until after 5:15 P.M. At no time during the trial was it stated that Deputy Davis was mistaken in stating that Mr. Dunavan was released from the hospital and arrested at 4:59; and that the search of the premises commenced after 5:15. And no claim is made of any such mistake or misstatement in the briefs of the Government on appeal. Those two time periods recur again and again in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">Neither was there any basis for a claim that the search was necessary to attempt to secure information in order that the hospital could be informed of the nature of Mr. Dunavan\u2019s affliction. Mr. Dunavan was wearing a chain around his neck with an emblem such as diabetics often wear. Even Deputy Davis observed the chain with a little emblem around Mr. Dunavan\u2019s neck. Upon his arrival at the hospital, they knew immediately from the emblem, if nothing else, that Mr. Dunavan was a diabetic and suffering a diabetic shock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">The fact that Mr. Dunavan was taken by the first-aid vehicle from the beach at 4.:30, thereafter changed to an ambulance, and transported to the hospital; treated there with \u201cshots,\u201d according to Deputy Davis, and released within half an hour, shows that the hospital knew the nature of his affliction and did not require any further information to take care of the man; and they knew the nature of his affliction because he was wearing a chain around his neck holding an emblem that disclosed he was a dia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>betic \u2014 the same emblem that Deputy Davis had first noticed Mr. Dunavan was wearing at the beach \u2014 \u201ca little emblem around his neck because diabetics carry that sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Even if the officers, before they entered appellant\u2019s room at the Ramada Inn, had a request from the hospital as to the identity of Mr. Dunavan, and everything they could learn about him, the compliance of the officers with such a request would not excuse them from securing a search warrant to seach his rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">It seems obvious why the search was being conducted \u2014 because the officers were suspicious of the large amount of money found on Mr. Dunavan. As stated by Mr. Justice Butler, speaking for the Supreme Court in Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 32, 33, 46 S.Ct. 4, 6, 70 L.Ed. 145:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-6\">\u201cThe protection of the Fourth Amendment extends to all equally \u2014 to those justly suspected or accused, as well as to the innocent. The search of a private dwelling without a warrant is in itself unreasonable and abhorrent to our laws. * * * Belief, however well founded, that an article sought is concealed in a dwelling house, furnishes no justification for a search of that place without a warrant. And such searches are held unlawful notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">After finding Mr. Dunavan in a state of unconsciousness, with more than nine hundred dollars in-numerous bills stuffed in all of his pockets, the officers were suspicious of something, and after finding the key to Mr. Dunavan\u2019s motel room in his pocket, they determined that they would see whether there was any evidence of illegal activity, or at least have a search on general principles, because they were admittedly curious. But, as held in District of Columbia v. Little, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 242, 178 F.2d 13, aff. 339 U.S. 1, 70 S.Ct. 468, 94 L.Ed. 599, the Fourth Amendment precludes searches of premises by officers without a warrant, regardless of whether the officers are searching for evidence of crime, or whether they are seaching for something else, or just searching.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">As Judge Gray said, in passing, he always carried his motel key and that if any accident happened to him, he would be glad to have officers search his room and belongings to find out who he was. Coming from one of Judge Gray\u2019s eminence, this statement is sound and salutary, and certainly most men would agree completely and welcome assistance. It is to be said that there are many men who do not find their world so felicitous, and would avoid such an intrusion to ascertain their identity, even in case of accident or illness, with all means at their command to the point of relying upon the Fourth Amendment to prevent it. We do not know the number of men who carry with them in their locked suitcases or attach\u00e9 cases, or keep within locked drawers, letters or documents that might be technically incriminating, or more incriminating than merely technical; or who have letters that they would not have anyone in the world see involving their domestic affairs, or liaisons, or conduct that, while it would not be criminal, would subject them to shame and embarrassment, or lead to the break-up of families and destruction of friendships and loss of standing in their communities. The searching of premises, the unlocking or breaking open of drawers or attach\u00e9 eases in order to ascertain the identity of an injured or ill man is not a specifically-established and well-delineated exception, so jealously and carefully drawn as to justify such a search without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">In this regard, Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for the Court in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 454, 455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2032, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, made this powerful statement of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-11\">\u201cThus the most basic constitutional rule in this area is that \u2018searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 The exceptions are \u2018jealously and carefully drawn,\u2019 and there must be \u2018a showing by those who seek exemption . . . that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u2019 \u2018[T]he burden is on those seeking the exemption to show the need for it.\u2019 [United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 61, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">The striking fact about this case is that the entire period of time between the arrival of Deputy Sheriff Davis at the scene where he found Mr. Dunavan suffering from a diabetic seizure, to the time of Mr. Dunavan\u2019s release from the hospital after being treated for the affliction was unusually short.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">In cross examination by counsel for the Government, Deputy Davis testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Davis, all of this investigation occurred over a very short \u2022 period of time, did it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-10\">\u201cQ. I take it you were in a pretty big hurry, is that correct? Is that a correct statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-12\">\u201cQ. Primarily to determine what was wrong with this man Dunavan and to identify these people, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-13\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-14\">To sum up the facts substantiating this statement, of how short was the period of investigation of Mr. Dunavan, Deputy Davis had previously testified that he arrived at the scene of action where Mr. Dunavan was found at the roadside, with a diabetic seizure at 4:12 P.M. on Sunday, May 17, 1970. He stated that he had then called for an emergency first-aid vehicle to take Mr. Dunavan to meet the ambulance that had been summoned; that the emergency vehicle arrived in about 15 minutes, possibly around 4:30 P.M.; that Deputy Davis sent out a radio message for Lt. Rose to call him at the Sunway Restaurant out on the beach, and he had received this call and spoke to Lt. Rose by telephone at the restaurant at 4:45 P.M.; that Mr. Dunavan, between 4:30 P.M. and 4:59 P.M. had been transported by the emergency vehicle and then by the ambulance; had reached the hospital; been treated there with \u201cshots,\u201d and had been discharged from the hospital, and immediately arrested there by police on the charge of not having a valid driver\u2019s license; and had been booked by the police at about the same time; that Deputy Davis first saw Lt. Rose at the Ramada Inn at 5:15 P.M. and that they had proceeded to search Mr. Dunavan\u2019s room and his attache cases. Since Mr. Dunavan was transported from the beach in the first-aid vehicle and then, later, in the ambulance, he could probably not have reached the hospital for treatment of his diabetic seizure within ten or fifteen minutes. Mr. Dunavan, therefore, would have been at the hospital receiving the shots for approximately only fifteen minutes \u2014 until the hospital considered his treatment sufficient to discharge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-19\">Diabetics suffering from an insulin reaction often recover from an unconscious condition in a remarkably short time \u2014 from ten to fifteen minutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>It has been suggested that the testimony of Sheriff Davis that appellant Dunavan was discharged from the hospital at 4:59 P.M. and then arrested, and booked, was hearsay, since Mr. Davis was not present when appellant Dunavan was discharged from the hospital and thereafter arrested, and booked. But Mr. Davis was the officer in charge of the whole case. His testimony as to when appellant Dunavan was discharged from the hospital and arrested, and booked, was from police records which he referred to when he testified. Title 28 U.S.C.A., Sec. 1732, The Federal Business Records Act, provides for evidence from business records; and, according to United States v. Graham, 391 F.2d 439 (C.A.6), certiorari denied, Tucker v. United States, 390 U.S. 1035, 88 S. Ct. 1433, 20 L.Ed.2d 294, police records are business records. Moreover, there was no objection from either party as to the testimony of Mr. Davis from the police records. He was the chief representative of the police involved in this case and, from everything that appears, his testimony from the police records is accepted as true by everyone. It should be mentioned that when it was pointed out to Mr. Davis that he testified that appellant Dunavan was discharged from the hospital, arrested and booked at 4:59, whereas he further testified he did not search appellant\u2019s apartment and dispatch cases until after 5:15 P.M., and that, therefore, he knew Mr. Dunavan was discharged from the hospital before he commenced his search to ascertain what Mr. Dunavan was suffering from, he denied it. But he continued to testify that he had not commenced his search until 5:15 P.M., and that Dunavan had been released at 4:59 P.M., and at no time stated that he was mistaken with regard to the times of search, and of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-9\">There was some testimony with respect to the hospital\u2019s calling the officers at the motel and the officers calling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>from the motel to the hospital. Deputy Davis testified that <em>\u201cshortly before we arrived in the [motel] room, </em>we received a call <em>from our office </em>by telephone that the hospital was requesting some information on Dunavan and wanted to know if we could give them any. * * * Lt. Rose found an insulin bottle in the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-5\">\u201cQ. And what did you do when he found that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-6\">\u201cA. I believe that City Policeman Officer Mr. Peebles is the one that made that call to the hospital and gave them the number off the insulin bottle and other information they asked for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-7\">\u201cQ. And was some information received from the hospital, too ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-8\">\u201cA. The hospital called a number of times, called us one time at the motel, and I believe called our office on two different occasions inquiring about Mr. Dunavan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvF\">Deputy Davis had already opened one attach\u00e9 case. He was asked what he did with regard to the other and he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-9\">\u201cWe did not have a key for it and so we asked one of our officers to see if he could find a key on Mr. Dunavan and bring it to us, which he did and Mr. Shook with the FBI opened this case here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">All of Deputy Davis\u2019 testimony, as above set forth, is hearsay. He did not call the hospital. He did not speak with anyone at the hospital. He did not know Mr. Dunavan was at the hospital but asked an officer if he could find a key on Mr. Dunavan \u201cand bring it to us.\u201d All of this hearsay evidence is in direct conflict with Deputy Davis\u2019 testimony from the police records that Mr. Dunavan was released from the hospital and immediately arrested and booked at a specified time \u2014 which was before Deputy Davis entered the motel and searched Mr. Dunavan\u2019s attach\u00e9 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">Such hearsay evidence does not appear to me to be substantial evidence to overcome the repeated and direct testimony of Deputy Davis from the police records that Mr. Dunavan was discharged from the hospital at 4:59 and that Deputy Davis did not enter the motel and search the attach\u00e9 cases until after Mr. Dunavanhad been released from the hospital and arrested by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">For substantial evidence \u201cis such relevant evidence as a reasonable man might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">But after all is said on the subject of whether the officers called the hospital from the motel and whether the hospital called . the officers at the motel, or whether the officers searched Mr. Dunavan\u2019s attach\u00e9 cases before, or after, communicating with the hospital, the fact that clearly stands forth is that Deputy Davis and the doctors and nurses at the hospital knew from the diabetes amulet that Mr. Dunavan was wearing around his neck that he was a diabetic suffering from diabetic shock and, consequently, there was no need to search his motel room and attach\u00e9 cases to ascertain this fact. And, if there was no need to search the motel room and the attach\u00e9 cases to secure this information, the search clearly was in violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-15\">With regard to the search of appellant\u2019s apartment and effects, because of the emergency arising from his dangerous condition in which Mr. Davis testified he found appellant Dunavan at 4:21 P.M., it appears that from that time until after 5:15 P.M., when he searched the premises and attach\u00e9 cases of appellant, he had not notified the hospital of anything regarding Mr. Dunavan. Mr. Davis, therefore, according to his own testimony, let more than an hour pass without communicating with the hospital respecting Mr. Dunavan\u2019s condition. In Mr. Davis\u2019 mind, there was no emergency justifying the search of the attach\u00e9 cases which he had in his hands, at the time he sent Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>Dunavan to the hospital, and which he did not search until an hour later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Appellants Dunavan. and Mitchell, who occupied the motel room together, were both convicted by the use of the evidence seized by the state and federal officers as a result of the search of the premises they were sharing, as well as by much additional evidence. The evidence which was procured as a result of the search and seizure, without warrant, was, in my view, in violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">In accordance with the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the judgments should be set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">.

It may do this if the diabetic has taken too much insulin, or if he hasn\u2019t eaten enough, or if he has played or worked harder than usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">\u201cWhen this happens, something called an insulin reaction begins to develop. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">In severe reactions, a diabetic may be irritable, laugh or cry without cause, talk thickly, stagger drunkenly, or even become unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-11\"><em>\u201cIf the patient gets a little carbohydrate quickly </em>\u2014 in the form of sugar, for example, or of candy, crackers, soft drinks, orange <em>juice </em>\u2014 the <em>symptoms are likely to disappear within ten minutes. </em>That\u2019s why many diabetics carry a few lumps of sugar or several crackers in their pockets or handbags.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-12\">\u201cThe treatment may have to be repeated, and in severe cases a doctor may have to inject glucose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">\u201cA new hormone called <em>glucagon </em>\u2014 developed late in 1960 \u2014 largely eliminates the need for intravenous injection of glucose in such emergencies. <em>Injected under the skin, it has the remarkable ability to raise the blood sugar to normal levels promptly and consistently. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Facts about Diabetes, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">\u201cWithin ten minutes after receiving one ampule of glucagon the patient is usually sufficiently awake to eat. Recovery after an insulin reaction is usually prompt and complete. Often a person feels well again within fifteen to thirty minutes.\u201d ADA Forecast, published by American Diabetes Association, Inc. 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
