J. Gaillot, Jr. discovered that the Department of Health, Educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tion and Welfare had adopted a policy of denying Federal financial assistance to State hospitals if they continued to classify blood according to the race of the donor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Acting as her own attorney she then instituted a declaratory judgment action in the District Court, contending that the HEW policy was manifestly inconsistent with the disclosure of racial information required by the United States Bureau of Census and constituted a denial of her rights under the First Amendment because her religious convictions did not permit her to accept a transfusion of blood from a person of another race. The District Court dismissed the complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Since Mrs. Gaillot is not a lawyer she was probably unaware when she filed her suit that Federal courts traditionally have declined to decide questions of potentially constitutional significance \u2014 or, for that matter, questions of any other sort \u2014 unless they arise from a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d within the meaning of Article III of the United States Constitution. A \u201ccontroversy\u201d in this sense involves considerably more than mere abstract philosophical disagreement with the wisdom, propriety or desirability of specific governmental activities, necessitating a judicial opinion \u201cadvising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth, 1937, 300 U.S. 227, 241, 57 S.Ct. 461, 464, 81 L.Ed. 617, 621; Nashville, Chattanooga, &amp; St. Louis Railway v. Wallace, 1933, 288 U.S. 249, 262, 53 S.Ct. 345, 347, 77 L.Ed. 730, 735; Byers v. Byers, 5 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 205, 208. As a corollary proposition, a party seeking relief must establish his interest in the outcome of the litigation by demonstrating actual or immediately threatened interference with his legal rights, rather than some speculative future adversity that may never materialize. Poe v. Ullman, 1961, 367 U.S. 497, 504, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1756, 6 L.Ed.2d 989, 996; International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehouse-men\u2019s Union v. Boyd, 1954, 347 U.S. 222, 74 S.Ct. 447, 98 L.Ed. 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">The purported conflict between the policies of HEW and the Census Bureau has no perceptible impact on Mrs. Gaillot\u2019s interests. Essentially her claim is that <em>if </em>in the future she should suffer injury or disease requiring a blood transfusion and <em>if </em>the only available blood supply is from a State hospital which has elected to comply with the HEW policy (rather than from private sources not subject to the requirement), she <em>may </em>be involuntarily subjected to a procedure which <em>might </em>offend her religious sensibilities <em>if </em>the blood given her comes from a person of a different race. Since claims involving such hypothetical contingencies have never provided a proper foundation for constitutional adjudication, we conclude that the District Court correctly declined \u201cto make existing controversies out of presently academic differences.\u201d American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. United States Fidelity <em>&amp; </em>Guaranty Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 633, 638 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">. The Department\u2019s authority was derived from Title VI of the Civil Eights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d et seq., and the regulations promulgated under it, 45 C.F.E. \u00a7 80.1 et seq.
