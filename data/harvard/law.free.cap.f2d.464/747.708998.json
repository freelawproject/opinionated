Yet we have found the questions raised to be substantial, to have warranted the careful consideration given to them and to require something more than perfunctory treatment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">Appellant is a well-known technical expert and inventor. By his employment contract with appellee, Sperry Rand Corporation, he was required to assign rights in his inventions to Sperry. While in such employment he developed the \u201cAddress Counter Stage Circuitry\u201d now in controversy. Sperry asked appellant to sign an application for a patent covering this circuit. Appellant, without questioning that his contract otherwise would apply, wrote Sperry that he declined to do so because the invention was obvious to any skilled electronic circuit designer and not sufficiently inventive to qualify for a patent. Pursuant to Section 118, <em>supra, </em>and Patent Office Rules of Practice 47(b) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the same effect, Sperry itself applied for a patent on February 28, 1966, in appellant\u2019s name.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant was advised of that fact by a letter from the Patent Office; and on May 31, 1966, Ke submitted his objections to the Patent Office to the effect that he did not believe the invention to be patentable. The Patent Examiner assigned to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the application rejected it on June 25, 1968, relying in part on appellant\u2019s submission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 9, 1968, Sperry Rand filed a response to that rejection, followed by appellant\u2019s protest on June 17, 1969, against the issuance of the patent. On July 23, 1969, the Examiner again rejected the patent claim as being obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Subsequently, Sperry Rand obtained a personal interview with the Examiner and again amended its application. In the summer of 1970, Sperry Rand and appellant were notified that the Patent Examiner had tentatively decided to allow the amended application. On July 21, 1970, appellant filed a petition to the Commissioner citing Rule 182 of the Patent Office Rules of Practice<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seeking to prevent issuance of the patent or, alternatively, to defer issuance until appellant had been given an opportunity to present his objections. On September 17, 1970, appellant submitted technical objections, along with a letter from counsel specifically requesting an interview with the Examiner. Detailed petitions asking for rejection of Sperry\u2019s application or for a full hearing followed on November 21, 1970, and January 27, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In a letter dated March 16, 1971, the Deputy Commissioner of Patents advised appellant that \u201cthe inventor has been accorded full consideration of his contentions as to non-patentability\u201d and that his correspondence would be entered into the official file. Appellant\u2019s request for an interview was denied. On April 20, 1971, appellant requested reconsideration of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision; and on May 24, 1971, the Deputy Commissioner ruled that appellant\u2019s position had been made of record in the application file, that the contentions advanced by him had been given careful consideration but that those contentions were not persuasive to reverse the March 16 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Appellant then commenced this action and in connection therewith sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The district court, being of the view that appellant had failed to show that he would eventually prevail on the merits of his cause or that he would suffer irreparable injury, denied interim relief. Appellant then appealed from such denial and moved here for summary reversal and an injunction pending appeal. This court, to afford opportunity more fully to consider the matter, temporarily restrained the issuance of the patent and later remanded the case to the district court, continuing the temporary stay of issuance of the patent \u201cuntil disposition by the District Court on the merits\u201d. Upon remand, that court in reliance upon Rule 12(b) (6) Fed.R.Civ.P. granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The present appeal was taken from that dismissal. Subsequently, this court denied appellant\u2019s further application for a stay pending appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim against appellees upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As against such a motion the court must take as true all material facts well pleaded in the complaint with reasonable inferences in favor of the movant, but conclusions of law and other broad conclusionary allegations unwarranted or negated by the facts pleaded may be disregarded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Allegations that a patent for the circuit in question would be invalid, that applicant was wrongfully refused a hearing, and that his due process rights were violated are conclusionary in nature and did not by themselves save the complaint. Appellant\u2019s assertion that he \u201cis as well situated as any member of the public to protect the public interest in contesting issuance of the patent\u201d (as a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d) is immaterial to the problem before us. That appellant is an outstanding inventor must be conceded, and it was and is to be assumed as alleged that if a patent issues the appellant will become publicly known as the inventor and by reason of the publication of his name will suffer injury to his personal reputation. Whether such injury would be irreparable, as claimed, is conclusionary and dependent upon related legal problems. Factually it seems problematical that any substantial damage of the nature apprehended by appellant would be suffered in view of the disclosure in the files of the Patent Office of appellant\u2019s protests and the narrow basis of appellant\u2019s fears in relation to the inferences that might be drawn from the face of a patent bearing his name. The line between inventions which might and might not be obvious to persons skilled in the art is often shadowy; and judicial notice may be taken that various patents issued to inventors whose fame still survives have been determined upon court test to be invalid in whole or in part. Yet we shall assume that the granting and publication of the patent would injure appellant\u2019s reputation to an appreciable degree and, on the basis of appellant\u2019s allegations, that there is substantial question relating to the obviousness of such a claimed invention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Appellant bases his claimed right to a hearing on two contentions: first, the Patent Commissioner in violation of his statutory duty has wrongfully refused to grant a hearing to appellant; and, second, appellant was entitled to a hearing by virtue of the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Appellant argues that the Patent Commissioner has\u2019 abused his authority in failing to grant appellant a hearing on the patent\u2019s validity. He relies on sections 6 and 103 of Title 35 U.S.C. (1970) in support of his argument. Section 6 states that \u201c[t]he Commissioner, shall superintend or perform all duties required by law respecting the granting and issuing of patents\u201d, and also provides that \u201c[h]e may . . . estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>lish regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of proceedings in the Patent Office.\u201d Because 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> precludes the issuance of patents with \u201cobvious\u201d subject matter, appellant\u2019s argument continues, the Commissioner neglected his statutory duty in refusing to provide a full hearing when the obviousness of the patent was challenged by the inventor.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">There is no express statutory requirement or authorization for an oral hearing at the request of the inventor in the issuance of a Rule 47(b) patent. Section 118 of Title 35 U.S.C. authorizes the Patent Commissioner to accept applications for patents from non-inventors to whom \u201cthe inventor has assigned or agreed in writing to assign the invention or who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter justifying such action.\u201d Patent Office Rule 47(b) specifies procedure to be utilized when a non-inventor application is filed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure states that the inventor may \u201cprotest his designation as an inventor and offer evidence to support his position\u201d, but may not \u201cinstitute inter partes proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Thus, neither the statute, the rule, nor the Manual expressly authorizes an oral hearing or interview for an aggrieved inventor. On the contrary, reference in the Manual to the position of one protesting his own inventorship suggests an intention inconsistent with inter-party proceedings in the present context. By contrast, where Congress intended that both notice and an opportunity for a hearing be given, it has clearly expressed its intentions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Congressional intent has been discussed by this court in a case somewhat analogous to the present controversy. In LaRue v. Udall, 116 U.S. App.D.C. 396, 324 F.2d 428, cert. denied, 376 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 660, 11 L.Ed.2d 606 (1963), appellants had unsuccessfully protested an exchange of public grazing land by the Department of Interior under the Taylor Grazing Act. The opinion noted that \u201carguments pro and con on appellants\u2019 protest, including affidavits and memoranda of law, were considered by the lower echelons of the Department and finally the matter reached the Secretary of Interior,\u201d who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201capproved the exchange.\u201d With regard to appellants\u2019 contention that a \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d had not been accorded them, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">\u201cAs appellants were heard at length on their protest against the proposed exchange, it is apparent their real complaint is that no formal evidentiary hearing was held. We find nothing in the Taylor Grazing Act which requires a hearing on such a protest. Section 8, dealing with exchanges, merely requires publication of notice of a contemplated exchange. Where Congress intended a hearing to be held, it provided therefor in express terms, as it did in \u00a7 1 of the Taylor Grazing Act. [43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315.] <em>Id. </em>at 400.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Although personal interviews with applicants are not infrequently granted at the Commissioner\u2019s discretion, the general practice covered by Patent Office Rule 2 is to the contrary.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Appellant finally claimed before the district court the following rights on the facts alleged, although all of them were not specifically asserted in the first instances: (1) a written decision by the Examiner setting forth the grounds for rejecting appellant\u2019s arguments; (2) an opportunity to rebut the Examiner\u2019s position; (3) an opportunity to interview the Examiner after having received full knowledge of the basis for his decision;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (4) an opportunity to appeal from the Examiner\u2019s decision, with all of the rights applicable thereto; and (5) an order prohibiting the Patent Office from distributing to any person copies of the patent. In contending that these rights should be recognized on his behalf since most of them were available to Sperry Rand, appellant ignores the fact that an applicant, as such, has certain express statutory rights without provision for their extension to others. For example, when the Examiner initially rejected the claims, he was obligated to state \u201creasons for such rejection\u201d and Sperry was entitled to have the application re-examined \u201cwith or without amendment\u201d as provided by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132 (1970). Moreover, had the Examiner persisted in his rejections, Sperry had a right of appeal to the board of Pat-tent Appeals under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 134, and subsequently could seek judicial review if dissatisfied. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141, 145 (1970). The Patent Office regularly sells and distributes copies of all issued patents as a service to the interested public regardless of patent validity. That service is expressly provided for by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(a) par. 9 (1970), which makes no distinction between patents which after issuance may be adjudged valid or invalid. The Patent Office must be free to cite and provide copies of even invalid patents, as evidence of prior art, in examining future applications of others under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 131. The patent law recognizes that patent applications for assigned inventions may involve disagreement between the inventor and the assignee by permitting the latter alone to apply in the event of the inventor\u2019s refusal. This is not a case where the validity or scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>assignment is questioned. The statutory right of the appellee to prosecute the patent application by virtue of the assignment is not, and cannot be, challenged. The statute does not create or imply a non-right or counter-right on the part of the inventor. We can find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that refusal of the Commissioner to accede to the demands of appellant constituted a violation of any duty imposed by statute or rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">However, statutory enactments and administrative rules must yield to or be supplemented by constitutional mandates. Appellant\u2019s second contention, accordingly, is that the Due Process clause of the Constitution requires the Commissioner to meet appellant\u2019s demands in spite of any legislative or administrative void which might otherwise exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Congress has been specifically empowered to enact legislation pertaining to patents.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s alternative argument is that it has failed to provide procedural safeguards within its statutory scheme; that this failure exists from denial by statute, rule, or practice of an opportunity for an inventor in appellant\u2019s position to meet with the Examiner and present contentions concerning alleged patent invalidity; and that through such failure appellant has been denied \u201cdue process of law\u201d contrary to the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">There is no dispute that appellant had numerous opportunities to present his views to the Commissioner. On May 31, 1966, appellant submitted his first objections to the Patent Office; on June 17, 1969, appellant filed a second protest; on July 21, 1970, appellant filed a petition seeking to prevent issuance of the patent after it had been tentatively approved; on September 17, 1970, appellant submitted a lengthy affidavit detailing the technical reasons why the patent should not be issued; detailed petitions asking for rejection of Sperry\u2019s patent followed on November 21, 1970, and January 27, 1971; finally, on April 20, 1971, appellant requested that the Deputy Commissioner reconsider his decision to grant the patent. It is our conclusion that in view of these and similar opportunities to submit written objections and comments, procedural due process did not compel the Patent Office to grant appellant also a personal interview with the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">WJR, The Goodwill Station, Inc. v. Federal Comm. Com\u2019n., 84 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 174 F.2d 226 (1948), rev\u2019d. Federal Comm. Com\u2019n. v. WJR, The Goodwill Station, 337 U.S. 265, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353 on remand, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 392, 178 F.2d 720 (1949), is instructive. The FCC granted permission to Coastal Plains Broadcasting for construction and operation of a radio station to serve parts of North Carolina. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 of the Communications Act, WJR filed a petition for reconsideration of the decision and also requested that a hearing be held in which WJR could participate. Its petition alleged that the new station would interfere with its broadcast signal and included an engineering affidavit in support of this allegation. Coastal Plains opposed the petition on grounds that even if the allegations were assumed true, the interference which resulted did not violate the Commission\u2019s rules and Standards of Good Engineering Practice \u2014 in effect, a motion to dismiss. By its decision and order the Commission denied without a hearing WJR\u2019s petition for reconsideration. This court characterized one of the central issues as follows: \u201c[I]s WJR entitled to a hearing before the Commission as to the sufficiency of the allegations of its petition, assuming their truth, to show indirect modification of its license by the granting of the Coastal Plains application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>174 F.2d at 231. In answer to this question the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>opinion<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> held that WJR was entitled to a hearing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, 337 U.S. 265, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353 (1949), holding that \u201cdue process of law\u201d as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment does not necessarily require federal administrative tribunals to grant oral argument to one claiming to be adversely affected by their determination of questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">\u201c[T]he right of oral argument as a matter of procedural due process varies from case to case in accordance with differing circumstances, as do other procedural regulations. Certainly the Constitution does not require oral argument in all cases where only insubstantial or frivolous questions- of law, or indeed even substantial ones, are raised. Equally certainly it has left wide discretion to Congress in creating the procedures to be followed in both administrative and judicial proceedings, as well as in their conjunction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>337 U.S. at 276, 69 S.Ct. at 1103.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">To require a hearing on all questions of law, the Court indicated, would have serious effects on administrative and judicial tribunals.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Both in the circumstances of <em>WJR </em>and in the present context Congress had provided for oral arguments or hearings only in limited instances. \u201cCongress, we think, has committed to the Commission\u2019s discretion . the questions whether and under what circumstances it will allow or require oral argument, except where the Act itself expressly requires it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>337 U.S. at 281, 69 S.Ct. at 1106. \u201c[I]t is hardly to be taken that Congress intended the \u2018reasonable opportunity to show cause\u2019 always to include opportunity for oral argument.\u201d <em>Id., </em>337 U.S. at 282, 69 S.Ct. at 1106. Neither the petitioner in <em>WJR </em>nor appellant here claimed that the hearing would allow presentation of information not already presented. \u201cRespondent does not contend that it was denied any opportunity to present for the Commission\u2019s consideration any matter of fact or law in connection with its application or that the Commission has not given all matters submitted by.it due and full consideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>337 U.S. at 284, 69 S.Ct. at 1107; <em>see also </em>Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Sales Affiliates, Inc., 233 F.2d 148, 164 (2d Cir. 1956). Indeed, it appears that at least the first refusal to grant the patent was influenced by appellant\u2019s written opposition. Although appellant asserts that the <em>ex parte </em>interview with Sperry resulted in the issuance of the patent, there is no indication that the patent would not have been issued without the interview in view of the amendments to the claim subsequently made. The argument here has not ranged so wide as to suggest that the granting of a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>interview to the applicant and not to the inventor was an invidious discrimination per se; but we have considered and rejected this circumstance as an indication of the failure of due process. While an interview or hearing may prove helpful in the determination of a question, it is not the function of a court to compel interviews unless there exists some obligation to accord them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Mindful of the admonition of the Supreme Court that necessity of oral arguments must be decided on a case by case basis, <em>WJR, </em>337 U.S. at 276, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353, it is our opinion that this case is not one in which a personal interview with the Examiner or other oral hearing was necessary as an element of due process. Appellant has sought throughout the five years of this controversy to persuade the Patent Office that his invention was \u201cobvious\u201d and therefore not patentable under federal law. \u201cUnder \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 694, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). This type of inquiry involves technical and largely documented consideration as to which personal interviews could be of minimal assistance to an examiner.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">This contrast of factual situations can be seen by comparing Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), with Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). In <em>Kelly </em>the problem concerned initial termination, after <em>ex parte </em>investigation, of welfare benefits without a prior hearing. The Court held that the rudimentary aspects of due process require \u201can effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d 397 U.S. at 268, 90 S.Ct. at 1020. In <em>Perales, </em>however, involving a federal statutory claim of disability benefits turning primarily upon medical evidence, the confrontation and cross-examination held required by due process of law in <em>Kelly </em>was not deemed essential.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">The instant ease involves a question of patentability in technical aspects analogous to the problem of applicant\u2019s health in <em>Perales. </em>Both cases involved evaluation of data; neither case involved the veracity of the parties where an examination of the witness by the trier of fact was crucial. As the court said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u201cThe matter comes down to the question of the procedure\u2019s integrity and fundamental fairness.\u201d 402 U.S. at 410, 91 S. Ct. at 1431.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We think that appellant was given ample opportunity to present his claims before the Patent Office even though he was not afforded a personal interview. \u201cThe ultimate requirement is a procedure that permits a meaningful opportunity to test and offer facts, present perspective, and invoke official discretion.\u201d Blackwell College of Business v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., 147 U.S.App. D.C. 85, 454 F.2d 928 (decided Sept. 10, 1971). The procedure followed by the Patent Office allows to reluctant inventors in appellant\u2019s position fair opportunity to present their opposition to the issuance of a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The motion to dismiss was properly granted by the district court. Assuming the truth of the facts well pleaded in appellant\u2019s complaint neither the statutory duties of the Patent Office nor the Due Process clause compelled the Commissioner of Patents to grant appellant a personal hearing or interview or the other procedures now demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-11\">. \u201cWhenever an inventor refuses to execute an application for patent, or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, a person to whom the inventor has assigned or agreed in writing to assign the invention or who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter justifying such action, may make application for patent on behalf of and as agent for the inventor on proof of the pertinent facts and a showing that such action is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties or to prevent irreparable damage; and the Commissioner may grant a patent to such inventor upon such notice to him as the Commissioner deems sufficient, and on compliance with such regulations as he prescribes.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-12\">. Appellant stated in his application for reconsideration of the denial of his petition for rejection of the patent application or for a full hearing: \u201cBecause of the damage to my personal reputation as an outstanding inventor, along with the injury to the public from the grant of an individual patent, I determined to contest the Sperry application. ... As I put it, the Patent Office cannot against my wishes and without reason, permanently associate my name as inventor on an invalid patent . . . without affording me all rights of due process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b802-17\">. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.47(b) (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-18\">. The Patent Office interpreted appellant\u2019s employment contract with Sperry as an agreement to assign future rights in appellant\u2019s inventions to Sperry, rather than a straight assignment, and hence determined that the patent must issue to appellant alone, not to Sperry or to appellant as Sperry\u2019s assignor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. The Examiner, in a letter to UNIVAO Engineering Center, stated the following reasons for rejecting the application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\u201cClaims 1 to 8 are rejected as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.

By the inventor\u2019s own admission, in a letter to Mr. Cleaver dated February 25, 1966, and made of record by the inventor (paper #4), he does not consider this to be a \u2018patentable invention\u2019. The inventor, Mr. Cogar, further states that \u2018ON-ON flip flops (more commonly referred to as complimentary (sic) flip-flops), bi-directional current gates, bi-directional shift registers including direct indicator drive are well known and widely used in the art.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\">.
