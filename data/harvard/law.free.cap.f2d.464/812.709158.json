SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b867-21\">Appellant WCOV, Inc., the licensee of UHF Television Station WCOV in Montgomery, Alabama, seeks to prevent VHF Station WSLA, located in Selma, Alabama, from expanding its effective radiated power. The Federal Communications Commission approved WSLA\u2019s proposed expansion and denied appellant\u2019s request for reconsideration without a hearing. Finding no error in the Commission\u2019s procedures and no abuse of discretion in its decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b867-23\">WSLA began operation as Selma\u2019s only television station in 1960 at an effective radiated power of 2.51 kw, one of the lowest in the country. The station consistently lost large amounts of money until 1968 when a fire destroyed its facilities and silenced its broadcasts altogether. On August IS, 1970, in an effort to get the station back on the air, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the licensee, Selma Television Incorporated (STI), filed an application with the Commission to transfer the station to Central Alabama Broadcasters, Inc. (Central). This application was followed, about a week later, by a second application requesting a tenfold increase in effective radiated power. It was made clear to the Commission that the two applications were mutually contingent \u2014 that is that Central would not be interested in purchasing WSLA unless the station\u2019s power was increased and that STI was not interested in resuming broadcasting at increased power unless the sale to Central was approved. No petitions to deny or informal objections were filed, and the Commission approved the assignment application and the modification of facilities application simultaneously several months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Thereupon, WCOV filed with the Commission a petition for reconsideration. Although it did not oppose the grant of the assignment application, WCOV argued that enlargement of WSLA\u2019s Grade B contour would endanger WCOV\u2019s competitive position and therefore have an adverse UHF impact. <em>Cf. </em>In re Application of KTIV Television Co., 2 Pike &amp; Fischer RR2d 95 (1964). Moreover, WCOV contended that Central\u2019s surveys of the programming-needs of its gain area were inadequate. Finally, WCOV argued that it had the \u201cgood reason\u201d required by Section 1.106(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Commission\u2019s rules for not filing a pre-grant petition to deny. Specifically, WCOV argued that it was unfairly surprised when the Commission granted the assignment and modification applications together and that it had planned to oppose the modification application when and if the assignment application \u2014 which it did \"not oppose \u2014 was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In a careful and detailed opinion, the Commission rejected each of these eontentions. It found WCOV\u2019s excuse for failure to file a petition to deny unpersuasive, and therefore held that WCOV would be held to a \u201chigher standard\u201d before reconsideration would be granted. Moreover, the Commission found that even under the normal standard WCOV had failed to allege sufficient facts to require a hearing. It found the adverse UHF impact to be de <em>minimis </em>and easily outweighed by the need to provide television service to the Selma market. Similarly, it held that Central\u2019s gain area survey, as supplemented after the petition for reconsideration was filed, to be in accord with the Commission\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Having failed to persuade the Commission, WCOV now renews its arguments in this court. For the reasons given below, we find appellant\u2019s contentions equally unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Strictly speaking, it is unnecessary for us to review the Commission\u2019s decision to hold WCOV to a higher standard since a careful reading of the Commission\u2019s opinion makes clear that it would have rejected WCOV\u2019s petition even under the usual pre-grant test. Nonetheless, we note in passing that the Commission\u2019s insistence on a higher standard in this situation is neither unreasonable nor unprecedented. As this court stated in Valley Telecasting Co. v. FCC, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 410, 336 F.2d 914 (1964), post-grant pleadings should not be granted unless they \u201cclearly point to an injury to the public sufficient to outweigh considerations of administrative orderliness,\u201d 118 U.S.App.D.C. at 413, 336 F.2d at 917, or \u201cclearly require a hearing to avoid the possibility of a serious injury to the public.\u201d 118 U.S. App.D.C. at 415, 336 F.2d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The Commission has frequently ruled on two mutually contingent appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>cations together,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we see nothing inherently arbitrary about this procedure. On the contrary, it seems to us to be an eminently sensible device for avoiding wasted effort and moot decisions. The FCC rules make no provision for an extension of time to file a petition to deny when one application is dependent upon another,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and WCOV points to no past Commission decisions which could have misled it. We need hardly elaborate on the importance to the agency of having the arguments against an application before it at the time the initial decision is made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If WCOV was really confused about the proper timing of its petition to deny, it could have requested clarification from the Commission before the initial decision. Instead, appellant chose to sleep on its rights and, having done so, it should not be heard to complain about the consequences of its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We share the Commission\u2019s view that, whatever standard is used to judge WCOV\u2019s petition, it fails to make sufficient factual allegations to require a hearing. <em>Cf. </em>WLVA, Inc. Lynchburg, Virginia v. FCC, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 262, 459 F.2d 1286 (1972). WCOV relies heavily on the adverse UHF impact which expansion of WSLA\u2019s Grade B contour would allegedly cause. However, in recent years the Commission has indicated that the need to avoid adverse UHF impact is no longer as pressing as it has been in the past. Although UHF impact will apparently still be considered, it will now be given somewhat less weight when balanced against important competing Commission policies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The UHF. impact doctrine is, of course, a creation of the Commission and the Commission is free to give it such weight as it chooses, provided it is not arbitrary or irrational. <em>See </em>WLVA, Inc., Lynchburg, Virginia v. FCC, <em>supra, </em>148 U.S.App.D.C. at 279, 459 F.2d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">It is hardly arbitrary or irrational to hold, as the Commission did here, that any adverse UHF impact is easily outweighed by the need to provide the Selma market with television service \u2014a goal which the Commission has been pursuing since 1954. Even with the tenfold increase in its effective radiated power, WSLA will still be one of the weakest stations in the country \u2014 weaker by far, incidentally, than WCOV. The Commission reasonably found that it was simply not possible to get WSLA back on the air without this modest increase, and that the increase would inevitably cause some further overlap with WCOV\u2019s market. We cannot say that the Commission exceeded its mandate by subordinating UHF impact to the need to provide city-grade service to Selma.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Moreover, we are particularly reluctant to upset the balance struck by the Commission in light of the <em>de minimis </em>nature of the adverse UHF impact alleged by WCOV. Granting WSLA\u2019s modification application will cause a scant three per cent increase in its Grade B contour overlap with WCOV. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Even with the increased power, WSLA\u2019s signal will not approach Montgomery, which is WCOV\u2019s primary market. The adverse UHF impact should be further reduced by the fact that WSLA and WCOV enjoy different -network affiliations. Although WCOV has lost money every year since it began operations, these losses have been steadily declining, and the station is now apparently in a fairly stable financial condition. In light of all these facts, we share the Commission\u2019s view that the adverse UHF impact caused by WSLA\u2019s increase in power is unlikely to be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">WCOV argues that Central\u2019s pre-grant survey was inadequate and that the Commission erred in allowing Central to supplement the survey after WCOV filed its petition for reconsideration. However, as the Commission pointed out, if WCOV had filed a petition to deny, Central would have been permitted to amend its application at the pre-grant stage. Having remained silent until after the modification application was approved, WCOV can hardly object to the fact that Central responded to its arguments at the post-grant stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">When Central\u2019s initial survey is viewed together with its supplementation, we cannot say that the Commission erred in finding it adequate. Indeed, it is interesting that Central\u2019s survey is a good deal more extensive than the survey submitted by WCOV itself when WCOV was interested in buying the station. We also note that Central has undertaken to serve primarily Selma and Dallas Counties, which are not within WSLA\u2019s gain area. Inasmuch as the Commission has previously held that population surveys need be less extensive for areas outside the primary service area, <em>see </em>In re Application of Liberty Television, 26 FCC2d 760, 763 (1970); In re Application of Eagle Broadcasting Co., 20 FCC2d 233, 236 (1969), Central\u2019s gain area survey need only show that its programming will be generally responsive to the community\u2019s needs. And since WCOV purports not to oppose WSLA\u2019s return to the air at its previously authorized power, it can only be heard to complain about the adequacy of the survey in the gain area. When our examination of the survey is so restricted, we cannot say that the Commission erred in holding it to be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.106(b) (1972), which provides in pertinent part: \u201c * * * If the' petition [for reconsideration] is filed by a person who is not a party to the proceeding, it shall * * * show good reason why it was not possible for him to participate in the earlier stages of the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">.
