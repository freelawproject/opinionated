Ehlert v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>1971, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed. 2d 625. <em>Ehlert </em>held also that the Selective Service Statute, 32 CFR \u00a7 1625.2 (1971) prohibits a Local Board\u2019s reopening a registrant\u2019s classification in circumstances similar to those this case presents. Here, however, the registrant\u2019s board did take some action which the registrant describes in his brief as a \u201cde facto\u201d reopening of his classification. The United States Attorney, in his brief, describes this action of the Local Board as a \u201ccourtesy interview\u201d. Regardless of how it may be described, the Board had no power to reopen the registrant\u2019s classification. Moreover, the Board\u2019s conclusory statements, pure dictum, which the registrant had no opportunity to respond to, should not be permitted to prejudice the registrant in any other proceedings he might bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
