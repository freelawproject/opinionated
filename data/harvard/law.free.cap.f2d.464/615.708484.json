Illinois, 1968, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776. Secondly, he urges that the imposition of the death penalty amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The intervening decision in Furman v. Georgia, 1972, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 and its companion cases holding that the death penalty as imposed under the Georgia and Texas statutes is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment is controlling. There, as in Florida,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the death penalty has been inequitably, arbitrarily, and infrequently imposed and thus \u201cconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d. 408 U. S. at 239, 92 S.Ct. at 2727.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to grant the writ if the state of Florida should fail or refuse within a reasonable period of time to reduce Newman\u2019s sentence to a period not exceeding life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">.

Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary for us to consider Newman\u2019s contention concerning the lack of the voir dire transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
