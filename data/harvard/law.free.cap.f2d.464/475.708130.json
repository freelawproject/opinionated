The motion, made in the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2515 and 2518(10) (a), was based primarily on the allegation that the government had failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That section requires that either the Attorney General or a specially designated Assistant Attorney General authorize applications for the interception of wire communications. In the instant case the application was reviewed and authorized by Sol Lindenbaum, the Executive Assistant to the Attorney General. The district court granted appellee\u2019s motion, and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10) (b) the government brought this appeal. The threshold question, and the only one we reach, is whether a motion to suppress is available to a grand jury witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520) provides a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of wiretapping and electronic surveillance. Wire and oral communications obtained in violation of the statutory provisions, and the fruits of such unlawful interceptions, may not be introduced before a grand jury or other enumerated forums. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other sections of the Act detail the remedies for those aggrieved by unlawful interceptions: \u00a7 2518(10) (a) provides for motions to suppress, \u00a7 2511 for criminal sanctions, and \u00a7 2520 for civil relief. Also, in the recent case of Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (June 26, 1972), the Supreme Court approved the raising of a \u00a7 2515 violation in defense to a contempt citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-19\">It is the interpretation of \u00a7 2518(10) (a) which concerns us here. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-20\">\u201cAny aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, may move to suppress the contents .of any intercepted wire or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>There is no contention that the appellee is not an \u201caggrieved person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, on the face of the statute, proceedings before grand juries might be thought to be included, as a grand jury is arguably an \u201cauthority of the United States\u201d and the motion to suppress would be a \u201cproceeding in or before any court.\u201d However, the specific omission of \u201cgrand jury\u201d from this section is significant when the language is compared to that of \u00a7 2515, see note 3 <em>supra,, </em>and when the legislative history is consulted. A comparison of the two sections makes the omission of \u201cgrand jury\u201d from \u00a7 2518(10) (a) obvious and glaring, and congressional concern is manifest in the Senate report which accompanied the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201c[Section 2518(10) (a)] must be read in connection with sections 2515 and 2517, discussed above, which it limits. It provides the remedy for the right created by section 2515. Because no person is a party as such to a grand jury proceeding, the provision does not envision the making of a motion to suppress in the context of such a proceeding itself. Normally, there is no limitation on the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand jury, which is enforcible by an individual. (Blue v. United States, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416 [16 L.Ed.2d 518] (1965).) There is no intent to change this general rule. It is the intent of the provision only that when a motion to suppress is granted in another context, its scope may include use in a future-grand jury proceeding.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 106 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2195.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">It is therefore beyond dispute that the omission of \u201cgrand jury\u201d was both intentional and significant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In Gelbard v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the Court examined the omission without deciding the availability of motions to suppress evidence to witnesses before a grand jury. The majority opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201cThe congressional concern with the applicability of \u00a7 2518(10) (a) in grand jury proceedings, so far as it is discernible from the Senate report, was apparently that defendants and potential defendants might be able to utilize suppression motions to impede the issuance of indictments ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">The asserted omission of grand jury proceedings from \u00a7 2518(10) (a) may well reflect congressional acceptance of that procedure<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as adequate in these cases .... Although the Government points to statements in the Senate report to the effect that \u00a7 2518(10) (a) \u2018limits\u2019 \u00a7 2515, we read those statements to mean that suppression motions, as a method of enforcing the prohibition of \u00a7 2515, must be made in accordance with the restrictions upon forums, procedures, and grounds specified in \u00a7 2518(10) (a).\u201d 408 U.S. at 59, 92 S.Ct. at 2367. (Footnote supplied; original footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">The opinion refrained from holding that motions to suppress were unavailable to grand jury witnesses and relied instead on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 as authorizing a contempt defense based on 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 2515. The four dissenting Justices, looking to the statutory scheme and legislative history, argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that motions to suppress could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>be made in the context of grand jury proceedings. The dissent noted that prior to the Omnibus Act grand jury witnesses were not entitled to suppression hearings, and that Congress did not intend to alter this rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Although the <em>Gelbard </em>majority opinion does not provide explicit precedent to guide our statutory interpretation, we find that the language, context, and legislative history of \u00a7 2518(10) (a) mandate the conclusion that Congress has not authorized such suppression procedures for grand jury witnesses. We are mindful that prior to <em>Gelbard, </em>some courts<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contended that the Senate report\u2019s citation to Blue v. United States, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966) somehow limited or weakened the language: \u201cthe provision does not envision the making of a motion to suppress in the context of [a grand jury] proceeding . . . .\u2019\u2019No case has been called to our attention, nor have we found any, in which a witness has been permitted to suppress evidence before a grand jury. It is hardly surprising therefore that the closest authority the Senate could find was Blue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor do we find the quoted language sufficiently ambiguous to lend substance to the argument that because motions to suppress are made in court rather than before the grand jury, they are authorized by \u00a7 2518(10) (a). The Court did not decide this question. While footnote 20 of the majority opinion<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> suggests the distinction, we find the dissent\u2019s analysis compelling on this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">We therefore hold that, whatever rights a witness may have in a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to a contempt proceeding, he may not anticipate such a proceeding by bringing a motion to suppress evidence before the grand jury. This result strikes a balance between the requirements of the federal wiretap statute and the efficient functioning of the grand jury. It allows the grand jury to proceed, uninterrupted by lengthy suppression hearings unless and until the power to compel testimony is invoked. The aggrieved grand jury witness is not left without remedies for the unlawful interception. While remedies other than suppression may be less efficacious in protecting individual rights, it must be remembered that the Omnibus Act provides greater protection than previously existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The order of the district court is reversed and the motion to suppress is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\">.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the dissenters, stated: \u201c[Section] 2515 contains a basic proscription of certain conduct, but does not attempt to specify remedies or rights arising from a breach of that proscription; the specification of remedies is left to other sections. Other sections provide several remedies; criminal and civil sanctions are imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 2511 and 2520, whereas \u00a7 2518(10) (a) accords a right to a suppression hearing in specified cases. Thus the fact that one who may be the victim of alleged unlawful surveillance on the part of the Government is not accorded an <em>Alderman-type </em>suppression hearing under the provisions of \u00a7 2518(10) (a) is not left remediless to such a degree that it must be presumed to have been an oversight; he is remitted to the institution of civil proceedings, or the filing of a complaint leading to the institution of a criminal prosecution. While the latter two remedies may not be as efficacious in many situations as a suppression hearing, the remission of an aggrieved party to those remedies certainly does not render nugatory the general proscription contained in \u00a7 2515.\u201d 405 U.S. at-, 92 S.Ct. at 2377.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\">. <em>See </em>In re Evans, 452 F.2d 1239, 1245-46 (D.C.Cir. 1971), cert denied, 408 U.S. 930, 92 S.Ct. 2479, 33 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972); In re Egan, 450 F.2d 199, 205-206 (3d Cir. 1971), aff\u2019d, 408 U.S. 41, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\">. <em>See also </em>Gelbard v.
