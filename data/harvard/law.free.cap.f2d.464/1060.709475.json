They were charged with violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a) (1) and 841(b) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">The day after the indictment was returned, the defendants proceeded before Judge Whipple and filed an order to show cause (1) why the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey \u201cought not to be precluded from continuing the prosecution,\u201d or (2) \u201cwhy any Indictment or Indictments which may have been handed up in the within matter ought not to be dismissed.\u201d By the terms of the order submitted for court approval, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey would have been \u201cpermanently enjoined and restrained\u201d from proceeding to seek an indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants claimed that such injunctive relief was warranted because the Government had allegedly failed to fulfill its part of a \u201cbargain\u201d which all the parties to this appeal had made in September, 1971. Crusco and Cimmino contended that, under the terms of this \u201cbargain\u201d they gave to the Government \u201ctapes and confidential communications\u201d which were \u201ccrucial to their defense\u201d in order to help the Government make a comprehensive investigation of whether a Government agent had acted illegally in pursuing the appellants. The defendants were also allegedly required to \u201crefrain from filing motions\u201d so that the Government\u2019s investigation could be expedited. In return, the Government was said to have promised them a \u201ccomprehensive full report of the results of the investigation\u201d and dismissal of the indictment in the event that illegality were uncovered. The appellants filed for injunctive relief on the ground that the Government had breached this \u201cbargain\u201d and that the Government\u2019s action \u201chas made any preparation of a defense an impossibility.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">The judge denied the relief requested in the order \u201cwithout prejudice to proceed by notice of motion.\u201d The present appeal is taken from this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">After the appellants filed their appeal and unsuccessfully sought a stay of the district court proceedings pending the disposition of the appeal, they filed a notice of motion for a restraining order, or in the alternative a dismissal of the indictment. A hearing was held on February 14, 1972, after which the parties entered into a February 25th consent order providing that there be an evidentiary hearing on March 15, 1972 so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>the court could determine the facts relevant to the appellants\u2019 claim for relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The appellants assert that they are entitled to review of the judge\u2019s denial of the order to show cause on the basis of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (1), which permits appeals from motions for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To prevail on this contention, they must demonstrate that the order denied by the district judge was in fact an injunction, because denials of temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable. Richardson v. Kennedy, 418 F.2d 235 (3d Cir. 1969); United States v. Chelsea Towers, 404 F. 2d 329, 330 (3d Cir. 1968); Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association v. Port of Philadelphia Marine Terminal Association, 276 F.2d 931 (3d Cir. 1960). Cf. Pan American World Airways v. Flight Engineers\u2019 International Association, 306 F.2d 840, 843 (2d Cir. 1962); Perl-man v. United States, 247 U.S. 7, 13, 38 S.Ct. 417, 62 L.Ed. 950 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The order to show cause submitted by the appellants to the district judge requested the issuance of a permanent injunction, prior to a hearing and without notice to the Government. The relief requested is not available, however, through an <em>ex parte </em>procedure. Judge Whipple accordingly denied the order to show cause and directed the appellants to seek their injunctive relief by way of a notice of motion. F.R.Crim.P. Rule 12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">Why the appellants believed they could obtain a permanent injunction without notice or a hearing is beyond our understanding. Even if we assume the appellants\u2019 erroneous premise that injunctive relief is as available in criminal matters as it is in' civil practice, the appellants were nonetheless not entitled to obtain more than a temporary restraint through an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite the confusion wrought by the appellants\u2019 unorthodox and, indeed, impermissible hybrid application for an order to show cause, it is clear that the district court did not deny injunctive relief. While refusing a temporary restraint, the district court explained to the appellants that they could still give notice, obtain the requisite hearing and seek an injunction of the prosecution and a dismissal of the indictment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both parties consent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>ed to a hearing scheduled for February 25, 1972, but it was postponed pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The denial of the order to show cause cannot properly be construed as a \u00a7 1292(a) (1)' denial of injunctive relief. The motions for injunctive relief and dismissal of the indictment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are still before the district court and are yet to be decided. What the judge did was simply to inform the appellants that there was no <em>ex parte </em>short cut to a permanent injunction and that if they wanted to try to enjoin the Government or have the indictment dismissed, they would have to proceed via notice of motion, the normal route.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">We find that the judge\u2019s denial of the order to show cause was not appealable within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a) (1). Richardson v. Kennedy, <em>supra. </em>A mandate will issue to dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">. We note that the appellants applied to enjoin the United States Attorney from seeking an indictment one day after the indictment had been returned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">.

The appellants do not argue that the judge\u2019s decision constituted \u201ca final order\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1116-18\">. Under F.R.Civ.P., Rule 65, even a preliminary injunction may not issue \u201cwithout notice to the adverse party.\u201d A temporary restraint may be granted without notice if \u201cirreparable\u201d injury would otherwise occur, but such an order normally expires within ten days of the time of entry and the restrained party may \u201c[o]n 2 days\u2019 notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, * * * move its dissolution or modification * * Rule 65(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1116-21\">. Since the indictment has already been handed down by the grand jury, it would be meaningless for the district judge to consider the appropriateness of enjoining its return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1117-17\">.
