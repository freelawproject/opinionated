Concluding that the Trial Court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-23\">On February 5, 1971 Agent Thomas J. Baekes of the United States Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs was advised by a confidential informant that the defendant would be delivering heroin at approximately 11 p. m. to an individual named Cleveland Green, who would be driving a light blue 1960 De Soto sedan, license number 223B907. The informant, whose reliability had been repeatedly demonstrated on previous occasions, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>provided a general physical description of Green and the approximate geographical area in which the delivery was to take place. As a result of surveillance activities late that night Backes observed the defendant stop his automobile, honk the horn several times and motion toward another car matching the informant\u2019s description and containing an individual resembling Green. The officers immediately closed in and forcibly removed the defendant from his vehicle, at which time a package of heroin fell out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">On the basis of this encapsulated version of facts that are in all material respects undisputed, we hold that there was probable cause for a search of the defendant\u2019s automobile and that the motion to suppress was therefore properly denied. Draper v. United States, 1959, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327; United States v. Acosta, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
