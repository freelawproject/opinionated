Second-guessing jury instructions is tricky business, especially when the instructions require exposition of the law on a subject not <em>clearly </em>settled by the Supreme Court and this Court. Still, we feel compelled to hold that the instructions at issue here confused the jury and deprived the plaintiff of a fair chance to persuade the jury of his version of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">On May 5, 1970, the plaintiff Joseph Henry Kyzar and other longshoremen employed by Cooper Stevedoring Company were engaged in unloading sixty foot lengths of structural steel from the M/V JAYME MAIA, owned and operated by the defendant Vale Do Ri Doce Navegacai, S.A. The ship was moored at the Napoleon Avenue Wharf in New Orleans. A shore level crane with a hundred foot boom hoisted the steel beams out of the Number 5 hatch of the JAYME MAIA. A fellow longshoreman of the plaintiff operated the crane. He could not see into the hold of the ship and, in deciding when to \u201cboom up\u201d or \u201cboom down\u201d, relied upon hand signals from another longshoreman stationed on the deck of the ship overlooking the hatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">On signal from this flagman, the crane operator first spotted the boom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>over the hatch. The crane cable was then hooked to the steel beams in the hold. Because the beams were some fifteen feet longer than the hatch opening, the load was \u201cdipped\u201d to get it clear of the hatch \u2014 moved to a catercornered position by the crane operator who would boom up or boom down.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Kyzar was injured while allegedly pushing the steel by hand to guide it out of the hatch. Kyzar testified: \u201ca steel beam had been slung and the gear had begun to lift. The beam began to swing erratically and [Kyzar] was finally ridden by the beam to the bulwarks where he struck the side of the ship and fell into a hole at the edge of the cargo.\u201d The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to disprove that Kyzar had pushed the beam. It indicated that Kyzar had negligently failed to heed a warning from the flagman designed to alert longshoreman to possible swings by the cargo as it was lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The crux of Kyzar\u2019s legal position in the district court was that the JAYME MAIA was unseaworthy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, Kyzar argued, no tag lines <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were provided to be used during manual guidance of the steel beams, despite a regulation of the Bureau of Labor Standards requiring that \u201cloads requiring continual manual guidance while in motion shall be provided with tag lines.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kyzar contended that the failure to provide tag lines violated the regulation and rendered the ship unseaworthy as a matter of law; or, that even if the regulation did not apply, proper equipment for the vessel would have included tag lines for the injury-causing unloading procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">Second, Kyzar tried to prove that the boom had been improperly spotted over the hatch and that this improper use of seaworthy equipment by the plaintiff\u2019s fellow longshoremen constituted an unseaworthy condition. Finally, Kyzar tried to show that he should have been provided with a \u201chard hat\u201d during the unloading procedure. He based this contention, like his position on the need for tag lines, on both a BLS regulation <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on the fitness of the ship independently of those regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">The chief bone of contention in this Court is the lower court\u2019s charge to the jury on operational negligence, directly relevant to the alleged improper spotting of the boom and perhaps relevant to the tag line and hard hat issues as well. The charge was designed to require the jury to distinguish an unsafe <em>condition </em>amounting to unseaworthiness from a single negligent <em>act </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s fellow longshoremen: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">You must bear in mind that, in order for the ship owner to be liable for the negligent acts of the longshoremen, or for the improper use of seaworthy equipment by the [longshoremen], those acts or that use must create an unsafe condition of the ship or her appurtenances which subsequently causes injury. There can be no unseaworthiness if the negligent act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>improper use and the resulting injury are simultaneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">The law generally recognizes that a corporation is liable for the negligence of <em>its </em>employees. Therefore, a ship owner is not liable for the negligent acts of the stevedore\u2019s employees, that is, the longshoremen, but it becomes liable if the negligent acts of the longshoremen create an unseaworthy condition which subsequently causes injury. The law does not regard that an unsafe condition of the ship of unseaworthiness can be created if the negligent act and injury are simultaneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJPj\">After deliberating for an undisclosed period of time, the jury asked the court for clarification of this part of the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cJudge Cassibry:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">We would like a diffinition [sic] of \u2018simultaneous\u2019 in reference to your charge on unseaworthiness causing an accident. Is it instantaneous or is it one eontineous [sic] action ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">GA White Foreman\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The court recalled the jury and repeated its earlier charge on unseaworthiness without modifying the language defining operational negligence. After the jury asked for clarification of the meaning of \u201csimultaneous\u201d, and after the trial court repeated the original language, counsel for the plaintiff specifically objected to the unelaborated charge; counsel for the defendant agreed that the charge was misleading. Even the court itself expressed doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">Are there any objections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">After hearing that again, something does bother me. It is possible the jury might have gotten the impression negligence of employees simultaneous with injury will not permit recovery. Of course, if this is a condition of failure to supply or some other reason for unseaworthiness, there will be failure \u2014 there will be recovery even though the negligence is contemporaneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">I don\u2019t think that came through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-18\">Mr. Lugenbuhl? [counsel for defendant]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-19\">You know, that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m not going to change it, because you all will never agree on what I should tell them. And I don\u2019t blame you because that\u2019s an area we really need a lot of guidance on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-20\">COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-21\">I don\u2019t agree with the charge that you gave, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-22\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-23\">All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-24\">COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-25\">* -x- * we again suggest to the Court the operation of negligence and the effect of the single act of negligence of fellow longshoremen should have been brought to the jury in light of the special charge that we previously requested. The thing, the crushing dilemma, if it be a dilemma, highlights the needs to properly establish precedent in these charges. We didn\u2019t think the Court did originally, and we renew our objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-27\">The charge was not changed, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant in all respects and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-28\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-29\"> In considering the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, \u201cwe must consider the charge as a whole, in connection with the contentions made by the parties in the trial court, and from the standpoint of the jury. If the charge in general correctly instructs, then even though a portion is technically imperfect, no harmful error is committed.\u201d Troutman v. Southern Ry. Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 586, 590; Webster v. Sea Drilling Corp., 5 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>1969, 411 F.2d 411, 413; Grey v. First National Bank, 5 Cir. 1968, 393 F.2d 371, 387. \u201cOur scrutiny of the district court\u2019s instructions must be orbitary and universal, not narrow and monocular.\u201d McDaniel v. Slade, 5 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 607, 609, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The trial court\u2019s charge to the jury cannot stand when, as a whole, the charge leaves us with substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations. In the instant case the trial court\u2019s charge leaves us with precisely such doubt. We agree with the appellant that, particularly after the jury had indicated its bewilderment with the word \u201csimultaneous\u201d and the appellant had objected to a rerun of the original instruction, it was not enough for the trial judge to repeat the initial instruction on operational negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The court was attempting \u2014 quite properly \u2014 to convey to the jury that \u201cunseaworthiness is a condition\u201d and that \u201cthe isolated, personal negligent act of the [plaintiff\u2019s] fellow longshoreman\u201d through the improper use of non-defective equipment does not render a ship unseaworthy. Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 500, 91 S.Ct. 514, 518, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 567.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An army of commentators has wrestled with the <em>Usner </em>distinction and often despaired of understanding its refinements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the task of charging a jury on the distinction between act and condition is one no trial judge welcomes and no appellate judge envies.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Still, we are of the opinion that the instant instruction embodies a notion of operational negligence which, when interpreted from the jurors\u2019 point of view, conflicts with <em>Usner </em>and the developing law of unseaworthiness. In one sense, whether a negligent act or improper use by a fellow longshoreman and the resulting injury are \u201csimultaneous\u201d is relevant to a determination of unseaworthiness. An act of a fellow longshoreman has only an instantaneous duration when it begins or develops, for the first time, contemporaneously with injury to the plaintiff. And \u2014 whether for sound policy reasons or not \u2014 it appears that a greater-than-instantaneous duration is what converts a single act of negligence into a condition tantamount to unseaworthiness. The condition need not exist for long enough to permit discovery by a reasonably prudent shipowner. Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 1960, 363 U.S. 539, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941. But the act must in some way have roots which can be traced back in time for more than the instant separating act and injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The relevant simultaneity, it must be noted, is that of injury and <em>inception </em>of substandard conduct, not injury and <em>simple occurrence </em>of substandard conduct. We explained this distinction recently in Robinson v. Showa Kaiun K. K., 5 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 688, 690:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\"><em>Usner </em>distinguished \u201cinstantaneous\u201d unseaworthiness from what might be called \u201cconnected\u201d unseaworthiness. A longshoreman or one of his fellows might engage in a <em>congeries </em>of negligent acts that are of such a character or that continue for such a length of time that they become related to the status of the vessel. That <em>congeries </em>of acts might create a \u201ccondition\u201d of unseaworthiness, so that an individual act of negligence within or after the <em>congeries </em>might give rise to liability under the unseaworthiness doctrine. However, if the negligent act of a longshoreman is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>part of any <em>congeries </em>of negligent acts connected to the status of the vessel or to its loading but is rather an isolated \u201cinstantaneous\u201d act of negligence within an otherwise seaworthy method of loading on an otherwise seaworthy vessel, then that one act of negligence by the longshoreman or his fellows will not render the vessel unseaworthy. <em>Compare </em>Alexander v. Meiji Kaiun K.K., D.C.La.1961, 195 F.Supp. 831, aff\u2019d sub nom. Strachan Shipping Co. v. Alexander, 5 Cir. 1962, 311 F.2d 335, <em>with </em>Taylor v. S. S. Helen Lykes, 5 Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 777, and Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">For example, a single act of an incompetent crewman \u2014 a violent attack on a fellow crew member \u2014 may demonstrate the unseaworthiness of the crew, but only if the assailant has previously demonstrated a \u201csavage disposition.\u201d Boudoin v. Lykes Brothers Steamship Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 336, 75 S.Ct. 382, 99 L. Ed. 354. This restriction on recovery in the <em>Boudoin </em>situation reflects the need to link the substandard conduct of fellow crew members to an earlier point in time \u2014when the disposition for violence established itself in the assailant\u2019s personality and thereby created the condition of his unfitness for service with other men. Similarly, \u201ca continuous course of negligent conduct by a crewman, when coupled with a negligent act which results in injury, could provide a basis for an unseaworthiness recovery. The course of negligent conduct would be evidence of the incompetence of the crew to meet the contingencies of the voyage and of the crew\u2019s unsuitability for its intended service. The single negligent act which causes injury is not evidence of unseaworthiness per se but it does serve to connect the injury with the existing unseaworthy condition. The single act would establish the requisite causal connection between the unseaworthy condition of the crew, as evidenced by the continuing course of negligent conduct on the part of the crewman, and the injury to the seaman.\u201d Note, Unseaworthiness and Operational Negligence: Condition versus Cause \u2014 Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 13 B.C. Ind. &amp; Comm.L.Rev. 568, 580 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> It is apparent from the foregoing analysis that a trial court invites serious confusion by instructing against liability in unseaworthiness \u201cif the negligent act or improper use and the resulting injury are simultaneous.\u201d For the jury may well believe that an individual act causing immediate injury cannot reflect unseaworthiness even though the act occurs within or after \u201ca <em>congeries </em>of negligent acts that are of such a character or that continue for such a length of time that they become related to the status of the vessel.\u201d Robinson v. Showa Kaiun K.K., <em>supra. </em>In the present case, the unelaborated use of \u201csimultaneous\u201d would permit the jury to believe the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the boom was spotted incorrectly throughout the unloading operation \u2014 plainly a condition of unseaworthiness \u2014 and yet still deny recovery. The jury might reason that the injury occurred simultaneously with continued improper spotting of the boom by Kyzar\u2019s fellow longshoreman. The instruction was fatally ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">When a trial court must charge on operational negligence, the court\u2019s first responsibility is to establish, in so many words, the Supreme Court\u2019s own distinction between operational negligence and unseaworthiness. The jury must be told to distinguish between an \u201cisolated, personal negligent act of [a] fellow longshoreman\u201d and an individual act of such duration or character that it may be described as a condition of the crew and consequently the vessel itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In defining an \u201cisolated, personal negligent act of a fellow longshoreman,\u201d a court may wish to suggest the relevance of the time when the act causing injury first commences. We do not say that the consideration is entirely beside the point. We do say, though, that the potential for confusion is great when a jury is told to determine operational negligence by considering the simultane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ity of act and injury. Once the concept is launched into the jury\u2019s minds, it is hard to see how it can be adequately explained in less than several complex sentences. We seriously doubt that the jury will do better after a heavy dose of \u201csimultaneous\u201d than it would if left to distinguish a single isolated act of negligence from an act traceable to a time prior to injury and therefore linked to the condition of the vessel or its crew.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">For the interests of judicial economy, other alleged defects in the charge deserve brief comment. The appellant complains of the trial court\u2019s handling of the instruction on tag lines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, the appellant objects to the court\u2019s failure to charge specifically that the failure to provide tag lines might still constitute unseaworthiness even though the Bureau of Labor Standards regulation did not apply to the facts of this case. Second, Kyzar objects to the failure of the court to reread, after the jury was recalled for further instructions, the original charge on the tag line regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We feel it unnecessary to comment on the failure to reread the tag line instruction when the jury was recalled. The problem is unlikely to recur during the second trial of this cause. However, given the central importance of the dispute over tag lines, the court\u2019s initial instruction should have told the' jury specifically that the failure to provide tag lines might constitute unseaworthiness even if the lines were not required by BLS regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court\u2019s actual instruction carried a strong implication that unseaworthiness, as it related to the tag line issue, could be made out only by a finding that the regulation had been violated. Moreover, the jury should have been reminded specifically of the terms of the tag line regulation, and required to find the Regulation applicable if it determined this load to have required continuous manual guidance while in motion. There was much clarity to gain and little to lose by such a reminder, even though the Regulation was in evidence and had been referred to extensively in summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">As for the hard hat charge, the court instructed that the hard hat regulation was inapplicable as a matter of law, but did not instruct that the regulation was not dispositive. The inevitable effect of the instruction was to suggest that the jury need not consider the plaintiff\u2019s contentions that hard hats ought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>been provided as part of the ship\u2019s equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Finally, we note the appellant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s instruction on \u201cspotting the boom\u201d was too general<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and should have stated in context that \u201ca boom that is spotted incorrectly renders the vessel unseaworthy.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Because the court\u2019s instruction on operational negligence, repeated after confusion was apparent, was confusing and may have substantially deprived the plaintiff of fair treatment by the jury, we conclude that the judgment below must be vacated and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">APPENDIX: See footnote 7</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The law distinguishes between a condition and an act, which may or may not bring about a condition of unseaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Now this concept involves a rather fine distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Some courts have referred to it as a metaphysical distinction, or \u201chairsplitting,\u201d but nonetheless it exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">I will try to simplify it for you, since you are called upon to make the determination of whether the ship was in fact unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Unseaworthiness is a condition whereby a vessel or its equipment is not reasonably fit for its intended use, and if that condition of unfitness exists at the time of the accident, and as a result a crew member or longshoreman is injured, the shipowner is liable no matter how the condition was brought about or who brought it about.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">Indeed, if the condition exists, whether it was brought into existence by the ship\u2019s crew, a third party, or even an injured\u2019s fellow employee, the shipowner would still be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">Now, let us take a seaworthy vessel with appliances that are reasonably fit for their intended use or purpose on which normal operations are in process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">And during the course of such operations the previously fit ship or appliance is rendered unsafe because of the negligent act of some person.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">In such an instance, if the negligent act itself is in process and has not yet ripened into an unseaworthy condition, the act, during its commission, is referred to as operational negligence \u2014 and in that limited circumstance the shipowner would not be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-20\">In other words, if the defect arose as a momentary step or a phase in the progress of work aboard an otherwise seaworthy ship, and was an incident in the continuous course of operation, \u2014 and an unseaworthy condition had not yet resulted, the shipowner is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-21\">On the other hand, if the momentary phase had ended and the act had ripened into a condition of unseaworthiness at the time the accident occurred, then the shipowner is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">Thus, there is a point at which negligent conduct ends and an unseaworthy condition begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">If the act results in the condition of unseaworthiness at the time of the accident, then the owner is liable; if the act falls short of creating the condition at the time of the accident, it is not. Actually, the controversy here centers about the parties\u2019 respective contentions as to whether the accident was due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>unseaworthiness or caused by operational negligence, or as the lawyers referred to it in their summations, an instantaneous act.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Petition for Rehearing is Denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. It is \u201cfully settled that a shipowner\u2019s liability for an unseaworthy vessel extends beyond the members of the crew and includes a longshoreman like the [appellant].\u201d Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 497-498, 91 S.Ct. 514, 516, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 566, citing Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Moreover, \u201cthe scope of unseaworthiness is by no means . . . limited [to the defective condition of a physical part of the ship itself]. A vessel\u2019s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service.\u201d Usner v.

Although this charge was given before the Supreme Court decided <em>Usner, </em>we believe that the charge puts before the jury, a lucid and comprehensible exposition of operational negligence. Of course, we cannot now foresee all objections to this charge arising in the thousands of specific factual settings to be litigated in the future. Nor have we any jurisdiction to decide those cases by promulgating a uniform charge on operational negligence, binding in advance. The charge is only a guideline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. The Court\u2019s charge read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZW\">\u201cCertain Federal Regulations promulgated by the Bureau of Labor Standards of the United States Department of Labor were introduced into evidence in this case. I have found as a matter of law that the Regulation requiring hard hats does not apply and was not violated in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">If you find that the Regulation requiring the use of tag lines was violated, this constituted negligence as a matter of law and the vessel was rendered unseaworthy as a matter of law, and if such unseaworthiness or negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, defendant shipowner would be liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">It was not repeated when the jury was recalled for further instructions on unseaworthiness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b346-15\">. After the initial reading of the charge, Kyzar\u2019s lawyer stated, \u201cI do take exception to there not being a charge that although there may be no labor standards governing a particular condition of seaworthiness you may still find unseawortliiness to be the cause of the accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\">. The district court gave the following instruction on \u201cspotting the boom\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-14\">\u201cThe plaintiff contends that improper spotting of the boom caused the ship to be unseaworthy and caused him to be provided with an unsafe place to work.\u201d \u201cImproper or negligent use of seaworthy equipment by plaintiff\u2019s fellow longshoremen may create a condition of unseaworthiness. A shore crane used by a stevedore in the unloading of a ship is considered as part of the ship\u2019s gear for purposes of the issue of seaworthiness. Improper methods of handling cargo may create a condition of unseaworthiness even though the equipment used is in reasonably safe condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">The two paragraphs were not consecutive in the original charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
