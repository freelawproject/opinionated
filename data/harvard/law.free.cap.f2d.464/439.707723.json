App. \u00a7 462(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">Droge was classified I-A on January 13, 1970. On April 27, 1970, he filed a completed Form SSS 150 requesting classification as a conscientious objector (I-O). On August 24, 1970, the local board reopened his classification, but denied the 1-0 classification on the ground that he was not sincere, and classified him I-A. Droge requested a personal appearance. He appeared on October 23, 1970. The board again denied his claim, this time on the ground that the claim was based upon \u201cessentially political and philosophical opposition to the Viet Nam War\u201d rather than \u201cConscientious objection to war in any form.\u201d The \u201cExecutive Secretary\u201d of the Board prepared, signed, and placed in Droge\u2019s file a one and one-half page summary of what was said and done at this appearance. Assuming that it is accurate, it supports the board\u2019s determination. Droge, however, never knew of the existence of this summary. He appealed, and on January 7, 1971, the appeal board, without stating the reasons for its decision, upheld the local board\u2019s denial of Droge\u2019s claim and classified him I-A. He was ordered to report for induction, reported, but refused induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">Droge, on his SSS 150 form, signed the printed statement that, by reason of his religious training and belief, he was conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form and to participation in noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces. In support of this statement, he described his Catholic background. He said that, although as a young adult he \u201cfell away from any formal association with the church, some of the ideas and beliefs of the church . stayed with [him].\u201d His conscientious objection to participation in war developed after his registration with the Selective Service system, but when it did develop, he concluded that he could not participate in war because of his belief that there was \u201csomething in [him] and in all men higher than natural drives, higher, even, than reason,\u201d and that no obligation was more important than his allegiance to this \u201csoul.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>He also stated that \u201cI can not participate in war because i [sic] believe that there is something in me and in all men higher than natural drives. . . . \u201d His statement clearly establishes the link between his opposition to participation in war and his religious beliefs. United States v. Seeger, 1968, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733; Welsh v. United States, 1970, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">There is nothing in his form SSS 150 that casts doubt on his sincerity, and we note that in its final action the local board did not find him insincere.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The appeal board gave no reason for its decision. But it did have before it the Executive Secretary\u2019s statement of what happened at Droge\u2019s personal appearance. That statement does support the local board\u2019s finding that Droge was opposed to the Vietnam war rather than to all wars. Perhaps the appeal board\u2019s decision rests on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The difficulty is that under the Selective Service Regulations the Executive Secretary\u2019s statement should not have been in Droge\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.13(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">\u201cIf any information considered by the local board does not appear in the written information in the file, <em>other than information presented orally by the registrant or in his behalf at a personal appearance under the provisions of </em>\u00a7 <em>1624.2 of this chapter, </em>the local board shall prepare and place in the file a written summary of such information.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">Section 1624.2(b), 32 C.F.R. states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">\u201cAt any [personal appearance], the registrant . . . may present such further information as he believes will assist the local board in determining his proper classification. Such information shall be in writing, or, if oral, shall be summarized in writing <em>by the registrant </em>and placed in the registrant\u2019s file.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-19\">These provisions require that any summary of a registrant\u2019s personal appearance before the local board that is placed in the registrant\u2019s file must be the registrant\u2019s summary, not that of the local board. United States v. Fisher, 7 Cir., 1971, 442 F.2d 109, 115-117; <em>see generally </em>Simmons v. United States, 1955, 348 U.S. 397, 75 S.Ct. 397, 99 L.Ed. 453; Gonzales v. United States, 1955, 348 U.S. 407, 75 S.Ct. 409, 99 L.Ed. 467; United States v. Nugent, 1953, 346 U.S. 1, 73 S.Ct. 991, 97 L.Ed. 1417.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">Here it is undisputed that the summary was prepared by the Executive Secretary of the local board, and was never seen, much less approved or adopted, by Droge. There is no doubt th\u00e1t the summary is highly prejudicial to his case. It strongly intimates that he is opposed only to the Vietnam war rather than to \u201cwar in any form.\u201d Such a belief would not entitle him to a 1-0 classification. Gillette v. United States, 1970, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168. It was on this basis that the local board denied Droge\u2019s claim following his personal appearance. The appeal board may have reached a similar conclusion on the strength of the local board\u2019s summary which should not have been in appellant\u2019s appeal file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A decision based upon this information violates the Supreme Court\u2019s requirements of \u201cprocedural regularity\u201d and \u201cfair play,\u201d and vitiates Droge\u2019s right to an effective appeal. Gonzales v. United States, supra, 348 U.S. at 412-414, 75 S.Ct. 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-21\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-14\">. We do not hold that, having complied with the regulation and placed a registrant\u2019s summary in his file, a local board would be powerless to protect itself against fraud or inaccuracy or omissions in the summary. That question is not presented here. We see no reason why, in such a case, the board could not insert a statement pointing out inaccuracies or omissions. But even in such a case, the cited authorities would require that the registrant be given a copy and a chance to respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
