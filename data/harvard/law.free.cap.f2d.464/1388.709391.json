McGarva, 5 Cir. 1972, 453 F.2d 918, we affirmed McGarva\u2019s conviction for willfully failing and refusing to submit to induction into the armed forces of the United States, in violation of Section 462, Title 50, Appendix, United States Code. On May 30, 1972, the Supreme Court vacated our judgment in this case, and remanded it to us \u201cfor reconsideration in light of the position presently asserted by the Government\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>McGarva v. United States, 1972, 406 U.S. 341, 92 S.Ct. 2067, 32 L.Ed.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">We have obtained a copy of the Solicitor General's brief before the Supreme Court. The government confessed error in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-5\">\u201cPetitioner asserts that he was never provided a copy of the government appeal agent\u2019s report that was placed in his file after the local board\u2019s classification decision. That report, he contends (Pet. 16), \u2018may have improperly and adversely affected the decision of the State Appeal Board in violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.\u2019 [footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-6\">\u201cThe report in question does, we think, comment unfavorably on petitioner\u2019s claim. The government appeal agent stated (Pet.App. E-9) that he \u2018was not convinced that registrant was sure about his own feelings, the war generally, or his purpose in life. It was clear registrant does not want to be drafted.\u2019 This Court and others have generally recognized that when new information is added by others to a Selective Service file subsequent to the local board\u2019s classification, procedural due process, requires that the registrant be furnished a copy of the supplemental statement and be accorded the opportunity to respond in writing. [citations omitted] That procedure was not followed in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-7\">And, while it might be argued that the government appeal agent\u2019s statement merely sets forth what was already apparent on the face of petitioner\u2019s claim, we recognize that the unique function that the government appeal agent serves' \u2014 i. e., \u2018[t]o be equally diligent in protecting the interests of the Government and the rights of the registrant in all matters\u2019 (32 C.F.R. 1604.71(d) (5)) \u2014 makes it likely that the State Appeal Board attached more weight to his observations than it would have attached to a similar comment made by someone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-10\">\u201cIn these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the failure to inform petitioner of the existence of the government appeal agent\u2019s adverse report \u2018so that he could be afforded an opportunity to rebut\u2019 (Pet. 15) was a fatal error in the processing of petitioner\u2019s claim, [footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-11\">\u201cIt is therefore respectfully submitted that the petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted, the judgment of the court of appeals vacated and the conviction reversed.\u201d Memorandum for the United States, pp. 6-8, filed in the Supreme Court April 27, 1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-12\">This position now asserted by the government presents issues not raised before us on the prior appeal by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">In consideration of the foregoing, it is ordered:</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-14\">1. Our prior opinion, 453 F.2d 918, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">2. This cause is remanded to the district court with directions to set aside McGarva\u2019s conviction and dismiss the indictment, on the grounds that Mc-Garva was not furnished a copy of the government appeal agent\u2019s report and was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the adverse material contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-16\">Prior opinion vacated, and cause remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
