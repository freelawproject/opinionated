Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956); United States ex rel. Grays v. Rundle, 428 F.2d 1401 (3d Cir. 1970), and eases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">However, the transcript of the July 25, 1966, proceeding discloses that the district court did not comply with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the time it accepted the guilty plea on the basis of which the sentence was entered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At least this portion of the mandate of that rule, which was summarized, in part, as follows in Woodward v. United States, 426 F.2d 959, 962 (3d Cir. 1970), was not explained to petitioner;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>\u201cFirst, the court must satisfy itself that the defendant understands the nature of the charge. Routine questioning or a single response by the defendant that he understands the charge is insufficient. To satisfy itself that the defendant actually does comprehend the charges, the court must explain the meaning of the charge and what basic acts must be proved to establish guilt.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261-262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); Compare: Kress v. United States, 411 F.2d 16 (8th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Under these circumstances, the district court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether Christinzio\u2019s plea of guilty was in fact entered voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charges,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> since the \u201cfiles and records of the case\u201d do not \u201cconclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; George v. United States, 421 F.2d 128 (2d Cir. 1970). Although the transcripts of the July 25, 1966, proceeding and of the sentencing proceeding make clear that petitioner was not a stranger to the federal criminal courts, the record before the district court did not permit a finding or conclusion that the Government had sustained the burden imposed on it by the failure of the sentencing judge to comply with the above-mentioned Rule 11 requirements. See <em>Halliday, supra </em>note 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">The June 22, 1971, order will be vacated insofar as it denied the application of petitioner and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-21\">. The petition also contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak8\">\u201c . . . (1) the indictment in criminal 239-66 was obtained by deliberate misleading of the Grand Jury; (2) they did not understand these charges; (3) the District Judge did not understand these charges or the sentences allowed by law; (4) the officers of the Court did not understand these charges or the sentences allowed by law; (5) the indictment was patently ambiguous; (6) there was not, and could not be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>a factual basis for conviction and sentences at the federal forum; (7) they were denied <em>due process, </em>effective assistance of counsel and fundamental fairness in federal criminal proceedings in violation of the Federal Constitution, Amendments V and VI.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-5\">. Count I charged that Christinzio entered on May 15, 1966, an insured bank \u201cwith intent to commit larceny\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and Count II charged such entry in such bank \u201cwith intent to commit a felony affecting such bank; that is, the taking and carrying away, with intent to steal or purloin property, money, or things of value in excess of $100, belonging to or in the care, custody, control, management or possession of said bank,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). See United States v. Christinzio, et al., Criminal 239-66, D.N.J. Even if one of these two counts was defective for duplicity, since Christinzio pleaded guilty to both counts on the advice of counsel and received only a general sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment where he could have received a 20-year sentence on either count alone, such a defect would not entitle him. to relief. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Fair-child, 435 F.2d 972, 975 (10th Cir. 1971) ; Barnes v. United States, 197 F.2d 271 (8th Cir. 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-7\">\u201cA defendant may plead guilty. . . . The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such idea . . . without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. . . . The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b980-14\">. We note that although the petitioner\u2019s district court brief alleged that the sentencing judge did not comply with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this contention was only presented to the district court to the extent of the allegations in such brief (pages 8-9), stating that there was not \u201ca factual basis for the plea\u201d and it was not \u201cvoluntarily and understandingly made.\u201d Furthermore, the district court has rejected this claim of noncompliance with Rule 11 when made by the co-defendant Flynn, who entered guilty pleas to the same two counts at the same proceeding at which petitioner was present and entered his pleas. See Flynn v. United States, Civil No. 172-67, D.N.J., Opinion of November 30, 1967, aff\u2019d. 404 F.2d 935, (3d Cir. 1968). Also we note that the \u201cfiles and records of the case\u201d (see third paragraph of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255) show that the district court judge made these statements at the time of sentencing, without any denial by either co-defendant :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZWy\">\u201cYou have been involved in crimes of violence. You have been involved in crimes that all circumstances indicate carry guns, and you don\u2019t carry guns to start some fellow on a 100 yard dash, not when you are entering banks at 4:00 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b980-16\">. Although the district court personally addressed the co-defendant Flynn concerning the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea (pp. 1-3 of transcript of change of plea proceedings of July 25, 1966, in Criminal No. 239-66, D.N.J.), the only statements arguably made by the district court personally to petitioner to determine that Christinzio understood the nature of the charges were as follows (p. 5 of above transcript) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Now, Mr. Christinzio, your age, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahd\">\u201cDEPENDANT CHRISTINZIO: 28, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APC\">\u201cTHE COURT: You understand the nature of these charges, and it is your intention to plead guilty to the first two counts \u2014 is that correct, Mr. Caggiano?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1u-\">\u201cMR. CAGGIANO [Attorney for Christinzio] : Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG5a\">sj\u00ab s{s * \u2666 s{s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkBA\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand, Mr. Christinzio, by the entry of a plea of guilty to the first two counts that you immediately waive any trial either by a jury or by the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-25\">\u201cDEPENDANT CHRISTINZIO: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b981-26\">. In Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 832, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969), the Supreme Court affirmed a judgment that a federal criminal defendant \u201cwas not entitled to relief because \u2018ample evidence\u2019 supported the District Court\u2019s finding that the Government had met its burden of demonstrating that petitioner entered his plea voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charges against him.\u201d This <em>Halliday </em>rule applies to pleas entered prior to April 2, 1969.
