He. was also charged as an aider and abettor in both counts. 18-U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\"> Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the evidence was entirely sufficient to warrant the conviction on each count. He also urges error in the admission of certain testimony, otherwise relevant, as to the modus operandi and earlier events transpiring in the surveillance of the dock area where appellant was seen taking delivery of the marij'uana from persons aboard a Dutch motor vessel recently arrived at the Tampa docks from Turbo, Colombia. Assuming objection to this evidence, its admission does not rise to the level of prejudicial error. It was relevant to show the accuracy of the surveillance and the familiarity of the customs agents with the odor of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-20\">Even assuming error in the admission of this evidence, its reflection on the guilt of appellant was remote if at all. The other evidence of guilt was overwhelming and thus such error, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf. Milton v. Wainwright, 1971, 407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
