We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-20\">The Company, a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal office in Chicago, Illinois, was authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to operate as a for-hire common carrier, of motor vehicles, which drives the shipper\u2019s (owner\u2019s) motor vehicle together with the owner\u2019s baggage, sporting equipment and personal effects from one place to another.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its original tariff the Company limited its liability to a maximum of $1,000 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or the deductible portion of the vehicle owner\u2019s collision insurance (if covered) and disclaimed any liability for loss of damage to \u201cbaggage, sporting equipment and personal effects\u201d of owners of the motor vehicles transported by it. Before this suit was filed the Company had been told by Commission employees that its tariff violated \u00a7 20(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-21\">After this suit was filed, on October 30, 1969, the Company filed a new tariff including a Released Rate Order approved by the Commission in which the Company terminated the practice of denying liability for loss of damage to baggage, sporting equipment and per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>sonal effects of the owner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition to terminating the practice of disclaiming liability for the personal contents in the owner\u2019s car, the Company, in reissuing its Shipping Order and Freight Bill on January 1, 1970, removed the provision limiting its liability for damages to the car to either $1,000 for cars without collision insurance or the deductible portion of the owner\u2019s collision insurance. In its place the Company now claims the benefit of the owner\u2019s insurance on the motor vehicle in case of damage or loss as long as that provision does not void the insurance policy and as long as the Company reimburses the owner for the premium.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">The Company having conceded the unlawfulness of the original tariff, the only question raised in this appeal is whether the modified tariff with the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d. provision limits the Company\u2019s liability in violation of \u00a7 20(11) and is an \u201cundue preference\u201d in violation of \u00a7 316(d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">The government contends that the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d tariff provision violates \u00a7 20(11) because the Company concedes the earlier $1,000 limitation is unlawful and because the result for the Company under the pertinent clause is identical to the earlier result and consequently is also unlawful. It argues that the total effect is an attempt to do indirectly what the Company could not lawfully do directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">The Company, to sustain the provision, argues: that there is no limitation or avoidance of liability since the provision applies only after the Company assumes liability; that its customers are not required to obtain insurance for the Company\u2019s benefit; and that the Company reimburses the customer for the premium if the Company actually benefits from the insurance policy. It relies upon Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Erie &amp; W. Transportation Co., 117 U.S. 312, 6 S.Ct. 750, 29 L.Ed. 873 (1886), and Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Payne, 199 Iowa 1008, 203 N.W. 4 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-15\">We do not agree with the government that the situations under the earlier and the instant provisions are identical. In the earlier provision there was an express <em>limitation of liability </em>in the case of an insured customer to the deductible amount in the policy, and in the case of the uninsured customer to $1,000. The result was to enable the Company to \u201cexempt\u201d <em>itself from liability </em>for \u201cthe full actual loss, damage or injury caused by it\u201d in direct violation of \u00a7 20(11). The \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause, however, presupposes the Company\u2019s liability for the \u201cfull\u201d loss in conformity with \u00a7 20(11), and does not \u201cexempt\u201d it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>that liability. The clause permits the Company to recover from the customer the proceeds of the insurance paid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">We see no violation of \u00a7 20(11) in the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause. There is no express prohibition in \u00a7 20(11) which precludes the clause. The Supreme Court, before adoption in 1887 of the Interstate Commerce Act, decided that \u201cAs the carrier might lawfully himself obtain insurance against the loss of the goods ... he may lawfully stipulate with the owner to be allowed the benefit of insurance voluntarily obtained by the latter.\u201d Phoenix Ins. Co., 117 U.S. at 325, 6 S.Ct. at 756. Presumably the Company\u2019s \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause will be known to the car owner and under the tariff provisions the clause must not contravene terms of any owner\u2019s insurance policy. Practically, the clause does not have significance, since most owners who would engage the Company\u2019s services would have insurance. And the insurer is, or can be, protected by a policy endorsement which would effectually conflict with the clause. We conclude that the clause does not \u201cexempt . . . [the Company] . from the liability imposed\u201d so as to violate \u00a7 20(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">There is no requirement in the clause that all shippers carry insurance protecting the Company. The part of the premium \u2014 paid by the owner for his liability insurance \u2014 attributed to the custody of the car by the Company is minimal. In the event of a loss, that part is reimbursed by the Company to the owner, and the Company is burdened with \u2022the total loss. Accordingly, there is no limitation of liability in violation of \u00a7 20(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">We conclude that the district court erred in deciding that the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause in suit violated \u00a7 20(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">We think also that the district court erred in deciding that the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause is an unlawful preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-13\">Undue preferences or prejudices prohibited</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-14\">(d) All charges made for any service rendered or to be rendered by any common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in interstate or foreign commerce in the transportation of passengers or property as aforesaid or in connection therewith shall be just and reasonable, and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service or any part thereof, is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. It shall be unlawful for any common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in interstate or foreign commerce to make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, port, gateway, locality, region, district, territory, or description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever; or to subject any particular person, port, gateway, locality, region, district, territory, or description of traffic to any unjust discrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever: <em>Provided, however, </em>That this subsection shall not be construed to apply to discriminations, prejudice, or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier of whatever description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-15\">The government contends that the clause operates to give an unlawful preference to non-insured owners, since the Company\u2019s insured owners pay the cost of transportation <em>and </em>the premium for insurance if their car is not involved in an accident, while the non-insured pay only the transportation cost.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>We think the government\u2019s reliance on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in China Fire Ins. Co. v. Davis, 50 F.2d 389, 392-393 (2nd Cir. 1931), cert. den. sub nom. Mellon v. China Fire Ins. Co., 284 U.S. 658, 52 S.Ct. 36, 76 L.Ed. 558 (1931), is misplaced. That decision, which found a violation of \u00a7 2 of the Act there, is not authority for a holding that \u00a7 316(d) of the Act is violated here. There the basic question was whether the plaintiff insurer had shown that the fraud of the shipper was attributed to the carrier where the shipper who had been paid total damages by the carrier for goods damaged in transit withheld that information while collecting the benefits of an insurance policy directly paid for by the shipper. The court found the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause in the carrier\u2019s bill of lading invalid in that it allowed the shipper to obtain insurance on the goods in transit for which the carrier was primarily liable; and the carrier had no tariff obligation to reimburse the shipper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under these facts the <em>Chino, Fire </em>court could reasonably hold that the insurance added cost to the shipper for the transportation of the goods so as to result in the carrier charging or receiving \u201cgreater compensation\u201d from insured shippers than it charged or received from uninsured shippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">In National Garment Co. v. New York C. &amp; St. L. R. Co., 173 F.2d 32, 37-38 (8th Cir. 1949), another case relied on by the government, the Eighth Circuit held that the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause there violated \u00a7 2 of the Act. The court followed <em>China Fire </em>in construing \u00a7 2 of the Act in a case somewhat similar, on the facts, to <em>China Fire. </em>The Eighth Circuit decided that the lack of the reimbursement provision in the carrier\u2019s tariff in <em>China Fire </em>was of no aid to the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause in <em>National Garment </em>and did not change the <em>China Fire </em>rule. The court thought the insurance was of value to the carrier during the period of transportation and that in the usual event of transportation without loss the carrier had received the \u201ccompensation\u201d forbidden by \u00a7 2 at the expense of the shipper. The court further stated: \u201cIn the event of loss the carrier, if it so elects, returns to the shipper the cost of the compensation [the premium] which it was forbidden by the Act to receive in the first place, avoids its liability as a carrier, and deprives the insurer of its rights under a valid contract.\u201d <em>National Garment, </em>173 F.2d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">Neither <em>China Fire </em>nor <em>National Garment </em>is applicable to the case before us. Here we are not dealing with a specific agreement to transport an owner\u2019s motor vehicle, nor a specific insurance policy. Section 2 prohibits \u201cgreater compensation\u201d to the carrier while \u00a7 316(d) prohibits \u201cunjust and unreasonable charges\u201d and \u201cundue and unreasonable preferences.\u201d We understand from this record that, unlike <em>National Garment </em>and <em>China Fire, </em>the owner here purchases insurance primarily to cover <em>his </em>use of the motor vehicle and not the <em>shipping </em>of the vehicle. The issue actually is whether the premium paid by an insured owner \u2014 whose vehicle is not damaged \u2014 for the time the motor vehicle is in the custody of the carrier amounts to an unreasonable preference or an unreasonable charge as opposed to the uninsured owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">The government contends that the Company receives the benefit of insurance coverage although the shipped motor vehicle is not damaged, and that the owner\u2019s payment of the premium amounts to an additional charge on him above the actual charge of transporting the car which all owners pay whether or not they have insurance. This they argue is an unreasonable charge and suggest that the problem could be cured if the Commission approved lesser rates for insured owners than for uninsured owners. As pointed out earlier in fn. 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>this type of rate setting might present additional problems. There has been no showing in this record that the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause in the Company\u2019s bill of lading provides for an \u201cunjust and unreasonable charge\u201d or \u201cundue and unreasonable preference\u201d in which owners with insurance are charged more than owners without insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">There is no preference granted uninsured motorists in the wording of the clause. No insurance is required of any owners, even if we assume that uninsured motorists are substantial users of the Company\u2019s services. The clause presupposes, unlike the shipper\u2019s insurance in <em>China, Fire, </em>the customary owner\u2019s liability insurance, which the owners would carry even if the Company\u2019s services were not used. We hold that this record does not support the district court\u2019s finding that the \u201cbenefit of insurance\u201d clause in the Company\u2019s tariff violates \u00a7 316(d), since there has been no showing that that part of the insurance premium attributable to the Company\u2019s custody of the owner\u2019s car amounts to an unreasonable preference or charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1435-13\">.
