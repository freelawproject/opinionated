There were three passengers in the defendant\u2019s car. Special Agents William R. Stringer and William H. Garvie of the FBI were trailing Young\u2019s car in a government car with the intention of arresting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-21\">Agent Stringer, driving the Government\u2019s car, pulled alongside Young\u2019s car. Agent Garvie, who was seated on the passenger side of the front seat, made an effort to display his badge and credentials to Young while both Young\u2019s car and the Government car continued in motion, at speeds estimated from 15 to 30 miles per hour. Then the Government car abruptly pulled in front of Young\u2019s car; there was conflicting testimony as to whether Young\u2019s car had been brought to a stop before Agent Stringer cut in front to prevent further forward motion. The Government car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>was positioned diagonally in front of Young\u2019s car with the transmission in the \u201cpark\u201d position and the right side of the car at an angle to the front of Young\u2019s car. As Agent Garvie stepped out of the Government car and started toward Young, Young suddenly drove his car forward and ran into the right rear door of the Government car, striking the right front door and damaging both doors of the Government car. Agent Garvie was forced to jump back into the car to keep from being run over.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The Government took the position that Young was deliberately trying to run over Agent Garvie, and that he had damaged Government property in the course of committing the assault on Garvie. Young admitted that his car struck the Government car, but denied that the Government ear or his own car had come to a complete stop. He alleged that he had no intention of running over Agent Garvie or of striking the Government car. Young\u2019s version of the facts was that he did not realize that the men who attempted to impede his progress on Monument Street were law enforcement officers trying to arrest him. He urged that the collision with the Government car occurred when he attempted to swivel his car sharply and continue on his way \u2014 \u201csimply a non-violent attempt to prevent two strange white men from stopping his path of travel.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, in pertinent part, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">It is completely unimportant whether this defendant did or did not know that these men were <em>FBI </em>agents on such occasion. He didn\u2019t have to know that. Whether he knew it or not if he did what the government contends that he did whether he knew that they were agents at the time or not would make no difference as to whether he is guilty or innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\"><em>\u00bb &amp; \u00bb </em>* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">An intentional or unlawful threat or attempt to commit injury upon the person of another when coupled with an apparent present ability so to do and an intentional display of force such as to place the victim in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm constitutes an assault. An assault may be committed without actually touching, striking or committing bodily harm to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">Unlawfully as used in this instruction means either contrary to law or without legal justification; thus a person who in fact has the present ability to inflict bodily harm upon another, wilfully threatens or attempts to inflict bodily harm upon such person may be found guilty of forcefully assaulting such person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">The essential elements required to be proved in order to establish the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>fense charged in the indictment are first the act or acts of forcefully assaulting an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation while the agent was engaged in the performance of his official duties as charged, and second, such act or acts wilfully which means with bad purpose to disregard the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u2022X* -X* -X- -X- *X* -X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">Knowledge of the identity or official character of the person assaulted is not an essential element of the offense. If the defendant assaults a federal officer in order to be guilty it will not be necessary that the defendant should know that they were federal officers to be guilty of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">You are instructed that if you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, James Earl Young, did forcefully assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with an FBI agent who was engaged in the performance of his official duties then it is your sworn duty to find the defendant guilty as charged in count one of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> Our prior decisions hold that knowledge of the official capacity of the person assaulted is unnecessary for conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. Burke v. United States, 1968, 400 F.2d 866; Pipes v. United States, 1968, 399 F.2d 471; Bennett v. United States, 1960, 285 F.2d 567. But none of those cases holds that a defendant may be held absolutely liable for \u201cassaulting\u201d a government officer when the defendant acts from the mistaken belief that he himself is threatened with an intentional tort by a private citizen. \u201c[A] case based upon Section 111, as construed by this court, is not submitted to the jury without a charge that the \u2018assault\u2019 must be an intentional act wilfully done without legal excuse.\u201d <em>Burke, supra, </em>400 F.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\"> When there is no doubt of the defendant\u2019s unlawful intention, knowledge of the official capacity of the victim is invariably unnecessary; the assailant takes his victim as he finds him. But if the defendant asserts a lack of intention or wilfulness based upon ignorance of the identity of the victim and ignorance of the victim\u2019s official privilege to interfere with the defendant\u2019s person or freedom of movement, the jury must be allowed to consider the defendant\u2019s evidence tending to show that he was ignorant of the official capacity of the victim. For only then can the jury give fair consideration to whether the \u201cassault\u201d was \u201can intentional act wilfully done without legal excuse.\u201d <em>Burke, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">The portion of the instruction quoted first was broad enough to permit the jury to find Young guilty of the offenses charged even if the jury believed Young\u2019s testimony that he thought he was being harassed by local rowdies. Instead, the jury should have been clearly instructed that it could not find Young guilty of the offenses charged unless the jury believed that Young intended to threaten or attempted to injure Agent Garvie; and that Young could not intend to threaten or to attempt to injure Agent Garvie if Young acted out of a reasonable belief that Agents Garvie and Stringer were strangers who intended to inflict harm upon Young. Such an instruction would permit the jury to pass upon Young\u2019s contention that he had no unlawful intention to commit the offenses charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>because he acted to protect himself and his fellow passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The Government, in its supplemental brief, points out that the trial court instructed the jury to convict the defendant only upon finding an \u201cunlawful\u201d attempt to inflict injury, defined as attempt \u201ceither contrary to law or without legal justification.\u201d This portion of the charge, the Government urges, removes the sting from the portion of the charge which stated \u201cit is completely unimportant whether this defendant did or did not know that these men were FBI agents . . . \u201d We disagree. At best, the charge was confusing and contradictory, even when read in light of the words now stressed by the Government. At best,, one portion of the charge correctly stated the applicable law in general terms, but another portion eliminated the key specific ground on which Young denied the wilfulness of his conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We conclude that the charge, considered as a whole, failed \u201cto define with substantial particularity the factual issues,\u201d and failed \u201cclearly to instruct the jurors as to the principles of law ... to apply in deciding the factual issues involved in the case before them.\u201d United States v. Hill, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 279, 281. The failure to instruct properly on the issue of intention effectively deprived Young of his right \u201cto have presented instructions relating to a theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence.\u201d Perez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 297 F.2d 12, 14-15. As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">We do not intend to characterize the case for the defense as either strong or weak. That is unnecessary, for \u201cin criminal cases the defendant is entitled to have presented instructions relating to a theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, even though the evidence may be weak, insufficient, inconsistent, or of doubtful credibility. He is entitled to have such instructions even though the sole testimony in support of the defense is- his own.\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Tatum v. United States, 1950, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 190 F.2d 612, 617, quoted with approval in Strauss v.

Young testified at the trial ns follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">. . . I was going down the street and all a sudden was a car blowed its horn and I looked over and they whipped in, they whipped in front of me and before the man got out, I didn\u2019t know who it was because unmarked ear I don\u2019t know who it was, the only thing I know the car was whipping in front of me, and this guy was gitting, before the car stopped and before mine stopped he had jumped out of the car with his door wide opon. I tried to get out of the way and that\u2019s when my bumper catehed his door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">Q. Now is it your testimony that you did not know who it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">A. I don\u2019t know who he was and after lie got out that's when he come up and went in his pocket and come up with this badge and he did not have no badge on the outside of his thing because lie went in his coat pocket and opened it up, come right up to the oar and opened it up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">On cross-examination, Young added :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-17\">I am telling you the truth of it, I didn\u2019t try to run over no FBI, I didn\u2019t know who no FBI was, he was in a plain ear and it was a car, nil I know was a car whipped in front of me and he was gitting out his car when 1ns car whipped in front of me, I tried to avoid it, that\u2019s when I turned trying to git out the way.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\">. Judge Godbold accurately predicted the confusion underlying the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury in the present case. In his concurring opinion in Pipes v. United States, <em>supra, </em>Judge Godbold observed, \u201cAn unlimited rule of no knowledge would have to be restricted sooner or later in circumstances involving rights of citizens who are involved with persons they neither know nor have reason to know are federal officers.\u201d 399 F.2d at 478.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">. The flaws in the court\u2019s charge infect not only the conviction under Section 111 but also the conviction of Young for damaging government property. 18 Tl.S.O. \u00a7 1361, <em>supra </em>note 2. Section 1361 applies only to a person who \u201cwilfully injures or commits any depredation against any property of the United States. . . . \u201d At the very least, the statutory prescription of wilfulness requires that the accused have intended to damage or destroy the property in question, whether or not the accused knew the property was United States property when he acted against it. We assume, without deciding, that only this minimum level of wilfulness is required by Section 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">Still, by analogy to assault, an intentional act of damage or destruction may be justified- \u2014 for instance, by necessity or in self-defense. Such justification for the act of destruction would negate the criminal <em>mens rea </em>required by Section 1361. In tlie present case, the court\u2019s instruction deprived Young of the defense that he rammed the FBI car only because lie believed himself the target of an unlawful assault, from which Young was trying to make his escape.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
