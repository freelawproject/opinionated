I dissent to granting the rule on the clerk in this case.</p> <p id=\"b95-12\" pgmap=\"95\">There was no good cause shown for the record being tendered to our clerk three months late.</p> <p id=\"b95-13\" pgmap=\"95(34) 96(39)\">The young attorney for Willie Richmond stated that this was his first appeal and that he did not know he had only ninety days to lodge the record; he thought that he had seven months. It is my opinion this was not for good cause. We should not presume incompetence of counsel without a hearing of some sort and I would deny the motion and let the matter take its natural course.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
