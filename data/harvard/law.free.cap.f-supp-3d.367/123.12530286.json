Because motions for summary judgment require a final determination of the parties' claims, a district court's review of a magistrate judge's determination of such a motion should be evaluated under the de novo standard applicable to dispositive matters under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), as opposed to the clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard applicable to a magistrate judge's ruling as to non-dispositive matters under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 72(a). A district judge may accept, set aside, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

The Court further concludes that the findings, reasoning, and legal support for the recommendations made in the Report are consistent with applicable law as set forth in the cases and statutes relied upon therein, and are thus warranted. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons set forth in Magistrate Judge Freeman's thorough and detailed Report, the Court adopts in their entirety the Report's factual and legal analyses and determinations, as well as its substantive recommendations, as the Court's ruling on Plaintiff's Motion (Dkt.

On the claims raised in its Complaint, Plaintiff is also seeking reimbursement for the costs it incurred, both to defend against the Underlying Asbestos Claims and to settle certain of them, after Defendants allegedly breached their obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Currently before this Court, pursuant to a reference to report and recommend on dispositive motions, are (1) a motion by Plaintiff seeking partial summary judgment in its favor on the issue of whether Defendants have a duty to provide Plaintiff with a complete defense on any pending Underlying Asbestos Claims and any similar claims that may be asserted in the future (Dkt. 114), and (2) five separate cross-motions by Defendants, seeking partial summary judgment in their favor on the issues of (a) whether the Claims give rise to a duty to defend at all (Dkt. 132); (b) whether, assuming a defense obligation, any defense costs should be allocated\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   with Plaintiff, based on the fact that Plaintiff was self-insured for a period of time relevant to the Claims (Dkt. 136); (c) whether any duty to defend and/or indemnify has been vitiated by Plaintiff's purported lack of cooperation in its defense by the Insurers, and/or by Plaintiff's voluntary payments to resolve some of the Claims (Dkt. 128); (d) whether the attorneys' fees charged to Plaintiff by the law firm that it retained to defend against the Claims (after Defendants' allegedly breached their duty to defend) are based on billing rates that are unreasonably high as a matter of law, such that, if Defendants are required to pay any past-incurred defense costs, Defendants should not have to reimburse Plaintiff at those rates (Dkt. 135); and (e) whether Defendants have any obligation to indemnify Plaintiff on the Underlying Asbestos Claims (Dkt. 130).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this Report and Recommendation, this Court will address: first, Plaintiff's motion on the duty to defend, together with Defendants' cross-motions on the duty to defend and the allocation of defense costs; second, Defendants' cross-motions on Plaintiff's alleged failure to abide by the cooperation and voluntary payment provisions of the relevant insurance policies, and on the reasonableness of defense costs; and, finally, Defendants' cross-motion on the duty to indemnify. For the reasons discussed below, I recommend that Plaintiff's motion, as well as Defendants' cross-motions on the duty to defend, the allocation of defenses costs, and the duty to indemnify, be granted in part and denied in part, and that Defendants' cross-motions regarding Plaintiff's duty of cooperation, voluntary payments, and the reasonableness of defense costs be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The relevant evidentiary record in this case has been presented by the parties through nine Declarations or Affidavits and exhibits thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, pursuant\n   to Local Civil Rule 56.1, the parties have filed no fewer than 17 dueling statements of facts that are supposedly undisputed, or that the parties claim are contested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has reviewed the submitted evidence and the parties' several Rule 56.1 Statements, and, in the following summary, has attempted to highlight those undisputed and disputed facts that are most pertinent to this Court's recommendation as to how the motion and cross-motions should be resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Insurance Policies Issued by Defendants\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This litigation involves insurance policies issued by both Travelers (the \"Travelers Policies\") and Liberty Mutual (the \"Liberty Mutual Policies\") (collectively, the \"Policies\"), as described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     The Travelers Policies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Travelers Policies consist of various primary general liability, umbrella and/or catastrophe, and excess insurance policies issued by Travelers to Plaintiff, as the named insured, over a 27-year period, from April 1, 1958 to April 1, 1985 (the \"Travelers Policy Period\").

(Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 18; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 18.) The asbestos litigation commenced in Maryland, but, over time, emerged in other jurisdictions, as well, including Michigan, California, Illinois, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.) With the exception of the Maryland litigation and \"a single case venued in New York,\" Defendants assert that the Underlying Asbestos Claims have \"universally\" involved cranes (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 21), which Plaintiff did not manufacture prior to its acquisition of LIT and Yale. Thus, with few exceptions, Defendants assert that any liability that Plaintiff could face on the Claims, based on the claimants' exposure to asbestos during the coverage periods of the Policies, could only arise from the claimants' exposure to products manufactured by LTI and Yale, which were not acquired by Plaintiff until after the Policies lapsed, and were not themselves insured under the Policies. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff disputes this version of the facts, and contends that the asbestos litigation concerns Plaintiff's products generally and, as such, could involve products within the scope of the Policies. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that, although LTI and Yale also made hoists, Plaintiff itself had a \"huge market share in hoists\" during the Policy Periods, and that the hoists it manufactured were almost always attached to cranes manufactured by others. (Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 21 (quoting Maloney Decl., Ex. 11 (Deposition of William Kiniry, Jr. (\"Kiniry Dep.\") ), at 65:15-17, 59:17-20).) Further, Plaintiff explains that hoists themselves were once manufactured with asbestos in their braking mechanisms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, Plaintiff contends that - whether the allegations of the Underlying Asbestos Claims state this explicitly or not - there is a high likelihood that, during the Policy Periods, any given claimant's exposure to asbestos in a crane could have been the result of exposure to asbestos in a hoist (manufactured by Plaintiff) that was itself\n   <em>\n    attached\n   </em>\n   to the crane (manufactured by an After-Acquired Entity).

(Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) On March 31, 1997, the parties entered into a written cost-sharing agreement regarding defense of the Mack Truck Claims (the \"Mack Truck Agreement\"). (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 29; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 29.) Pursuant to the Mack Truck Agreement, each party's share of the defense costs was calculated using a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   formula based on the periods covered by the Policies or Plaintiff's self-insurance. (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 30; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 30.) Defendants assert that, pursuant to the Mack Truck Agreement, the parties' shares of the defense costs for these claims were periodically adjusted, \"with Defendants' shares gradually decreasing and [Plaintiff's] share gradually increasing over time.\" (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 30.) The Mack Truck Agreement has not yet been terminated, and Plaintiff has not placed the Mack Truck Claims at issue in this case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint, dated June 29, 2015 (\"Compl.\") (Dkt. 1) at 12 n.1; Pl.

(Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 34; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 34.) Based on a \"handshake\" agreement between the parties in or about 2002, defense costs in the Michigan cases were also shared. (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 35; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Then, over time, the parties entered into informal agreements to share the costs of defending asbestos claims brought in other jurisdictions, as well. (Def.

Under these informal agreements, Defendants participated in the defense of Underlying Asbestos Claims, although it appears that Defendants did not make any indemnity payments in connection with settlements of claims.

On their cross-motions, Defendants characterize the parties' pre-2011 relationship as one of unity and cooperation, by which outside counsel \"regularly provided status update reports to the insurers for the cases they were handling\" (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 48 (citing Maloney Decl., Ex. 6 (Deposition of Harvey (\"Harvey Dep.\") ), at 184:18-24), Defendants paid only \"their proportionate share of defense costs\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55 (citing Maloney Decl., Ex. 22 (Deposition of Jenna Perkins), at 28:19-29:8, 29:20-30:5, 34:12-21; Maloney Decl., Ex. 21 (Deposition of Susan Gunty (\"Gunty Dep.\") ), at 42:8-10) ), and \"[l]ocal counsel collaborated both with the insurers and with each other\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58 (citing Harvey Dep., at 184:18-24; Gunty Dep., at 48:21-49:3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff, in response, paints Defendants' relationship with local counsel, during the pre-2011 time frame, as professional, courteous, and responsive, but not as collaborative. (Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 58 (citing Gunty Dep., at 48:17-20).) Although it has continued to honor the cost-sharing agreement made with respect to the Mack Truck Claims (and has been willing to carve those claims out from its Complaint in this action (Compl. \u00b6 74 n.1) ), Plaintiff nonetheless contends that Defendants are obligated, under the Policies, to pay 100 percent of the defense costs for the Underlying Asbestos Claims, and not just a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share (Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 55). Plaintiff also cites instances in which Defendants seemed to be working against Plaintiff, by, for example, forcing \"defense counsel (Don Miller) to reduce his rates, which forced [Plaintiff] to make up the difference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47 (citing Maloney Dec., Ex. 10 (Deposition of Miller (\"Miller Dep.\") ), at 88:16-89:22).) In further describing the purported conflict of interest between the parties, Plaintiff states that Harvey warned Plaintiff to \"[b]e careful of Candace Buehner [Defendants' representative],\" and to \"look very carefully at any proposal she [made],\" because, according to Harvey, Travelers \"had mentioned a while back that [they] wanted to decrease Travelers contribution to the [underlying asbestos] cases.\" (Pl.

(Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 59 n.9; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 59.) In January 2011, however, Alan Korman (\"Korman\") became Plaintiff's new general counsel (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 65; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 65), and, according to Defendants, Korman \"wasted no time\" in retaining the law firm of DLA Piper as NCC for the Underlying Asbestos Claims (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 66 (citing Maloney Decl., Ex. 27 (DLA Piper engagement letter) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While Plaintiff concedes that, prior to becoming Plaintiff's general counsel, Korman had a relationship with DLA Piper, it takes issue with Defendants' characterization of events, and states that Korman initially retained the firm \"for corporate litigation and intellectual property matters.\" (Pl.

According to Plaintiff, Korman only retained DLA Piper as NCC for the Underlying Asbestos Claims following a meeting with local counsel on those Claims two or three weeks into his tenure, at which time he assessed Plaintiff's potential liability and determined that he needed to bring in DLA Piper as NCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Korman Dep., at 33:10-20).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In any event, it is undisputed that Korman retained DLA Piper as NCC in February 2011. (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 73; Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 73.) It appears, however, that Korman may not have given Defendants any formal notice of this action, and certainly did not do so until after the action was taken. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75 (citing Korman Dep., at 33:21-34:7, 328:18-329:4, as support for Defendants' assertion that Plaintiff \"never directly advised Defendants of DLA's retention\"); Pl.

Korman also did not notify Defendants when he replaced some of Plaintiff's then-existing local counsel with DLA Piper attorneys. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.

Plaintiff contends that Korman did not inform Defendants of these changes because Defendants were not \"fully defending\" Plaintiff in the Underlying Asbestos Claims (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , paying 100 percent of Plaintiff's defense costs, instead of a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share), because he was dissatisfied with Defendants' representation of Plaintiff based on his discussions with local counsel, and because he believed that Defendants' litigation strategy was allowing asbestos liability to go \"unchecked\" in a way that would eventually \"bankrupt\" Plaintiff. (Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. 56.1 Response \u00b6 69 (citing Korman Dep., at 327:16-328:17);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Korman Dep., at 117:24-118:5.)

Plaintiff, though, contends that it actively wanted to meet with Defendants to discuss defense strategy, but that Defendants only wanted to talk about cementing a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   fee-sharing arrangement for the new crop of cases, and did not want to meet with DLA Piper.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) The Complaint alleges that Defendants wrongfully refused \"to defend and indemnify their insured, [Plaintiff], with respect to thousands of lawsuits commenced in various jurisdictions across America claiming personal injury, including in some cases wrongful death, arising out of alleged exposure to asbestos contained within the products of [Plaintiff] and its predecessor companies.\" (Compl. \u00b6 2.) In addition to seeking damages, costs, interest, and attorneys' fees, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Defendants are obligated to pay, on behalf of Plaintiff, all past, present, and future defense and indemnity costs associated with the Underlying Asbestos Claims, except for those costs associated with the Mack Truck Claims.

On the same day, Travelers filed a combined Answer, Cross-Claim, Counter-Claim, and Third-Party Complaint against Sentry Insurance Mutual Company (\"Sentry\") and CMIC. (Dkt. 20.) CMIC answered Travelers' Third-Party Complaint on October 13, 2015 (Dkt. 36), and Plaintiff answered the Third-Party Complaint on behalf of Sentry on February 16, 2016 (Dkt. 48).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   During the course of these proceedings, but separate from any court filings, the parties apparently exchanged correspondence that set forth their positions as to the scope of their responsibilities under the Policies.

(Letter to Alan Korman, from Craig P. Johnson (on behalf of Travelers) and Jamie Owen (on behalf of Liberty Mutual), dated June 12, 2017 (\"Def. 6/12/17 Ltr.\") (Dkt. 116-43).) In addition to reiterating the legal contentions that they make in this case, Defendants informed Plaintiff in the June 2017 letter that, subject to a number of conditions and reservation of rights, they would \"pay 100% of the reasonable and necessary defense [costs] on a going forward basis with respect to all active and pending [asbestos] cases outlined in Attachment A\" to the letter (with Attachment A, to this Court's understanding, consisting of a list of all then-pending Underlying Asbestos Claims on which Plaintiff was named as a defendant in its individual capacity).

In fact, with the exception of Plaintiff's initial moving papers (Dkts. 114, 115, 116, and 118), the Rule 56.1 Statements filed by Defendants in opposition to Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 127, 134), and the Notices of Defendants' cross-motions (Dkts. 128, 130, 132, 135, 136, 139, and 140),\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the above-listed papers - including 19 of the parties' 20 legal memoranda, and nearly all of the Declarations/Affidavits, exhibits, and Rule 56.1 Statements placed before the Court - have been filed by the parties under seal. The parties have made no attempt to redact\n   these many submissions, and have not sought leave of court to afford them blanket confidentiality protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To the extent this Court has relied on any materials filed by the parties under seal, this Court now considers those materials to be \"judicial documents,\" entitled to a presumption of public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lugosch v.

Certainly, to the extent this Court explicitly discusses any such materials, they should be considered integral to its analysis, and thus the presumption of public access to those materials should be accorded significant weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For this reason, and because, on balance, this Court finds that any \"competing considerations\" to public access (such as the privacy interests of innocent third parties,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Amodeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415715\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1044/#p1048\">\n    71 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1050-51 ) are either non-existent or weak, this Court is not placing any part of this Report and Recommendation under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Furthermore, although Judge Marrero previously issued a Protective Order in this case to protect the confidentiality of certain types of discovery material (such as trade secrets and private personal material) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54), the parties' rationale for filing most of their papers under seal, pursuant to that Protective Order, cannot be readily discerned from those papers. Rather, what\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   obvious is that the parties have grossly over-designated their submissions as \"Confidential,\" placing under seal extensive amounts of legal argument and plainly public information. I therefore recommend that all of the papers submitted in connection with the motion and cross-motions be unsealed, absent a focused showing by the parties that portions of those papers contain information that is particularly sensitive, such that the balance of interests weigh in favor of maintaining confidentiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Duty To Defend (Dkt. 114), and Defendants' Cross-Motions on the Duty To Defend (Dkt. 132) and on the Appropriate Allocation of Defense Costs (Dkt. 136)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As noted above, this Court will first address Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, in which Plaintiff asserts that the Court should declare that, as a matter of law, Defendants have contractual obligations to provide Plaintiff with a complete defense to all pending Underlying Asbestos Claims (except for the Mack Truck Claims) involving bodily injuries that occurred, in whole or in part, during the Policy Periods, and that this defense obligation will continue with all similar claims that may be asserted in the future. (Dkt. 114.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conjunction with addressing\n   Plaintiff's motion, this Court will also consider Defendants' cross-motions for partial summary judgment in their favor on the issues of whether the Underlying Asbestos Claims (and future similar claims), by their nature, give rise to a duty to defend at all (Dkt. 132), and, to the extent they do, whether that duty requires Defendants to pay 100 percent of Plaintiff's defense costs, as opposed to a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   allocated share, based on Defendants' time on the risk, relative to the time that Plaintiff has been self-insured (Dkt. 136). Essentially, these two particular cross-motions represent the flip-side of Plaintiff's motion: by arguing that, as a matter of law, Defendants are required to provide it with a \"complete defense,\" Plaintiff is teeing up two separate issues for resolution as a matter of law: (1) whether the Claims give rise to a duty to defend (an issue on which Defendants themselves claim to be entitled to judgment, in the first of the cross-motions referenced here), and (2) whether that duty to defend requires Defendants to pay 100 percent of Plaintiff's defense costs (an issue on which Defendants also claim to be entitled to judgment in their favor, in the second of those cross-motions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, I recommend that each of these motions - Plaintiff's motion seeking a declaration that it is entitled to a complete defense, and Defendants' cross-motions regarding (a) whether the Claims give rise to a duty to defend, and (b) on the issue of allocation - be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Legal Standards Regarding the Duty To Defend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   An insurer's \"exceedingly broad\" duty to defend is triggered \"whenever the four corners of the [underlying] complaint suggest - or the insurer has actual knowledge of facts establishing - a reasonable possibility of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Continental Cas.

Mem., at 7 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9 (arguing, with reference to Defendants' June 2017 letter, that \"there is no genuine dispute that Travelers and Liberty [Mutual] have now finally acknowledged their respective insuring obligations and agreed, albeit belatedly, to 'assume 100% of the reasonable and necessary defense costs in connection with open and pending asbestos cases against [Plaintiff]' \") ). For their part, and not conceding that they have made any admissions, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's motion on the duty to defend should, in part, be found to be \"moot,\" in light of Defendants' \"\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   to assume\" the complete defense of certain of the Underlying Asbestos Claims - specifically, those Claims asserted against Plaintiff in its individual capacity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Duty To Defend Mem., at 18 n.19 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Given the legal contentions asserted in Defendants' June 2017 letter, however, as well as its conditional nature and Defendants' express reservation of certain rights, that letter cannot rationally be construed as an admission, nor can it be read to render any portion of Plaintiff's motion moot. For one thing, it is this Court's understanding that, by their letter, Defendants did not offer to provide a defense for any Underlying Asbestos Claims asserted against Plaintiff solely in its capacity as successor-in-interest to the After-Acquired Entities (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Duty To Defend Mem., at 18 n.19), even though Plaintiff plainly seeks a ruling, via its motion, that such claims give rise to a duty to defend (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Duty To Defend Opp./Reply Mem., at 12-13). Moreover, even to the extent Defendants offered in their letter to assume a complete defense of any claims, on a going-forward basis, they expressly reserved the right to discontinue such a defense after the \"fact discovery\" phase of the litigation -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , before expert discovery and any summary judgment motion practice - if, in their view, it had become apparent that the facts \"establish[ed]\" that the claimants' injuries arose out of products \"manufactured, sold, distributed and/or handled\" by any party not named in the Policies as an insured, presumably including the After-Acquired Entities.

This hardly represents an unqualified admission that Defendants owed Plaintiff a \"complete\" defense of any\n   claims, or even an \"offer\" to provide such a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, this Court will proceed to consider the legal arguments made by the parties with respect to the duty to defend, and the scope of that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Three \"Buckets\" of Asbestos Claims at Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In its motion, Plaintiff argues that, for all asbestos litigation at issue in this case, Defendants are obligated, under the Policies, to pay 100 percent of Plaintiff's reasonable defense costs, regardless of whether the particular claims in question were or will be (a) asserted against Plaintiff in its individual capacity, (b) asserted against Plaintiff both individually and in its capacity as a successor in interest to one or both of the After-Acquired Entities, or (c) asserted against Plaintiff solely in its capacity as successor in interest, or, for that matter, asserted only against some or all of the After-Acquired Entities themselves, and not naming Plaintiff directly on the claims at all. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem.) Defendants, however, reasonably divide the Claims into three \"buckets,\" labeling the first of these categories \"Bucket A,\" the second \"Bucket B,\" and the third \"Bucket C,\" and addressing them separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the reasons that follow, I recommend that the Court grant partial summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor on the issue of whether the so-called Bucket A and B claims give rise to Defendants' duty to defend, but that it grant partial summary judgment in Defendants' favor on the same issue with respect to the Bucket C claims. Further, as to the issue of defense-cost allocation for the Bucket A and B claims, I recommend that - except with respect to the Mack Truck Claims, as to which Plaintiff has agreed to continue to contribute to defense costs - the Court grant Plaintiff partial summary judgment declaring that, at the defense stage of those claims, Plaintiff has no obligation to share in the costs of defense. I also recommend, however, that the Court deny Plaintiff's request for a declaration that the Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the full defense costs of the Bucket A and B claims. Rather, I recommend that (unless the duty to defend is found to be vitiated by any conduct by Plaintiff, as discussed further below), the complete cost of defense of such claims be allocated\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   between Defendants, based on their relative time on the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Bucket A and B Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Claims Give Rise to a Duty To Defend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants concede that Plaintiff is the named insured on the Policies (Def. Duty To Defend 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13), and it is undisputed that the Policies require Defendants to defend Plaintiff against claims seeking damages for bodily injury that occurred during the Policy Periods (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Background,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at Section A(1) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to Bucket A claims, on which Plaintiff is named as a defendant only in its individual capacity, Defendants' duty to defend should be found to be triggered, if not by the face of the underlying complaints themselves, then by the Insurers' actual knowledge of facts establishing a reasonable possibility of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Casualty Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4427118\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/80/640/#p648\">\n    80 N.Y.2d at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.Y.S.2d%20966\">\n    593 N.Y.S.2d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20N.E.2d%20506\">\n    609 N.E.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same should be found for Bucket B claims, as, in the defense stage, the covered claims\n   (as to which Plaintiff may be directly liable) are too closely intertwined with the non-covered ones (as to which Plaintiff may only be liable in its capacity as successor in interest to the After-Acquired Entities) to allow for those claims to be readily distinguished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alfa Laval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%209557466\">\n    2011 WL 9557466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Generali\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20903279\">\n    1994 WL 903279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In arguing that none of the Underlying Asbestos Claims give rise to a duty to defend, Defendants do not contest that the nature of the injuries alleged could give rise to coverage under the Policies. Instead, their arguments boil down to the assumption that, regardless of whether Plaintiff is named in its own capacity on any of the Claims, it cannot be liable on those Claims because any asbestos-containing products that could have caused the claimants' injuries during the Policy Periods were actually manufactured by the After-Acquired Entities (which were not covered by the Policies), rather than by Plaintiff itself. This assumption by Defendants as to who manufactured the products in question is not drawn from the four corners of the existing underlying complaints; instead, Defendants argue that the assumption is warranted because, after \"decades of litigation,\" it has become clear that the injury-causing products were not made by Plaintiff. (Def. Duty To Defend Mem., at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff has been sued for asbestos-related injuries that could only have been caused by products manufactured by the After-Acquired Entities, the law would support Defendants' assertion that they would have no duty to defend those suits. As correctly noted by Defendants, \" '[t]here is no provision in the [Policies] that purports to extend coverage specifically to after-acquired entities for previously incurred liability. An alternative reading would lead to an absurd scenario in which [Defendants] would be obligated to provide coverage to any company acquired by the insured for an indefinite period of time.' \" (Def. Duty To Defend Mem. at 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Maryland Cas. Co. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co. - Conn\n   </em>\n   , No. 88cv2613 (SWK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20592267\">\n    1994 WL 592267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 1994) ).) Nonetheless, to avoid the duty to defend, Defendants would have to \"establish[ ] as a matter of law that there is\n   <em>\n    no possible factual or legal basis\n   </em>\n   on which [they] might eventually be obligated to indemnify [their] insured under any policy provision,\"\n   <em>\n    Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v.

Duty To Defend Mem., at 16) is undercut by Defendants' concession, in footnotes, that the Mack Truck Claims and at least one other Underlying Asbestos Claim did involve Plaintiff's own products (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 16 n.16, 17 n.17;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435257\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/83/#p97\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 13 (arguing that the products at issue in the Underlying Asbestos Claims were \"\n   <em>\n    virtually\n   </em>\n   exclusively\" manufactured by LTI and Yale (emphasis added) ) ). Defendants' only explanation as to why even the Mack Truck Claims do not give rise to a duty to defend is that Defendants have never, in the past, been required make any indemnification payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 16 n.16.) Defendants argue that, as \"no indemnity has ever been paid\" in those cases, it should be concluded that there was \"no real liability,\" and hence no duty to defend from the outset. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Yet the fact that Defendants\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   , in the past, indemnify Plaintiff for any resolved Mack Truck Claims is insufficient to establish that there was no possibility, based on the complaints, that they\n   <em>\n    might have\n   </em>\n   been obligated to indemnify Plaintiff on those\n   claims or that they might have such an obligation on similar claims that have not yet been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, and more broadly, this Court is unaware of any authority supporting Defendants' attempt to redefine the well-settled question of when the duty to defend is triggered by reference to an insurer's historical experience with indemnification. Even accepting Defendants' representation regarding how earlier cases have played out, the Shakespearian maxim that \"what's past is prologue\" has no bearing on the legal question of when a duty to defend arises. Defendants' seeming argument that, because the evidence adduced in past cases against Plaintiff did not lead to an indemnification requirement, all present and to-be-filed asbestos claims against Plaintiff will necessarily end the same way - and that Defendants should therefore not be required to defend Plaintiff against any such claims - would turn the law on its head. An insurer's prediction as to how an evidentiary record in a case will eventually be developed should not deprive an insured of an early defense where an allegation against it could possibly (even if not probably) lead to a finding of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Third, as to Bucket A claims, asserted against Plaintiff in its individual capacity, the Insurers' cannot avoid their duty to defend merely because the claimants' pleaded allegations may not have identified those specific products, made by Plaintiff, that could have caused or contributed to the claimants' injuries. In some instances, while giving notice pleading of the general nature and cause of their injuries, claimant crane operators who were exposed to asbestos may not have identified, in their complaints, any of the particular component parts of the cranes that allegedly contained the asbestos. In others, as in the complaint of claimant Harold Stone (the \"\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   Complaint\") that has been offered by Plaintiff as an exemplar (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem., at 5-6), claimants may have identified those crane components to which they were exposed and that that they believed contained asbestos, but they may have made clear that their knowledge was potentially incomplete, such that any pleaded list of components was not intended to be exhaustive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schretzman Decl., Ex. 30 (\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   Complaint), at 7 (alleging that Stone recalled \"being exposed to a number of asbestos products,\n   <em>\n    including but not limited to\n   </em>\n   brakes, clutches, hot tops, joint compound, refractory, overhead cranes, overhead crane brakes, and steel furnaces\" (emphasis added)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ).) In both of these scenarios, the claimants' pleadings could be readily construed to include potential claims against Plaintiff for exposure to asbestos in the hoists that it manufactured, and that, according to Plaintiffs, were likely attached to the cranes in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Finally, even if the pleadings for certain Bucket A claims appear, on their face, to make allegations only about cranes, those pleadings would still give rise to a duty to defend, as, in light of Plaintiff's representations that the referenced cranes were highly likely to have included hoists that it manufactured (and that contained asbestos), Defendants have \"actual knowledge of facts establishing a reasonable possibility of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Frontier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525083\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/91/169/#p175\">\n    91 N.Y.2d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525083\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/91/169/#p175\">\n    667 N.Y.S.2d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525083\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/91/169/#p175\">\n    690 N.E.2d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Continental Cas.

In the circumstances presented here, it is evident that the claims cannot be parsed absent the development of case-specific facts regarding the particular source(s) of asbestos that may have caused the claimants' alleged injuries over the duration of their exposure to cranes and attached hoists, and thus the duty to defend must be found to extend to Bucket B, as well as to Bucket A claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Accordingly, as a threshold matter, Plaintiff has demonstrated that the Underlying Asbestos Claims on which it is named at least in part in its individual capacity are covered by the Policies, triggering Defendants' duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mount Vernon Fire Ins.

Whereas Plaintiff argues that Defendants should each be declared separately liable for the full defense costs wherever their Policies are implicated at all, Plaintiff makes this argument primarily in the context of arguing that no\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   allocation should be made that includes Plaintiff or its captive insurer in the allocation. Plaintiff takes a less emphatic position on the question of whether Defendants might be required to allocate defense costs as between the two of them (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Allocation Opp. Mem.), and, indeed, such a requirement should make little economic difference to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Alfa Laval\n   </em>\n   , the Appellate Division noted that \"the pro rata sharing of defense costs [between insurers] may be ordered when more than one policy is triggered by a claim,\"\n   <em>\n    Alfa Laval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498686\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/451/3498686/\">\n    954 N.Y.S.2d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , even though it did not take that step in that case. In the circumstances of that case, the Appellate Division found that both of the two insurers in the case could not \"viably provide ...

Indeed, Defendants have a demonstrated history of allocating costs on the Underlying Asbestos Claims (as they shared, for years, in the costs of defense of the Mack Truck Claims and claims in other jurisdictions); they raise no concern about their ability to do so presently or in the future; and they argue strenuously in their submissions that the Policies dictate the appropriateness of\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   allocation. (Def. Allocation Mem., at 9-11 (citing the \"occurrence\"-based terms of the Policies to support this proposition).) Certainly, at no point does Liberty Mutual (which has the shorter Policy Period in this case) suggest that, in the absence of a judicial ruling requiring CMIC to share defense costs, Travelers should be required to pay Plaintiff's defense costs in full, with Liberty Mutual only potentially contributing later. Further, in offering, in their June 12, 2017 letter, to assume 100 percent of the reasonable\n   cost of defense of all of the Underlying Asbestos claims (subject to certain conditions), Defendants apparently contemplated an ability to allocate 100 percent of those costs between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For all of these reasons, and as a matter of equity and efficiency in this particular case, this Court concludes that, as between the two Defendants (but not Plaintiff or CMIC at this juncture), it would be appropriate for defense costs of the Bucket A and B claims to be allocated based on Travelers' and Liberty Mutual's respective time on the risk. Defendants' combined contributions, however, should total 100 percent of the costs of defense of such claims, pending potential later contributions by Plaintiff, unless Defendants are successful in proving that their duty to defend was vitiated by Plaintiff's own conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Accordingly, I recommend that the portion of Plaintiff's motion that seeks a declaration that, as a matter of law, the Bucket A and B claims give rise to a duty to a \"complete\" defense obligation by Defendants be granted, although I further recommend that Defendants not be held jointly and severally liable for this \"complete\" defense, but rather that 100 percent of the defense costs of the Bucket A and B claims be allocated between them, based on the relative length of their Policy Periods. I further recommend that Defendants' cross-motion with respect to allocation of defense costs be granted to the extent that a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   allocation of defense costs as between Defendants should be found appropriate under the Policies, but denied to the extent Defendants are seeking a declaration that Plaintiff's captive insurer, CMIC, should share in defense costs on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis, as well, prior to the resolution of the underlying claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Bucket C Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   On the Bucket C claims, Plaintiff is named as a defendant, if at all, only in its capacity as the successor in interest to the After-Acquired Entities. Defendants argue that they have no duty to defend these claims, as the claims do not even potentially fall within the Policies, and as Plaintiff has conceded this to be true. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Duty To Defend Mem., at 14; Def. Duty To Defend Reply Mem., at 3 n.5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   With regard to Plaintiff's purported concession, Defendants cite a July 19, 2016 email from an attorney representing Plaintiff, and a spreadsheet attached to that email. (Def. Duty To Defend Mem., at 6, 6 n.5 (citing Maloney Decl., Ex. 58 (\"Pl. 7/19/16 Email\") ).) The spreadsheet divides then-existing \"active\" and \"closed\" asbestos cases against Plaintiff into different categories, based on how Plaintiff was named in the pleadings, and indicates those categories for which Plaintiff was, at the time of the email, seeking coverage, and those (including claims on which it was named solely as a successor in interest) for which it \"concede[d] that the [Policies] do not provide coverage.\" (Pl. 7/19/16 Email, at 8.) This \"concession,\" however, is not as clear-cut as Defendants suggest, as the email itself seems to focus on \"indemnity\" payments rather than on the duty to defend. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498686\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/451/3498686/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Background,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at Section A(1).) The parties' lengthy course of dealing, though - as to which the parties provide conflicting descriptions - is relevant to the questions of whether, as Plaintiff contends, Defendants essentially forced it to handle its own defense (and to settle claims on its own) by refusing to provide a sufficient defense, or, to the contrary, Plaintiff breached the cooperation and consent-to-settle provisions of the Policies, despite Defendants' good-faith efforts to secure cooperation and to provide Plaintiff with a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiff cannot ignore the fact that, up until 2011, it\n   <em>\n    voluntarily\n   </em>\n   entered into cost-sharing agreements, both formal and informal, with Defendants; that Defendants honored those agreements; and that, under the parties' agreements, Defendants actively provided Plaintiff, for\n   <em>\n    many years\n   </em>\n   , with a defense of many of the Underlying Asbestos Claims. With this background, and even with this Court's finding, above, that the Claims at issue legally entitled Plaintiff to a complete defense, Plaintiff is hard-pressed to paint Defendants as abjectly derelict in their duties as insurers, such that Plaintiff could avoid its ongoing duty of cooperation. Moreover, Defendants contend that Korman's arrival in 2011 led Plaintiff to begin \"freezing out Defendants from all decisions concerning the strategy, defense and settlement of the Underlying [Asbestos] Claims,\" by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , appointing DLA Piper as NCC \"[w]ithout Defendants' knowledge or consent,\" unilaterally \"fir[ing] and replac[ing] local counsel in several jurisdictions,\" and instructing DLA Piper to coordinate with Defendants only \"on rare occasions when [Korman] was in a good mood.\" (Def. Coop./Vol. Paymt. Mem., at 21-22 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).) Defendants further contend that they made \"diligent efforts to obtain [Plaintiff's] cooperation through repeated written correspondence and telephone calls\" and attempts to schedule meetings, in the face of Korman's, and by extension Plaintiff's, \"brazen[ ] ... obstructionism.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   As articulated by Plaintiff, however, the relevant facts are quite different. Plaintiff cites the deposition testimony of Korman and others to assert that, when Korman stepped into Harvey's shoes as Plaintiff's new general counsel, he faced an increasing number of asbestos litigation filings\n   spreading into new jurisdictions. (Pl. Coop./Vol. Paymt. Opp. Mem. at 2; Korman Dep., 106:24-107:13; Miller Dep., 42:13-43:5.) He also questioned why Defendants were paying only a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of Plaintiff's defense costs in the Underlying Asbestos Claims, instead of \"paying 100% of the defense, which he understood was their duty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3.) In this iteration of events, Korman \"engaged in multiple discussions with Travelers ... about the risk facing [Plaintiff] and the rationale for the current strategy,\" but the Defendants \"did not want to meet with [ ] Korman and DLA [Piper] to discuss the new strategy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4.) According to Plaintiff, the only thing Defendants wanted to discuss was whether Plaintiff would agree to extend the cost-sharing structure used in Mack Truck Agreement to new third-party asbestos suits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5.) Plaintiff argues that Defendants not only refused to defend Plaintiff fully, but were actively working against Plaintiff's interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   While, if Defendants' accounts were credited, this might be sufficient to show the type of \"willful and avowed obstruction\" necessary to meet their heavy burden to disclaim further defense and indemnity obligations, it is not for the Court to credit Defendants' version of the facts in evaluating their cross-motions. Instead, where Defendants are the moving parties, this Court \"must view the evidence in the light most favorable to [the Plaintiff] ... and must draw all reasonable inferences in [Plaintiff's] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    L.B. Foster Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257107\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/81/#p87\">\n    138 F.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, \"[a]ssessments of credibility and choices between conflicting versions of the events are matters for the jury, not for the court on summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Rule v. Brine, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571913\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/1002/#p1011\">\n    85 F.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011 (2d Cir. 1996). As the parties' recitation of the relevant facts are almost diametrically opposed, this Court finds that triable issues of material fact preclude summary judgment in Defendants' favor with respect to the issue of cooperation. Similarly, the differing versions regarding the breakdown of the parties' relationship also preclude a finding that Plaintiffs were entitled to proceed to settle claims without Defendants' consent. If Defendants' evidence were credited, Defendants stood ready and willing, at all relevant times, to work with Plaintiff on providing an ongoing defense of the Underlying Asbestos Claims, whereas, if Plaintiff's evidence were credited, it had little choice but to go it alone after Defendants refused even to meet with Plaintiff to discuss the path forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   I therefore recommend that Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment as to Plaintiff's alleged violations of the cooperation and voluntary payment provisions of the Policies be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Reasonableness of Defense Counsel's Billing Rates\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In a cross-motion filed by Liberty Mutual and a coordinated cross-motion filed by Travelers, Defendants request that the Court find the rates charged by DLA Piper in connection with its defense of the Underlying Asbestos Claims to be unreasonable as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Liberty Mutual Rates Mem.; Travelers Rates Mem.) Defendants also request a partial summary judgment ruling that, to the extent Defendants may be found obligated to reimburse Plaintiff for any defense costs, their payment obligations should be limited to the purportedly \"prevailing reasonable hourly rates\" set out in the report of Liberty Mutual's expert on fees, John S. Pierce (\"Pierce\"). (Liberty Mutual Rates Mem., at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pierce Decl.;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Travelers Rates Mem.) Liberty Mutual describes Pierce as having spent \"28 years serving as an expert in the evaluation of attorneys' fees and costs\" (Liberty Mutual Rates Mem., at 7; Pierce\n   Decl. \u00b6 2), and, although Travelers has submitted the separate opinion of its own expert, Gerry Tostanoski (\"Tostanoski\") (whom Travelers describes as an attorney with \"over 30 years of experience in representing defendants in asbestos litigation\" (Travelers Rates Mem., at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minetto Decl., Ex. 27 (Expert Report of Gerry H. Tostanoski, dated Apr. 7, 2017 (\"Tostanoski Report\") ) ), Travelers states that the two experts' reports are generally consistent, and urges the Court to adopt Pierce's assessment of \"reasonable rates\" (Travelers Rates Mem., at 1 (joining in \"the relief requested by Liberty Mutual\") ). Plaintiff challenges both of Defendants' proffered expert reports, and argues that Defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating the unreasonableness of the fees in question. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Rates Opp. Mem.)

In a footnote to the chart that he prepared to set out his work, Pierce states that, under Supreme Court precedent, \"a reasonably hourly rate is generally equated to the\n   <em>\n    prevailing market rate for attorneys providing comparable services.\n   </em>\n   \" (Pierce Decl., Ex. A-2, at 1 n.2 (emphasis in original).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pierce then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   [T]he prevailing rate is neither the highest rate chargeable not [sic] the lowest. Instead, as the term suggests, it is the one most '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     prevalent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ' or the most '\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     frequent\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ' or the most '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     customarily charged\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .' I thus look primarily at the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     median\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   hourly rate in hourly rate surveys as the best indication of the prevailing market rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original).) The most \"frequently\" charged rate, however, would not be the \"median\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the mid-point of values), but rather the \"mode,\" and would be calculated differently from the median. Either way, though, Pierce's comments fail to appreciate that there are ranges of attorney rates that may be reasonably charged in a given case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v. City of Yonkers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Fed.%20Appx.%20605\">\n    345 Fed.

By taking the position that reasonable rates are best measured by the median (or the mode) of the rates charged by similarly experienced counsel in relevant markets, Pierce excludes from his analysis any higher rates that might be less commonly charged, but might still be \"reasonable\" in the circumstances presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Further, assuming that Pierce actually, as he claims, derived \"median\" rates from certain rates surveys, this Court cannot discern how he then went on to deduce what the reasonable rate should be, for a given attorney, from the various median rates he compiled. For example, in setting the rate that he considered reasonable for the work performed in 2011 by Adam A. DeSipio (\"DeSipio\"), a senior associate at DLA Piper (and the first attorney identified in Pierce's chart), Pierce lists four supposed \"median\" associate rates from various rate surveys ($ 240, $ 274, $ 240, and $ 370 per hour), but he then fails to acknowledge that the rate charged by\n   DLA Piper for DeSipio's work in 2011 was $[redacted] per hour, a rate that closely approximates the average of the median rates that Pierce supposedly thought were most relevant. Rather than rely \"primarily\" on those median rates, Pierce concludes - with no further explanation - that the \"reasonable\" rate for DeSipio in 2011 was $ 215 per hour, a rate lower than any of the medians he claims to have used as reference points. (Pierce Decl., Ex. A-2, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In deriving DeSipio's \"reasonable rate,\" Pierce apparently also relied on two additional rates that were not derived from surveys, but rather had been paid by Liberty Mutual itself, for the work performed in asbestos litigation by senior associates at two unnamed law firms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26(4).) At $[redacted] and $[redacted] per hour (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A-2, at 2.) ), these rates are notably lower than the market median rates that, according to Pierce, should be considered by the Court to be the most persuasive indicators of reasonableness. In a similar vein, in opining as to a reasonable range of attorney rates for asbestos litigation, Travelers' expert, Tostanoski has relied - in her case, entirely - on the range of \"blended\" rates that Travelers has typically paid to its approved counsel in such litigation. (Tostanoski Report, at 3-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Travelers Rates Mem., at 2.) To the extent either of Defendants' experts has sought to compare DLA Piper's rates to the rates customarily paid by\n   <em>\n    insurers\n   </em>\n   for coverage counsel, the comparison is not apt, as insurance companies, due to the volume of work they offer, may well be able to negotiate for lower attorney billing rates than could be obtained by other types of clients in the marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Rates Opp. Mem., at 13-14.) Thus, the attorney rates that are customarily paid by insurers may fall at the lower end of a reasonable range for like services (as, in fact, can be seen by the rates listed by Pierce in his chart), and should not be used as a standard by which the upper limit of that range is measured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Moreover, returning to Pierce's analysis, even if the lower, insurance-paid rates that he identified in his chart were added to the mix, this Court still cannot determine how he concluded, for example, that the \"reasonable\" rate for DiSipio's work, in 2011, should be found to be no more than $ 215 per hour. This rate represents neither the median, nor the mode, nor, for that matter, the average of the listed rates that Pierce supposedly considered, and this Court has been unable to replicate any math that Pierce may have used to calculate the value at which he asserts DiSipio's rate for 2011 should be capped. In its opposition brief, Plaintiff quotes Pierce as having testified at his deposition, \"I don't do a mathematical computation.\" (Pl. Rates Opp. Mem., at 18 (quoting Minetto Decl., Ex. 24 (Deposition of Pierce), at 118:17-18).) Indeed, a close review of his Declaration reveals no formula, no logic, and no stated justification for Pierce's selection of $ 215 as the upper limit of a reasonable rate for DiSipio, as Pierce merely states, \"[a]fter reviewing and comparing DLA [Piper] NCC rates to th[e] survey billing rates, I set a reasonable billing rate for each timekeeper which was in my opinion a reasonable prevailing rate.\" (Pierce Decl. \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Even apart from the seeming arbitrariness of Pierce's conclusions, it seems evident that he failed to look at relevant case-specific variables. A reasonable fee has been described in this Circuit as \"what a reasonable, paying client would be willing to pay,\"\n   <em>\n    Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass'n v. Cty. of Albany &amp; Albany Cty.

Factors that may be important to an overall lodestar analysis of reasonable\n   fees include, for example, the qualifications and special expertise of the attorneys, the complexity of the work they were called upon to perform, and the nature of their track record and the degree of their success in the litigation in question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760540\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/182/#p190\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"the district court should, in determining what a reasonable, paying client would be willing to pay, consider factors including, but not limited to, the complexity and difficulty of the case, [and] the available expertise and capacity of the client's other counsel ...\");\n   <em>\n    Farrar v.

A-2), he does not discuss (for example) the fact that, by 2011, DiSipio already had 18 years of experience (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A-2 at 1) - more than some partners - or consider whether the specific work DiSipio performed for Plaintiff was at a partner level. On a similar note, Plaintiff strongly takes issue with the opinion expressed by Pierce that the lead attorney on the DLA Piper team, William F. Kiniry, Jr. (\"Kiniry\"), who charged Plaintiff at hourly rates ranging from $[redacted] to $[redacted] over the period from 2011 to 2016, should have reasonably charged no more than $ 290 to $ 335 - only about $ 100 per hour more than the rates that Pierce claims would have been reasonable for the associates working on the case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Liberty Mutual Rates Mem. (Addendum); Pl. Rates Opp. Mem., at 12.) Plaintiff describes Kiniry as not just being a senior partner at a national firm, but as one who came with \"three decades of experience successfully developing and implementing complex national product liability defense strategies.\" (Pl. Rates Opp. Mem., at 5.) In fact, Plaintiff asserts that Kiniry has played this type of critical leadership role in handing \"national asbestos defense for numerous entities, including [redacted]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 12.) Plaintiff asserts that other, similarly situated clients have \"paid similar or higher rates\" for Kiniry's time (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581942,12448254\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/494/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 5), and that Plaintiff actually negotiated discounted rates for his services (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581942,12448254\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/494/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 4, 7-8), facts that Pierce did not consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Finally, because context matters when determining the reasonableness of attorneys' fees, this Court notes that where the work to be performed is particularly difficult, this may justify the client's hiring of especially skilled counsel - and thus paying higher counsel rates - than might be customary in the market for less difficult work. Defendants do not seriously challenge Plaintiff's representation that, at the time it retained DLA Piper, Plaintiff's asbestos cases were \"doubling,\" in an expanding number of jurisdictions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 10), and that it was in Plaintiff's interest to have a highly experienced attorney take the reins as NCC. Plaintiff also suggests, in its papers, that the asbestos litigation was not just expanding, but was, at that time, in such disarray that exceptional attorney skill was needed to rein in costs and get matters under control. According to Plaintiff, when Korman came on board as Plaintiff's new general counsel, he \"apprised the situation as dire\" (Pl. Rates Opp. Mem., at 2), finding \"no centralized coordination\" among the asbestos cases pending in different jurisdictions, \"no leadership,\" and \"no defense strategy in place\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9 (quoting Korman Dep., at 23:20-24) ). While Defendants generally urge the Court to discredit Korman's testimony as \"self-serving and uncorroborated\" (Def. Coop./Vol Paymt. Reply Mem., at 1), the role of the Court, as noted above, is not to take credibility determinations away from the jury. At the very least, Plaintiff's assertions regarding the supposed \"sorry state\" of Plaintiff's overall defense to the Underlying Asbestos Claims (Pl. Rates Opp. Mem., at 10) raise material factual issues as to why it chose DLA Piper to take over the role of NCC, and, hence, whether it may have been reasonable for Plaintiff to pay the rates charged by that firm, even if higher than the rates that may have been charged by firms with lesser resources and less of a national profile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In sum, this Court concludes that Defendants have not, by way of their cross-motions, overcome the presumption that DLA Piper has charged Plaintiff reasonable rates. Certainly, in light of the factual issues raised by Plaintiff regarding the context of DLA Piper's retention and the level of its experience in a national coordinating role, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, this Court cannot find that Defendants have met their burden to demonstrate that, as a matter of law, DLA Piper's rates have been unreasonably high and should be capped at those set out in the Pierce opinion. Accordingly, I recommend that Defendants' cross-motions on the reasonableness of defense costs be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271357\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/212/#p228\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying summary judgment on the issue of the reasonableness of defense costs where the record presented disputes of material fact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Cross-Motion on the Duty To Indemnify (Dkt. 130)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Defendants' final cross-motion for partial summary judgment seeks a judicial finding that Defendants have no duty to indemnify Plaintiff with respect to any of the Underlying Asbestos Claims. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def. Duty To Indemnify Mem.) In support of this cross-motion, Defendants' argue, as they do in support of their cross-motion on the duty to defend, that all of the products that are actually at issue in those Claims were manufactured by Plaintiff's After-Acquired Entities. Thus, Defendants' contend, they can have no obligation to provide coverage for any claimants' injuries.

Further, as already explained with respect to Bucket A and B claims, even where Plaintiff's products are not explicitly named in the underlying pleadings, there is a reasonable possibility that coverage under the Policies could be implicated on those claims, as Plaintiff has shown a likelihood that its asbestos-containing hoists were attached to the cranes at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Discussion,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at Section II(A)(3)(a)(i).) For these reasons, Defendants have not established - and cannot establish, at this time - that they will not be obligated to indemnify Plaintiff on any of the Underlying Asbestos Claims on which Plaintiff is named in its individual capacity, once those claims reach final resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   At bottom, as long as there is a reasonable possibility that the Underlying Asbestos Claims may be covered under the Policies (which this Court finds to be the case with any such claims asserted against Plaintiff in its individual capacity), then Defendants have a duty to defend Plaintiff on those claims, and cannot show, as a matter of law, that the claims will not implicate their duty to indemnify. I therefore recommend that Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment as to the duty to indemnify be denied as premature, with respect to such claims.
