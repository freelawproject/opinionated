Serious Harm and Substantial Risks of Serious Harm Posed by Inadequate Periodic Mental-Health Evaluations in Segregation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to showing a serious mental-health need, plaintiffs must establish that they have been subjected to either serious harm, or a substantial risk of serious harm--the second part of the 'objective' test under Eighth Amendment jurisprudence--as a result of inadequate mental-health care.

For example, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care has issued a position statement declaring that mentally ill prisoners should not be placed in segregation absent extenuating circumstances, and even in those circumstances, the stay should be shorter than 30 days.

Even one of defendants' experts opined that, based on his experience as a correctional administrator, mentally ill prisoners should generally not be placed in segregation; if they are, it should only occur with the explicit approval and hands-on involvement of mental-health staff, and such prisoners should be placed on a fast-track to be moved into more therapeutic settings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The substantial risk of harm posed by extended placement in segregation is even more acute for the subset of prisoners with serious mental-health needs who suffer from 'serious mental illness.'\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   the American Correctional Association and the American Psychiatric Association take the position that seriously mentally ill people should not be placed in segregation unless absolutely necessary, and if so, they should only remain for the shortest duration possible and no longer than three to four weeks.

Associate Commissioner Naglich candidly agreed with plaintiffs' expert Burns that placing seriously mentally ill prisoners in segregation is \"categorically inappropriate,\" and that such placement is tantamount to \"denial of minimal medical care.\" Naglich Testimony Vol. V at 73. Given the consensus on the substantial risk of harm of decompensation for these most severely mentally ill prisoners, the court concluded that it is categorically inappropriate to place prisoners with serious mental illness in segregation absent extenuating circumstances; in addition, when extenuating circumstances exist, decisions regarding the placement of such prisoners should be made with the involvement and approval of appropriate mental-health staff, and the prisoners should be moved out of segregation as soon as possible and have access to treatment and monitoring in the meantime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite the significant risks of harm created by segregation and by ADOC's segregation facilities in particular, \"overwhelming evidence makes clear that ADOC does not ensure that those with a heightened risk of serious harm from mental illness are not placed in segregation or that they are not sent there for dangerously long periods.\"\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As plaintiffs' expert Haney testified, as a general matter, \"it is much more difficult for staff to detect decompensation of prisoners while they are housed in segregation: when prisoners remain in their cells around the clock, mental-health staff have a harder time observing the patient and diagnosing illnesses effectively, and correctional officers and fellow prisoners also lack sufficient regular contact with the prisoner to notice the onset of symptoms of mental illness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n    at 1238-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, the Easterling facility's segregation unit has tiny windows that do not allow correctional officers to observe inside without being directly in front of the door--which correctional officers often avoid because of a risk of having bodily fluids or food thrown at them through a food slot on the door. The court witnessed firsthand that the Donaldson and St. Clair facilities have very little visibility into the cells from the officers' station due to small windows and dim lighting. Bibb's segregation units \"might be the most egregious in terms of visibility,\" having no line of sight from the central officer station.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, ADOC facilities frequently permit prisoners to cover their cell door windows with papers, which the court found \"heightens the risk of suicide\" by inhibiting the ability of correctional and mental-health staff to observe prisoners. The lack of visibility in ADOC segregation units therefore \"makes it even more difficult to provide effective monitoring.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n    at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The inadequacy of ADOC's mental-health monitoring of prisoners in segregation is further aggravated by a lack of privacy in segregation units, which discourages prisoners from having frank discussions about their mental health with mental-health staff. As the court noted, \"most ADOC segregation units are not conducive to having a cell-front conversation, due to heavy solid doors and very loud units with dozens of cells in a single unit. As the court saw during its tours of five prisons, none of the units--even the ones at Bibb, where only three cells are in a unit--were conducive to confidential conversations, because of the proximity to other cells and prisoners.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1243 n.71.

Additional Findings on Periodic Mental-Health Evaluations in Segregation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Having solicited further briefing from the parties, the court now makes additional findings regarding ADOC's provision of periodic mental-health evaluations to prisoners in segregation. The parties were instructed to \"point[ ] to where the relevant evidence is in the current record on this issue,\" and \"to address whether additional evidence, expert testimony, and an evidentiary hearing are needed.\" Phase 2A Liability Order Re Segregation (doc. no. 1364) at 2. However, because the parties did not request to submit additional evidence or conduct a further evidentiary hearing, the court now makes its findings based on the evidentiary record as it existed at the time of its previous liability opinion, and with the benefit of additional briefing and highlighting of information in the quite voluminous record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs highlighted three categories of evidence in the record that, in conjunction the above evidence, demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that periodic mental-health evaluations do not occur with adequate frequency, and that even when they do occur the evaluations are so cursory as not to be worth the paper they are written on. First, plaintiffs point to medical records and movement histories for three prisoners who were not on the caseload during extended periods in segregation, and who began to engage in self-harm while in segregation. These prisoners either received no periodic evaluations, or received evaluations that uniformly checked boxes indicating that the prisoners were stable and appropriate for placement, despite previous incidents of self-harm. Second, there are the records of three prisoners who were on the caseload during their time in segregation, but who nevertheless received inadequate periodic evaluations. Despite being identified as having serious mental-health needs, these prisoners received 'periodic' mental-health evaluations at irregular intervals, and far less often than required by ADOC's own regulation. Like the evaluations of those not on the caseload, and sometimes despite the prisoner having suffered multiple mental-health crises in segregation, each of these forms uniformly indicate that placement in segregation is appropriate and not affecting the prisoner's mental health, and contain no mention or analysis of the prior mental-health crises. Third, plaintiffs point to the psychological autopsies of five prisoners who committed suicide while in segregation between April 2014 and February 2016, who were not on the mental-health caseload and whose suicides were described as \"not anticipated\" by correctional and mental-health staff. Together, this evidence further supports that periodic mental-health evaluations in ADOC segregation units likely occur irregularly when they occur at all, and in any case are likely a perfunctory exercise that fails to detect and assess adequately signs of serious psychological harm and decompensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The record contains the medical records of three prisoners--R.M.W., L.P., and J.D.--who were in segregation for extended periods of time and who were not on the caseload. Each of these prisoners engaged in self-harm while in segregation, yet received irregular and patently inadequate\n   mental-health evaluations from ADOC, if at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court's previous liability opinion noted the case of R.M.W., a transgender female prisoner who spent 36 days in segregation at the Fountain facility in early 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Ex. 181, ADOC0392220-221; Joint Ex. 404, MR016842, MR016932. During this time, she was not on the caseload: although she presented mental-health issues at her intake screening at admission to ADOC custody, ADOC determined at that time that she did not need treatment and therefore declined to place her on the caseload. Beginning three days after placement in segregation, and over the following two weeks, she engaged in multiple instances of self-mutilation, including lacerations to her arm, shoulder, and ankle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Ex. 404, MR016897, MR016980-985, MR016988-89, MR01700-01. R.M.W. testified at trial that on another occasion while in segregation she attempted to hang herself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.M.W. Trial Tr. at 17:20-25. She further testified that placement in segregation makes her depressed, and that, while she has suffered from mental illness while not in segregation, she has engaged in self-harm only while in segregation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:11-14:5; 17:15-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   During this stint in segregation, and despite multiple incidents of self-harm, R.M.W. was seen by mental-health staff only twice: once while in the suicide watch cell, and again for a 30-day review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Ex. 404, MR017066-081. The record of the 30-day review reflects that it was quite cursory. The psychological associate conducting the review merely checked several boxes indicating that R.M.W. was in good condition; wrote \"Inmate appropriate for placement\"; and circled the portion of the form stating, \"Segregation placement not impacting inmate's mental health.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at MR017081.

He was not on the caseload during this period, despite being placed on suicide watch five times between December 2013 and June 2014, including for ten days or more on two separate occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Ex. 272, MR011840; Joint Ex. 177, ADOC039134-36, Joint Ex. 272, MR012076-78. L.P. received a 30-day and 90-day evaluation in 2013, but then received no further mental-health evaluations for the following nine months, despite ADOC Admin Regulation \u00a7 625 requiring an evaluation at each 90-day interval, and despite L.P. being placed on suicide watch five times during that period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Ex. 272, MR012021-093. The two assessments L.P. received have the same boxes checked as R.M.W.'s 30-day evaluation, indicating that he was in good condition, and that segregation placement was not impacting his mental health.

The record contains evidence of five such suicides that occurred between April 2014 and February 2016, which were committed by prisoners not on the mental-health caseload: C.P., D.H., J.H., J.J., and T.H. Pls. Ex. 1110 at MHM040806-07 (T.H.), MHM040814-15 (J.J.), MHM040816-18 (J.H.0); Pls. Ex. 1215 at MHM 041802-04 (C.P), MHM041808-10 (D.H.). Each of these suicides was described in the psychological autopsy report as \"not anticipated\" by correctional and mental-health staff. Such a significant number of wholly unanticipated suicides in ADOC segregation units further suggests that ADOC's monitoring mechanisms--including periodic mental-health evaluations--are simply failing to detect prisoners' decompensation while in segregation, and exacting a terrible price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants do not dispute any of the plaintiffs' arguments regarding the existence or content of periodic evaluations conducted in a particular prisoner's case. Nor do defendants point to other cases in which prisoners either on or off the caseload received periodic evaluations in accordance with ADOC's regulations, or in which such an evaluation caused ADOC to\n   reconsider placement in segregation or to provide additional mental-health treatment. Instead they assert, without citation to the records of any particular prisoners, that segregation rounds and periodic evaluations \"do in fact occur, but the content and conduct of them is not to Plaintiffs' liking.\" Defs.'

Holmes's testimony did not cite his knowledge of any particular inmate's case, much less provide supporting medical records; rather, he explained what was occurring at Tutwiler by describing the formal requirements of ADOC regulation \u00a7 625. Notably, Holmes also testified that segregation mental-rounds were occurring as written in ADOC regulation, and that he knew of no prisoners in segregation at Tutwiler who had decompensated or were at risk of decompensation. In light of its findings that mental-health rounds were cursory and infrequent; that extended placement in segregation poses a serious risk of psychological harm and decompensation to even previously healthy prisoners; that certain prisoners at Tutwiler have been placed in segregation for extended periods; and, as Holmes acknowledged during his testimony, that prisoners have attempted suicide while in segregation at Tutwiler, the court finds that Holmes's unwaveringly rosy testimony regarding ADOC's mental-health care of prisoners in segregation at Tutwiler, in the absence of supporting documentation, tends to undermine his credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, given evidence to the contrary--such as the records of K.N., the Tutwiler prisoner who spent 98 days in segregation, attempted suicide while there, and did not receive the required periodic evaluations in compliance with the ADOC regulation and the voluminous evidence the court has heard about how understaffing impacts the ability of the mental-health contractors to comply with the regulations--the court declines to infer from the mere existence of a regulation that evaluations are in fact occurring as prescribed, or to credit\n   Holmes's testimony in the absence of any supporting medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, with regard to prisoners both on and off the caseload, the court finds that ADOC's periodic mental-health evaluations are cursory, perfunctory, and inadequate for identifying the serious psychological harms and risk of decompensation that may result from segregation. This conclusion is based on the evaluations' uniform indication that segregation is not affecting a prisoner's mental health, near-uniform indication that prisoners are in good condition, and striking dearth of substantive comments--all despite the serious and well-documented psychological harm inflicted by extended periods of isolation, and despite documented (and sometimes severe) mental illness and incidents of self-harm among the prisoners in question. In addition, this conclusion is supported by evidence of several wholly unanticipated suicides in ADOC custody, as well as the court's previous findings that the ADOC's other practices of segregation monitoring--namely, mental-health rounds and security rounds--are also cursory, infrequent, and inconsistent. More fundamentally, if the stated purpose of ADOC's periodic evaluations is \"[t]o determine if segregation placement is contraindicated by ... [t]he inmate's mental status [or] [t]he potential for significant deterioration in the inmate's functioning by continued placement in the restrictive environment,\" ADOC regulation \u00a7 625.II.C, it is remarkable that not once did an evaluation in these cases--nor in any case cited to the contrary by defendants--determine that placement in segregation\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   impacting a prisoner's mental health, much less appear to result directly in a prisoner's transfer out of segregation. In sum, the plaintiffs have carried their preponderance-of-evidence burden in demonstrating that periodic mental-health evaluations in ADOC segregation units occur infrequently and irregularly; are largely perfunctory in nature; and are inadequate at identifying signs of psychological harm and decompensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   4. Conclusions of Law Regarding Actual Harm and Substantial Risk of Serious Harm\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The evidence in the record amply demonstrates that ADOC's' failure to provide periodic mental-health evaluations of prisoners in segregation poses a substantial risk of serious harm to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the previous liability opinion found, extended placement in segregation poses a substantial risk of serious, potentially permanent psychological harm and decompensation. The risk is heightened for prisoners with mental illness. And, for the population with 'serious mental illness,' that risk is so acute that the court concluded that placement of such prisoners in segregation is categorically inappropriate absent extenuating circumstances, and that even under such circumstances placement should only be made with the consultation of mental-health staff and for as short a period as possible. Because extended isolation may cause mental illness in previously healthy individuals, as well as aggravate existing mental illness, ongoing monitoring is necessary in order to determine the appropriateness of a prisoner's continued placement in segregation in light of the prisoner's current mental-health needs, and to identify any necessary treatment. As the court put simply, given the serious risks of extended isolation, \"it is ... essential to identify those who need mental-health treatment in segregation.\"\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d at 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, as Burns testified, mental-health evaluations--separate from mental-health rounds and other monitoring--are important to \"catch[ ] signs of mental illness at its earliest point to be able to intervene.\" Burns Trial Tr. Vol. I at 212:9-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It must also be noted that factual support for, and import of, these conclusions\n   is magnified by the particular conditions in ADOC's segregation units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court has before it evidence that three prisoners on the caseload and three prisoners not on the caseload at a range of prisons received periodic evaluations at erratic intervals or not at all, and that those evaluations they received were perfunctory. In addition, the record also contains voluminous evidence that, largely due to correctional and mental-health understaffing, ADOC's mental-health providers have repeatedly failed to provide to prisoners in segregation the mental-health services required by ADOC regulations, such as mental-health rounds and security checks, and that those prisoners receive little in the way of out-of-cell contact with mental-health providers. Moreover, defendants have been unable to point to any medical records reflecting the timely provision of the required evaluations. Thus, while the six prisoners' records might not be enough in a vacuum to find that ADOC is failing to provide adequate periodic evaluations, in light of the overwhelming evidence that understaffing has prevented the mental-health staff from fulfilling a variety of requirements, and the lack of records showing that prisoners received adequate evaluations in a timely manner, these \"[r]epeated examples of delayed or denied medical care\" sufficiently demonstrate that ADOC fails to provide adequate periodic evaluations on a systemic basis.\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1583428\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/792/1052/#p1059\">\n    792 F.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1059 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding that \"[r]epeated examples of delayed or denied medical care\" may reveal systemic deficiencies). The lack of sufficient periodic evaluations is demonstrated by, among other evidence, multiple instances in which staff indicated that segregation placement was not affecting a prisoner's mental health, and that continued placement was appropriate, despite the fact that a prisoner had recently engaged in significant self-harm or suffered a mental-health crisis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates v.

Indeed, in light of the significant number of wholly unanticipated suicides in ADOC segregation units, by individuals who were not on the mental-health caseload, defendants' contention that \"the system works\" is astonishing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Response in Opposition to Liability Finding Related to Segregation Monitoring (doc. no. 1418) at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants raise several objections to a finding of harm, all of which are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, defendants contend that ADOC's written policies regarding segregation rounds, including its administrative regulations, are constitutionally sufficient, and that a finding of liability is further precluded because plaintiffs have not challenged the sufficiency of these policies. This argument misses the mark because plaintiffs' challenge is directed at ADOC's\n   <em>\n    actual practices, not the policies\n   </em>\n   , and, as the record shows, mental-health staff do not in any meaningful way follow policy: compliance is inconsistent, superficial, and frequently nonexistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, defendants argued that ADOC has already taken substantial steps to address the risk of suicide in its facilities, because of which no inmate in ADOC custody had committed suicide since January 1, 2017. Defs.' Response in Opposition to Liability Finding Related to Segregation Monitoring (doc. no. 1418) at 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amended Phase 2A Interim Relief Order Regarding Suicide Prevention Measures (Doc. No. 1106). Therefore, they asserted, there is no current risk of suicide in ADOC facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As an initial matter, since the filing of that brief, the parties have presented evidence of an increasing number of suicides in segregation. However, the court need not rely on that evidence here. For even if defendants were correct that they have eliminated the risk of suicide in segregation, the potential harms of insufficient mental-health monitoring in segregation are plainly not limited to increased risk of suicide. Rather, as experts from both sides testified, the harms of extended segregation--which are aggravated when placement and treatment are not informed by an accurate understanding of a prisoner's mental-health needs--include \"hallucinations, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety attacks, and self-harm,\" Burns Trial Tr. Vol. I at 209, as well as psychosis and delusions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tytell Trial Tr. at 189:9-20. Thus, even if it were true that there is no current risk of suicide in ADOC segregation units, the failure to detect psychological harm and decompensation among prisoners in segregation still could result in serious and potentially permanent harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, defendants assert that plaintiffs impermissibly seek to expand the definition of the plaintiff class by seeking relief on behalf of mentally healthy inmates. They thus argue that because plaintiffs represent a class of prisoners \"with a serious mental-health disorder or illness,\" a liability finding cannot extend to prisoners without mental-health needs before entering segregation. Similarly, defendants state, \"A serious mental health need does not exist as to any mentally healthy inmate.\" Defs.' Response in Opposition to Liability Finding Related to Segregation Monitoring (doc. no. 1418) at 3. These assertions all misunderstand the nature of the groups subject to ADOC's practices in segregation, as well as the court's power to order relief for those groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In light of ADOC's systemic under-identification of individuals with mental illness, and the fact that placement in segregation can cause previously healthy individuals to develop mental illness, there are three categories of prisoners with serious mental-health needs who are subject to ADOC's' care in segregation. First, there are prisoners who are\n   <em>\n    not on the mental-health caseload\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    do not have a mental illness\n   </em>\n   prior to placement in segregation, who develop mental illness requiring treatment because of the conditions in segregation. Second, there are prisoners who are\n   <em>\n    not on the mental-health caseload\n   </em>\n   but who have\n   <em>\n    unidentified mental illness requiring treatment\n   </em>\n   prior to placement in segregation, whose illness may worsen as a result of placement in segregation. Third, there are prisoners\n   <em>\n    on the mental-health caseload\n   </em>\n   (that is, with identified mental illness) prior to placement in segregation, whose illness also may worsen as a result of placement in segregation. In addition, there is a fourth group of prisoners who are\n   <em>\n    not on the caseload\n   </em>\n   and who do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   develop mental illness while in segregation. Groups Two and Three--those with unidentified mental illness and those who are on the caseload--both have serious mental-health needs and are therefore by definition members of the plaintiff class. Group One--prisoners who enter segregation healthy but then become mentally ill in segregation--pass into the plaintiff class when they become ill. Group Four do not have serious mental-health needs, and at no point develop such needs despite placement in segregation. To the extent that defendants argue that Group Four exists and is not part of the plaintiff class, the court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Supreme Court precedent makes clear that the court is permitted under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) to order relief even for currently healthy prisoners.

Moreover, defendants cite dicta from a Supreme Court case about access to prison libraries, stating that courts should not allow \"a healthy inmate who had suffered no deprivation of needed medical treatment ... to claim violation of his constitutional right to medical care, simply on the ground that the prison medical facilities were inadequate....\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

The plaintiffs here are prisoners with serious mental illnesses, not healthy prisoners.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunn v. Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271362\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/219/1100/#p1123\">\n    219 F.Supp.3d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123 (M.D. Ala. 2016). Again, defendants confuse the groups of prisoners at issue. Today's liability opinion extends to prisoners who enter segregation with mental illness (whether previously identified or not), and who develop mental illness while in segregation. In addition, as the Supreme\n   Court approved in\n   <em>\n    Plata\n   </em>\n   , relief here--providing adequate periodic mental-health evaluations to those in in segregation--will necessarily also extend to healthy prisoners. The\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   dicta thus has no bearing here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   More fundamentally, however, the risk posed by ADOC's inadequate provision of mental-health evaluations, in conjunction with other inadequate forms of monitoring, is by no means obscure or amorphous. To the contrary, as the court has explained, the severe and potentially permanent harm regularly inflicted by extended segregation is well documented, and monitoring prisoners in segregation for signs of psychological harm and decompensation is essential in order to avoid exposing prisoners to risk of further harm, and to provide any necessary treatment. Experts from both sides testified that this risk extends even to previously healthy individuals, but is significantly heightened for those with existing mental illness, and especially for those with 'serious mental illness.' Indeed, contrary to defendants' assertion, one need not stretch far to compare the pathogenic agent at issue in\n   <em>\n    Helling\n   </em>\n   to ADOC's exposure of prisoners with serious mental-health needs to extended segregation without adequate monitoring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   C. Deliberate Indifference\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The previous liability opinion noted overwhelming evidence that defendants were aware of the harm and risk of harm produced by ADOC's failure to monitor adequately the mental health of prisoners in segregation, and that they disregarded that harm or failed to act reasonably to alleviate it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1252-55 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In addition to those findings, the existence of ADOC's regulations providing for segregation rounds and periodic evaluations, in order to detect signs of harm and decompensation, show that ADOC is well aware that placement in segregation poses a substantial risk of serious harm, and that regular monitoring is necessary in order to mitigate that risk and reevaluate continued placement. Accordingly, the court concludes that defendants were deliberately indifferent with regard to their failure to provide adequate periodic evaluations of mental health to prisoners in segregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the above reasons, the court finds that ADOC's failure to provide adequate periodic mental-health assessments of prisoners in segregation creates a substantial risk of serious harm for those prisoners, and that this failure has contributed to the Eighth Amendment violation discussed in the main liability opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Despite having reached this conclusion, the court is uncertain in light of recent developments, which include what appears to be a crisis of suicides in the ADOC, whether an additional remedy is warranted. Accordingly, before the court sets this opinion down for a relief hearing, the parties will be given an opportunity to address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, it is ORDERED that, by noon on February 18, 2019, counsel for plaintiffs and defendants, after conferring with each other in an attempt to reach agreement, are to file a joint report of suggestions of how proceed as to relief in light of the above opinion. The court recognizes that February 18 is a holiday, but there now appears to be an urgency regarding the resolution of the issue of segregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   DONE, this the 11th day of February, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Because the court reserved this issue at the time of entering its liability opinion on June 27, 2017, and because the parties declined to submit additional evidence into the record, it now decides the issue based on the record that existed at the time of the liability opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Defendants argued that a separate liability opinion on this issue would be unnecessary because of the court's plan to hold a remedial trial on segregation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Response to Pls.' Proposed Opinion (doc. no. 1549) at 3. The court disagrees. Identifying the full scope of the liability finding, including the discrete issue analyzed here, is necessary in order to determine the scope and elements of the necessary remedy. Moreover, to the extent that defendants complain of the possibility of \"stale evidence,\" this claim is unavailing given that the parties both declined the opportunity to present additional evidence on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    As in the prior liability opinion, when the court refers to 'mentally ill prisoners' in this opinion, it is referring to only those with serious mental-health needs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Braggs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n     257 F.Supp.3d at 1190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    'Serious mental illness' is a term of art in the field of psychiatry--distinct from the far broader Eighth Amendment concept of 'serious mental-health needs'--that refers to a certain subset of particularly disabling conditions. Serious mental illness is defined by the diagnosis, duration, and severity of the symptoms. Certain diagnoses, such as schizophrenia and disorders accompanied by psychosis, are by definition serious mental illnesses, because they last a lifetime and are accompanied by debilitating symptoms; others, such as major depression and anxiety disorder, may be considered serious mental illnesses depending on the severity of the individual's symptoms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defense counsel maintained at oral argument that \u00a7 625 requires 30-day and subsequent 90-day evaluations for only inmates receiving treatment for serious mental illness. However, the plain language of the regulation requires such an evaluation \"[w]henever\n    <em>\n     an inmate\n    </em>\n    is maintained in a segregation cell for longer than thirty days,\" and \"[f]ollowing each ninety-day period thereafter.\" Joint Ex. 127, Admin. Reg. \u00a7 625 (doc. no. 1038-150) (emphasis added). Indeed, defendants' own brief clearly states that \"any inmate\" in segregation is to receive such evaluations under the regulation, cites testimony to that effect from ADOC psychologist Dr. Scott Holmes, and relies on that understanding\n    <em>\n     as evidence that ADOC is currently providing adequate evaluations. See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Response in Opposition to Liability Finding Related to Segregation Monitoring (doc. no. 1418) at 14. This understanding is further evident from ADOC's provision of such evaluations--albeit in an inconsistent and cursory manner--to individuals not identified as having serious mental illness. Finally, defense counsel could produce no evidence at oral argument supporting his then-understanding that \u00a7 625 applies to only inmates with serious mental illness. Accordingly, the court concludes that this regulation applies to all inmates held in segregation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The court previously misstated that the regulation required segregation rounds occur at least twice per week. However, the regulation in fact required that\n    <em>\n     ADOC staff\n    </em>\n    perform these rounds at least twice per week, and that contracted mental-health staff perform rounds an additional two times per week, on days different from those on which ADOC staff did rounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Haney recommended that Bibb's segregation units be closed immediately due to a lack of monitoring, which rendered the risk of harm too great. He explained that in four decades of doing this work, he has never recommended any unit to be closed immediately.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/#p1249\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Given H.C.'s multiple transfers between segregation and hospital units, across multiple ADOC facilities, the exact duration of each stint in segregation is unclear to the court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Joint Ex. 173, ADOC038881-885. Counsel for the plaintiffs maintained at oral argument that H.C. was held in segregation for multiple years during this time, and defense counsel did not challenge this characterization. In any case it is apparent that H.C. spent significant (even if not continuous) time in segregation during this period. The court is persuaded, in light of its previous findings regarding the psychological harms of segregation, that even assuming that H.C. was in and out of segregation, three mental-health evaluations over the course of three years are insufficient to determine the appropriateness of segregation placement and any treatment needs during this period. Moreover, insofar as H.C.'s time in segregation was viewed as \"resetting\"--for instance, based upon brief placement in a hospital unit--that determination likely should have resulted in\n    <em>\n     more\n    </em>\n    evaluations under ADOC regulation \u00a7 625, not fewer. That is, the regulation would have again required a 30-day evaluation after the segregation time was \"reset,\" in addition to an evaluation at 90 days and each 90-day period thereafter--rather than simply at 90-day intervals, had the time not been reset.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    To the extent defendants attempt to re-litigate the issue of segregation rounds, which the previous liability opinion already found to be cursory and insufficiently frequent, they ignore both the court's prior findings and its order for additional briefing. That order solicited additional input on the \"discrete issue\" of whether ADOC is \"conducting adequate periodic mental-health assessments of prisoners in segregation.\" Phase 2A Liability Order Re Segregation (doc. no. 1364) at 1. Because the Eighth Amendment liability finding remained open only as to the issue of periodic evaluations, the court declines to disturb its previous findings on the inadequacy of ADOC's segregation rounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In addition, although this opinion is based on the record as existed at the time of the 2017 liability opinion, the court cannot close its eyes to overwhelming and disturbing evidence presented throughout the segregation remedial trial during February-April 2018, that officials of ADOC and its mental-health contractor, throughout the command chain, were consistently unaware of the day-to-day activities occurring in segregation units--including officials who were tasked to monitor one specific facility. Namely, officials presented testimony as to various policies and practices in segregation units that was wildly inconsistent with one another, with the representations of defense counsel, and with documentary evidence as to what was in fact occurring on the ground. In this particular context, testimony from Holmes to the effect that segregation mental-health monitoring was occurring exactly as required by regulation, without further supporting evidence, rings particularly hollow.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Defendants further argue that \"No evidence exists in the record that a mentally healthy inmate entered segregation at an ADOC facility and developed a mental illness as a direct result of inadequate monitoring.\" Defs.' Response in Opposition to Liability Finding Related to Segregation Monitoring (doc. no. 1418) at 3. However, under\n    <em>\n     Helling\n    </em>\n    , evidence of such a particular case is unnecessary given overwhelming and uncontradicted testimony from both experts on both sides that even mentally healthy individuals face a significant risk of psychological harm from extended segregation, and that adequate monitoring is necessary in order to identify signs of psychological harm and decompensation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
