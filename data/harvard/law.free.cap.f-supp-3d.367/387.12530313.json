The proposed MCPS IEP was also developed based on the observations of the Student at the Private School by a MCPS Resource Teacher and an MCPS Autism Specialist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   33. An IEP Team meeting was held on April 15, 2016,12 and included: special education staff from MCPS; a MCPS school psychologist; a MCPS OT; a MCPS SLP; the Student's Parents; their attorney; a special education teacher from the Private School; and Dr. Solomon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   34. The IEP Team agreed that the Student was certificate (not diploma) track and would participate in alternate assessments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   35. The proposed MCPS IEP's present level of performance (PLOP) sections described the Student in all areas of need, including oral language, behavior, safety, adaptive skills, social skills and gross motor.13 It also discussed his PANS and CVID diagnoses. The information contained within the PLOP sections was taken directly from the Private School documents provided to MCPS by the Parents, including the Private School's IEP, BIP, and Annual Education Report, and the evaluations performed by the Children's Hospital psychologist and SLP, as complemented by the observations of the MCPS Resource Teacher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   36.

By August 2016, the Student had made progress on some math and reading objectives. He also had made progress in the following areas: using appropriate voice volume; asking before taking an object; demonstrating eye contact when someone approached/greeted him; demonstrating manners with regard to greetings and responding to simple questions; adhering to the commands of stop and come here, even when engaged in a preferred activity; and using and responding to greetings. He generally continued to need prompting to attend to speakers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   61. The Student was participating in group instruction at the Private School and in shared activities with peers, including taking turns on iPad games and sharing art supplies. He did this with substantial prompting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   62. The Student continued to elope. It mainly occurred when the Student asked for an item, but was told he could not have it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   63. The student was having tantrums more frequently. Tantrums lasted anywhere from a few seconds to fifteen minutes. Triggers were when the Student was denied access to a desired item, activity, ritual, or routine. Approximately once a day, the Student's tantrum would include him hitting his head against a hard object.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   64. Strategies being implemented by the Private Schools included: predictable schedules; preparation before transitions; if/then prompts; token economy; and prompting for the Student to use word to express his frustration. If preventative strategies were not successful, staff was utilizing: close proximity to ensure safety; additional staff to prevent injury; modifying the environment to prevent elopement; and use of mats to prevent injury against the tile floor or other hard objects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   65. The PLOP sections of the proposed MCPS IEP were updated in August 2016 based on this new information from the Private School. The majority of the rest of proposed MCPS IEP remained the same as the April version, including the proposed special/general education hours and the proposed placement of the Student in the Autism Program at the Elementary School.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   66.

In this regard, Plaintiffs argue that A.H.'s IEPs fell short because they included lunch and recess in the general education setting and A.H. cannot benefit from this setting. Pls.' Mem. 34. In addition, Plaintiffs assert that the proposed placements were inadequate for four reasons: (1) A.H. would not have been safe in the proposed placements; (2) they did not provide sufficient ABA programming; (3) they did not offer adequate staffing and instructional methods; and (4) A.H. would have been the only student in electives at Cabin John.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-43.

In support of this argument, Dr. Solomon testified that A.H. would not benefit from inclusion in the general education setting because \"he is barely available for guided and structured social interactions\" and does not have the skills to imitate his non-disabled peers. Nov. 7, 2017 Tr. 108:1-110:3. Similarly, Ms. Quinn testified that, based on her experience with A.H. at Ivymount, exposing him to a less-structured setting would not be beneficial. Nov. 8, 2017 Tr. 225:12-226:6. Ms. Quinn admitted, however, that she was not qualified to opine as to whether A.H. would benefit from inclusion in the general education setting because she only has observed him at Ivymount, which has a 100% disabled population.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Because A.H. has never been included in the general education setting, MCPS concluded that there was no data to support A.H.'s removal from the general education setting for lunch and recess. 2016 IEP 61, 2017 IEP 74. However, MCPS explained that data would be collected upon his enrollment and then they would determine whether A.H.'s continued inclusion in this setting was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This plan was reasonable, and the evidence demonstrates that A.H.'s initial inclusion in the general education setting for lunch and recess was appropriate. That is, Ivymount reported that A.H. was \"highly motivated to interact with adults and peers,\" and, indeed, that \"when [A.H.] earns reinforcement, he most often chooses to interact with adults or peers.\" Ivymount Nov. 18, 2016 Report 11, Pls.'

In addition, Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley testified that A.H. would benefit from inclusion in the general education setting for lunch and recess because it would give him an opportunity to model appropriate behavior and continue developing his social skills. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 63:2-64:2, 188:25-189:19. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that the ALJ properly deferred to MCPS's determination that A.H.'s inclusion in the general education for lunch and recess, with special education support, was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410449\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/711/713/#p718\">\n    711 F.

Plaintiffs specifically expressed concerns about A.H.'s safety during lunch at the proposed placements because there are doors in the cafeterias that allow access to the outside and, if the supervising paraeducators were not paying attention, A.H. would have ample opportunity to elope to the outside. Nov. 8, 2017 Tr. 51:4-61:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Both IEPs provide extensive supports and services for A.H. across the school day. Among others, the 2016 IEP requires \"frequent eye contact/proximity control\" and \"special education support during lunch and recess,\" and the 2017 IEP mandates \"close adult proximity at all times\" and \"adult support.\" 2016 IEP 29, 50; 2017 IEP 67, 71. Plaintiffs express concerns about A.H.'s safety at the proposed placements because of the \"intensity and unpredictability of A.H.'s behavior,\" but they have not demonstrated that the proposed placements lacked the capacity to implement the extensive supports outlined in the IEPs. Pls.' Mem. 29. To the contrary, both Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley testified that the proposed placements had the resources to implement A.H.'s IEPs. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 82:6-17, 215:3-216:12. They explained that two paraeducators accompany the students during lunch and recess at Bells Mill and \"at least three staff\" accompany the students during lunch at Cabin John, resulting in a ratio of approximately two students to one staff member. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 101:5-11, 186:5-8;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   47:22-48:22 (Ms. Garland's testimony that \"there were 6 students\" in the proposed classroom at Bells Mill); 174:17-23 (Ms. Stanley's testimony that \"the classrooms [at Cabin John] each have 7 students\"). Significantly, Ivymount reported that this level of staffing was appropriate for A.H. during non-work times. Ivymount Dec. 16, 2015 Report 4 (stating that A.H. \"requires a high staff-to-student ratio (e.g., two students to one staff member) to stay safe during non-work times, such as lunch and recess\"). In addition, Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley testified that the staff at Bells Mill and Cabin John have experience working with students who have tantrums and elope and have strategies to support students with these behaviors. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 60:4-62:10, 185:17-193:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Plaintiffs' safety concerns were further negated by MCPS's plan to collect data and assess the appropriateness of A.H.'s continued inclusion in the general education setting once enrolled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 IEP 61; 2017 IEP 57, 74. Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley also explained that if a student is unable to safely participate in the community outings at Bells Mill or Cabin John, the student stays back at school with a paraeducator. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 65:1-22, 193:16-194:6. This plan is reasonable and, indeed, identical to the practice at Ivymount; when Ivymount put bringing A.H. into the community on hold due to behavioral concerns, A.H. stayed back at school with an aide while other students participated in the community outings. 2017 IEP 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8, 2017 Tr. 221:25-222:12. But, despite MCPS's plan to evaluate the appropriateness of A.H.'s inclusion in these settings, and the evidence demonstrating the capacity of the proposed placements to implement the IEPs, Plaintiffs nonetheless claim that A.H. would not have been safe at the proposed placements. This assertion, based on mere speculation, does not support a finding that\n   A.H. was denied a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    R.E.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522801\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/167/#p186\">\n    694 F.3d at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Speculation that the school district will not adequately adhere to the IEP is not an appropriate basis for unilateral placement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Plaintiffs also assert that the proposed placements are inadequate for A.H. because they do not provide intensive ABA programming. Pls.' Mem. 37-40. Specifically, relying on Dr. Solomon's observations of the proposed placements, Plaintiffs argue that the ABA programming at the placements is inadequate because the ratio of students to staff members is two-to-one, ABA instruction is only delivered for two or three hours of the day, and because the schools do not collect behavioral data or have BCBAs on staff to analyze student data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522801\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/167/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Nov. 7, 2017 Tr. 87:8-89:5, 181:11-183:4. Plaintiffs point out that, at Ivymount, by contrast, ABA instruction is delivered throughout the day in a one-to-one format, data is collected several times a minute, and data is analyzed by BCBAs. Pls.' Mem. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The 2016 and 2017 IEPs implicitly require ABA instruction by setting behavioral and academic goals and mandating, among other supports and services, \"errorless teaching strategies,\" \"frequent and/or immediate feedback,\" and positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors. 2016 IEP 24-25, 31; 2017 IEP 27, 29, 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nov. 7, 2017 Tr. 83:2-23 (Dr. Solomon's testimony that \"a large part of the [ABA] approach is through errorless teaching\"). However, the IEPs do not mandate full-time, one-to-one ABA instruction, data collection at frequent intervals, or data analysis by a BCBA. Thus, the proposed placements were not required to offer these services in order to provide A.H. with a FAPE. Moreover, for the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the IEPs were inadequate for failing to mandate these supports and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   First, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the IEPs denied A.H. a FAPE by failing to require one-to-one ABA instruction. The 2016 IEP provides \"1:1 instruction for new skill acquisition,\" a \"highly structured classroom,\" \"direct instruction,\" and a variety of other instructional supports, including \"short instructions,\" breaking down assignments into smaller units, and \"strategies to initiate and sustain attention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 IEP 24-33. Similarly, the 2017 IEP calls for \"individualized instruction,\" a \"low staff to student ratio,\" \"close adult proximity at all times,\" \"adult support,\" and many of the same instructional supports outlined in the 2016 IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 IEP 27-34, 56. A.H.'s performance at Ivymount supports the appropriateness of the IEPs. That is, although Ivymount reported that A.H. was \"not able to learn new skills without the one-to-one attention of an adult,\" Ivymount also reported that A.H. participated in daily group instruction for 1.5 to 2.5 hours, albeit with \"substantial prompting from staff.\" Ivymount Dec. 16, 2015 Report at 2, 4; Aug. 4, 2016 IEP 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8, 2017 Tr. 235:16-24 (Ms. Quinn's testimony that A.H. is \"in group instruction varying from an hour and a half to two and a half hours a day). In addition, and significantly, Ivymount's updated IEP for A.H. did not mandate one-to-one support for A.H., but only called for \"Intensive staffing (1:1, 2:1, small group).\" Ivymount Jan. 24, 2017 IEP 3, Defs.' Ex. 50. Thus, in light of A.H.'s participation in group instruction at Ivymount and the extensive supports and services outlined in MCPS's IEPs, the Court concludes that the IEPs were reasonably calculated to provide A.H. an educational benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/#p999\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Plaintiffs also have not demonstrated that the IEPs were inadequate for failing to mandate data collection at frequent intervals or data analysis by a BCBA. The 2017 IEP explicitly requires \"task analysis,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   and both IEPs incorporate Ivymount's BIPs for A.H., which provide \"data will be analyzed and compared to baseline rates to determine the treatment effectiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ivymount Dec. 9, 2016 BIP 3, Ivymount Dec. 16, 2015 BIP 3, Pls.'

Plaintiffs have not shown that the IEPs were inadequate for A.H., but only that, at Ivymount, data is collected \"at least once or twice a minute\" and analyzed by a BCBA. Nov. 8, 2017 Tr. 194:23-196:19. This does not support a finding that A.H. was denied a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanson ex rel. Hanson v.

Md. 2002) (\"[T]he insistence of parents that a non-public school setting is more appropriate does not establish the inappropriateness of the public school, even if the child would have benefitted more in the private setting.\"). Moreover, Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley testified that the staff at Bells Mill and Cabin John consistently collect and analyze both behavioral and instructional data. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 65:23-69:12, 196:6-218:21. They also testified that a special educator with the proper training and experience, like those at the proposed placements, can analyze data just as well as a BCBA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   115:23-116:17, 147:9-149:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs have not shown that the proposed placements lacked the capacity to implement the instructional supports in A.H.'s IEPs related to ABA programming. Plaintiffs' challenge to the adequacy of ABA programming at the proposed placements is based on Dr. Solomon's visits to the schools, during which she did not see the staff collect behavioral data or deliver individualized ABA instruction throughout the school day. Nov. 7, 2017 Tr. 87:8-89:5, 181:11-183:4. However, Dr. Solomon's visits did not include observations of how the classrooms would function with A.H. as a student, and there is no indication that any of the students in the classrooms at the time required instructional supports similar to those outlined in A.H.'s IEPs, such as \"1:1 instruction for new skill acquisition\" and \"high frequency reinforcement.\" Thus, Dr. Solomon's observations do not establish that the proposed placements were incapable of implementing the supports and services in A.H.'s IEPs once he enrolled. To the contrary, Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley expressed no doubt that the Autism Programs at Bells Mill and Cabin John had the resources to implement the services and supports mandated by A.H.'s IEPs. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 49:1-9, 216:2-12. They testified that the staff at Bells Mill and Cabin John are trained in ABA, deliver ABA instruction throughout the day, and consistently collect and analyze both behavioral and instructional data. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 65:23-69:12, 196:6-218:21. Thus, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that A.H. was denied a FAPE because the proposed placements do not offer adequate ABA programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the adequacy of the staffing and instructional methods at the proposed placements. Pls.' Mem. 32. Plaintiffs do not argue that the instructional supports outlined in the IEPs are inappropriate, but assert that the proposed placements do not offer the staffing and instructional methods necessary for A.H. to make academic and functional progress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This challenge is based on their observations of classrooms at the proposed placements, during which they saw \"students engaging in independent work, with the adults close by but not actively engaging with the students, as well as group instruction, where no concrete reinforcement was observed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32-33. Plaintiffs assert that A.H. requires more intensive instruction and point out that, at Ivymount, A.H. spends most of his day one-on-one with an instructor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Like their challenge to the adequacy of ABA programming at the proposed placements,\n   Plaintiffs' challenge to the staffing and instructional methods at the placements is based on their observations of how classrooms functioned during their visits - without A.H.'s enrollment or the school's opportunity to comply with his IEPs. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the proposed placements lack the capacity to implement the IEPs if A.H. enrolled. To the contrary, Ms. Garland and Ms. Stanley testified that the proposed placements had the staffing and expertise to implement A.H.'s IEPs and that A.H. would receive an educational benefit at the placements. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 82:6-17, 215:3-216:12. Therefore, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that A.H. was denied a FAPE because the proposed placements do not have adequate staffing and instructional methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs assert that A.H. was denied a FAPE because Cabin John was incapable of properly providing \"academic instruction in the special education setting outside of general education\" as required by the 2017 IEP. Pls.' Mem. 40-43; 2017 IEP 54. In support of this argument, Plaintiffs point out that students in the Autism Program at Cabin John spend five hours a week in electives, such as art and computer class, but Cabin John does not formally offer electives in the special education setting. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 190:5-191:3. Therefore, students in the Autism Program typically attend their electives in the general education setting \"with support.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   244:8-21. If a student is unable to attend electives in the general education setting, Ms. Stanley explained, then they \"work on the same content within the [self-contained] classroom with the special educator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   190:5-191:3, 244:8-21. Plaintiffs assert that A.H. would have been the only student in these self-contained electives and that such \"classes of one\" are inconsistent with the social objectives outlined in his 2017 IEP. Pls.' Mem. 41-42. Therefore, according to Plaintiffs, Cabin John is incapable of implementing A.H.'s 2017 IEP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the Autism Program at Cabin John deviates \"materially\" from the 2017 IEP.\n   <em>\n    Sumter Cty.

However, as other courts have recognized, the failure to implement a material or significant portion of the IEP can amount to a denial of FAPE.\"). By offering the electives in a self-contained classroom with a special educator, Cabin John would comply with the mandate of the 2017 IEP that A.H. receive all \"academic instruction in the special education setting outside of general education.\" 2017 IEP 54. Plaintiffs' assertion that A.H. would have been the only student in self-contained electives at Cabin John is speculative; indeed, Ms. Stanley testified that there was one student last year who attended the self-contained electives. Nov. 15, 2017 Tr. 244:8-21. Moreover, even if A.H. were the only student in self-contained electives, he would still have had opportunities throughout the school day to advance the social objectives in the 2017 IEP, such as during lunch and community outings.
