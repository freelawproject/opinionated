BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The DOC's mission is to protect the public by supervising adult offenders and by directing them to treatment, education, and work programs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The purpose of the educational program is to provide education to offenders without a GED, high school diploma, or vocational training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among the vocational skills taught are culinary skills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Most of the teachers in the prison system are hired and employed by the DOE, but work under a DOE/DOC partnership as detailed in a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MOU describes DOE's responsibilities, e.g., \"ensur[ing] that all educational staff comply with both DOE and DOC rules, regulations and institutional\n   standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding conduct in a security environment and report[ing] violations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stella was hired by the DOE as a prison education teacher responsible for developing and implementing a culinary arts program for DOC inmates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   His employment was governed by an employment contract for a term from January 4, 2016 through June 30, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   He entered a second employment contract with the DOE for a term from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two contracts are identical in relevant part. Each provided the DOE could terminate Stella's employment before its expiration date: (1) pursuant to the provisions of 14\n   <em>\n    Del. C.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 121(a)(5), which provides for dismissal for misconduct in office or willful neglect of duty,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) for any disciplinary action initiated by the DOE, or (3) for any violation of the DOC's policies and procedures, including its \"Code of Conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From January to March 2016, Stella received DOE training to work in a Level 5 prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The topics covered related to working in prison education and review of the DOE Employee Handbook, DOE/DOC Collaboration (including \"Chain of Command\"), and DOE/DOC communications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   His signed acknowledgment affirmed he completed this training, understood its relevance to his work plan, and would clarify any questions with his Teacher/Supervisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   From January 4, 2016 to March 14, 2016, Stella also received DOC Correctional Employee Initial Training (\"CEIT\") to prepare for working in a Level 5 prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   CEIT covered topics including the DOC Code of Conduct and Press Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 1.4 of the DOC's Employee Code of Conduct states: \"[s]taff shall be courteous while interacting with any person, discharge their duties in a fair, impartial manner, and recognize their responsibilities as public employees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1.5 lists examples of \"unbecoming staff conduct,\" including: dissemination of confidential information contrary to DOC policy or procedures, any conduct that would interfere with the staff member's ability or\n   fitness to effectively perform required duties, and violation of any DOC policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DOC Policy Number 10.3, \"Communications and Community Relations,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Chief of Media Relations (CMR) will be the central contact for all news media and public inquiries.

Vaughn Correctional Center (\"JTVCC\") and rotated every month to a different correctional institution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   This rotation caused Stella to miss routine training exercises that reinforced DOC and DOE policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 18, 2016, Warden sent Stella an e-mail containing the \"communication policy we discussed\" that stated \"[a]ll official communications concerning the prison education program must first go through/be approved by the teacher supervisor. This includes, email, phone calls, letters, and personal communications with DOC and DOE administration and outside agencies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 19, 2016, Stella sent an e-mail to Michael Grossman, DOE Education Associate, Adult &amp; Prison Education Resources, seeking information on a teaching certification process and stating \"I'm trying hard to lean the whole 'chain of command' thing since I've spent my entire career in the private sector. If I wrote to you in error please let me know.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 18, 2016, Warden sent Grossman and DOE Teacher Supervisor Kristi King an e-mail stating \"[i]f I did not print [the communication policy] for [Stella] I know I verbally informed him of this policy when he took it upon himself to contact [the individual] who oversees food services here, and when he was talking\n   about contacting the Commissioner directly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Grossman responded \"we need to work through this and move forward, assuring he clearly understands for each site, in writing would help.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   King replied to Grossman and Warden that she spoke to Stella that morning about the need to follow the chain of command and that he received her instructions well and understood them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 3, 2017, Warden sent Stella an e-mail telling him to \"remember DOC's chain of command,\" in response to his request to use a DOC locker for his personal items.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Warden suggested the request should come through her, rather than going directly to DOC personnel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On February 1, 2017, Stella was teaching at JTVCC during his normal rotation when Building C of the facility was subject to an inmate takeover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella was in the separate Education Building with twelve inmates preparing to finish his class when an audible Code One signaled an attack on a correctional officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite confusion in the hallways, Stella closed his classroom door and continued teaching because he had not been instructed to leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, the prison was placed on lock down and he was escorted from the classroom to a training room with other staff and correctional officers where he learned the prison was subject to an inmate takeover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was internet access through computers in the training room and Stella contacted his wife to let her know he was in no immediate danger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Communications with the inmates, including threats to kill a hostage, were audible over correctional officers' radios which made Stella feel sick and he distanced himself from the radios.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   After about three hours, Stella and the others were moved to a visiting room, where they continued to hear inmate negotiations but were allowed to walk around more freely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   After approximately five hours of confinement in the two rooms, they were released to leave JTVCC around 6:00 p.m. that evening.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hostage crisis ended shortly after 5:00 a.m. the next morning when a prison Response Team gained access to Building C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Stella immediately drove from JTVCC and pulled over and parked at his first opportunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, he was overcome by emotions; his hands were shaking and he began to cry as he called his wife, who was\n   in California at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   He regained composure after the call and resumed driving home when he received a call from a number he did not recognize.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The caller said, \"Anthony, are you okay?\" to which he responded, \"Who is this?,\" and was told, \"Esteban.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella then recognized the caller as a reporter he was acquainted with from the News Journal, Esteban Parra (\"Parra\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   He remembers the call, but nothing about the conversation or what occurred from the time he left the prison until arriving home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The News Journal published an article at 10:15 p.m. February 1, 2017 identifying Stella as a DOE employee and culinary instructor at JTVCC and reported his observations while in lock down at the prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the conversation, Stella was not aware an article recounting his experiences would be published and did not know what information was public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After returning home that night, Stella could not sleep and called his wife who suggested he write down his experiences as a cathartic mechanism to deal with the stressful events of the day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following that suggestion, he wrote out his thoughts and posted them on his Facebook page around 11:00 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella testified he had developed positive relationships with some of his student-inmates and was bothered by what he perceived as the media's generalization of inmates as \"bad.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   That over-generalization was part of the reason him wrote and published his thoughts on the incident on Facebook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was unequivocal, however, that the only reason for his actions was as a coping mechanism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time he went to bed, Stella knew the riot was ongoing and had \"no idea\" when it would be resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Stella estimates he had around 800 friends on Facebook at the time of his post, including at least one reporter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   His post praised DOC and DOE officials, as well as inmates he worked with:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I was also honored to spend close to three months in the correction officers' academy CEIT 212, and I have come to consider each and every correction officer a colleague and a friend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The [DOE] and the [DOC] both care for the wellbeing of those that entrust us for their safety and rehabilitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The hard working people for the [DOC] do all that they can to be respectful, and of course there are exceptions, but these people are good people-people who work hard to provide for their families and who provide a great service to the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The people who work for the [DOE] also work tirelessly to help the inmate/students who desire to have a better life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Don't believe for a minute that we mistreat prisoners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I also know that the good people at DOC and the inmates who I have had the pleasure to know will protect me.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The post also expressed negative descriptions of other inmates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The inmates who sieged Building C and put our colleagues in great peril today are not the inmates that we teach. These inmates claim that they are fighting for their rights-they claim they want education-they claim they want to be treated fairly. To that I say bullshit! The inmates from Building C are among the worst off the worst. They wear yellow jump suits and they are not permitted to walk freely as are the inmates who wear white-the same ones who I teach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   And they wonder why they are treated this way. Well don't for a minute believe their cries for help and in justice. These are men who have not decency-men who think nothing of taking a life-men who think only of themselves. These men should not receive any rights as they are always ready to take someone else's right away from them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Timothy Magee (\"Magee\"), a fellow prison educator and Facebook friend, saw Stella's post around 6:00 a.m. February 2, 2017 and was \"shocked\" by its negative description of some inmates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not knowing if the prison takeover was ongoing, and believing the post potentially put hostages in more danger if read by or quoted to the inmates, Magee texted Stella advising him to take the post down.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   After approximately twenty to thirty minutes of back-and-forth texting, Stella did so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the interim, Magee took screen shots of the inflammatory portions of Stella's Facebook post and texted them to Warden because, at that point, Stella had not taken the post down.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   After receiving Magee's screen shots, Warden contacted Stella and instructed him to remove the post, to which he responded he had done so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Warden also sent the screen shots to her supervisor, Maureen Whelan (\"Whelan\"), State Director for Adult and Prison Education Resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Stella testified he submitted the Facebook post as an editorial via the online portal on delawareonline.com sometime prior to 10:39 p.m. on February 1, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Within minutes, Stella communicated with Parra about the submission which he attached to his e-mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parra immediately responded that he would \"see about attaching this to the story so people can read\n   it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   After his exchange with Magee the following morning, Stella was \"frantic\" and attempted to reach Parra to implore him to prevent publication of his letter to the editor and relay that he was \"not allow[ed] to comment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parra immediately responded, \"I'll let them know. Did you send it to the opinion page, as well?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella replied, \"Yes[.] I will be in deep trouble if its published[.] Thank you[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears Stella's editorial (identical to his Facebook post) was never published, although he could not recall if or how he confirmed this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For several weeks following the hostage crisis, teachers in prison education were not permitted to return to JTVCC as the facility was still in emergency operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 10, 2017, Whelan contacted Christopher Klein (\"Klein\"), then DOC Bureau Chief of Prisons, advising that the DOE intended to interview Stella regarding a violation of the DOE's communication policies, and asking if the DOC had concerns about Stella's re-entry to the prison and whether it wished to be involved in the interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Klein responded that the \"DOC does have significant concern based on the information,\" but declined to participate in the investigation due to time and resource limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   He suggested the DOE follow its internal processes for handling the matter, but emphasized Stella should understand the DOC reserved the right to revoke his security clearance regardless of any action the DOE might take.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On February 20, 2017, DOE Human Resource Officer Jeanette Hammon (\"Hammon\") notified Stella by letter that the DOE had initiated an investigation of his actions on February 1, 2017, stating that he was prohibited from entering any DOC facility during its pendency and that he would be notified of the investigation's final outcome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hammon conducted the investigation, which included interviewing Stella, with Grossman and Warden present, to determine if Stella spoke to the media and whether the Facebook post was his.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hammon also spoke to Warden and King, and collected relevant documents including: screen shots of the Facebook post, the News Journal article, applicable DOE and DOC policies, the MOU, and letters written by Stella or submitted on his behalf;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   all of which she provided to Bunting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following her investigation and consultation with DOE legal counsel, the decision was made to proceed with an intent to terminate letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 15, 2017, that letter was hand-delivered to Stella during a meeting with Hammon and Whelan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   It stated the DOE intended to terminate him \"for misconduct in office and willful neglect of duty,\" specifically, \"the DOE's investigation revealed that you violated the DOE's External Communication policy 8.11, Department of Correction (DOC) Public Information, Media and Community Relations policy 10.3, DOE Employment Philosophy, and the DOC Code of Conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   It advised a pre-termination meeting would be held on March 24, 2017, during which Stella would have the opportunity to present any mitigating or extenuating circumstances and work history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   That meeting was held before Bunting, with Whelan, Hammon, Stella and his wife in attendance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bunting reviewed pertinent documents prior to the meeting, including Stella's employment contract, applicable DOE and DOC policies, and training records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point before making her final decision, Bunting also reviewed Stella's Facebook post and the News Journal article.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Stella and his wife read from prepared remarks during the meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his defense, Stella stated he was under a great deal of stress on the day of the riot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also offered that, due to his rotation among correctional facilities, he was not able to participate in \"drills\" or attend all monthly department staff meetings at JTVCC where departmental policies, including press policies, were reinforced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also suggested that DOC officials who released him and the other employees following the hostage crisis should have \"simply remind[ed] us about not communicating with the press, similar to how a judge always instructs a jury just before they would be dismissed for the day.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella asserted he did not believe he disclosed anything \"newsworthy\" when he spoke with Parra because anyone monitoring police and fire band transmissions \"knew more about what was going on than I did.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also believed that, in light of comments by his trainers and inmates, and a March 19, 2017 News Journal article reporting a \"gross lack of security\" at Delaware's Level 5 facilities, his \"comments could not have made anyone less safe than was already the case prior to the siege.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Following the pre-termination meeting, Bunting reviewed the documentation she had, consulted with Hammon about Stella's work history and applicable policies, consulted with legal counsel, and made the decision to terminate Stella.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bunting documented\n   her reasons for the decision in an April 4, 2017 letter, which was hand-delivered to Stella on that date.\n   <footnotemark>\n

The Facebook post made no comment about any conditions inside JTVCC\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the February 1 incident and, other than relaying his observations\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   that date, provided no information about any \"conditions\" or \"issues,\" to be \"brought to light.\" Paragraph 65 is an unsupported assertion. Nothing is explained, fully or otherwise, that provides support for the allegation that Stella was terminated \"for speaking out about the conditions inside JTVCC.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Stella also suggests the News Journal's interest in his experiences demonstrates he was speaking on a matter of public concern. The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court first notes Stella asserted his comments contained only information already in the public domain, and that when he made them, \"[he] didn't think for a minute that anything [he] said was newsworthy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   Media publicity does not establish the covered speech is a matter is of public concern for First Amendment purposes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the Third Circuit has stated where \"local news media's assessment that the communication is newsworthy, 'entirely different considerations ... come into play.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   Media interest, therefore, is but one consideration taken into account in making a public concern determination. In\n   <em>\n    Roseman\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit made the threshold determination that the employee's speech did not implicate a matter of public concern and then made the statement about newsworthiness in\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   court concluded letters\n   to the tax commissioner\n   <em>\n    criticizing\n   </em>\n   management of the tax division concerned matters of public import, a conclusion \"\n   <em>\n    supported by\n   </em>\n   the fact that the issues raised in the letters were deemed important enough to be the subject of at least two radio broadcasts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Stella provides no compelling support for the proposition that his speech was a matter of public concern based on its newsworthiness. The sole case he affirmatively relies on,\n   <em>\n    Bailor\n   </em>\n   , is only analogous to the extent that a state employee's speech related to a prison riot at a DOC facility. The\n   <em>\n    Bailor\n   </em>\n   plaintiff filed a report containing allegations that certain correctional officers used excessive force against inmates during a riot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agreed the plaintiff's speech was a matter of public concern and the court only addressed the balancing step of the First Amendment inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Stella's speech did not bring to light any alleged improprieties by government employees during the February 1 riot; it merely recounted his experiences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The court also rejects Stella's comparison of his speech to the\n   <em>\n    Watters\n   </em>\n   plaintiff who was solicited by a newspaper reporter \"presumably because ... [his observations] touched upon issues of 'political, social, or other' concern to the community.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, a reporter approached the plaintiff with questions about the Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") for the Philadelphia Police Department and published an article quoting his comments criticizing certain aspects of the EAP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff was terminated days later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court stated the plaintiff spoke to the reporter \"about the grave problems he perceived in operating the EAP without a written policy statement,\" the content of which appeared on its face \"to address a matter of significant public concern.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, there was \"ample evidence in the record that the existence of an effective EAP had been a matter of public interest for some time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found the content of the plaintiff's speech was \"precisely the kind of issue that a citizen of Philadelphia is likely to find of the utmost importance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statements Stella shared with the News Journal reporter are not comparable. Stella acknowledges the article reported nothing more than his experiences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   No criticism was made regarding the actions of any government employee, facility procedures, treatment of Stella and other staff during the lock down, or otherwise touching on a matter of public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Media interest in Stella's experiences does not change that conclusion. Public interest in a topic does not necessarily equate with a matter of public concern for First Amendment purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Speech by a public employee \"as a citizen upon matters of public concern\" is distinguished from speech by \"an employee upon matters of only personal interest\" for which, \"absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Arndt v.

Based on the record as a whole, the court determines that content supports the conclusion that Stella's speech relates to matters of personal, not public, concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The fact that he felt the need to respond to the News Journal reporter and post his thoughts on Facebook, while shaken from his experience on the drive home or due to the need to cope with the resulting stress later that night, does not transform his speech into a matter of public concern. Therefore, the context and form of his speech do not lead the court to the find that his speech was on a matter of public concern for First Amendment purposes, and do not overcome the determination that its content reflected personal, rather than public, concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Based on this conclusion, it is not necessary to proceed to a balancing analysis: \"in order to merit Pickering balancing, a public employee's speech must touch on a matter of 'public concern.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count I is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Qualified Immunity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Individual Defendants separately argue that, as governmental employees, they are entitled to qualified immunity from Stella's First Amendment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   Qualified immunity \" 'shield[s] [government actors] from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]hether [a government official] made a reasonable mistake of law and is thus entitled to qualified immunity is a question of law that is properly answered by the court, not a jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Because qualified immunity is 'an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability ... it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The qualified immunity analysis involves two inquiries.

The FAC alleges defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \"by falsifying reasons for terminating [Stella] from his position as a prison education teacher.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    273\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella maintains \"[t]he Delaware Superior Court has held that an employee must show the employer intentionally\n   <em>\n    created false reasons\n   </em>\n   to terminate his employment\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   otherwise that the employer intentionally falsified [his] employment records\" to support an implied covenant claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    274\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella concludes, therefore, that he \"does not have to prove Defendants actually falsified the employment records relating to his termination.\n   <em>\n    He only has to show the employer intentionally created false reasons to terminate his employment.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    275\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella contends defendant's false reason for his termination was that his actions created a safety risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    276\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The court disagrees with the implication Stella draws from the\n   <em>\n    Cosby\n   </em>\n   opinion as to what must be shown to support his claim. The specific part of the sentence reciting the intentional creation of \"false reasons to terminate\" cites the section of\n   <em>\n    Pressman\n   </em>\n   that stated the nature of \"employment relationships counsels caution about creating causes of action based solely on personal motivations,\" but described evidence showing the employee's former supervisor \"set out on a campaign to discredit [the employee] by\n   <em>\n    creating fictitious negative information\n   </em>\n   about [the employee's] work and hiding positive information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    277\n   </footnotemark>\n   That campaign included misrepresentations creating the appearance that the employee did not complete tasks, editing a progress report to understate his accomplishments, and failing to pass along a progress report showing significant accomplishments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    278\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the falsification of the employee's record leading to termination was the issue, not an allegedly false reason for that termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Cosby\n   </em>\n   court specified that \"to maintain a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, [the employee] must demonstrate evidence that [the defendant]\n   <em>\n    manufactured\n   </em>\n   grounds for dismissal. This requires a showing that the employer actually created false grounds for firing an employee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    279\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cosby\n   </em>\n   cited opinions by the Third Circuit and this court in support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    280\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Third Circuit determined \"[i]f the employer did not actually falsify or manipulate employment records, then it does not matter if the employer gave a\n   <em>\n    false rationale\n   </em>\n   for termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    281\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, this court stated \"employers are only culpable for the\n   <em>\n    manufacture\n   </em>\n   of grounds for dismissal, not for the statement of a false reason for dismissal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    282\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , this court reemphasized\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Pressman\n   </em>\n   only held culpable the\n   <em>\n    manufacture\n   </em>\n   of grounds for dismissal, not the\n   <em>\n    statement\n   </em>\n   of a false reason for dismissal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    283\n   </footnotemark>\n   In yet another case mentioned in Stella's brief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    284\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Delaware Supreme Court stated a plaintiff has \"the burden to prove ... the falsification\n   <em>\n    of her records\n   </em>\n   \" to support an allegation that those records were \"falsified or manipulated ... to create a fictitious ground\" for termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    285\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Thus, precedent does not support Stella's position that an allegedly false reason for dismissal is sufficient to support a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    286\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Delaware Superior Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Layfield v. Beebe Medical Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    287\n   </footnotemark>\n   is factually similar to this case. The\n   <em>\n    Layfield\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, a nurse, made documentation errors in violation of hospital policies and was terminated based on the defendant's resulting loss of confidence in her nursing abilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    288\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff alleged she was fired based on jealousy and resentment, and that the defendant manipulated her record to justify it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    289\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted summary judgment for the defendant where the record showed the plaintiff admitted to several errors in violation of hospital policy, and that the explanation she alleged as the real reason for her termination could not show a violation of the implied covenant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    290\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Here, Stella does not argue the evidence his termination was based upon, i.e., screen shots of his Facebook page and statements attributed to him in the News Journal article, was false or\n   manufactured. He simply argues the reason given for his termination, that his actions created a safety risk, is false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    291\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the pre-termination and termination letters cannot be the basis for his implied covenant claim because they merely memorialize defendants' reasons for his termination: \"misconduct in office and willful neglect of duty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    292\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those letters note safety concerns as a result of Stella's actions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    293\n   </footnotemark>\n   but, even if those concerns were false, they are not a false manipulation of his record upon which his termination was based. Likewise, even accepting Stella's testimony that the real reason he was fired was because Warden was \"pissed off\" and \"insecure\" about Stella's breakfast meeting and friendship with Coupe,\n   <footnotemark>\n    294\n   </footnotemark>\n   his claim fails. \"Dislike, hatred or ill will, alone, cannot be the basis for a cause of action for termination of an at-will employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    295\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count III is granted for failure to show his termination was based on \"false and fictitious grounds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
