Luu initiated this action against Defendants Kevin Esterly and the Lehigh Valley Academy Regional Charter School (LVA), regarding an allegedly inappropriate relationship between Esterly and A.Y., Luu's minor daughter. Luu asserts six claims against Esterly and LVA, of which three are against LVA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   LVA filed a motion to dismiss. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Luu is the mother of two children: a boy and a girl. Am. Compl. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 11. Luu and her children met Esterly, his wife, and their daughters at the Heritage Baptist Church in 2009. Am. Compl. \u00b6 16. Luu's daughter, A.Y., became friends with Esterly's oldest daughter. Am. Compl. \u00b6 18. Eventually, A.Y. and Esterly developed a relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2017, Esterly changed, or caused to be changed, the emergency contact form for A.Y. at LVA and listed himself as A.Y.'s stepfather. Am. Compl. \u00b6 33. Previously, the emergency contact form only listed Luu and a family friend. Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. LVA failed to verify the\n   change in the contact form with Luu and did not verify the change against the unchanged contact information for Luu's son, who also attended LVA. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 9, 2018, Luu attempted to pick up A.Y. from LVA but a school representative told her that Esterly previously picked her up. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. This was the first time LVA informed Luu that A.Y.'s emergency contact form listed Esterly as stepfather and that he signed her out of school on ten prior occasions. Am. Compl. \u00b6 42. Luu confronted Esterly about picking up her daughter and inappropriate text messages he sent to her daughter. Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. Luu also instructed LVA not to release A.Y. or her son to any person except her. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. A few days later, Luu returned to LVA and discussed her concerns about Esterly and her daughter with the principal of LVA. Am. Compl. \u00b6 47. The principal and Luu discussed contacting the police and applying for a protection from abuse order. Am. Compl. \u00b6 48. They ended up contacting the Special Victims Unit regarding the situation. Am. Compl. \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 5, 2018, around 7:05 a.m., Luu dropped A.Y. off at the bus stop. Am. Compl. \u00b6 56. The bus was scheduled to pick up students at 7:09 a.m. Am. Compl. \u00b6 56. A.Y. never made it to LVA. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-60. LVA did not notify Luu of A.Y.'s absence and Luu only became aware that A.Y. was missing when she did not arrive home from school. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-62. Failing to notify Luu that her daughter was absent violated a written policy or custom which dictated that parents would be made aware when their children were absent from school. Am. Compl. \u00b6 13. It was later determined that Esterly picked up A.Y., drove her to the Philadelphia International Airport, purchased one-way tickets for the pair to Cancun, Mexico, and took her out of the country.

Accepting the allegations of the amended complaint as true, LVA was aware of the change to the emergency contact form, but not that it was incorrect. LVA further failed to verify the change in the contact information with Luu or against the contact information for Luu's son. Then, LVA allowed Esterly to sign A.Y. out of school on ten occasions between November 2017 and February 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After LVA learned of the improper and incorrect change to the emergency contact form the school did not release A.Y. to Esterly again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In March 2018, without any school involvement, Esterly picked up A.Y. and took her out of the country.

Luu simply reiterates the facts of the case and argues that LVA's actions created a situation that destroyed her relationship with her daughter. However, Luu offers no basis to conclude that LVA's actions or inactions were so severe as to shock the conscious. While unfortunate, taking these allegations as true and drawing reasonable inferences therefrom, the amended complaint does not sufficiently allege facts that LVA was deliberately indifferent.
