Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case concerns two competing car share services with similar names. On April 17, 2017, AAA issued a press release announcing the launch of its \"GIG\" car share service. GM also developed a car share service called \"MAVEN GIG,\" which AAA asserts AAA did not learn about until May 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 1. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to AAA, the Court discusses the two car share services below. The Court starts with AAA's GIG car share service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. AAA's GIG Car Share Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016, AAA created its subsidiary, A3 Mobility, to focus on a new business model innovation for AAA.

In September 2016, A3 Mobility began developing an idea for a car share service, and AAA drafted a business case to present to its executives that identified April 2017 as the launch date. Haight Decl. \u00b6 8; Hetke Tr. at 46:6-18, 53:19-54:3, 106:5-12; 138:17-23.

Haight Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-12; Hetke Tr. at 79:20-80:25. Soon after, AAA learned that [redacted] was covered by a preexisting third party trademark application, and therefore AAA abandoned [redacted] and proceeded with \"GIG\" (the acronym of \"Get In. Go.\"), a mark that AAA's Chief Innovation Officer, Mike Hetke, came up with during a January 27, 2017 meeting.

GM's MAVEN GIG Car Share Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    a. GM's \"Maven\" Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Maven is an affiliate of GM that provides vehicle-sharing services under its \"Maven\" mark. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl\") \u00b6 29. GM developed its \"Maven\" mark in January of 2016. GM offers rental services through Maven that are labeled with the word \"Maven\" and another identifying word. For instance, GM offers rental services targeted toward personal use called \"MAVEN HOME\" and \"MAVEN CITY\" under its Maven mark. Bowler Decl., Ex. 8 (\"Bhattacharya Tr.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 33:11-12;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 9 (\"Stooke Tr.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 26:21-28:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    b. GM's EXPRESS DRIVE Relationship with Lyft\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Around the same time that GM developed its Maven mark, GM had a program with Lyft called \"EXPRESS DRIVE\" for the use of GM vehicles in providing Lyft services. Bhattacharya Tr. at 33:19-34:8; Bowler Decl., Ex. 8 (\"Steyn Tr.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 20:11-25:9. Specifically, EXPRESS DRIVE is a program branded by Lyft whereby Lyft \"offers cars through their partners, like Maven to the drivers exclusively for them to earn money on the Lyft platform.\" Steyn Tr. at 21:9-12. In other words, Lyft serves as the direct contact to the drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:21-25, 52:18-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before the fall of 2016, however, GM's relationship with Lyft and EXPRESS DRIVE became strained due to unprofitability and unaligned incentives. Bhattacharya Tr. at 50:10-51:6; Steyn Tr. at 24:16-25:10; 53:18-23. In particular, GM wanted direct contact with the drivers. Steyn Tr. at 53:18-23. Therefore, in the\n   summer of 2016, GM began exploring an alternative \"platform-agnostic\" model where GM would maintain a direct relationship with drivers regardless of the business partnership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Stooke Tr. at 37:13-38:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    c. GM Brainstorms the MAVEN GIG Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   GM came up with the MAVEN GIG mark idea in early August 2016, when a team of GM employees brainstormed names for a car rental service for individuals to drive for companies like Uber or Lyft, who do not own cars or do not want to use their own cars for commercial purposes. ECF No. 75-1 (\"Bhattacharya Decl.\") \u00b6 4; Stooke Tr. at 46:3-5, 48:8-22; Adkisson Decl., Ex. 2 (\"5th Resp. to AAA's 1st Interrogs.\") at 3-5. The name was based on research by Megan Stooke, the Chief Marketing Officer for Maven Drive, regarding the phrase \"gig economy,\" which is used to describe the trend in the labor market for short-term, freelance work, such as working as a driver for one of the app-based services. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Stooke Tr. at 48:8-22. From that research, the team shared the MAVEN GIG name with GM's advertising agency, Dentsu Aegis Network, on August 8, 2016. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Adkisson Decl., Ex. 5. Management approved the MAVEN GIG mark in mid-September 2016. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. GM employees confirmed that the purpose of the MAVEN GIG service was for GM to have a direct relationship with drivers and to have an agnostic platform where drivers could drive for any ride share or delivery business. Strooke Tr. at 38:10-18; Steyn Tr. at 53:18-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    d. GM Communicates with Potential Business Partners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before GM's formal approval of the MAVEN GIG mark, GM used the mark in a few instances to discuss potential partnerships with other businesses. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6 10. For instance, GM emailed Amazon twice in August and September 2016, to propose a partnership based on the MAVEN GIG service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Adkisson Decl., Ex. 7 (\"8/29/16 Email to Amazon\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 8 (\"9/28/16 Email to Amazon\") (\"For Maven Gig ... [A] Gig partnership with Amazon wouldn't be a fleet dedicated to Amazon; the concept of Gig is that rideshare drivers can use our car to drive for multiple platforms.\"); Stooke Tr. 80:14-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 8, 2016, GM participated in a live WebEx meeting with Uber during which GM proposed a business partnership with Uber. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6 13. As part of that WebEx meeting, GM emailed Uber a slideshow titled \"Maven Gig\" (file name \"Maven-Gig-Overview_Uber.pdf\") that explained the MAVEN GIG service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Adkisson Decl., Ex. 9 (\"9/8/16 Email to Uber\"). The slideshow bore both the Maven mark as well as the MAVEN GIG mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In September and November 2016, GM also discussed and presented written materials about the MAVEN GIG service with an individual name Moshe Cohen from Gravity Technologies as well as the grocery delivery company Instacart. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; Stooke Tr. 81:5-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Adkisson Decl., Ex. 10 (\"9/2016 Emails with Gravity Technologies\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 12 (\"11/2016 Instacart Maven Gig Presentation\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 11 (\"11/30/16 Instacart Maven Gig Workflow Presentation\"). The Instacart presentation predominantly displayed the Maven mark, but also displayed the MAVEN GIG mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/2016 Instacart Maven Gig Presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    e. GM's Pilot Program Partnership with Uber\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Both parties agree that GM entered into a partnership with Uber to rent cars directly to Uber drivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 3; Opp'n at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bhattacharya Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17. However, GM paints the partnership as the \"first business partnership for the MAVEN GIG service,\" while AAA emphasizes that this was merely a pilot program.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 3-6,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The evidence reflects that GM and Uber entered into a three-month \"Pilot Agreement\" executed on October 31, 2016, that made Uber a rideshare partner. Steyn Tr.at 52:1-18, 97:8-19, 99:22-100:25;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 11 (\"Pilot Agreement\"); Stooke Tr. 39:6-41:3; Bhattacharya Tr. at 53:2-15. Although the Pilot Agreement mentioned Uber and Maven, it did not mention MAVEN GIG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pilot Agreement. The Pilot Agreement provided that Uber had exclusive responsibility to \"conduct email marketing of the Program to existing and potential Uber Driver Partners,\" and that the parties would jointly distribute a press release announcing the launch of the program. Pilot Agreement at GM18110 &amp; GM18121; Steyn Tr. at 103:1-104:22; Bhattacharya Tr. at 26:24-25, 144:15-145:25. The press release went out on November 1, 2016; however, the press release mentioned Uber and Maven but did not mention MAVEN GIG. Bowler Decl., Ex. 12 (\"11/1/16 Press Release\"); Steyn Tr. at 105:10-107:8; Bhattacharya Tr. at 148:11-150:6. Indeed, GM employees later clarified that this was because GM technically never had a co-marketing agreement with Uber on MAVEN GIG. Bhattacharya Tr. at 255:4-18; Bowler Decl., Ex. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   AAA points to evidence in the record demonstrating that GM may have sought to purposefully conceal the MAVEN GIG mark during its pilot with Uber. For instance, the record demonstrates that GM was particularly sensitive about the Lyft EXPRESS DRIVE partnership, so GM wanted to get \"Express Drive unwound\" before they got \"[MAVEN GIG] up and running,\" especially because GM had not given Lyft formal notice that GM was exiting EXPRESS DRIVE and especially given the fact that Lyft and Uber were competitors. Steyn Tr. at 55:21-57:25, 89:20-90:20; Bhattacharya Tr. at 148:13-151:4 (\"[W]e knew the entire conversation would be about Uber and Lyft, in any case, and that the message we wanted to tell would get lost.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bowler Decl., Ex. 15. Moreover, GM wanted MAVEN GIG to be a platform-agnostic, multi-partner product, and knew that if GM \"tried to message extensively about the platform agnostic aspects of [MAVEN GIG], the fact that [GM] only had one-co-marketing partner to begin with didn't look great with that.\" Bhattacharya Tr. at 150:13-151:4. Therefore, GM did not have a marketing campaign or intend to market MAVEN GIG until it had other partners besides Uber, which the evidence in the record suggests did not occur until May of 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:4-60:8, 156:1-158:18, 214:8-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bowler Decl., Ex. 16. Thus, the MAVEN GIG mark is not mentioned in the media talking points or the official communications plan regarding the Uber pilot. Steyn Tr. at 110:21-112:24; Bowler Decl., Ex. 16 (\"Media Briefing Talking Points\"); Bhattacharya Tr. at 152:12-155:25; Bowler Decl., Ex. 18 (\"Communications Plan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The car share service rental became available to Uber drivers in San Francisco on November 1, 2016. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6 18; ECF No. 75-2 (\"Jaising Decl.\") \u00b6 5. That same day, as part of the Pilot Agreement, Uber contacted drivers through a sign-up email to promote the car share service and to explain how to rent a car. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6 19; Jaising Decl. \u00b6 6. The sign-up email from Uber mentioned Uber and Maven but did not mention MAVEN GIG.

Specifically, the sign-up email stated: \"We've teamed up with Maven.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uber Driver\n   Email. The Uber sign-up email contained a hyperlink that led to the landing page at www.mavendrive.com/gig, and an enrollment website at www.mavendrive.com/gig/#!enroll (\"Enrollment Website\"), which directed customers to complete a four-part enrollment form to create an account, provide personal and credit card information, and schedule an appointment to rent a car.

Specifically, GM cites to evidence in the record that GM used the mark in a few emails to: (1) confirm that customers were interested in GM's \"Maven Gig program\" (as opposed to GM's other services under Maven); (2) advise customers that their inquiry would be forwarded to GM's \"Maven Gig\" team; and (3) provide information about the MAVEN GIG service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Adkisson Decl., Ex. 21 (email dated 2/22/2017);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 22 (emails dated 1/5/2017-1/6/2017);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 23 (email dated 2/8/2017);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 24 (email dated 3/15/2017). Nonetheless, GM's emails in response to customer inquiries also frequently used the Maven mark. For instance, GM sent the emails from a Maven email address, such as memberservices@maven.com; GM signed the emails \"Maven Member Services\"; and GM's emails displayed a prominent Maven mark.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Adkisson Decl., Exs. 21 &amp; 23. Further, several of GM's emails referred to the service inconsistently, including \"[o]ur program with Uber,\" \"[o]ur Uber program,\" \"[o]ur partnership with Uber.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 21;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Additionally, GM cites to evidence showing that GM replied to two customer emails with questions about the car share service by attaching a slide presentation dated January 31, 2017 with the file name \"Maven Gig Uber Pilot Highlights.pdf\" that displayed the MAVEN GIG mark. Jaising Decl. \u00b6 17; Adkisson Decl., Ex. 21 (email dated 2/22/2017 attaching PDF);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 29 (email dated 3/2/2017 attaching PDF).

Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Bhattacharya Tr. at 47:9-49:7.

Both parties agree that AAA first used its GIG mark on April 17, 2017. Accordingly, GM must establish that there is no genuine dispute that GM made use of the MAVEN GIG mark prior to April 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   GM contends that there is no genuine dispute on priority of use for two reasons. First, GM argues that GM has made\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   trademark use of the MAVEN GIG mark in commerce by selling and rendering its car share service under the MAVEN GIG mark.

Otter Prods., LLC\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Macy's Inc. v. Strategic Marks, LLC\n   </em>\n   , are distinguishable. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Seal Shield, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the court found prior use where plaintiff \"sold 382 units of its protective Kindle 2 case\n   with the designation 'Life Proof'\n   <em>\n    affixed\n   </em>\n   to the packaging.\" 13-cv-2736-CAB (NLS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2011350295\">\n    2014 WL 11350295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 4, 2014) (emphasis added). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Macy's Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court found use in commerce when there was \"no real question that Macy's offers products displaying the disputed trademark for commercial sale on its website.\" 15-0612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20374147\">\n    2016 WL 374147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 2016). In both of these cases, the sales could constitute actual use because the mark was attached to or displayed with a good that was, in turn, sold. Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Seal Shield, LLC\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Macy's Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the mark was simply affixed to the package or product itself, the mark at issue in the instant case is associated with a service, not a product, so the mark cannot directly be \"affixed\" to the service. There can, however, be use in connection with the sale of the service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brookfield Commc'ns Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1051\">\n    174 F.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that for actual sales to be relevant, the mark must have been \"used in conjunction with the actual sale of goods or services\" in a public manner that \"creates an association among consumers between the mark and the mark's owner.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Perhaps recognizing that it cannot rely only on the sale in the same way as the parties in\n   <em>\n    Seal Shield, LLC\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Macy's Inc.\n   </em>\n   , GM points to the following evidence from the car share service enrollment and reservation process during the Uber pilot program in an attempt to demonstrate that GM used the MAVEN GIG mark \"publicly and repeatedly in connection with its\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   sales between November 1, 2016, and April 17, 2017\": (1) the statement next to the check box on the Enrollment Website that said \"I agree to Maven Gig's Lease Agreement and Privacy Statement\" before being able to proceed; (2) the reservation confirmation and reservation update emails that stated \"Welcome to Maven Gig!\" and instructed customers to let the parking attendant know \"you are looking for Maven Gig\" when picking up the rental car;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) other email correspondence with customers; and (4) the January 31, 2017 update to the Maven Website that allowed people to make reservations on the \"Maven Gig\" tab.

The Court then addresses AAA's arguments regarding GM's use, including evidence that GM purposefully hid the MAVEN GIG mark. Ultimately, the Court concludes that despite GM's insistence that its sales numbers and revenue constitute evidence of priority, the MAVEN GIG mark was not sufficiently used in conjunction with the actual sale of the car share service in a public manner so as to create an association among consumers between the MAVEN GIG mark and the car share service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Before doing so, however, the Court finds it useful to briefly discuss GM's pilot program with Uber because all of the evidence GM cites arises from this pilot program. GM and Uber entered into a three-month Pilot Agreement executed on October 31, 2016, that made Uber a rideshare partner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pilot Agreement; Steyn Tr.at 52:1-18, 97:8-19, 99:22-100:25; Stooke Tr. at 39:6-41:3; Bhattacharya Tr. at 53:2-15. That Pilot Agreement only mentioned Uber and Maven and did not mention MAVEN GIG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pilot Agreement. GM employees clarified that this was because GM technically never had a co-marketing agreement with Uber on MAVEN GIG. Bhattacharya Tr. at 255:4-18; Bowler Decl., Ex. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The evidence shows that when GM developed MAVEN GIG, GM wanted MAVEN GIG to be a platform-agnostic, multi-partner product. However, when GM entered into its pilot program with Uber, Uber was GM's only partner. The evidence shows that GM recognized that having only one partner would be inconsistent with its platform-agnostic goals for MAVEN GIG. Bhattacharya Tr. at 150:13-151:4 (explaining that GM knew that if it \"tried to message extensively about the platform agnostic aspects of [MAVEN GIG], the fact that [GM] only had one-co-marketing partner to begin with didn't look great with that.\"); Bowler Decl., Ex. 16 (11/1/2016 email from Rachel Bhattacharya, Director of Global Innovation at GM stating \"Maven and Uber jointly answered questions to the press at 3 pm ahead of the formal release. Emails to the drivers go out today. It is simply being marketed as 'a pilot program with Maven and Uber;' we aren't using the GIG name publicly until later this year ... when we have more partners on board.\"). Therefore, GM did not have a marketing campaign or intend to market MAVEN GIG until it had partners other than Uber. Bhattacharya Tr. at 59:4-60:8, 156:1-158:18, 214:8-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bowler Decl., Ex. 16. Thus, the MAVEN GIG mark is not mentioned in the media talking points or the official communications plan regarding GM's pilot program with Uber. Steyn Tr. at 110:21-112:24; Media Briefing Talking Points; Bhattacharya Tr. at 152:12-155:25; Communications Plan. Instead, as discussed below, GM only used MAVEN GIG in limited and casual instances with the Uber drivers in the pilot program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Enrollment Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   GM's evidence from the car share service enrollment and reservation process resembles the casual or limited use about which courts have cautioned, especially when compared to the prominent use of the Maven mark in the customer facing communications. For example, GM continuously emphasizes the fact that the Uber drivers who received the sign-up email during the pilot program and went to the Enrollment Website that included the Maven mark but did not include the MAVEN GIG mark, had to check a box next to the statement, \"I agree to\n   <em>\n    Maven Gig\n   </em>\n   's Lease Agreement and Privacy Statement\" before being able to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Enrollment Screen (emphasis added); Jaising Decl. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply at 6-7. This is the only use of \"MAVEN GIG\" prior to completing enrollment in the pilot program. The Court finds it useful to discuss the enrollment process, including this check box statement, before discussing the insufficiency of this use of the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As part of the Pilot Agreement, Uber contacted drivers through a sign-up email to promote the car share service and to explain how to rent a car. Bhattacharya Decl. \u00b6 19; Jaising Decl. \u00b6 6. The Uber sign-up email mentioned Uber and Maven but did not mention MAVEN GIG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uber Driver Email; Bhattacharya Tr. at 113:18-114:22; Stooke Tr. 84:19-85:3. Specifically, the sign-up email stated: \"We've teamed up with Maven.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uber Driver Email. The Uber sign-up email contained a hyperlink that led to the landing page at www.mavendrive.com/gig, and the Enrollment Website at www.mavendrive.com/gig/#!enroll, which directed customers to complete a four-part enrollment form to create an account, provide personal and credit card information, and schedule an appointment to rent a car.

AAA challenges this evidence because the tab was only accessible to existing users with a Maven account. Opp'n at 19. That is, the \"webpage could only be reached after a user logs on to the Maven Drive website and enters their [Maven] login information. Customers without a [Maven] or an Uber pilot account would never have encountered MAVEN GIG.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205910817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jaising Decl. \u00b6 17 (showing screenshot of access to the Maven Gig tab only after logging into Maven account). The Court agrees with AAA that the fact that only an existing Maven account user could see this tab raises questions about the private use of the mark on the webpage and how many drivers actually came in contact with this use of the mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brookfield Commc'ns Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1051\">\n    174 F.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The purpose of a trademark is to help consumers identify the source, but a mark cannot serve a source-identifying function if the public has never seen the mark.\"). More importantly, GM's use of the MAVEN GIG mark in this manner is\n   overshadowed by the prominent use of the Maven mark on the Maven Website and during the entire enrollment process. The prominent use of the Maven mark instead of the MAVEN GIG mark diminishes the public's ability to associate MAVEN GIG with the car share service \"as it is unclear which mark to attach to the [service].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nexsan Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273140\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/260/68/#p77\">\n    260 F.Supp.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Evidence that GM was Hiding MAVEN GIG Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court also agrees with AAA that evidence shows that GM purposefully hid the MAVEN GIG mark during the Uber pilot program. This undermines GM's claim that the MAVEN GIG mark was sufficiently used in conjunction with the actual sale of the car share service in a public manner to create an association among customers between the MAVEN GIG mark and GM's car share service, and whether GM's actual sales are, in turn, relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For instance, before GM entered into its pilot program with Uber, GM had a program with Lyft called \"EXPRESS DRIVE\" for the use of GM vehicles in providing Lyft services. Bhattacharya Tr. at 33:19-34:8; Steyn Tr. at 20:11-25:9. Before the fall of 2016, however, GM's relationship with Lyft and EXPRESS DRIVE became strained due to unprofitability and unaligned incentives. Bhattacharya Tr. at 50:10-51:6; Steyn Tr. at 24:16-25:10; 53:18-23. In particular, GM wanted direct contact with the drivers. Steyn Tr. at 53:18-23. Therefore, in the summer of 2016, GM began exploring an alternative \"platform-agnostic\" model where GM would maintain a direct relationship with drivers regardless of the business partnership.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273140\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/260/68/#p77\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Stooke Tr. at 37:13-38:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The record demonstrates that because GM had not given Lyft formal notice that GM was exiting its EXPRESS DRIVE program with Lyft, and because Lyft and Uber were competitors, GM was still sensitive about its Lyft partnership when GM began its relationship with Uber. Therefore, GM wanted to get \"Express Drive unwound\" before they got \"[MAVEN GIG] up and running.\" Steyn Tr. at 55:21-57:25, 89:20-90:20; Bhattacharya Tr. at 148:13-151:4 (\"[W]e knew the entire conversation would be about Uber and Lyft, in any case, and that the message we wanted to tell would get lost.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bowler Decl., Ex. 15. Moreover, GM wanted MAVEN GIG to be a platform-agnostic, multi-partner product, and knew that if GM \"tried to message extensively about the platform agnostic aspects of [MAVEN GIG], the fact that [GM] only had one-co-marketing partner to begin with didn't look great with that.\" Bhattacharya Tr. at 150:13-151:4. Therefore, GM did not have a marketing campaign or intend to market MAVEN GIG until it had other partners besides Uber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:4-60:8, 156:1-158:18, 214:8-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bowler Decl., Ex. 16.

However, GM disputes this evidence and asserts that the May 3, 2017 was merely an \"expansion\" of the MAVEN GIG service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court concludes that evidence that GM sought to play down the MAVEN GIG mark during its pilot program with Uber supports the inference that the uses of the MAVEN GIG mark were purposefully limited and casual so as to not create an association among consumers between the mark and the service, such that the revenue\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and costumers figures do not reflect actual use of the mark.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sebastian Brown Prods.

These arguments fail for the same reasons discussed in Section III.A.1.

Moreover, these cases do not even address the issue of disgorging a defendant's profits. As such, the Court finds these \"likelihood of confusion\" cases have no applicability in the Court's disgorgement analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Moreover, AAA has identified no authority, nor has the Court found any, where a court has disgorged a defendant's profits in a reverse confusion case based only on mere knowledge. Further, AAA has identified no authority, nor has the Court found any, where a court has disgorged a defendant's profits in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   case based only on mere knowledge. AAA has conflated what is sufficient for purposes of likelihood of confusion at the liability stage with what is sufficient to find \"willfulness\" in the disgorgement context at the remedies stage. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Stone Creek, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindy Pen Co.\n   </em>\n   , emphasize that in order to prove willfulness so as to be entitled to disgorgement of profits, a plaintiff must show that the infringement is \"willfully calculated to exploit the advantage of an established mark\" or that GM is \"attempting to gain the value of an established name of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindy Pen Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"36541\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/982/1400/#p1405\">\n    982 F.2d at 1405-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mere knowledge, therefore, is not sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Further, the Court's independent review of the case law indicates that AAA cannot rely on a reverse confusion theory to disgorge GM's profits. For instance, several cases suggest that because reverse confusion cases do not involve an intent to exploit an existing mark, reverse confusion cases are not entitled to a finding of willfulness under\n   <em>\n    Lindy Pen Co.\n   </em>\n   , and thus to infringer's profits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scat Enters., Inc. v.

GM identifies evidence in the record where AAA repeatedly failed to identify damages. First, none of AAA's written responses or documents identify any actual damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adkisson Decl., Ex. 46 (\"Resp. to GM's 6th Interrogs.\") at 1-5. Second, AAA's witnesses testified that they were unaware of any specific instances of consumers downloading the MAVEN GIG app under the mistaken belief that it was AAA's GIG car share app, or vice versa.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Voges Tr. at 166:23-167:06, 172:12-173:4, 177:22-178:3; Hetke Tr. at 203:18-204:14, 205:13-23. Third, AAA's damages expert, Scott Phillips, could not identify any evidence of actual damages. For instance, during Mr. Phillip's deposition, Mr. Phillips admitted that he has not seen any evidence that AAA has experienced any quantifiable damages. Adkisson Decl., Ex. 57 (\"Phillips Tr.\") at 36:18-24, 38:15-43:22, 44:19-46:20, 48:6-49:22, 52:10-53:13, 57:4-59:6, 61:7-62:11, 63:4-8, 67:1-68:23, 70:7-72:12. In his report, Mr. Phillips offers no opinion as to whether AAA has actually experienced any harm; instead, he only states that AAA\n   <em>\n    believes\n   </em>\n   it has been harmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adkisson Decl., Ex. 54 (\"Phillips Rpt.\") \u00b6\u00b6 36-38 (stating \"A3 Mobility believes that it has been damaged\"; \"A3 Mobility believes that ...

Finally, GM's expert, Ms. Distler, was not aware of any evidence of actual damages. Distler Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 100, 108 (\"From my review of the evidence produced in this matter, I am not aware of any evidence that supports Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants' use of the MAVEN GIG trademark resulted in any actual damages to Plaintiffs.

AAA does not challenge GM's assertions that: (1) AAA did not identify any actual damages in its discovery responses or documents; (2) AAA's witnesses were unable to identify any actual damages during their depositions; and (3) AAA's own damages expert was unable to identify any evidence of actual damages. Further, AAA does not address the case law cited by GM in support of its motion for summary judgment. Moreover, as discussed further below, neither AAA's case law nor evidence show a genuine issue for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   First, the case cited by AAA,\n   <em>\n    Villagomes v. Lab. Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   , does not support AAA's position.\n   <em>\n    Villagomes v. Lab.

Nev. 2011). In that case, the court declined to enter summary judgment on plaintiff's negligence claim based on her failure to disclose a computation of damages as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26, and instead found that the defendants could raise the issue in a motion in limine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246097\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/783/1121/#p1128\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast here, GM does not challenge AAA's failure to provide a computation\n   under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Opp'n at n.103. AAA cites to these two documents without any elaboration except for AAA's assertion that \"[a]lthough AAA has not quantified the precise amount of actual damages suffered, AAA produced testimony in discovery and declaration bearing on harm sustained as a result of infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246097\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/783/1121/#p1128\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This evidence cited by AAA does not create a genuine issue of material fact concerning actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Specifically, the declaration of AAA's GIG Car Share President, Jason Haight, provides anecdotal examples of Mr. Haight's \"belief\" that AAA has been damaged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haight Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-57. Mr. Haight's conclusory statements are not supported by detailed facts or evidentiary support. To the extent he mentions instances of confusion, Mr. Haight provides no details as to who specifically was confused, when the instance occurred, or how many times that type of confusion occurred.
