S\u00e1nchez, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Joshua Coulter brings this putative class action against Defendant Io, Inc. t/d/b/a Receivables Management Systems (RMS) (misidentified in the Complaint as \"Receivables Management Systems\"), alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1692 - 1692p. Coulter's claims stem from a debt collection letter he received from RMS. Coulter alleges the collection letter violated two provisions of the FDCPA-\u00a7 1692e and \u00a7 1692g-because it misleadingly suggested he could dispute the debt RMS was seeking to collect by calling RMS when, in fact, a dispute must be in writing to be effective under the FDCPA. Coulter and RMS have filed\n   cross-motions for summary judgment limited to the issue of RMS's liability to Coulter-i.e., whether the debt collection letter violated the FDCPA. Because the Court agrees with Coulter that the collection letter violated the FDCPA as a matter of law under\n   <em>\n    Caprio v.

Coulter was a 25-year-old university student at the time of the visit and was covered under his father's insurance policy. In June 2016, Coulter received an invoice from Patient First at his parents' address requesting payment of $71.97 for the January visit. Coulter did not pay the invoice, believing his insurance company should have covered the fee. Coulter received additional invoices from Patient First at his parents' address in July and August 2016, which he also did not pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 7, 2016, Patient First contacted RMS, a company in the business of collecting debts owed to third parties, and requested RMS's assistance in collecting the unpaid debt from Coulter. The following day, RMS mailed a one-page collection letter (the \"Collection Letter\") to Coulter, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    COLLECTION NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Your\n   <strong>\n    delinquent\n   </strong>\n   account with Patient First has been placed with RMS for immediate attention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Our records indicate that despite our client's numerous requests for payment you have allowed your account to become seriously PAST DUE.

Coulter seeks to pursue this action on behalf of a class consisting of individuals in Chester County, Pennsylvania, to whom RMS sent a debt collection letter containing the statement, \"[i]f you feel that this balance may be due from your insurance carrier please contact your carrier\n   <strong>\n    prior\n   </strong>\n   to contacting the representative at the extension listed below.\" Compl. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following a Rule 16 conference on December 11, 2017, the Court entered a scheduling order which directed the parties to conduct fact discovery on the issue of RMS's liability to Coulter under the FDCPA and to file cross-motions for summary judgment on liability at the close of discovery.

Specifically, \u00a7 1692g requires a debt collector to provide a consumer with a written notice, either in its initial communication with the consumer about the alleged debt or within five days after its initial communication, containing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) the amount of the debt;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (5) a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(1)-(5).

Specifically, Coulter points to the Letter's third and fourth paragraphs, which advise the consumer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   If you feel that this balance may be due from your insurance carrier, please contact your carrier\n   <strong>\n    prior\n   </strong>\n   to contacting the representative at the extension listed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Our Collection Representatives are available to work with you between the\n   hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Mail your payment or call today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Marcus Summ. J. Decl. Ex. A. Coulter argues the least sophisticated debtor could reasonably understand these provisions to suggest that calling RMS was an effective way to raise an insurance-related dispute regarding the debt, even though a dispute must be in writing to be effective under the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ.

RMS denies that these provisions can reasonably be read as offering the consumer an alternative way to dispute the debt, noting, inter alia, that neither provision makes any reference to \"disputing\" a debt, a subject that is instead addressed only the in the validation notice at the bottom of the Letter. According to RMS, the provisions cited by Coulter, when read in the order presented in the Collection Letter,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   merely state that, if the debt is valid (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"... the balance may be due ...\") but should be paid by [the consumer's] health insurance carrier (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"... from your insurance carrier, ...\"), then the debtor should \"please contact your carrier prior to contacting the representative at the extension listed below\" for purposes of making payment on the debt (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"Mail your payment or call today.

The court rejected the debt collector's argument that the language at issue was \"nothing more than an invitation to communicate, pay, or reach some sort of compromise,\" holding that even if the letter could be read in the manner advocated by the debt collector, the least sophisticated debtor could understand the language instructing the consumer to \"PLEASE CALL\" should there be \"ANY DISCREPANCY\" as \"more than a mere continuation of the debt collector's request for payment or for settlement discussions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405302\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/87/#p88\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405302\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/87/#p88\">\n    at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the issue is a close one, this Court agrees with Coulter that, under\n   <em>\n    Caprio\n   </em>\n   , the Collection Letter in this case violated \u00a7 1692g because the least\n   sophisticated debtor could reasonably understand the Letter to instruct the consumer to raise insurance-related disputes regarding the debt by calling RMS. While RMS's alternative interpretation of the Letter as merely encouraging the consumer to call RMS to make payment on the debt may be plausible,\n   <em>\n    Caprio\n   </em>\n   made clear that the Court's task in reviewing the Collection Letter is not \"to decide whether the debtor or the debt collector offers 'a more appropriate reading' of [the Letter],\" but to \"interpret the document from the perspective of [the] 'least sophisticated debtor.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546204\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/142/\">\n    709 F.3d at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, the third paragraph of the Letter advises the consumer, \"[i]f you feel that this balance may be due from your insurance carrier, please contact your carrier\n   <strong>\n    prior\n   </strong>\n   to contacting the representative at the extension listed below.\" Marcus Summ. J. Decl. Ex. A. As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Laniado\n   </em>\n   , the substance of this statement is not materially different from the language at issue in\n   <em>\n    Caprio\n   </em>\n   , which instructed the consumer to \"\n   <strong>\n    please call\n   </strong>\n   ' the debt collector \"if you feel you do not owe this amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Caprio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546204\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/142/\">\n    709 F.3d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Viewed from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor, the phrase \"[i]f you feel that this balance may be due from your insurance carrier\" can reasonably be understood to reference a dispute regarding the debt. This phrase is the equivalent of the phrase \"if you feel you do not owe this amount,\" which the\n   <em>\n    Caprio\n   </em>\n   court held could reasonably be interpreted to encompass a dispute-a consumer who feels that a debt is owed by his insurance company would necessarily also feel that he personally does not owe the debt. Indeed, at his deposition, RMS's corporate representative conceded that if a consumer were to advise RMS that the consumer did not believe he owed some or all of the balance alleged to be due because insurance should have covered it, RMS would normally consider the debt to be disputed.

The message that insurance-related disputes regarding the debt may be raised by telephone is reinforced by the very next paragraph of the Letter, which advises the consumer, \"Our Collection Representatives are available to work with you between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Mail your payment or call today.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marcus Summ.

Financial Recoveries\n   </em>\n   , in which a district court within the Third Circuit rejected a similar challenge to a debt collection letter that advised the consumer, \"[i]f you have insurance that may pay all or a portion of this debt, that information can be submitted by calling\n   <strong>\n    1-800-220-0260\n   </strong>\n   .\" No. 15-0753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203545322\">\n    2016 WL 3545322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.N.J.

In\n   <em>\n    Morello v.

Although acknowledging that there may be a distinction between disputing a debt and resolving it, the court in\n   <em>\n    Morello\n   </em>\n   found that the least sophisticated debtor could reasonably interpret the instruction to call if the debtor carried insurance that might cover the obligation \"as providing that, in the event the debtor seeks to dispute personal liability for a debt by claiming that his or her insurance provider is the liable party, the debtor may call the debt collector rather than submitting the dispute in writing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-11. The court concluded that this language, which \"invit[ed] [the] debtor to call the debt collector if another party (i.e., his or her insurance carrier) is liable for all or a portion of the debt obligation, rather than the debtor personally, could mislead that debtor into foregoing his or her statutory right to dispute a debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kassin v.

The consumer argued the letter violated \u00a7 1692g because the request that the consumer immediately telephone a collection assistant overshadowed the language in the validation notice stating that the consumer had thirty days in which to dispute the debt. Rejecting this argument, the Ninth Circuit found it significant that the challenged language did not demand immediate\n    <em>\n     payment\n    </em>\n    of the debt, which \"necessarily [would] require[ ] the debtor to forego the statutory right to challenge the debt in writing within thirty days, or suffer the consequences,\" but merely requested an immediate phone call.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833977\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1428/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833977\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1428/\">\n     at 1434\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

But whether the \"call today\" provision of the Collection Letter, standing alone, overshadows or contradicts the validation notice is not question here, as Coulter's claim is based on the combined effect of the language in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Letter. Moreover, contrary to RMS's assertion (and as discussed above), here, as in\n    <em>\n     Caprio\n    </em>\n    , the challenged provisions of the letter together do more than merely encourage the consumer to communicate with RMS; they ask the consumer to call an RMS representative if the consumer believes the debt is owed by his insurer.\n    <em>\n     Terran\n    </em>\n    is therefore inapposite.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The court in\n    <em>\n     Cruz\n    </em>\n    also cited\n    <em>\n     Szczurek v.
