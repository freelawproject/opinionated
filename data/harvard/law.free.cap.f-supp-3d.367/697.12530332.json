WATSON, United States District Judge\n  On August 15, 2018, this Court denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. 37).\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Ohio A.

The Intervenors joined that motion and filed their own supplemental brief. Dkt. 140, 140-1 (Intervenors' Suppl. Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; Mem.). The Plaintiffs filed a response. Dkt. 177 (Pls.' Opp'n to Summ. J.). Then the Defendants and Intervenors each filed a reply, completing the briefing. Dkt. 190 (Defs.' Reply); Dkt. 189 (Intervenors' Reply). For the reasons that follow, we\n  <strong>\n   DENY\n  </strong>\n  the motion for summary judgment.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiffs in this litigation include seventeen individual Ohio residents and five organizations based in Ohio. The individual Plaintiffs are Linda Goldenhar, Douglas Burks, Sarah Inskeep, Cynthia Libster, Kathryn Deitsch, LuAnn Boothe, Mark John Griffiths, Lawrence Nadler, Chitra Walker, Tristan Rader, Ria Megnin, Andrew Harris, Aaron Dagres, Elizabeth Myer, Beth Hutton, Teresa Thobaben, and Constance Rubin. All the individual Plaintiffs affiliate with the Democratic Party and vote for Democratic candidates. The organizational Plaintiffs, which include nonpartisan groups as well as groups affiliated with the Democratic Party, are: the Ohio A. Philip Randolph Institute (\"OAPRI\"), the League of Women Voters of Ohio (\"LWVO\"), The Ohio State University College Democrats (\"OSU College Democrats\"), the Northeast Ohio Young Black Democrats (\"NEOYBD\"), and the Hamilton County Young Democrats (\"HCYD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under Ohio law, the State General Assembly has the primary authority for drawing the State's U.S. congressional districts. A bipartisan \"legislative task force on redistricting, reapportionment, and demographic research\" (\"Task Force\") has the role of advising the General Assembly in this task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OHIO REV. CODE \u00a7 103.51. A version of the 2012 redistricting plan (the plan at issue here) first passed as H.B. 319. Later, that bill was updated slightly in H.B. 369. H.B. 369 passed both houses of the General Assembly, and Governor Kasich signed the bill into law on December 15, 2011. The map approved in H.B. 369 has been used in the 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 elections of U.S. congressional representatives from Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that the bipartisan Task Force did not actually draw the 2012 map. Rather, according to the Plaintiffs, the 2012 redistricting plan was drawn by both state-level and national Republican operatives. These operatives and other Republican staffers conducted much of the\n   map drawing in a hotel room in the Columbus DoubleTree Hotel that was converted into an office, which they called the \"Bunker,\" from July 2011 to October 2011. These individuals analyzed different versions of the map for their likely partisan outcomes based on indices created from historical election data. The Plaintiffs maintain that \"Ohio's congressional districts were drawn for the purpose of locking in a Republican supermajority impervious to normal electoral swings.\" Dkt. 177 (Pls.' Opp'n to Summ. J. at 1) (Page ID # 8277). Specifically, the districts were drawn so that Ohio would consistently elect twelve Republican representatives and four Democratic representatives (and, in fact, such results have been accomplished in every election held under the 2012 redistricting plan). At trial, the Plaintiffs aim to support their version of the facts, and thus their claims, through a combination of lay witness testimony, documentary evidence, expert testimony and reports, and an alternative map called the Proposed Remedial Plan. In their opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs point to specific pieces of record evidence that support their allegations. At this stage, we draw reasonable inferences from this evidence in the Plaintiffs' favor, but we form no opinion on the credibility or weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendants and Intervenors, in turn, either entirely dispute the facts and evidence offered by the Plaintiffs or contest their relevance. The Defendants and Intervenors move for summary judgment, raising two arguments: (1) the Plaintiffs' claims are nonjusticiable; and (2) the Plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish standing, an argument that, at times, seems to blend with an argument against the Plaintiffs' claims on the merits. Dkt. 136 (Mot. for Summ. J. at 1) (Page ID # 3546). The Intervenors focus their supplemental brief on the issue of justiciability. Dkt. 140-1 (Intervenors' Suppl. Mem. at 1) (Page ID # 4590).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

Specifically, the Plaintiffs do not suggest the adoption of a \"predominant purpose\" standard-i.e., proof that the Defendants' alleged partisan intent was the predominant factor in determining the way that the district lines were drawn. Instead, they advocate for a \"motivating factor\" standard, which would merely require them to prove that partisan intent was one factor that influenced the Defendants' drawing of the challenged districts.

In\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that the harm of vote dilution \"arises from the particular composition of the voter's own district,\n   which causes his vote-having been packed or cracked-to carry less weight than it would carry in another, hypothetical district.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1927\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, when partisanship predominates in the redistricting process, the resulting effect (and harm) tends to be the packing and cracking of the disfavored party's voters, which dilutes their votes. Specifically, this harm occurs in one of two ways. First, map-drawers \"pack\" voters by creating districts that contain far more supporters of the disfavored party than would be necessary to elect a candidate from that party, thus causing many votes to be \"wasted.\" Second, conversely, map-drawers \"crack\" voters by creating districts that carve off supporters of the disfavored party such that the disfavored party's voters are divided into separate districts in which they essentially can never elect a candidate of their party. Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Arizona State Legislature\n   </em>\n   defined partisan gerrymandering as \"the drawing of legislative district lines to subordinate adherents of one political party and entrench a rival party in power.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591109\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2652/#p2658\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That the Elections Clause does not give a State the power to disfavor particular voters or a political party only invites an inquiry into whether the State has, in fact, disfavored those voters or a party. We answer that inquiry by looking to see if either the First or Fourteenth Amendments, which police the State's power under the Elections Clause, has been violated. That brings us back to the standards for analyzing those claims, outlined earlier. As for Article I, \u00a7 2, if the people are unable to choose their congressional representatives (because the state representatives are effectively choosing for them through their gerrymandered drawing of congressional districts), it occurs because the people's votes have been improperly diluted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p860\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]y favoring supporters of Republican candidates over supporters of non-Republican candidates, the [redistricting plan] 'defeat[s] the principle solemnly embodied in the Great Compromise [i.e., Article I, \u00a7 2]' because it reflects a successful effort by the General Assembly to 'draw the lines of congressional districts in such a way as to give some voters a greater voice in choosing a Congressman [or Congresswoman] than others.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wesberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379871\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/1/#p7\">\n    376 U.S. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379871\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/1/#p7\">\n    84 S.Ct. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).

This echoes the intent (\"disfavor a class of candidates\") and effect (\"dictate electoral outcomes\") prongs of the previously described tests, but this theory also challenges the entire districting plan. In this sense, therefore, the Article I claim is a \"statewide\" claim, rather than a district-by-district challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, to support this specific claim at trial, the Plaintiffs may rely on statewide evidence about the intent and effect of the redistricting plan as a whole.

Dkt. 178-5 (Whatman Dep. at 163-64) (Page ID # 9668-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On the ground in Ohio, DiRossi worked with Heather Mann (formerly Heather Blessing) (another Republican consultant) to use historical statewide Ohio election results to create a \"Unified Index\" and to \"work to get the [Ohio U.S. congressional] districts put together in a legislative form so that it could go through the legislative process.\" Dkt. 178-7 (DiRossi Dep. at 112-13, 163) (Page ID # 9683-84, 9696);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 178-13 (Judy Dep. at 48) (Page ID # 9747) (agreeing that \"[w]hen new versions of a map came along [Troy Judy, the House Republican Caucus Chief of Staff] would have a new spreadsheet for that unified index for the districts\"). They worked at an office set up in a room at the DoubleTree Hotel in Columbus, Ohio, after having the beds taken out and computers installed. Dkt. 178-8 (Morgan Dep. at 51) (Page ID # 9724). They referred to the hotel room as the \"Bunker.\" Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 80) (Page ID # 8425). DiRossi testified that he never saw \"anyone who could be identified as a Democrat in the hotel room\" where they worked on drawing the map. Dkt. 178-7 (DiRossi Dep. at 149) (Page ID # 9690). However, various state Republicans such as Tom Niehaus, the President of the Ohio State Senate, and Matt Schuler, the Ohio State Senate chief of staff, would visit those working on the map-drawing at the DoubleTree. Dkt. 178-13 (Judy Dep. at 74-75) (Page ID # 9748-49). A reasonable trier of fact could find\n   that the Republicans' domination of the map-drawing process and the exclusion of Democrats indicates that partisan concerns motivated the map-drawing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   DiRossi also stated that he exchanged information with Whatman during the process of drawing the 2012 map. Dkt. 178-7 (DiRossi Dep. at 257) (Page ID # 9714). John Morgan assisted with DiRossi and Mann's map drawing, showing them \"how to access election data in Maptitude\" and training them in how to use the Maptitude program, which enabled them to create color-coded draft congressional maps and to evaluate various characteristics of those drafts, including the anticipated partisan effects of various districting schemes. Dkt. 178-8 (Morgan Dep. at 48-51) (Page ID # 9721-24); Dkt. 178-13 (Judy Dep. at 104) (Page ID # 9751). As the map-drawers drew districts in Maptitude, \"as [they] move[d] the district lines around,\" they could \"see what the vote totals would have been for that district\" as the program allowed the \"numbers [to] recalculate in real time.\" Dkt. 178-13 (Judy Dep. at 103-04) (Page ID # 9750-51). Communications between involved parties could also be understood to indicate partisan intent in the redistricting process. For example, on September 7, 2011, Whatman emailed talking points to Niehaus, stating that they were \"trying to lock down 12 Republican seats\" in the redistricting process. Dkt. 178-11 (Ex.

Viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, such evidence shows that the task of drawing the maps was farmed out to the national Republican Party and that the bipartisan Task Force was shut out of the process. This evidence, if credited as presented at trial, helps satisfy the partisan intent element.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Moreover, the Plaintiffs plan to offer expert testimony that will, in part, go to proving partisan intent. The Plaintiffs argue that the \"manner and extent to which the Republican mapmakers split political subdivisions and communities of interest, with resulting partisan gain, demonstrates their objective to crack and pack Democratic voters to optimize Republican seats in Congress.\" Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 84) (Page ID # 8429). Plaintiffs' expert William Cooper states that the districts as drawn under the 2012 map \"are not compact. Far too many counties and political subdivisions are split.\" Dkt. 177-4 (Cooper Dep. at 15) (Page ID # 8535). Cooper drew a Proposed Remedial Plan that splits significantly fewer counties and municipal civil divisions than the 2012 map. Dkt. 177-3 (Cooper Report at 11-14) (Page ID # 8519-22). Dr. Niven, another expert, will testify that the 2012 map split 322 census tracts, whereas the map in effect before the 2012 map's introduction split only 209 census tracts. Dkt. 179-8 (Niven Report at 5) (Page ID # 9926). Dr. Niven also explores several specific examples of district lines being drawn in a way that could indicate partisan intent. For example, Niven explains how the 2012 map divides Franklin County into three different congressional districts-the 3rd, 12th and 15th.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19-27 (Page ID # 9940-48). The 3rd district concentrated (packed) Democratic-leaning voters, creating a district nearly certain to elect a Democratic representative.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26 (Page ID # 9947). The 12th and 15th districts, however, chipped away (cracked) voters and merged them into districts that contained many Republican-leaning voters, thereby creating two districts that could be expected to elect Republican representatives.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22-25 (Page ID # 9943-46). Dr. Niven's\n    report states that the differences between the partisan leanings of the voters in the 3rd district and those in the 12th and 15th districts are statistically significant.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 27 (Page ID # 9948). Further, Dr. Niven highlights several examples of highly irregular district borders drawn into the 2012 map, from which a reasonable fact-finder could infer partisan intent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 10 (Page ID # 9931). Dr. Niven concludes that \"the districts have strategically targeted and divided populations\" based on analysis of the extent to which census tracts are split under the present map.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4 (Page ID # 9925).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Furthermore, Dr. Wendy K. Tam Cho used a computer algorithm to generate over three million simulated congressional maps informed only by traditional districting principles such as contiguity, compactness, and city and county boundary preservation. Dkt. 179-11 (Cho Dep. at 129) (Page ID # 10032); Dkt. 179-10 (Cho Report at 40) (Page ID # 10025). Dr. Cho then compared the 2012 map to the non-partisan maps within her dataset to determine the extent to which they diverged. She found that none of her over three million simulated maps produced the same 12-4 seat share as the 2012 map. Dkt. 179-10 (Cho Report at 40) (Page ID # 10025). Dr. Cho found that \"none of the simulated maps ... had the same partisan fairness metric of the challenged map\" and that \"[t]he responsiveness of the challenged map occurs in a very small number of [her] simulated maps.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Cho's simulations provide additional evidence of the partisan intent on the part of the map-drawers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    From this evidence, along with other testimony, emails, and the like, a reasonable fact-finder could infer that a predominantly partisan intent informed the drawing of the congressional districts in the 2012 plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      2. Partisan Effect and Statewide Associational Harm\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The second element of the Fourteenth Amendment claim and non-associational First Amendment claim is partisan effect. The evidence presented for these claims must be district-specific. On this particular effect element, then, the evidence required for satisfying the substantive claim blends with the evidence required to establish standing. Accordingly, we detail the evidence on this particular claim when we address the individual Plaintiffs' standing.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section II.C.1.a. As shown, at this stage, the Plaintiffs have enough evidence to establish an injury in fact for standing purposes, and likewise, to lead a rational finder of fact to conclude that the partisan effect element is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The First Amendment associational claim, however, rests on separate, statewide evidence. The Plaintiffs point to record evidence outlined below that could support an associational harm.\n    <em>\n     See also infra\n    </em>\n    Section II.C.1.b.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Prior to the 2011 redistricting, Ohio had eighteen U.S. congressional districts. Due to population changes, the 2012 map had to be reduced to sixteen U.S. congressional districts. Dkt. 178-5 (Whatman Dep. at 159) (Page ID # 9664). The current congressional districting plan was first used in the 2012 election cycle. Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 3) (Page ID # 8348). Every election in which it has been used has resulted in the election of twelve Republican representatives and four Democratic representatives, with each district consistently electing a candidate from the same party. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Districts have consistently elected Republicans while the 3rd, 9th, 11th, and 13th have elected Democrats.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 87-88 (Page ID # 8432-33). In each of\n    these elections, 75% of the representatives elected in the State of Ohio were Republicans. But in the 2012 election, Republicans won only 51% of the state-wide vote. In 2014, they won only 59% of the state-wide vote. In 2016, they won only 57% of the state-wide vote. In 2018, they won only 52% of the state-wide vote.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 86-87 (Page ID # 8431-32).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The 2012 map created the 3rd congressional district, a new heavily-Democratic district that some Republican map-drawers referred to as the \"Franklin County Sinkhole.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 81 (Page ID # 8426). In the 3rd district, Democratic candidates have won significantly more votes than were required to beat their opponents. In 2012, the Democratic candidate was elected with 68.29% of the vote, in 2014 with 64.05% of the vote, in 2016 with 68.57% of the vote, and in 2018 with 73.6% of the vote.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 88 (Page ID # 8433). Democratic candidates in the 9th, 11th, and 13th districts have won by similarly high margins.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 88-89 (Page ID # 8433-34).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The Plaintiffs plan to offer expert testimony to prove the partisan effect of the 2012 map. Dr. Christopher Warshaw states that since the enactment of the 2012 redistricted map partisan bias measures have increased. Dkt. 179-6 (Warshaw Dep. at 72-73) (Page ID # 9875-76). Dr. Warshaw presents four measures of partisan effect. First, the efficiency gap is one \"commonly used metric[ ] to measure partisan bias.\" Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 89) (Page ID # 8434). The efficiency gap is:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    the difference between the parties' respective wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes cast in the election. All of a party's votes are wasted if they lose the election. When a party wins an election, the wasted votes are those above 50%+1 needed to win. The efficiency gap aggregates both kinds of wasted votes for each party. According to the efficiency gap analysis, the ratio of the parties' excess votes reveals the discrepancy between how the map treats the parties.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (quotation marks omitted). Dr. Warshaw explains that Ohio's efficiency gap increased considerably between 2010 and 2012. Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 23) (Page ID # 8613). His report states that there were pro-Republican efficiency gaps in the 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 elections, and that the 2012 and 2018 efficiency gaps were particularly large.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; Dkt. 177-7 (Warshaw Suppl. Report at 3) (Page ID # 8672). Dr. Warshaw also states that the efficiency gaps under the 2012 redistricting plan are extreme compared to the efficiency gaps in other states. Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 21-23) (Page ID # 8611-13).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The second measure of partisan effect is the mean-median gap. \"If the party wins more votes in the median district than in the average district, they have an advantage in the translation of votes to seats,\" which is reflected by the mean-median gap measure. Dkt. 177-7 (Warshaw Suppl. Report at 3) (Page ID # 8672). Dr. Warshaw found that after the 2012 plan was implemented, there was a \"sharp increase\" in Ohio's mean-median gap. Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 24) (Page ID # 8614).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The third measure is declination. Dkt. 177-7 (Warshaw Suppl. Report at 3) (Page ID # 8672). As explained by Dr. Warshaw:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    The declination metric starts from the assumption that a plan that advantages one party will arrange the distribution of district vote shares in a way that treats the 50 percent threshold for victory differently than other vote values. The declination metric can be quantified using a number between -1 and 1 (positive values favor Democrats and negative values favor Republicans).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (citation omitted). The 2018 election resulted in a declination of -.69, which Dr. Warshaw concludes \"was more extreme than 98% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than 99% of previous U.S. congressional elections.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Dr. Warshaw also found that \"Ohio's post-2011 plans had some of the most extreme declinations in Ohio's history.\" Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 25-26) (Page ID # 8615-16).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Finally, Dr. Warshaw utilizes a partisan symmetry metric. Dkt. 177-7 (Warshaw Suppl. Report at 3) (Page ID # 8672). This measures \"whether each party receives the same share of seats for identical shares of votes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Dr. Warshaw found that \"Ohio's 2018 elections were more asymmetric than 92% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than 94% of previous U.S. congressional elections over the past 45 years.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4 (Page ID # 8673). He ran analyses on hypothetical elections in Ohio under the 2012 redistricting plan and found that they were more biased than comparable elections in other states. Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 26-27) (Page ID # 8616-17). He also found that \"Ohio's post-2011 elections were more asymmetric than previous congressional elections in Ohio\" and that the 2012 election had more extreme asymmetry \"than 96% of previous elections and [was] more pro-Republican than 97% of previous U.S. congressional elections over the past 45 years.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 27 (Page ID # 8617).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In addition to these four metrics, Dr. Warshaw analyzes the competitiveness of elections and \"the responsiveness of each party's seat shares to uniform swings in the statewide vote share.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 28 (Page ID # 8618).

At this stage, drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving party, the Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient record evidence to defeat the motion for summary judgment based on the partisan effect factor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      3. Lack of a Legitimate Justification and Causation\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The third and final elements of the Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment claims blend together. To illustrate: the Defendants may come forward with other legitimate justifications for the map, such as traditional redistricting criteria that include compactness and maintaining municipal and county boundaries, etc. If credited, this showing would indicate that a district's partisan effect is caused by, for example, the map-drawers' adherence to the State's pre-existing municipal and county subdivision boundaries and\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    by the Defendants' alleged predominantly partisan intent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Although the Defendants contend that the map-drawers were focused on traditional districting criteria, the Plaintiffs' experts and arguments counter this contention. For example, the Plaintiffs argue that one reasonable inference that could be drawn from their evidence of partisan intent and the extreme partisan effect of the map could be that traditional districting criteria were not part of the map-drawers' calculus. The presence of contradictory evidence proffered by each side indicates that there is a genuine issue of material fact on this element, and thus granting summary judgment would be inappropriate. The Plaintiffs' offer of evidence to rebut any possible justifications, detailed below, is sufficient to survive summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Plaintiffs plan to offer expert testimony to prove that the 2012 map's partisan leanings are not the result of the\n    drawers' attempts to comply with traditional redistricting criteria. Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 99-102) (Page ID # 8444-47). Cooper has drafted a Proposed Remedial Plan that attempts to \"undo the partisan gerrymander,\" Dkt. 177-4 (Cooper Dep. at 25) (Page ID # 8450), while still honoring traditional redistricting criteria such as one-person-one-vote, compactness, contiguity, incumbent protection, compliance with the VRA, and the preservation of communities of interest, Dkt. 177-3 (Cooper Report at 3) (Page ID # 8511). Cooper also drew his plan in compliance with the requirements of Ohio's 2018 Ballot Initiative.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Cooper's Proposed Remedial Plan splits only 14 counties whereas the 2012 map splits 23 counties.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11, 14 (Page ID # 8519, 8522). The Proposed Remedial Plan splits 27 municipal civil divisions whereas the 2012 map splits 73 municipal civil divisions.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Cooper's Proposed Remedial Plan also uses more compact districts than those in the 2012 map.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15-17 (Page ID # 8523-25). The Proposed Remedial Plan, had it been in effect for the 2012-2018 elections, arguably would have produced more Democratic representatives than the 2012 map. Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 97) (Page ID # 8442).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Plaintiffs also point to deposition testimony that indicates that concerns beyond traditional redistricting criteria factored into the drawing of the 2012 map's lines. For example, DiRossi stated that the map-drawers did not use any system other than visual inspection to ensure that the districts they were drawing were compact. Dkt. 178-7 (DiRossi Dep. at 212) (Page ID # 9705). DiRossi also testified that \"when you [are] doing redistricting and apportionment the first things that everybody want[s] from you [are] maps and indexes, maps and indexes ... the first thing that people wanted were historical political indexes and maps.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 233 (Page ID # 9711).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Defendants attempt to undercut any finding of partisan effect (and relatedly, intent) by arguing that because Democratic members of both the Ohio House of Representatives and State Senate voted for H.B. 369, any partisan effects of the map cannot be attributed to partisan intent. Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 2) (Page ID # 8347). The Plaintiffs assert that even though Democrats did vote for H.B. 369, many expressed their discontent with the bill and the way in which it was enacted arguably without sufficient time for parties to process and discuss its impact. They also argue that because Democrats were outnumbered in both the Ohio House and Senate, they did not have the ability to stop the enactment of the bill and therefore had power only to request minor tweaks to the plan.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 83-84 (Page ID # 8428-29) (noting that Republican State Senator Larry Obhof stated, \"While a lot of Democrats voted for the current map ... they didn't really have a lot of negotiating power at that stage,\" and further noting similar comments by then-Speaker of the State House William Batchelder). We conclude that a reasonable fact-finder could determine that, despite some Democrats having voted to approve H.B. 369, the map was drawn and enacted with partisan intent, and that it had a partisan effect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Lastly, to rebut any contention that the VRA provides a justification for District 11, the Plaintiffs rely on expert Dr. Lisa Handley.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 179-13 (Handley Report). Ohio's \"[c]urrent 11th District is the successor district to the first majority black congressional district created in Ohio in 1968, which has consistently elected African-Americans to Congress since.\" Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.'

Dr. Cho was provided each Plaintiff's home address. Dkt. 179-10 (Cho Report at 11) (Page ID # 9996). From that, she was \"able to determine which district the plaintiff would reside in in each simulated map.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175416\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/735/#p754\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Dr. Cho \"compute[d] the average Democratic vote share for the plaintiff's current district ... from 2012 to 2016[,]\" and then \"calculate[d] the average Democratic vote share for the plaintiff's district in the simulated maps with the 2008-2010 statewide election data.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175416\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/735/#p754\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As a result, Dr. Cho presents \"a comparison of the average Democratic vote share of each plaintiff's current district with the calculated set of average Democratic vote shares for each plaintiff's set of simulated districts.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175416\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/735/#p754\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The sample of simulated maps \"is comprised of 3,037,645 map draws that adhere to ... traditional redistricting principles ...

Some specific examples provide a better illustration. Take Plaintiff Rubin, who lives in District 16. Dr. Cho concludes that \"[a]mong the set of simulated maps, 100% of them would have placed Plaintiff Rubin in a district that would have provided a higher likelihood of electing a Democrat.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 29 (Page ID # 10014).\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    For all the Plaintiffs in other allegedly cracked districts (except one, Plaintiff Thobaben in District 15,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 28 (Page ID # 10013) (79.28%) ), Dr. Cho concluded that, among the simulated maps, 95% or more would have placed the Plaintiffs in a district that would have a higher likelihood of electing a Democrat. This is not to say that the Plaintiffs in these districts have a right to elect a Democrat; this evidence, however, helps to show that a district is cracked.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    On the other end of the spectrum are individual Plaintiffs who assert that their injury is having been packed into heavily Democratic districts. One such example is Plaintiff Inskeep, who lives in District 3. Dr. Cho concludes that, \"[a]mong the set of simulated maps, none of them would have placed Plaintiff Inskeep in a district that would have provided a higher likelihood of electing a Democrat.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15 (Page ID # 10000). Plaintiff Harris, in District 11, and Plaintiff Myer, in District 13, are in the same camp.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24, 26 (Page ID # 10009, 10011). Lastly, Plaintiffs Walker and Rader each live in District 9, and only 15.91% and 13.55% of the simulated maps, respectively, would provide them with a higher likelihood of electing a Democrat.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21-22 (Page ID # 10006-07). Again, this evidence could be understood to indicate that a district has been packed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    After generating the simulated maps, Dr. Cho analyzed that universe of alternative feasible maps for competitiveness, responsiveness, and partisan bias and compared that analysis to the same measures for the current map.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 30-40 (Page ID # 10015-25). This analysis allowed Dr. Cho to assess the comparative partisan bias and effect of the current map. She concluded that \"on an array of partisan metrics that seek to measure either competitiveness or biasedness, the current plan exhibits more partisan unfairness than most of the simulated maps.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 40 (Page ID # 10025). For example, Dr. Cho explains that \"[w]hen voters are 'packed and cracked' into districts, the districts are safe and not competitive[,]\" and concludes that \"it seems that competitiveness was almost a non-existent factor if one at all in the construction of the enacted map since the current districts lean so heavily toward one party.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 32, 37 (Page ID # 10017, 10022).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    We conclude that Dr. Cho's analysis supports the individual Plaintiffs' standing. As the Supreme Court explained in\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    , for partisan gerrymandering claims, the harm of vote dilution \"arises from the particular composition of the voter's own district, which causes his [or her] vote-having been packed or cracked-to carry less weight than it would carry in another, hypothetical district.\"\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1927\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1930-31\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Dr. Cho's report could be interpreted to show just that, on a district-by-district basis, for each individual Plaintiff, which is sufficient to establish their standing at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Dr. Warshaw's report provides additional support for the Plaintiffs' injuries in fact. Dr. Warshaw employs four partisan bias metrics-the efficiency gap, the mean-median\n    gap, symmetry in the vote-seat curve across parties, and declination-to measure the partisan advantage of the current plan. Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 5-13) (Page ID # 8595-8603). Based on these measures, Dr. Warshaw concludes that \"Democratic voters in Ohio are efficiently packed and cracked across districts.... As a result, Ohio's elections are unresponsive to normal shifts in voters' preferences within the historical range of congressional election results in Ohio.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4 (Page ID # 8594). Dr. Warshaw's analyses constitute statewide evidence that bolsters Dr. Cho's district-specific evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The Plaintiffs also propose an alternative map called the Proposed Remedial Plan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 177-3 (Cooper Report at 13) (Page ID # 8521). This Proposed Remedial Plan, in part, lends further support to establishing the individual Plaintiffs' injuries in fact as well as the third requirement for standing-redressability. As Dr. Warshaw concludes, using the same partisan-bias metrics that he used to analyze the current map, \"the remedial plan ... displays very low levels of partisan bias and high levels of responsiveness. Thus, [Dr. Warshaw] believe[s] that the remedial plan would improve the representational link between voters and Ohio's members of Congress.\" Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 43) (Page ID # 8633). In other words, the Proposed Remedial Plan aims to present concrete examples of other possible districts in which the Plaintiffs' votes would carry more weight than they do under the current districts by unpacking and uncracking those voters.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1927\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1931\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    In sum, the Plaintiffs have presented evidence that they actually live in packed or cracked districts and, consequently, that they have suffered injuries in fact. After trial, if this Court accepts this evidence and these experts' conclusions, the Plaintiffs could establish sufficient evidence to maintain standing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1927\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"The facts necessary to establish standing ... must ...

For example, Dr. Cho states that \"\n    <em>\n     none\n    </em>\n    of [her simulated maps] had the same 12-4 seat share as in the challenged map.\" Dkt. 179-10 (Cho Report at 40) (Page ID # 10025) (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 33-37 (Page ID # 10018-10022) (analyzing competitiveness and concluding that the simulated maps are more competitive than the current map, thus providing evidence that the current map packs and cracks voters). Moreover, Plaintiffs' expert Cooper provides evidence that the current districts cause the individual Plaintiffs' injuries.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 177-3 (Cooper Report). Specifically, Cooper drew a Proposed Remedial Plan that splits fewer counties and adheres to traditional redistricting principles (\"one-person-one-vote, incumbent non-pairing where possible, compactness, contiguity, the non-dilution of minority voting strength, and respect for communities of interest\").\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 11, 14-18 (Page ID # 8519, 8522-26). Cooper further shows that his Proposed Remedial Plan \"undoes the partisan gerrymander by giving Democratic voters a better opportunity to elect their candidates of choice than under the 2012 Plan.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18 (Page ID # 8526);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 20 (Page ID # 8528) (Figure 8: comparing, district-by-district, 2012-2016 elections results under the 2012 plan with what the results may have been under the Proposed Remedial Plan). As mentioned, Dr. Warshaw's report bolsters this conclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 177-5 (Warshaw Report at 43) (Page ID # 8633).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <em>\n     Redressability\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Finally, the Plaintiffs have established for the purposes of summary judgment that a favorable decision would redress their injuries because they seek an injunction that prohibits the State from conducting future elections under the current map and, in its place, the implementation of a non-gerrymandered map that does not dilute their votes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 37 (Second Am. Compl. at 51 - 52) (Page ID # 337-38). The Proposed Remedial Plan offers one possible example of how such a non-gerrymandered map might be drawn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <strong>\n     b. First Amendment Claims\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    For the individual Plaintiffs' standing to bring their First Amendment claims, we first note that, to the extent that the First Amendment theory is based upon vote dilution, the same analysis applies as in the Fourteenth Amendment context.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Benisek\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n     348 F.Supp.3d at 514\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[Voters] have a right under the First Amendment not to have the value of their vote diminished\n    <em>\n     because of\n    </em>\n    the political views they have expressed through their party affiliation and voting history. Put simply, partisan vote dilution, when intentionally imposed, involves the State penalizing voters for expressing a viewpoint while, at the same time, rewarding voters for expressing the opposite viewpoint.\"). We therefore conclude that, for purposes of summary judgment, the individual Plaintiffs have established standing for their First Amendment vote-dilution claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    A separate analysis, however, applies to the First Amendment associational claim. In her\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    concurrence, Justice Kagan explained why the plaintiffs in that case failed to establish standing under this theory: \"[The plaintiffs] did not emphasize their membership in [the Democratic] [P]arty, or their activities supporting it. And they did not speak to any tangible associational burdens-ways the gerrymander had debilitated their party or weakened its ability to carry out its core functions and purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1927\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1939\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Kagan, J., concurring). Accordingly, to establish standing on their associational claim, the individual Plaintiffs must (1) point to evidence of their membership in and activities supporting the Democratic Party, and (2) to establish an injury in fact, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the allegedly gerrymandered map weakened their party's ability to carry out its core functions and purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The remainder of this section will focus on the individual Plaintiffs' standing to bring this First Amendment associational claim. We conclude that they have put forward sufficient evidence to establish standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    <em>\n     Injury in Fact &amp; Causation\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    First, the individual Plaintiffs self-identify as Democrats or Democratic voters and actively support the Democratic Party.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 102-34) (Page ID # 8447-79). The individual Plaintiffs describe numerous examples of how the allegedly gerrymandered districts hinder their ability to engage in a variety of political activities-from voter apathy disrupting the party's mobilization and candidate recruitment efforts, to decreased fundraising, to both a general decline in political activity in districts (such as candidates not appearing at forums) and an inability meaningfully to influence representatives because the election results are essentially predetermined.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1927\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 177 (Pls.'

Moreover, the Plaintiffs point out that, despite Democrats winning between 39% and 47% of the state-wide vote, Democratic candidates have won only 25% of Ohio's congressional elections under the current map; meanwhile, the Republican state-wide vote share has fluctuated between 51% and 59%, but Republican candidates have won 75% of those elections. Dkt. 177 (Pls.' Opp'n to Summ. J. at 21) (Page ID # 8297). Part of Dr. Cho's analysis provides additional support.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 179-12 (Cho Suppl.

We discuss the organizational Plaintiffs' standing separately, however, because the injuries that they allege are somewhat different in nature.

She stated that \"it's been challenging based on the way this map is currently drawn, because folks have been feeling like, you know, [their] voices aren't being heard.

Oberdorf testified that members of her organization did informal outreach\n    to their friends in the lead-up to election and the most common reason that they identified for not planning to vote was that they felt that their votes did not matter. Dkt. 177-28 (Oberdorf Dep. at 70-71) (Page ID # 9548-49). Oberdorf testified that OSU students living near campus reside in the 3rd, 12th, and 15th congressional districts.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 103 (Page ID # 9560). She testified that having students split among the three different districts made it more difficult to \"disseminate information on elections\" and caused confusion among students \"who just assume that they can vote in the same area that their friends can.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 69 (Page ID # 9547).

Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.' Resp. to Proposed Undisputed Facts at 149) (Page ID # 8494). Nathaniel Simon is HCYD's Rule 30(b)(6) representative. At his deposition, Simon testified that he believes that under the Plaintiffs' Proposed Remedial Plan \"it would be much easier to engage voters and members about which district they live in and which candidates to advocate for\" because under the current map \"the City of Cincinnati is split, and so there's a lot of confusion regarding which candidate represents which individual and which area.\" Dkt. 178-3 (Simon Dep. at 20) (Page ID # 9639).

As to the organizational Plaintiffs' standing in their own right, they generally characterize their injury as a harmed ability to associate-\"the map mak[ing] it more difficult to engage voters, [requiring them to] use additional resources, and impair[ing] the efficacy of their work.\" Dkt. 177 (Pls.' Opp'n to Summ. J. at 58) (Page ID # 8334). As catalogued above, they offer testimonial evidence that raises a question of fact as to whether there is a \"causal connection between the injury and the challenged conduct\"-that the districts in the enacted map are at least in part responsible for the associational difficulties that the organizations face.\n    <em>\n     Miami Valley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070367\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/571/#p576\">\n     725 F.3d at 576\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Finally, the organizational Plaintiffs have also raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether \"the requested relief will redress the injury\"-whether redrawing\n    the districts, for example in the manner advocated by the Proposed Remedial Plan, would allow the parties to allocate resources more efficiently and to engage with voters in a more effective manner or whether more competitive districts would decrease the voter apathy that hinders the organizations' work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    At this stage in the litigation, the organizational Plaintiffs have established associational standing on behalf of their members for the vote-dilution claims (both under the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause) as well.

The Democratic organizations' members are Ohio Democratic voters, and the Plaintiffs have pointed to evidence from which it could be inferred that such voters were intentionally placed in packed and cracked districts where the power of their votes would be diluted. We have detailed this evidence in the context of the individual Plaintiffs above. More particularly, the OSU College Democrats \"generally live in the Third, Twelfth or Fifteenth Congressional Districts\" and \"the bulk of the members are registered to vote at their school address.\" Dkt. 177-1 (Pls.'

Finally, LWVO has 2,700 to 2,800 members in Ohio, some of whom reside in each of Ohio's sixteen U.S. congressional districts, which they claim are packed or cracked, resulting in dilution of their votes.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 134-35 (Page ID # 8479-80).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    The organizational Plaintiffs have also established that the interests that they seek to protect in this litigation \"are germane to the organization's purpose.\"\n    <em>\n     Friends of Tims Ford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481330\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/955/#p967\">\n     585 F.3d at 967\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Hunt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179268\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/333/#p343\">\n     432 U.S. at 343\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179268\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/333/#p343\">\n     97 S.Ct. 2434\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). NEOYBD, OSU Democrats, and HCYD seek to organize Democratic voters to elect Democratic candidates. They point to testimony from which a reasonable fact-finder could infer that these aims are hindered by the current district map. Additionally, OAPRI and LWVO seek to engage and educate voters and they argue that these efforts are hampered by packed or cracked districts that dilute people's votes, which in turn causes voter apathy and confusion. In fact, all of the organizational Plaintiffs have stated that voter confusion and apathy have resulted from the current map's alleged packing and cracking of voters, making the organizations' work more difficult and forcing them to expend greater resources to counteract these results. The organizations have averred that the uncompetitive races in certain districts resulting from the current districting mean that candidates and representatives are less responsive to the organizations\n    and less likely to attend voter forums that they organize.
