Plaintiffs responded in opposition (Doc. 18), and Defendant replied (Doc. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are four individuals-residents of Florida, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, respectively-seeking to represent a nationwide class of consumers who purchased glucosamine dietary supplements at Wal-Mart. (Doc. 1 at 1-2.) Plaintiffs assert that \"glucosamine sulfate has been shown to reduce the pain of osteoarthritis, in knees in particular, and can be equally as effective as Tylenol and some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Plaintiffs allege, however, that Defendant's glucosamine supplement label lists glucosamine sulfate as an ingredient \"when in fact the supplements contain glucosamine hydrochloride and potassium sulfate, less expensive ingredients with no proven efficacy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Plaintiffs assert that \"Defendant has long known that there is scant or conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of glucosamine hydrochloride for the treatment of osteoarthritis,\" and \"knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that its representations regarding the Glucosamine dietary supplements it sold were false or deceptive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Put simply, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's mislabeled glucosamine supplements induced them to purchase a product that was ineffective and unfit for treating their joint pain and seek monetary damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs advance seven specific claims for relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Count I\n   </strong>\n   - Breach of implied warranties in violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II\n   </strong>\n   - Breach of implied warranties in violation of Florida, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin state law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Count III\n   </strong>\n   - Unjust enrichment or quasi-contract;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Count IV\n   </strong>\n   - Negligent misrepresentation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Count V\n   </strong>\n   - Violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VI\n   </strong>\n   - Violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VII\n   </strong>\n   - Unfair trade practices in violation of Wisconsin state law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Doc. 1 at 19-32.)

The FDCA provides a specific protocol for testing compliance with the NLEA: under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), compliance with the labeling requirement is determined by testing twelve consumer packages of the food, taken from twelve randomly chosen shipping cases, using \"appropriate methods as given in the 'Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,' or, if no AOAC method is available or appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they discovered a mixture of glucosamine hydrochloride and potassium sulfate when they subjected \"individual crystals from samples of Defendant's supplement\" to \"Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).\" (Doc. 1 at 9.) Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendant's supplements fail to meet NLEA standards based on the FDCA protocol.

(Doc. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Still, the Court finds the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   persuasive insofar as it suggests that any NLEA claim that relies on scientific testing of a food's nutritional components must include an allegation that the food does not meet the labeling requirements when subjected to the twelve-sample FDCA protocol. In light of\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds that Plaintiffs' complaint must include an allegation that\n   the Defendant's supplement fails to meet the NLEA requirements when tested by the FDCA protocol. In other words, a plaintiff must allege the failure to meet the FDCA standard to have pled a viable NLEA violation. Plaintiffs have not done so here and therefore the Court will dismiss Counts II through VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Put simply, Plaintiffs have failed to allege a necessary element for a NLEA violation, and therefore they cannot state a facially plausible MMWA claim. And, because the Supremacy Clause preempts state-law labeling requirements unless they are identical to the NLEA, Plaintiffs' state-law claims fail for the same reasons. That said, the Court will also follow\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   in granting Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to resolve their failure to allege the prerequisite testing, if they can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.
