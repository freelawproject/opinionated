Hill Intake Dept.,\" the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, and \"Class Action Law Suit for Previous Complaints and Non-Compliance of Misdirection for Overcrowding and Mistreatment of Inmates Due Process Public Safety and Welfare of Prisoners,\" raising claims regarding conditions of confinement during his recent incarceration at the George W. Hill Correctional Facility (\"GWHCF\"). (ECF No. 2.) He has also filed a Motion for Leave to Proceed\n   <em>\n    In Forma Pauperis\n   </em>\n   . (ECF No. 1.) For the following reasons, the Court will grant DiMaio leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his Complaint with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Complaint suggests that DiMaio was incarcerated at the GWHCF from July 10, 2018 through December 10, 2018. (Compl. at 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alleges that during this time, he was confined in a 6' x 9' cell with two other men. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) DiMaio refers to \"levels of stress and anger, feeding and sleeping 1 hour free time and non-compliance of [guards] for medical attention and secure sleeping quarters for individuals correcting for errors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He \"ended up going to medical unit (infirmary) for other open-ended argu[ ]ments and [unintelligible] of self affirming differences with other inmates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As relief, DiMaio is \"only asking and recommending for [himself] a subsidiary amount allocated to [him].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) He suggests that $ 50.00 per day of incarceration, or a total of $ 900.00, would be sufficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court will grant DiMaio leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that he is incapable of paying the fees to commence this civil action.

The Court of Common Pleas, however, is also not a \"person\" subject to liability under \u00a7 1983 and, in any event, is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from DiMaio's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Will v.

Additional Deficiencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DiMaio takes issue with the fact that he had to share a cell with two other men during his incarceration at the GWHCF.

Thus, DiMaio's Complaint fails to state a claim with respect to his allegations of overcrowding at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DiMaio also appears to take issue with the fact that he only received one hour of \"free time,\" presumably per day. The Court construes DiMaio's claim to be one that he should have received more time for recreation.

Accordingly, DiMaio cannot maintain his claims regarding the lack of more recreation at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DiMaio also appears to suggest that he did not receive adequate medical care during his incarceration at the GWHCF. In the context of deficiencies in medical care, an inmate's rights are violated under either the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment if a prison official acts with deliberate indifference to an inmate's serious medical needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer v.

DiMaio, however, has not provided any facts regarding the needs for which he needed medical care. Moreover, as discussed above, DiMaio cannot proceed against any of the named Defendants. Accordingly, he has failed to state a claim regarding the denial of adequate medical care at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant DiMaio leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his Complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii).
