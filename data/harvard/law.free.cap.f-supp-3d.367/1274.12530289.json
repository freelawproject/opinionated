Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Genentech manufactures, markets and distributes Herceptin \u00ae (hereafter, \"Herceptin\"), a biologic drug used to treat breast cancer. Plaintiffs are cancer treatment providers who have purchased Herceptin for treatment of their patients. Plaintiffs do not challenge the efficacy or safety of the drug, but contend that Herceptin's labeling is misleading because, although the Herceptin label states that each vial contains 440 mg of Herceptin at a concentration of 21 mg/mL, not every vial contains that amount or more. They assert California state law claims for breach of express and implied warranties and unjust enrichment, and they seek actual damages, costs and attorneys' fees. Doc. 45 at 13-20. Genentech, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, contends that Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Here, in contrast, the regulatory scheme expressly allows a range of \"reasonable variations\" for solid drugs sold in vials, and Plaintiffs' state-law claims conflict with these regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs' Claims are Inconsistent with Federal Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Herceptin is a Solid Drug\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Herceptin should be considered a \"liquid drug\" subject to the requirement that the label \"express the minimum quantity\" as a measure of volume, rather than as a \"solid drug.\" However, regulatory history establishes that the FDA has always considered Herceptin to be a \"solid drug.\" The FDA approved the BLA with a label that referenced a net weight of 440 mg and a fill weight specification allowing deviations both above and below 440 mg. (Doc. 377-14, Def. Ex. 14, Dep. of David T. Lin, at 139:2-12 (\"When [Herceptin ] was approved in 1998, FDA treated it as a solid drug.\"). Moreover, the FDA has repeatedly approved this labeling for nearly two decades, and when it approved the updated labeling in 2017, it inserted the phrase \"for injection\" next to the product name \"HERCEPTIN \u00ae (trastuzumad),\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   thereby reaffirming that it considers Herceptin to be a solid drug. Doc. 377-15, Def. Ex. 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The FDA's 2014 Draft Guidance is not Retroactive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the Court should give deference to the FDA's conclusion in 2014 that Herceptin labeling did not comply with the 2014 Draft Guidance, in which it stated that the labeling of\n   all injectable products, including those reconstituted from a solid, must reflect the minimum quantity of drug product that can be withdrawn from the vial. However, this argument is based on Plaintiffs' faulty premise that the Draft Guidance merely restated standards in place since the FDA originally approved Herceptin's BLA in 1998. As the regulatory history of Herceptin establishes, this is not true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, from a legal stand point, Guidances are prospective in nature absent a contrary instruction from the FDA. Doc. 201-5, Ex. 5, Lin Dec., \u00b6\u00b6 62-71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Draft Guidance itself states that its recommendations \"apply to new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), as well as new packaging supplement to these existing applications submitted to CDER and CBER.\" Doc. 368-31, Pls. Ex. 31, FDA Draft Guidance for Industry,\n   <em>\n    Allowable Excess Volume and Labeled Vial Fill Size in Injectable Drug and Biologic Products\n   </em>\n   , at 1 (March 2014). Here, there is no dispute that the BLA for Herceptin was approved more than 15 years before the 2014 Draft Guidance was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs' argument ignores Herceptin's approval history. The uncontroverted facts establish the FDA-approved BLA disclosed that although the protein content label claim was 440 mg, the vials were intended to deliver only 400 mg, and that in 1999, the FDA drafted a letter to providers explicitly referring to the fact that the vial was designed to deliver 400 mg. It was not until 2014 that the FDA raised concerns about the labeling of Herceptin, and although Genentech promptly submitted proposed revisions, the FDA waited until 2017 to respond to Genentech's proposal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, the Court declines to apply the FDA's Draft Guidance retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Herceptin's Protein Content Variations Satisfied FDA Regulatory Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Net quantity labeling for solid drugs is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.51\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package.\n   <em>\n    Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized.

Variations shall comply with the limitations provided in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (emphasis added). The regulatory history of Herceptin clearly establishes that the FDA considers it to be a solid drug. It is\n   undisputed that the protein content of the Herceptin 440 mg vials has always been within the total protein specification of 440 mg \u00b1 35 mg (405 mg to 475 mg) approved by the FDA. Thus, at all relevant times, Genentech complied with the unambiguous terms of Section 201.51(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

Likewise, since at least April 2000, the carton label has stated that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    nominal\n   </em>\n   content of each HERCEPTIN vial is 440 mg Trastuzumab.\" Doc. 201-7, Ex. 7 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The undisputed facts establish that the FDA has always treated Herceptin as a solid drug, and has allowed reasonable variations as provided in the USP. Additionally, USP General Chapter &lt; 905&gt;,\n   <em>\n    Uniformity of Dosage Units\n   </em>\n   , provides for an allowable variation of 15% around the label claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.51\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

There, the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Our pre-emption cases presume that an actor seeking to satisfy both his federal-and state-law obligations is not required to cease acting altogether in order to avoid liability. Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility pre-emption would be \"all but meaningless.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The incoherence of the stop-selling theory becomes plain when viewed through the lens of our previous cases.

It would, of course, have been possible for drug manufacturers like PLIVA to pull their products from the market altogether. In so doing, they would have avoided\n   liability under both state and federal law: such manufacturers would neither have labeled their products in a way that rendered them unsafe nor impermissibly changed any federally approved label.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Similarly, in this case, Genentech cannot be forced to stop selling vials that comply with FDA requirements in order to avoid liability under state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
