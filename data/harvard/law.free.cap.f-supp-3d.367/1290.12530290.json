(Dkt. No. 29.) Plaintiff, the Town of Dutch John, filed its memorandum in opposition to County Defendants' motion on September 10, 2018. (Dkt. No. 32.) County Defendants filed a reply in response to Plaintiff's opposition on September 24, 2018. (Dkt. No. 35.) On January 10, 2019, the court heard oral argument on County Defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings, as well as Defendant Daggett County Redevelopment Agency's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. Nos. 25, 29, and 42.) At the conclusion of the hearing, the court opted to take the matter under advisement with a written order to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court now enters the following order granting Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, the Town of Dutch John (the \"Town\"), is located in Daggett County, Utah near Flaming Gorge Reservoir, and was incorporated as a town in 2015. (Dkt. No. 2 at 2.) Prior to its incorporation, it was referred to as the \"Dutch John community,\" and was founded by the Secretary of the Interior in 1958 on Bureau of Reclamation land as authorized by the April 11, 1956 Colorado River Storage Project Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Dutch John's central statutory purpose was to \"house personnel, administrative offices, and equipment for project construction and operation of the Flaming Gorge Dam and Reservoir.\" (Dkt. No. 34-1 at 3.) Permanent structures like houses, administrative offices, equipment storage and maintenance buildings, and other public facilities were constructed, owned, and maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1968, Public Law 90-540 then \"assigned responsibility for administration, protection, and development of the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area to the Secretary of Agriculture\" while providing that Colorado River Storage Project lands and waters \"would continue to be administered by the Secretary of Interior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The statute included Bureau of Reclamation\n   land surrounding the Flaming Gorge Reservoir (including the Dutch John community) within its description of the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area boundaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to 1998, most structures within the Dutch John community were administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, including the community's schools and public buildings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The federal government thus owned and operated a large portion of Dutch John community lands until 1998, when Congress passed the Dutch John Federal Property Disposition and Assistance Act (\"the Privatization Act\"). (Dkt. No. 2 at 4.) This act privatized many of the community's lands, and was passed \"[t]o dispose of certain Federal properties located in Dutch John, Utah, to assist the local government in the interim delivery of basic services to the Dutch John community, and for other purposes.\" (Dkt. No. 34-1 at 3.) After the Act was enacted into law, the federal government began disposing of the property as the Act directed, including transferring certain properties to Daggett County (the \"County\") without consideration and offering other properties for sale as designated by the Act. (Dkt. No. 24 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In enacting the Privatization Act, Congress found, inter alia, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The Federal Government was unnecessarily burdened with the cost of operating the Dutch John community, including providing basic services and maintaining facilities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Daggett County was also \"interested in reducing the financial burden the County experience[d] in providing local government support services to [the Dutch John] community that produce[d] little direct tax revenue because of Federal ownership\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Withdrawing the Federal Government's role in providing basic direct community services to Dutch John would require local government to provide the services at a substantial cost;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Dutch John residents were interested in purchasing the homes they were renting from the Secretary of the Interior;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Dutch John residents were interested in self-government;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Available private lands were insufficient to meet Flaming Gorge area visitors' growing demands for commercial recreational services and private development; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Privatization and disposal of certain lands in Dutch John would be in the public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Specifically, Plaintiff's interpretation is untenable because 1) the Act only \"authorizes\" the federal government to sell its properties (identified in Section 4) according to Section 10's instructions for disposing of those properties, and never mentions\n   the County's subsequent sales of its conveyed residual property; 2) the Act only imposes its \"fair market value\" requirements (e.g., appraisal and selling) on the federal government; and 3) Plaintiff's interpretation contradicts the Act's plain requirement that residual properties must be conveyed to the County \"without consideration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    I. \"The Sale of Properties as Authorized by this Act\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because Section 10(m) of the Act is the central provision at issue in this case, the court begins with the text of that provision. Section 10(m) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [A]ll revenues derived from the sale of properties as authorized by this Act shall temporarily be deposited in a segregated interest-bearing trust account in the Treasury with the moneys on hand in the account paid to Daggett County semiannually to be used by the County for purposes associated with the provision of governmental and community services to the Dutch John Community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The meaning of the language of Section 10(m) is plain on its face: if the sale of any property is authorized by this Act, revenues from that sale must be deposited in a designated U.S. Treasury account. Yet the text itself signals that the court must look beyond that isolated provision to the context of the statute as a whole to determine which \"sale[s] of properties\" the Act authorizes. Such an examination of Section 10(m)'s place within the context of the entire statutory scheme enables the court to decide whether or not the County's revenues from residual property sales must also be deposited with the Treasury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Throughout the entirety of the Act, the federal government is explicitly identified as the principal actor carrying out its essential requirements. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 Section 4 of the Act instructs the federal government to identify lands unnecessary for support of the respective agencies and to dispose of those lands;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 Section 6 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer jurisdiction over those identified lands to the Secretary of the Interior;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 Section 8 requires the federal government to develop a land use plan and ensure that disposal processes are consistent with said plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 Section 9 requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct appraisals to determine the fair market value of properties designated for disposal under Section 4; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 Section 10 instructs the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of properties identified for disposal under Section 4, and to convey any residual properties to Daggett County without consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   By contrast, Plaintiff has failed to identify a single provision that even addresses the County's disposal of residual properties conveyed to it under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, upon examining the Act in its entirety, the court finds that Section 10 authorizes disposition of those properties \"identified for disposal under section 4,\" and Section 10 only authorizes the federal government (both explicitly and implicitly) to sell certain properties identified under Section 4 for disposal. Simply put, no other provision in the Act authorizes the sale of properties, and Section 10 only authorizes the federal government to conduct such sales. The court thus finds it apparent from both the specific context of Section 10 and the broader context of the statute as a whole that the Act's drafters never intended that the County's subsequent sales of residual property would be subject to Section 10(m)'s requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nor does the County need the Act's \"authorization\" to sell its properties conveyed\n   to it by the Secretary of the Interior. Under Utah law, \"[a] fee simple title is presumed to be intended to pass by a conveyance of real estate, unless it appears from the conveyance that a lesser estate was intended.\" Utah Code \u00a7 57-1-3. Plaintiff has shown no evidence that the Act intended for residual property conveyed by the Secretary of the Interior to the County to be a lesser estate than fee simple. The Act does not reserve continuing control over the residual properties or provide that any post-conveyance obligations bind their future disposition. As County Defendants persuasively observe, \"[n]othing [in the Act] indicates that the obligations binding the Secretary of the Interior somehow run with the land or otherwise continue through subsequent conveyances.\" (Dkt. No. 29 at 11.) Absent clear language to the contrary, the presumption in favor of fee simple title conveyance strongly favors County Defendants' interpretation of Section 10(m). Accordingly, because the County does not require authorization to sell its fee simple properties after conveyance, it cannot be said that such residual property sales are \"authorized by this Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff argues that because the language of 10(m) is silent regarding who the specific seller is, the best interpretation of \"revenues derived from the sale of properties\" includes revenues from \"the sale of properties not retained by the federal government and authorized to be sold by the Act by either the Secretary of the Interior\n   <em>\n    or the County\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Dkt. No. 32 at 8) (emphasis added.) The problem with this interpretation is that the Act never refers to, much less \"authorizes,\" such subsequent residual property sales by the County. The Act only requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey residual properties to the County without consideration, and never once mentions any future requirements for the County with respect to disposition of those properties. The court declines to \"read into the statute a mandatory provision that Congress declined to supply.\"\n   <em>\n    Illinois Public Telecommunications Ass'n v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307628,4280799\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/1018/\">\n    752 F.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that even if the County's interpretation of Section 10(m) is reasonable, the legislative intent and history demonstrate that Plaintiff's interpretation should control. (See Dkt. No. 32 at 13.) Plaintiff asserts that the Act's purposes listed in Section 2(b) are predominantly to provide services to the Town, serve the interests of the residents of Dutch John, and help reduce the cost of such services, and that accordingly the \"Town's interpretation [of Section 10(m) ] coalesces with the Act's stated purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) It also asserts that a U.S. Senate floor speech from the original bill's author, Senator Orrin Hatch, confirms that the Town's interpretation is most consistent with the Act's legislative intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   While true that courts interpreting particular statutory language should also look to \"the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy\" for guidance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court\n   here finds that Plaintiff's interpretation of Section 10(m) is not required to serve the Act's stated purposes. For instance, the Act states that its purpose is \"to serve the interests of the residents of Dutch John\n   <em>\n    and Daggett County, Utah\n   </em>\n   , and the general public.\" Act \u00a7 2(b)(8),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%203041\">\n    112 Stat. 3041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Furthermore, in passing the Act Congress also found that \"Daggett County, Utah, is interested in reducing the financial burden the County experiences in providing local government support services to a community that produces little direct tax revenue because of Federal ownership\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%203041\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(a)(4)(B),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%203041\">\n    112 Stat. 3041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Plaintiff's legislative purpose argument is at best inconclusive in determining which of the two interpretations of Section 10(m) is most sound. And while the court deems examination of the Act's legislative history to be wholly unnecessary here,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   it notes that Senator Hatch's floor statement is likewise ambiguous on this issue as it does not clearly state which specific sales revenues should \"be used for costs related to Dutch John.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Therefore, the Act's plain language demonstrates that Section 10(m) does not require the County to pay its revenues derived from the sale of residual properties to the Treasury to be split between the federal government and Dutch John government and community services. That provision only applies to the federal government's property sales explicitly authorized under Section 10. Section 10(m) is not reasonably susceptible to any other interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    II. \"Fair Market Value\" Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The parties agree that the Act requires the federal government to sell its designated property for fair market value and to deposit those revenues in the U.S. Treasury, with 15.1% for the Treasury's general fund and the remainder to be paid to the County semiannually to provide governmental and community services to the Dutch John community. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 29 at 3.) However, as with Section 10(m), nothing in the Act's language, broader statutory scheme, or purpose requires the County to sell its conveyed residual property for fair market value. Instead, as County Defendants convincingly observe, each of the Act's provisions that Plaintiff cites regarding the requirement to sell property for fair market value \"explicitly or implicitly discuss sales by the federal government, not the county.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Plaintiff has failed to show that those sections even mention the County, much less obligate it to sell its property for fair market value in the same way as the federal government. Incorporating the reasoning above, the court likewise refuses to read this supposed fair market value requirement into the Act where Congress declined to supply it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Regarding the required fair market value appraisals, the Act also explicitly specifies in detail how the Secretary of the Interior will pay for conducting these appraisals: funds are to be derived from the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund. Act \u00a7 2(a)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%203046\">\n    112 Stat. 3046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As County Defendants persuasively argue, however, when residual properties are conveyed to the County after two years, numerous prior appraisals would need to be updated to allow those properties to be sold for fair market value. The Act does not mention updating the appraisals, nor how the County is supposed to pay for them, even though it went into great detail on these points regarding the federal government's\n   initial appraisals. Thus under Dutch John's interpretation, \"the federal government saddles the county with funding those appraisals itself. The county can't ... even use revenues from selling the conveyed property to cover those costs because those must be paid to the Treasury and split between the Treasury's general fund and services for the town.\" (Dkt. No. 29 at 12.) Besides the fact that the Act's plain language provides no support for this appraisal requirement, Plaintiff's interpretation would directly undermine the Act's purposes of providing financial assistance to local government and reducing the County's financial burden in providing community support services to the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court therefore holds that the Act's requirements for properties to be sold for their appraised fair market value does not apply to the residual properties conveyed to the County. The Act is not reasonably susceptible to Plaintiff's interpretation on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Properties Conveyed \"without Consideration\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Section 10 of the Act also provides that designated residences or lots, unoccupied platted lots, special use permit land, and church land that remains unpurchased after two years must be conveyed by the Secretary of the Interior \"to Daggett County without consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act \u00a7\u00a7 10(e)(4), 10(f)(1) &amp; (7), 10(g)(1) &amp; (6), 10(i)(1) &amp; (3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%203049\">\n    112 Stat. 3049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -51. Yet Plaintiff's interpretation of Section 10(m) would require the County to pay 15.1% of the revenues it derives from its residual properties directly to the U.S. Treasury, with an additional limitation that the remaining 84.9% be used exclusively for the benefit of the Dutch John community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Indeed, it is unclear from Plaintiff's interpretation what benefit (financial or otherwise) Daggett County would receive at all from such a conveyance. By contrast, the financial burdens of such an arrangement (including appraisals, marketing, closing, and maintenance of such properties) together with the expense of running the Town\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   would far exceed the benefit of the $ 300,000 annual payment the County receives under Section 13(b) to defray those costs. This would likewise be incompatible with the Act's purpose of reducing the County's financial burden of providing services to the Dutch John community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is a fundamental canon of statutory interpretation that courts should not \"construe a statute in a way that renders words or phrases meaningless, redundant, or superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Bridger Coal Co./Pac.

Plaintiff's proposed interpretation of the Act would render the phrase \"without consideration\" both ineffective and meaningless in each of these provisions, conflicting directly with the requirement that the land be conveyed by the federal government without consideration. The court instead opts to interpret Section 10(m) harmoniously with the Act's many requirements that residual property be conveyed to the County \"without consideration.\" Requiring\n   the County to pay 15.1% of its revenues from those sales to the U.S. Treasury, together with limiting what the County can do with the remaining 84.9% of revenues, would certainly constitute consideration for purposes of the Act, making it incompatible with the Act's plain requirements. Accordingly, application of these canons of interpretation likewise confirms that County Defendants' interpretation of the Act is more textually sound than Plaintiff's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, statutes should be interpreted to avoid absurd results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

While the language of Section 10(m) does not reasonably allow for alternative constructions in the first place, the court notes that Plaintiff's proposed interpretation of the Act would yield the absurdly inefficient result of requiring the County to take revenue from its sales of residual property conveyed to it by the federal government and deposit all of that revenue into federal coffers, only to have the U.S. Treasury then return that money back to the County on a semiannual basis, which the County must in turn spend exclusively on Dutch John's services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 29 at 8-9.) As County Defendants persuasively inquire: \"Is the county entrusted to turn over to the Treasury all its sales revenues, yet not trusted to be able to deduct the 84.9% the Treasury will eventually give back [to the county]? Why is the county only semiannually considered a good steward over the money to be spent on the town?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff provides no satisfactory answer to these legitimate questions. Thus, Plaintiff's interpretation would also yield an absurd outcome that Congress plainly did not contemplate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, County Defendants' Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings is hereby GRANTED.
