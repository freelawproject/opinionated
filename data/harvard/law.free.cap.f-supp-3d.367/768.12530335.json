(collectively \"Regions\"). The plaintiffs, Michael and Beverly Harris, have filed a Response in opposition (Docket No. 199), to which Regions has filed a Reply (Docket No. 200). For the reasons discussed herein, the motion will be granted and the plaintiffs' claims against Regions will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2006, Michael and Beverly Harris purchased a house on the Cumberland River. They obtained a mortgage through Regions. The deed of trust required the plaintiffs to keep the house insured against flood hazards. Prior to the August 21, 2006 closing date, Regions contracted with CoreLogic, a flood certification company, to provide a flood zone determination for the house. Buyers securing loans for houses in flood zones are required by lenders to purchase flood insurance pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"NFIA\"). Flood zones are determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") and demarcated on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (\"FIRMs\"). The FIRM in place at the time (the \"1981 FIRM\") showed that the house was in a flood zone, but CoreLogic incorrectly determined that the house was not in a flood zone and that flood insurance was thus not required. The plaintiffs did not purchase flood insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 20, 2006, FEMA issued a revised FIRM (the \"2006 FIRM\"). In late September or early October, Regions informed the plaintiffs that their house was in a flood zone under the 2006 FIRM and that flood insurance was thus required. The plaintiffs hired an insurance agent named David Vandenbergh to obtain a policy, which he procured from Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\"). There are two types of policies relevant to this dispute: \"pre-FIRM\" policies, which cover houses built before implementation of the 1981 FIRM, and \"post-FIRM\" policies, which cover houses built after implementation of the 1981 FIRM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2059.1\">\n    44 C.F.R. \u00a7 59.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"Existing construction\" and \"New construction\"). As a precondition to purchasing insurance, buyers purchasing post-FIRM policies are required to obtain an elevation certificate showing that the house is sufficiently elevated above the base flood zone. If part of a post-FIRM house falls below the elevation line, that part of the house is uninsurable. Buyers purchasing pre-FIRM policies do not need an elevation certificate because pre-FIRM houses are fully insurable, regardless of elevation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.3\">\n    44 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (outlining elevation certificate requirements). The plaintiffs were told that their house was a pre-FIRM property built before the 1981 FIRM was implemented\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that they were therefore not required to obtain an elevation certificate. However, this information was wrong. The plaintiffs' house was built in 1984, making it a \"post-FIRM\" property that did require an elevation certificate. As a result, the house was not fully insurable. The plaintiffs did not know that they had been misinformed or that the house was not fully insurable. They purchased a pre-FIRM policy that did not require an elevation certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2010, a 1000-year flood filled the plaintiffs' house with sixteen inches of water. The plaintiffs filed a claim with Nationwide under their policy. Nationwide responded that their rating information was incomplete because the plaintiffs' house required an elevation certificate. An elevation analysis was conducted, and a flood adjuster determined that the bottom floor of the plaintiffs' home was not insured under the policy because it was situated below the base flood-zone elevation. As a result, Nationwide did not cover damages sustained to the bottom floor of the house, including damage to the plaintiffs' personal property therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 2, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a Complaint in this court. (Docket No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CoreLogic filed a Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 25), which was granted (Docket No. 54). The court held that the common law negligence claims against CoreLogic were precluded by the NFIA. Regions then filed its own Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. Docket No. 60), which also was granted. (Docket No. 80.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the Sixth Circuit reversed, without ruling on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims. The Sixth Circuit's narrow decision held that the NFIA does not create an implied private right of action but also does not foreclose state common law claims.\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Nationwide Mut.

Rather, Rule 9(b) exists predominantly for the same purpose as Rule 8: to provide a defendant fair notice of the substance of a plaintiff's claim in order that the defendant may prepare a responsive pleading. Rule 9(b), however, also reflects the rulemakers' additional understanding that, in cases involving fraud and mistake, a more specific form of notice is necessary to permit a defendant to draft a responsive pleading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

With regard to the alleged misrepresentation prior to closing that the house was not in a flood zone, the plaintiffs allege that CoreLogic supplied false information via the inaccurate flood certification report. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 5 (\"[T]he Harrises and Regions were provided with flood certification information at the closing on the house, and the company providing the flood certification was [CoreLogic] ); Docket No. 184 at 2 ( [B]ased upon [CoreLogic's] flood certification, the Harrises and Regions were informed that they need not procure flood insurance at the time they purchased the house and procured the mortgage on the house.\").) The only allegations implicating Regions state that \"Regions further misrepresented to Plaintiffs the accuracy of the flood certification report and induced Plaintiffs to rely upon this report.\" (Docket No. 184 at 3.) The plaintiffs also allege that Regions \"supplied faulty information meant to guide Plaintiffs by failing to verify that the [house] was not in a flood zone prior to Plaintiffs' purchase of the property. Moreover, [Regions] failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating information regarding the flood certification determination, even though [it] certified the accuracy of the information provided.\" (Docket No. 184 at 4.) Failure to verify is an act of negligence, not a negligent misrepresentation. It is not a representation at all. The allegation as to the alleged misrepresentation of the report's accuracy plainly fails to meet Rule 9(b)'s requirements: it sets forth no time, place, speaker, or specific contents of the alleged misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    House v.

It therefore\n   fails to meet Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirements.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With regard to the representation that the house was subject to the 2006 FIRM, the plaintiffs do not allege any actual misrepresentation. The thrust of the plaintiffs' claim seems to be an inference that their house was\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   subject to the September 2006 FIRM. But the plaintiffs do not plead that Regions told them that. The Amended Complaint states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   On September 20, 2006, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (hereinafter referred to as \"FEMA\") implemented a revised FIRM for parts of Sumner County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In late September 2006 to early October 2006, the Harrises were contacted by Regions and informed that they were now in Flood Zone AE. The correspondence further informed them that they had forty-five (45) days to procure flood insurance. However, the FIRM with effective date of August 3, 1981, clearly shows Bay Point located in Eleven-Year Flood Zone A2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Docket No. 1 at 6.) The only representation on which the plaintiffs' claim hinges is thus the factually accurate statement that, pursuant to the newly-issued September 2006 FIRM, the plaintiffs' house was located in Flood Zone AE. The plaintiffs do not plead that Regions made any representation at all about the house's status relative to the 1981 FIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, even if Regions' non-representation regarding the 1981 FIRM could constitute an actionable omission, the plaintiffs do not plead any facts indicating that Regions was negligent. They do not plead facts supporting that Regions knew or had reason to know that the house was subject to the 1981 FIRM. They do not plead any facts supporting that Regions had reason to doubt CoreLogic's certification. Their allegation that Regions \"failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating information regarding the flood certification\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   is precisely the type of \"legal conclusion\" insufficient for \"the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-2020, 2013 WL at *16 (dismissing claim where plaintiff pled \"no factual allegation that...Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in communicating\" information).

These representations were meant to guide the Harrises in their business transaction. Moreover, Regions/AmSouth failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating information regarding the flood certification determination, even though it/they certified the accuracy of the information provided. The Harrises justifiably relied on this misinformation-and it was foreseeable to Regions/AmSouth that the Harrises would do so-in both purchasing Bay Point and in securing flood insurance.
