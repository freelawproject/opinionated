Transcript of the February 25, 2019, argument on the motions (\"Tr.\") at 69. In the few cases where courts have sustained the refusal of the USCIS to consent to the grant of SIJ status, the state courts had failed to make crucial findings,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

There are no cases that the parties have found where a court has upheld a failure to consent where the USCIS sought to second-guess the evidentiary sufficiency of a state court finding by arguing that the state court failed to consider an additional factor. And indeed such a proposition would be contrary to the instruction in the Policy Manual that the USCIS is not to \"reweigh the evidence\" before the state court. AR 289.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the USCIS has not pointed to any authority to show that gang membership is a factor that Congress intended it to consider when exercising its consent authority. An agency action is \"arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v.

There is no mention of gang membership, or any other similar factor, in the SIJ statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J). Indeed, the government admitted at the argument of the current motion that gang membership itself would not be a reason for the USCIS to refuse to consent to an SIJ application. Tr. at 70. The government seeks to justify the denial of consent not on the grounds of gang membership itself but rather on the basis that the failure to consider gang membership undercut the Family Court's decision that it would not be in the plaintiff's best interest to be returned to Guatemala. As explained in more detail below, that argument is deeply flawed. But, in any event, the argument is simply an effort to second-guess the evidentiary determination of the Family Court as to whether removal to Guatemala would be in the best interest of the plaintiff -- a decision properly left to the Family Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The agency went beyond the scope of its consent function when it second-guessed the Family Court's factual determinations as part of the adjudication of the plaintiff's SIJ petition. By second-guessing the Family Court's best-interest determination, the agency acted in excess of its statutory jurisdiction and its decision dismissing the plaintiff's SIJ petition should be set aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, the agency has failed to \"offer [a] rational connection\" between the alleged fact of gang membership or affiliation and the agency's judgment that the Family Court's best-interest determination was uninformed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Although some of these reasons were gang related,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   most of them were not. The Family Court emphasized that Zabaleta's nuclear family, including his mother, his stepfather, and his younger brother are all located in the United states and it would not be in Zabaleta's best interest to be separated from them. AR 51. The Family Court added that there are \"no family members [in Guatemala] who are willing or able to provide [Zabaleta] with a safe home.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Family Court also explained that Zabaleta's family provides him with his fundamental needs, including medical and dental care and a home to live.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Family Court discussed the fact that living in the United States has afforded Zabaleta the chance to attend school and obtain an education, whereas in Guatemala, he was forced to quit school to help around his grandfather's house after his grandmother passed away.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of all of the facts detailed in the Family Court's order -- most of which are unrelated to gangs -- the Family Court concluded that \"it is not in the child's best interest to be removed from the United States to Guatemala.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendants have not shown how alleged gang membership undercuts the Family Court's finding that removal to Guatemala would not be in the plaintiff's best interest. The agency's final decision on the plaintiff's SIJ petition -- the AAO's dismissal -- summarily states that, \"The Director reviewed [the Family Court's] factual findings and found that the court did not make an informed decision in reaching its best interest determination because law enforcement has identified the [plaintiff] as a member of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). The AAO continued that because the Family Court discussed the gangs in Guatemala without knowledge of the plaintiff's alleged gang membership in the United States, the Family Court's best-interest determination was \"not fully informed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The AAO, however, did not explain the connection between the gang allegations and the best interest finding. Indeed, the AAO acknowledged that it could not determine whether \"gang membership would have resulted in a finding that returning to Guatemala is in [the plaintiff's] best interest as we do not have the judicial expertise or authority to make a best-interest determination under state child welfare law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the AAO took a factor -- alleged gang membership -- which would not be a basis for rejecting an SIJ application, and which it could not determine would affect that state court findings, and leveraged it into a denial of consent because it simply did not know how it would have affected the Family Court decision. That was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The AAO made no attempt to explain how gang evidence could undermine the Family Court's conclusion that it was not in the plaintiff's best interest to be removed to Guatemala based on all of the non-gang related reasons that the Family Court articulated. Indeed, the government conceded at oral argument that the AAO did not explain whether the plaintiff's alleged\n   gang membership was relevant to the Family Court's best interest finding, only that evidence of the plaintiff's alleged gang membership did not appear to be before the state court. Tr. at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In their motion papers, the defendants attempt to explain a connection between alleged gang membership and the best-interest determination that the plaintiff should remain in the United States and not be removed to Guatemala. The defendants argue that because the plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   informed the Family Court that he feared gangs in Guatemala, it was not arbitrary or capricious for USCIS to consider whether he informed the Family Court that the MS-13 gang in the United States, which he is a member of or at least associates with, is connected to the gangs in Guatemala that he claims to fear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Reply at 2. This speculative argument is unpersuasive, among other reasons, because it ignores most of the facts on which the Family Court relied, and because this rationale was not included in the AAO's decision denying the plaintiff's SIJ petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wala v.
