ECF No. 44, Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 23. Lead Plaintiff seeks to represent a putative class of \"all persons other than Defendants who purchased or otherwise acquired Aerohive common shares between November 1, 2017 and January 16, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Aerohive is a California corporation that is headquartered in Milpitas, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Aerohive's common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"HIVE.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant David K. Flynn (\"Flynn\") has served as Aerohive's Chief Execute Officer (\"CEO\") since July 2007, as its President since November 2007, and as its Chairman\n   since July 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Defendant John Ritchie (\"Ritchie\") has served as Aerohive's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") and Senior Vice President since September 2015, and as Aerohive's Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\") since February 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Flynn and Ritchie are collectively referred to by Plaintiffs as the \"Individual Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Aerohive's Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"Aerohive has designed and developed a cloud networking platform and portfolio of products that enable customers to manage their network systems and to collect and analyze data from users.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. The Company's products include hardware, such as routers and switches, network management and data collection applications, and maintenance and support services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Aerohive has sold to over 30,000 end-user customers (organizations holding licenses to products and/or software subscriptions or services).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Aerohive services the healthcare, education, manufacturing, distribution, and retail industries throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Aerohive reaches most of its end-user customer base through \"channel partners,\" who are authorized to resell, distribute, and service Aerohive's technology platform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. These channel partners are supported by Aerohive's sales organization, which is comprised of regional sales offices and inside sales teams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By the end of 2016, roughly 40 percent of Aerohive's total revenues came from the education sector, especially through a government-funded program known as E-Rate, which provides subsidies to allow educational institutions to purchase technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Challenges Facing Aerohive in 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Aerohive has had historically promising year-over-year increases in revenue from 2013 to 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Despite this, Aerohive has never achieved profitability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 32. By the end of 2016, Aerohive faced increasing pressure to prove it was a \"real player in the industry\" and to \"maintain the value of its common stock.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 32. According to Plaintiffs, however, Aerohive faced several \"obstacles,\" including uncertainties surrounding the E-Rate program, which historically generated nearly 40 percent of Aerohive's revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 33. In addition, Aerohive launched the next generation of its cloud networking platform, HiveManager NG, which, due to delays in product updates, had created what Aerohive called \"elongated sales cycles\" while customers waited for features and capabilities to be added.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Aerohive's 2017 Sales Restructuring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in or around 2017, Defendants announced a major overhaul of Aerohive's sales organization and sales strategy, which Defendants promised would improve revenues and profitability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that these changes included: (1) installing new sales leadership; (2) \"unbundling\" Aerohive's product and service offerings; and (3) growing the Company's business with Dell, one of its key strategic partners.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court provides further details about Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Aerohive's changes in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Aerohive hired Ron Gill (\"Gill\") as Vice President of Americas Sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Gill had previously worked for Ruckus, one of Aerohive's competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gill reported to Thomas J. Wilburn (\"Wilburn\"), then-Senior Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations, \"who possessed extensive experience in technology and networking sales and marketing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Aerohive also added Alan Amrod (\"Amrod\"), another industry veteran, in order to make the organization \"faster and more nimble.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under this new structure, Defendant Flynn stated he would \"continue to directly\n   manage sales, marketing, and products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Aerohive announced it would shift away and diversify the customer base from the E-Rate program by \"unbundling\" Aerohive's product and service offerings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35. For instance, Aerohive announced a new offering consisting of a lower-priced, entry-level product called \"Aerohive Connect,\" with additional features and upgrades that could be purchased as part of \"Aerohive Select,\" a subscription service that would generate deferred revenues on a going-forward basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Third, Defendants placed emphasis on their plan to grow Aerohive's business with Dell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Defendants' Failing Sales Execution Strategy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' sales execution strategy was flawed and that Aerohive concealed these flaws from investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40 (\"Contrary to Defendants' statements, and unbeknownst to investors, Defendants' plan to achieve profitability by overhauling the sales organization showed signs of failing almost immediately.\"). In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Aerohive's strategy resulted in: (1) the departure of sales personnel; (2) failure to implement systems that ensured accuracy and predictability in forecasting sales revenues; (3) failures in the plan to offer the lower-priced product, Aerohive Connect, and then upsell the service subscription package, Aerohive Select; and (4) failures in the development of the partnership with Dell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-46. The Court discusses each of Plaintiffs' allegations regarding failures in Aerohive's sales strategy below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, Plaintiffs allege that the introduction of new sales leadership resulted in departures of sales personnel beginning in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Plaintiffs plead: \"[t]he abrupt resignation of Senior Director of Inside Sales Timothy Balistreri and loss of CMO/CSO David Greene, both respected leaders within the sales force, in conjunction with layoffs of existing Aerohive sales representative[s] in favor of VP Ron Gill's hiring of former colleagues from Ruckus, an Aerohive competitor, ultimately hurt morale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In support of this allegation, Plaintiffs rely on information from former Aerohive employees, identified by Plaintiffs as \"Confidential Witnesses\" (\"CW\"). One witness, identified as CW1, was a former inside sales representative from October 2016 to July 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW1 stated: \"[Gill] laid off four or five of us at the same time, execution style. We came into a room and were sent home for doing exactly what we had been told it was our job to do - we were told 'focus on [E-Rate],['] then suddenly it wasn't our focus.... Communication was so terrible at that time that the VP of Sales Operations called my cell phone and said he didn't even know [about the layoffs] until afterward.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Another witness, identified as CW2, was a program director who reported directly to Defendant Flynn and General Manager Amrod from June 2015 to September 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. According to Plaintiffs, CW2 \"confirmed that Gill was too quick to cut E-Rate-experienced sales personnel, who knew the Company's product lines and who were responsible for generating nearly 40 percent of the Company's revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW2 reported that neglecting E-Rate caused Aerohive to lose valuable sources of business, and many E-Rate customers stopped listing Aerohive as a preferred provider as they had in the past.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, CW3, an Aerohive territory manager from August 2015 to September 2017, stated that the rate of attrition in the Summer and Fall of 2017 was \"unprecedented\" and by the end of Fall 2017, the majority of the regional sales managers had been with the Company less than a year and did not understand\n   Aerohive's products well enough to sell them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege that \"Aerohive's failure to implement a system that ensured accuracy and predictability in forecasting sales revenues compounded the employee turnover problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. CW3 reported that because sales quotas had become unrealistic and there was little accountability, representatives frequently inflated their projections, and deals almost never closed when promised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW2 added that \"the pipelines were always big, but they didn't true-up as you got closer - they were not accurate at the end of each month. The return was always pushed out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that according to CW2 and CW3, the combined effects of unrealistic quotas, poor forecasting, and a diminished sales organization made it apparent by mid-year 2017 that Aerohive would fall short of revenue projections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW3 reported, \"[f]or the Americas, there was no way we could hit our number [in the second half of 2017]. We only had two reps on inside sales making their number[s] and the engineers were sitting around twiddling their thumbs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs allege that \"by mid-year 2017, it was also clear that Aerohive's plan to increase revenues by offering a lower-priced product, Aerohive Connect, and then upselling a service subscription package, Aerohive Select, was not working.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. One witness, identified as CW4, who was a sales operations renewals coordinator from September 2016 to June 2017, claimed that when Aerohive \"unbundled\" its product and support, Aerohive discovered \"many breaks in the whole system,\" meaning that many existing customers had been receiving support services free of charge for many years and were not inclined to start paying separately when the time came for renewals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW4 reported that everyone \"from the CEO on down\" was aware of this problem and discussed whether customer services would be cut off in order to force customers to pay. Ultimately, according to Plaintiffs, sales teams offered steep discounts on service contract renewals in order to secure deals, thereby generating lower-than-expected revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs allege that \"Aerohive's strategic partnership with Dell failed to develop as hoped.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. CW1 stated: \"[The Dell partnership] was a move in the right direction, but we put too many eggs in that basket and it wasn't as fruitful as expected. It was 'Oh god, this is going to be fantastic,' because it would bring us into deals, but it turned out to be more of a pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW2 said that the premature firing of Aerohive's E-Rate representatives meant a lack of personnel to support that aspect of Dell's business, and Aerohive lost ground it had gained in E-Rate through that channel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in order to remedy the sales organization turmoil and flat revenue, Defendants resorted to deep cost cutting measures, including further reductions in engineering, product management, and sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. CW2 described that the channel sales team was \"stripped down,\" and that cuts to engineering and operations were so drastic that they were rendered \"ineffectual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CW2 also explained that instead of \"selling, growing, and building, and improving,\" Defendants \"started cutting ideas, started to cut back to meet revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Alleged Misrepresentations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that between November 1, 2017 and January 16, 2018, Defendants made a number of false or misleading statements or omissions. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 51. Plaintiffs broadly categorize the false and misleading statements and omissions into three categories: (1) statements and omissions related to sales personnel issues; (2) statements and omissions related to sales\n   execution; and (3) statements and omissions related to projected revenues. Opp'n at 6-8. These false or misleading statements were allegedly made in Aerohive's quarterly report for 3Q17 on Form 10-Q (\"3Q17 Form 10-Q\") with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and Aerohive's earnings call with investors for 3Q17 (\"3Q17 Earnings Call\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 59. The Court has organized these statements by source below. Where necessary to the Court's discussion, the Court has provided the context for the statement at issue and indicated the challenged statement itself in bold font.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3Q17 Form 10-Q\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement 1:\n   </strong>\n   \"We also expect to continue to invest in our organization and our channel and strategic partnerships to meet the needs of our customers and to pursue opportunities in new and existing markets. In particular, we are investing to increase our sales capacity as well as our channel program.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement 2:\n   </strong>\n   \"We believe that the\n   <strong>\n    significantly slower pace of order volume\n   </strong>\n   in our education vertical in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2016, specifically due to\n   <strong>\n    slower pace of funding approvals under the federal E-Rate program\n   </strong>\n   , was one of the primary drivers of lower-than-expected order volume and revenue performance in our third quarter and our lowered revenue outlook for our fourth quarter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement 3:\n   </strong>\n   \"In May 2017, we announced that our Aerohive Connect and Select offerings are available across our entire portfolio of access points and switches. We believe that separating our product line into these two offerings delivers compellingly priced cloud-managed hardware for connectivity-oriented deployments and enables us to capture more subscription and software license revenue from those customers who require a more advanced feature set and support. This program may reduce our revenue, or the rate of our revenue growth, as purchasers take advantage of the lower entry pricing for our products. In addition, it may be difficult and take time for us to adjust expenses sufficiently to compensate for a shortfall in revenue, even when we may anticipate the shortfall.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement 4: \"\n   </strong>\n   We also believe that we introduced our new HiveManager NG product to some of our larger and more complex customers before its feature set was able to fully address their requirements, which resulted in\n   <strong>\n    elongated sales cycles\n   </strong>\n   and reduced revenue opportunities, which specifically contributed to our lower revenue performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3Q17 Earnings Call\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement 5 (by Defendant Flynn):\n   </strong>\n   \"In parallel, we continue to strengthen our go-to-market, both through our full OEM relationship with Dell EMC and through the initiative we launched at the start of this year to pivot to a more channel-centric go-to-market model to improve our sales efficiency and better address the mid-market. The foundation of this plan was the launch of our Connect-to-Select offering, and a launch of [a] number of channel recruitment and development end initiatives. Our sales leader Tom Wilburn's strength and passion is around larger enterprise direct touch business[es] so when we launched this initiative in Q1, he augmented his team with channel-centric sales leaders who built much of Ruckus' channel as well as new leadership in APAC. With this new program and team, we recruited 600 new resellers in the first half of the year and added 300 more in Q3. In Q3, we moved fully to a 2-tier model by transitioning our direct VAR business through SYNNEX and we signed WAV as a distributor to help us develop the\n   MSP and HSP channels. Now with this team in place and a program on the right trajectory, Tom has decided to move on to pursue opportunities that better align with his preferred go-to-market model. Having successfully restructured my leadership team under a COO organization, paired with a unified products and marketing organization, I now have the capacity to take on global sales leadership to drive this critical initiative working directly with our 3 theater sales leaders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   I am encouraged by the significant progress of our product delivery and that this has given Dell EMC the confidence in us to expand into a full OEM relationship.

We're encouraged by several metrics that point to improved sales productivity. For the third quarter in a row, we have reported year-over-year declines in sales and marketing expenses. In addition[,] for the last 2 quarters and also on a year-to-date basis, our sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue were sub-40%.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement 7 (by Defendant Ritchie):\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"We are currently expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $40 million to $42 million.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the above statements or omissions were misleading for one of three reasons. First, Plaintiffs contend that statements or omissions regarding Aerohive's sales personnel were misleading because Aerohive had replaced knowledgeable, experienced sales personnel and implemented cost-cutting measures that left the sales organization understaffed and ill-equipped to service existing customers and develop new opportunities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' statements were inaccurate and incomplete because they created the impression that Defendants' sales strategy to increase sales capacity was successful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 53. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the decline in E-Rate business was attributable only to problems with the program itself, when Defendants had fired sales personnel specializing in the education sector and E-Rate program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs contend that the statements and omissions related to sales execution were misleading because Defendants represented that the Aerohive Connect and Aerohive Select program offerings may reduce revenue or the rate of revenue growth and that it may be difficult to compensate for a shortfall in revenue when, according to Plaintiffs, \"Defendants already knew and/or recklessly disregarded that [ ] the transition to Aerohive Connect and Aerohive Select\n   was experiencing significant setbacks that would impact revenues in the fourth quarter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. In short, Plaintiffs effectively allege that \"while sales efficiency and productivity metrics were technically accurate, they were touted as evidence of Defendants' successful implementation of their sales strategy, while concealing the fact that Defendants had resorted to cost-cutting measures to compensate for lower than expected revenues.\" Opp'n at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs contend that the statements and omissions related to the projected revenues were misleading because Defendant Ritchie projected fourth quarter revenues in 2017 in the range of $40 million to $42 million but did not disclose adverse facts pertaining to Aerohive's business, operational and financial results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. Then, on January 16, 2018, Aerohive issued a press release entitled \"Aerohive Networks Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2017 Results,\" which revealed that Aerohive \"expects net revenue to be approximately $37 million,\" which is below the Company's previously stated guidance of $40 million to $42 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. The press release also stated: \"Following the change in our sales leadership at the end of our third quarter, we uncovered underlying sales execution issues which became fully apparent in the last month of the fourth quarter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following this news, Aerohive's share price fell $1.63, or 28.6%, to close at $4.07 on January 17, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Statement 2 is a statement in the 3Q17 Form 10-Q regarding Aerohive's \"significantly slower pace of order volume\" attributable to \"slower pace of funding approvals under the federal E-Rate Program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.

First, although Plaintiffs complain that Aerohive did not provide more complete statements, it is well-settled that the securities laws prohibit \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   misleading and untrue statements, not statements that are incomplete.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Police Retirement Sys. of St. Louis v.

In\n   <em>\n    Intuitive Surgical\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs alleged that a series of statements were false or misleading because the defendant did not \"detail[ ] that system placement was declining because of market saturation and the economic downturn, that new Systems were being purchased at higher utilization rates, and that [product] growth was declining faster than anticipated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156981\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/1051/#p1061\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit held that such allegations were not false or misleading because \"Rule 10b-5 prohibits 'only misleading and untrue statements, not statements that are incomplete.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156981\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/1051/#p1061\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396885\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/997/#p1006\">\n    280 F.3d at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, similar to\n   <em>\n    Intuitive Surgical\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs allege that statements 1 and 2 were false or misleading because they provided an incomplete picture of Aerohive's sales personnel issues. Yet to \"survive a motion to dismiss under the heightened pleading standards of the [PSLRA], the plaintiffs' complaint must specify the reason or reasons why the statements made by [the defendant] were misleading or untrue, not simply why the statements were incomplete.\"\n   <em>\n    Brody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396885\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/997/#p1006\">\n    280 F.3d at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even accepting Plaintiffs' allegation that the statements at issue were incomplete, Plaintiffs must still specify why the statements were misleading or untrue. Here, Plaintiffs' claims regarding statements 1 and 2 are insufficient because they fail to specify why the statements were misleading or untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Moreover, Aerohive did disclose sales personnel issues. Indeed, Aerohive disclosed sales organization turnover in that same document-the 3Q17 Form-of which this Court has taken judicial notice. For instance, Aerohive wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   We have experienced in the past higher than normal turn-over, especially amongst our sales and engineering personnel, and continue to replace personnel where we think needed to improve our operations and product development capabilities and processes.

However, Plaintiffs do not provide allegations that quantify the actual staffing problems, which makes it difficult to understand the severity of the problem or whether that actually had an impact on revenue.

Indeed, Plaintiffs do not state that information was gathered from a CW. Third, the portion of the statement about restructuring of the leadership team in February 2017 under a COO organization is \"quite literally true.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Colyer v.

Everex Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230683\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/1057/#p1065\">\n    228 F.3d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1065 (9th Cir. 2000). Because Plaintiffs have failed to plead a primary securities law violation, Plaintiffs have also failed to plead a violation of Section 20(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cutera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696207\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/1103/#p1111\">\n    610 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1113 n. 6. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim under Sections 20(a) is also GRANTED. Because granting Plaintiffs an additional opportunity to amend the complaint would not be futile, cause undue delay, or unduly prejudice Defendants, and Plaintiffs have not acted in bad faith, the Court grants leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leadsinger, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071886\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/522/#p532\">\n    512 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety is GRANTED without prejudice. Should Plaintiffs choose to file an amended complaint, they must do so within 30 days of this Order. Failure to do so, or failure to cure the deficiencies addressed in this Order, will result in dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs may not add new claims or parties without leave of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    In their motion, Defendants appear to count this statement as three separate statements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 17-18 (referring to statement 6 as \"statements 6, 7, 8\"). The Court refers to this statement in its entirety as \"statement 6.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Defendants refer to this statement as \"statement 9\" in their motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 19.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
