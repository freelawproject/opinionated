Plaintiff Manish\n   Patel (\"Plaintiff\") filed a single Response, (ECF No. 9), and Defendant filed a single Reply, (ECF No. 10). For the reasons discussed below, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, (ECF No. 6), is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant \"denied compensation for the property that was damaged ... and failed to pay for any loss of use, despite due and proper demand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 1, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Complaint in Clark County District Court alleging the following claims: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violations of Nevada's Unfair Claims Practices Act; (4) intentional refusal to pay insurance benefits; and (5) declaratory relief. Defendant subsequently removed the action to federal court.

Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant \"has failed to effectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement of [Plaintiff's] claim in which liability of [Defendant] is reasonably clear.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). Moreover, Plaintiff alleges Defendant \"acted fraudulently, oppressively, and in malicious regard for [Plaintiff's] rights,\" and therefore, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient. Plaintiff does not state how he complied with the terms and conditions of the insurance contract or what those terms were. Further, he merely recites the pertinent statutory language of NRS \u00a7 686A.310(1) without presenting any allegations showing that Defendant's liability was \"reasonably clear.\" Moreover, Plaintiff's allegations regarding punitive damages are legal conclusions which lack requisite facts. As such, the pleading fails to provide Defendant with fair notice to properly defend against the alleged violations, and does not permit the Court to infer more than a possibility of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starr v. Baca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1216\">\n    652 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (9th Cir. 2011) (stating a complaint \"must contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively\"). Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Intentional Refusal to Pay Insurance Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations regarding this claim are essentially the same as those\n   pled in support of his cause of action for violations of the Unfair Claims Practices Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-44). Defendant maintains that it \"is unaware of any legal theory of 'Intentional Refusal to Pay' that is not subsumed by a breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant theories.\" (MTD 6:17-19). In his Response, Plaintiff cites provisions of Chapter 686A of the Nevada Administrative Code (\"NAC\") as the basis for his claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 4:10-5:3) (quoting NAC \u00a7\u00a7 686A.670(2), 686A.675 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v. Thorpe\n   </em>\n   , the Nevada Supreme Court expressly held that exclusive original jurisdiction is vested in the Nevada Division of Insurance (\"NDOI\") when \"a party seeks to ensure compliance with the insurance code.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

In\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   , the Nevada Supreme Court also held that while failure to pursue an administrative violation with NDOI does not preclude subject matter jurisdiction in the district courts, it does render the claim unripe and therefore \"nonjusticiable.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5726335\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/123/565/\">\n    170 P.3d at 993-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because the NDOI has exclusive jurisdiction over Nevada Insurance Code regulatory and administrative claims and Plaintiff has not pled that he exhausted his administrative remedies, Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    First Nat.

Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In support of his declaratory relief claim, Plaintiff alleges that he entered into a valid insurance contract with Defendant, that Plaintiff paid the insurance premiums, that Plaintiff made a demand against the insurance policy, and that Defendant acted in bad faith and denied the claim. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-47). Based on this, Plaintiff alleges that \"[a]n actual controversy exists between the parties and it has become necessary of the judicial determining to resolve this actual controversy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). Once again, however, Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient. Plaintiff fails to indicate even generally what he seeks the Court to declare, making the granting of relief impossible. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits courts to \"freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" Fed. R.

Plaintiff shall have twenty-one days from the entry of this Order to file an amended complaint. Failure to file an amended complaint by this date shall result in the Court dismissing this action.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Plaintiff does not make factual allegations regarding the nature of the damaged items, the loss of use, or the \"costs of replacement.\" While Paragraph 12 of the Complaint states that \"[Defendant] in bad faith and without good faith basis denied compensation for the property that was damaged as described in Exhibit 1,\" no such exhibit is attached. (Compl. \u00b6 12). Paragraph 42 also references the missing exhibit: \"[Defendant] intentionally refused to pay on [Plaintiff's] claim even when confronted with overwhelming evidence to support that all the items contained in Exhibit 1 were damaged, and [Plaintiff] is entitled to loss of use damages.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 42). In his Response, Plaintiff explains that the exhibit, which he accidentally omitted, is \"the demand letter dated February 28, 2018 including a list of damaged items filed with [Defendant]....\" (Resp. 4:6-8, ECF No. 9). Plaintiff further states that said demand letter is attached to his Response as \"Exhibit 2.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    4:24-26). But again, Plaintiff fails to attach the letter as an exhibit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In its Reply, Defendant argues that the subject insurance policy, which is provided as an exhibit to Plaintiff's Response, \"shows that there is no coverage for [Plaintiff's] loss. And as such, not only is there no breach of contract due to no coverage obligation, but all extracontractual causes of action fail as well.\" (Reply 2:24-27, ECF No. 10). Specifically, Defendant argues that the policy excludes coverage for \"water damage\" which is defined as \"damage caused by ... water backup which includes water which reverse[s] flow or overflows from sewers, drains ... or similar systems caused by obstruction, interference, or inadequacy of drainage and which originates off the premises.\" (Ins. Policy at 28, Ex. 1 to Resp., ECF No. 9-1); (Reply 4:5-10). Nevertheless, at this point in time, the Court is unable to determine whether Plaintiff's loss is necessarily subject to the exclusion. However, Defendant is not precluded from reasserting this argument should Plaintiff elect to file an amended complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
