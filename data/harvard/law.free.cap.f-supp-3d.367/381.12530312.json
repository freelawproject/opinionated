Plaintiffs articulate three theories: (1) the common fund doctrine; (2) the common benefit doctrine; and (3) the catalyst theory and Unfair Trade Practices Consumer Protection Law (\"UTPCPL\"), 73 Pa.

On March 21, 2011, this court granted summary judgment in favor of Owens Corning and against plaintiffs Patricia Wright and Kevin West based on\n   <em>\n    JELD-WEN, Inc. v.

In 2012, the court of appeals reversed and held that applying\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   rule retroactively to plaintiffs' claims would violate due process.\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

As explained in that decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   When the Plaintiffs filed their class action, there was little dispute as to the effect of Owens Coming's bankruptcy on the Plaintiffs' claims against it. Based on our much-maligned decision in\n   <em>\n    Avellino v. M. Frenville Co. (In re M. Frenville Co.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"598784,6560542\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/744/332/\">\n    744 F.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1984), a \"claim\" under the Bankruptcy Code did not arise until a cause of action accrued under applicable non-bankruptcy law-that is, when a claimant possessed a right to payment. In this context, the Plaintiffs' cause of action did not accrue until the defects in the roofing shingles manifested in 2009, years after the Confirmation Date. Thus, at the time they filed the class action, the Plaintiffs were correct to conclude that they did not hold \"claims\" under the Code based on the action. But subsequently we overruled\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   with our en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   , in which we rejected\n   <em>\n    Frenville's\n   </em>\n   \"accrual test,\" and in its place established the rule that a \" 'claim' arises when an individual is exposed pre-petition to a product or other conduct giving rise to an injury, which underlies a 'right to payment' under the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683962,3818142\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/114/\">\n    607 F.3d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104. Accordingly, plaintiffs retained their causes of action against Owens Corning.

This court denied class certification. (ECF No. 181). That decision was affirmed by the court of appeals. (ECF No. 208). On December 19, 2018, the court closed the case after being advised of settlement, subject only to the resolution of this motion for counsel fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Legal Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gunter v.

Cir. 1993), for the proposition that a common fund is not necessary. In that case, however, retroactive salary payments were paid from which a counsel fee award could be calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To the extent plaintiffs are asking the court to assume a class was created, the court of appeals identified factors courts should consider in determining whether attorneys' fees as part of a class action settlement are appropriate: (1) whether the entire value of benefits to the class is attributable to the efforts of class counsel; (2) whether the percentage-of-recovery request reflects the fee that would result from private negotiations; and (3) whether there are any particularly innovative terms in the settlement.\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288661\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/283/#p338\">\n    148 F.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338-40 (3d Cir. 1998). In\n   <em>\n    Gunter\n   </em>\n   , the court of appeals identified seven factors that courts ought to consider when determining the appropriateness of an attorneys' fee request in common fund class action settlements: (1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted; (2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms or fees requested by counsel; (3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (5) the risk of nonpayment; (6) the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and (7) the awards in similar cases.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11238909\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/190/#p195\">\n    223 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   195 n.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The common fund doctrine is difficult to apply in this case for the simple reason that no common fund was created. The tangible economic value of counsel's efforts to the \"class\" is zero. No free riders were identified in this case. Plaintiffs do not seek to recover counsel fees from similarly situated parties who benefited from their efforts, but from the\n   <em>\n    opposing\n   </em>\n   party, Owens Corning. Alternatively, plaintiffs ask the court to impose a counsel fee award on persons who are not part of this case but may settle warranty claims against Owens Corning in the future - but without notice or opportunity for them to be heard. The affected \"members\" of the proposed \"class\" are not identifiable and have no ability to object to the fee request. It would be purely speculative to predict the fee that may result from a private negotiation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although plaintiffs' counsel are skillful and the litigation was complex and long-lasting, the success ultimately achieved was minimal. The actual settlement contained no innovative terms and encompassed only the roofs of the named plaintiffs. The circumstances here are far different from the common fund decisions cited by plaintiffs. In short, plaintiffs ask the court to breathtakingly expand the common fund doctrine. Even if the court had discretion to award counsel fees under these circumstances, it would decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B. Common Benefit Doctrine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The gravamen of plaintiffs' theory fits more closely into the \"common benefit\" doctrine. As set forth in\n   <em>\n    Polonski\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Under the common benefit doctrine, an award of attorney's fees is appropriate where \"the plaintiff's successful litigation confers 'a substantial benefit on the members of an ascertainable class, and where the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit makes possible an award that will operate to spread the costs proportionately among them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , 412 U.S. at 5, 93 S.Ct. at 1946 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mills [v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.]\n   </em>\n   , 396 U.S. [375] at 393-94, 90 S.Ct.

This test entails satisfying three distinct elements: (1) the plaintiff must confer a substantial benefit; (2) to members of an ascertainable class; and (3) the court must ensure that the costs are proportionally spread among that class. Because this test may be read literally to include every lawsuit against any institutional defendant, we have refined this language further. In\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. United Steelworkers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468604\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/845/#p848\">\n    666 F.2d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848 (3d Cir. 1981), this court inquired: (1) whether the benefits may be traced with some accuracy; (2) whether the class of beneficiaries are readily identifiable; and, (3) whether there is a reasonable basis for confidence that the costs may be shifted with some precision to those benefitting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Polonski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105759\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/137/139/#p145\">\n    137 F.3d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No practical, traceable substantial \"common benefit\" was achieved. Fundamentally, the success counsel obtained related to the legal doctrine of retroactivity, not the merits of the claims (i.e., a holding that Oak Ridge shingles were defective). No aggrieved customer will now \"win\" his/her warranty claim; instead, customers merely have the opportunity to present those claims. Ultimately, a successful claim will not depend on retroactivity or the\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   rule, but on whether a particular customer's shingles were defective. The success in this case is analogous to a general lesson of law that was rejected as a basis for counsel fees in\n   <em>\n    Polonski\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The members of the benefiting class are not ascertainable and there is no reasonable basis for shifting costs. No class was certified in this action. The customers whose potential warranty claims might otherwise have been discharged in bankruptcy are unknown. How many persons may ultimately benefit, when and if they pursue warranty claims, is unknown. Owens Corning points out, correctly, that plaintiffs failed to identify a single person who directly benefited. Causation is also problematic because there is no evidence in the record to dispute Owens Corning's representation that its warranty practices were unchanged by the result in this litigation. (Interrogatory Response \u00b6 15, ECF No. 252-5). There is simply no reliable, practical and precise method to impose a fee award on persons who may settle warranty claims in the future.

No class settlement or claims administration process exists, or is possible, here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In summary, the court declines to exercise its discretion to award counsel fees under the common benefit theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C.

This court's independent research did not locate any such decisions. The analysis in\n   <em>\n    Templin\n   </em>\n   about the availability of counsel fees under the federal ERISA statute sheds little light on the availability of counsel fees under a Pennsylvania statute like the UTPCPL. In\n   <em>\n    Cottrell v.

As explained above, plaintiffs achieved procedural success on the legal issue of retroactivity, but did not obtain success \"on the merits.\" After many years of litigation, class certification was denied and the settlement involved only the roofs of the named plaintiffs. Plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they catalyzed changed behavior by Owens Corning; the record reflects that its warranty practices were unchanged by the result in this case. (ECF No. 252-5). In addition, the court is unwilling to adjudge Owens Corning liable under the UTPCPL. To the contrary, the court is not convinced that Owens Corning's reliance on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   was in bad faith, i.e., the first\n   <em>\n    Ursic\n   </em>\n   factor. Further litigation of the UTPCPL claim in an effort to recovery counsel fees is not warranted. This case is settled. In sum, the court will not award counsel fees under the catalyst theory, even if it were not moribund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for counsel fees will be denied.
