The ALJ never made a finding that Plaintiff's reported activities met the threshold level for transferable work skills, and the limited manner in which Plaintiff reportedly carried out her daily activities do not demonstrate greater functioning than Plaintiff alleged. For example, although Plaintiff was able to prepare meals daily and perform household chores, she allegedly could do so for only very short periods of time and required frequent breaks.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR 168-71,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR 21-22. Plaintiff required the assistance of an electric scooter to shop for groceries, and reported that she was unable to read, sew, and play video games often because those activities hurt her hands too much.

Plaintiff walked her four small dogs when her pain levels permitted; however, she had \"a little indoor grass area with kitty litter under it\" for the times she was unable to take her dogs out for a walk.

Indeed, Plaintiff was seen by Dr. Hungerford only three times before the doctor rendered her extremely limiting opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 351-55 (October 2015), 390-94 (January 2016), 414-18 (February 2016).

Given Plaintiff's assertion that her inability to work was primarily due to her constant fibromyalgia pain, one would expect she would have relayed those concerns to her primary care physician. Moreover, Plaintiff's complaints to her physical therapist more than one year before she began seeing Dr. Hungerford does not explain why Dr. Hungerford did not document similar issues in her own treatment notes. It was reasonable for the ALJ to expect some objective findings in Dr. Hungerford's treatment notes that substantiated the extreme limitations she assessed.

The Commissioner argues that the ALJ's inclusion of \"consistent with unskilled work\" in the RFC makes\n   <em>\n    Zavalin\n   </em>\n   's holding inapplicable.
