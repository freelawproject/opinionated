To do so, the Court confronts two questions. First, did the so-called Federal Foreclosure Bar of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(3) prohibit the HOA's otherwise valid non-judicial foreclosure of the Coventry Green property? And second, did Bank of America's attempt to ascertain the superpriority portion of the lien-amounting to nine months of delinquent assessments-preserve its interest in the property despite that foreclosure? The Court answers both questions in the affirmative\n   and therefore grants Bank of America's motion for summary judgment, denies RH Kids's motion, and enters judgment in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Housing and Economic Recovery Act and Federal Foreclosure Bar\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act in response to the 2008 recession and its ensuing foreclosure crisis. The purpose of the act was to protect the fragile housing market by addressing the critical undercapitalization of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). It sought to ensure that the two companies \"operated in a safe and sound manner ... consistent with the public interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204513\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). To that end, the act subjected both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increased oversight and government control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The act created the Federal Housing Finance Agency and authorized it to place both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the Agency's conservatorship, which it did in 2008. As conservator, the FHFA was responsible for supervising and winding up Fannie's and Freddie's affairs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

(# 10, at 2-3). The deed of trust listed the Alfaros as the borrowers, Bank of America as the lender, and MERS\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the beneficiary nominee.

The HOA struck first. In January of 2011, the HOA recorded a lien for delinquent assessments against the property through its agent Nevada Association Services. (# 80, Exh. D). After the Alfaros failed to satisfy the outstanding lien, the HOA recorded a Notice of Default and Election to Sell again\n   through its agent Nevada Association Services. (# 80, at 5). In March of 2012, the Coventry Green Trust purchased the property at a public auction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Coventry Green later conveyed its interest in the property to Diakonos Holdings, LLC-the original plaintiff in this case.

J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the HOA foreclosure, servicer Bank of America attempted to satisfy the outstanding superpriority-lien balance. Bank of America contacted Nevada Association Services by letter and requested a payoff invoice that would satisfy the superpriority portion of the HOA lien. (# 80, Exh. G-1). Nevada Association Services did not respond. (# 80, at 5). Shortly thereafter, the bank filed a Notice of Trustee's Sale pursuant to a Deed of Trust to sell the property at auction in May of 2012.

Instead, it brings three arguments to avoid the Bar's application here. First, RH Kids argues that the Bar is irrelevant because Freddie Mac did not have an interest in the loan at the time the HOA foreclosed. (# 81, at 3). If true, the FHFA's conservatorship over Freddie Mac would offer no reprieve from this valid state-law foreclosure. Second, RH kids argues that even if Freddie Mac did have an interest in the property, its failure to record voided that interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567296,12567297\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/363/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing NRS \u00a7 111.325 ). Finally, RH Kids contends that the Foreclosure Bar cannot preempt Nevada criminal statutes such as NRS \u00a7 205.395, which prohibits false representations concerning title-a statute it alleges Bank of America has violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court turns first to RH Kids's argument that Freddie Mac did not have an interest in the property at the time of the foreclosure. The crux of this argument is that Bank of America failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Freddie Mac took an interest in the property in September of 2007 like it claims. (# 81, at 3-5). It contends that Bank of America's proffered evidence-Freddie Mac internal records and declarations of employees-is inferior to the recorded title, which does not bear Freddie Mac's name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. As a result, it argues that there is a material issue of fact regarding whether Freddie Mac's ownership implicates the Foreclosure Bar at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, the evidence that RH Kids urges the Court to disregard is the very evidence the Ninth Circuit found sufficient to demonstrate a Freddie Mac property interest in\n   <em>\n    Berezovsky\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266516\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/923/#p926\">\n    869 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   932 n.8.

Bank of America provided the declaration of Dean Meyer who is a Freddie Mac employee competent to testify on behalf of the enterprise. (# 80, Exh. B). Meyer testified that \"Freddie Mac acquired ownership of the [Coventry Green]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Loan, which specifically includes the Note and the Deed of Trust, on or about September 4, 2007 and has owned it ever since.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. To support his declaration, Meyer also submitted authenticated printouts of the Freddie Mac internal loan processing system, MIDAS. (# 81, Exh. B-1-B-3). These printouts corroborate Meyer's declaration that Freddie Mac owns 100% of the loan and that it owns the loan to this day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Berezovsky\n   </em>\n   , Bank of America has provided evidence that Freddie Mac owned the loan at the time the HOA foreclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nevertheless, Summit argues that Freddie Mac surrendered its interest in the property when it failed to promptly record.

Freddie Mac's relationship with its loan servicers and beneficiaries is governed by the \"Guide.\" (# 80, at 15-16). The Guide's rules and regulations confirm that Freddie Mac retained ownership of any loan under its portfolio and had authority to direct the actions of its beneficiaries and servicers. For instance, Freddie Mac could \"require the Seller or the Servicer ... to make such ... assignments and recordations of any of the Mortgage documents so as to reflect the interests of Freddie Mac\" at any time.\n   <em>\n    Freddie Mac, Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1301.10 (2019), http://www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/pdf/guide.pdf (\"The Guide\"). Also, Freddie Mac could compel its agents to make assignments that Freddie Mac deemed proper.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266516\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/923/#p926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6301.6 (\"Freddie Mac may, at its sole discretion and at any time, require a Seller/Servicer, at the Seller/Servicer's expense, to prepare, execute and/or record assignments of the Security Interest to Freddie Mac\"). Because Bank of America was agent to Freddie Mac, Freddie Mac's failure to promptly record its interest did not invalidate its ownership in this property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, RH Kids argues that the Federal Foreclosure Bar does not preempt NRS \u00a7 205.395, which prohibits a party from knowingly misrepresenting ownership on title. (# 81, at 5). This argument arises out of a 2011 assignment of the deed of trust wherein MERS transferred its interest in the loan to Bank of America. (# 80, Exh. C). RH Kids argues that if MERS knew that Freddie Mac was the owner of the deed of trust when it assigned the deed to Bank of America, that assignment was a misrepresentation under \u00a7 205.395-a class C felony. (# 81, at 5). This argument, however, starts from the incorrect premise that Bank of America was the owner of the deed after the assignment. MERS was merely the temporary nominee who assigned its own servicing rights to Bank of America in 2011. Freddie Mac remained the owner of the deed of trust despite not being listed on the title. Accordingly, the 2011 assignment did not violate NRS \u00a7 205.395. More importantly, that assignment did not affect the application of the Federal Foreclosure Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, Bank of America has demonstrated that Freddie Mac indeed owned this loan at the time the HOA foreclosed. Its ownership of the loan created a property interest that was protected by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(3)'s bar on non-consensual foreclosures. Neither Freddie Mac nor FHFA consented to that foreclosure. (# 80, Exh. K). As a result, the HOA foreclosure did not extinguish Freddie Mac's interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Bank of America's Lack of Tender is Excused Because the HOA Trustee's Practice was to Reject Such Payments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition to the Federal Foreclosure Bar's preservation of Freddie Mac's interest in the property, the Court also grants summary judgment because Bank of America was excused from the tender requirement of the superpriority lien amount. Prior to the HOA foreclosure, Bank of America contacted Nevada Association Services by letter and requested a payoff amount to satisfy the HOA's superpriority lien balance. (# 80, Exh. G).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that letter, Bank of America acknowledged that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 granted the HOA a superpriority lien that subordinated the Bank's interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Bank of America was unaware of the lien amount but assured Nevada Association Services that \"whatever [that amount] is ...

(# 80, Exh. H, at 18-19). Because Nevada Association Services refused to respond, Bank of America could not verify the superpriority lien amount. It therefore did not tender a check to the HOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Nevada Supreme Court addressed the tender issue in\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A. v. SFR Inv.

Adv. Op. 7 at *4 (an offer to pay combined with a rejection of that offer \"cure[s] the default as to that portion of the lien such that the ensuing foreclosure sale [does] not extinguish the first deed of trust\"). In other words, Bank of America's interest in the property is preserved if it (1) attempted to satisfy the superpriority lien amount and (2) Nevada Association Services made clear that it would reject the bank's tender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That is what happened here. Bank of America's letter requested the superpriority lien amount, acknowledged that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 granted the HOA a lien superior to its own, and offered to tender the nine-month delinquency. (# 80, Exh G-1, at 1). Bank of America never received a response, which was consistent with Nevada Association Services' policy at that time. (# 80, Exh. H, at 18) (explaining that Nevada Association Service's position was to ignore requests like Bank of America's under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act). Accordingly, Bank of America could not ascertain the delinquent balance necessary to satisfy the HOA superpriority lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nevertheless, RH Kids contends that Bank of America's failure to tender a physical check still extinguished the bank's interest because its mere inquiry is insufficient. The problem is that Bank of America fared no better had it calculated the superpriority lien amount and sent a check. Nevada Association Services would have rejected tender and foreclosed anyway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21 (despite receiving a check or request for a ledger balance, Nevada Association Services would not respond except to \"[send the bank] a notice of sale\"). Nevada Association Services' corporate counsel, Chris Yergensen, testified in a similar case that during that time, it was the company's policy not to provide the delinquent superpriority lien amount. Instead, it would mail a notice of sale and proceed with the foreclosure despite the bank's attempt to satisfy the outstanding balance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. RH Kids does not dispute that policy in its briefing, nor does it provide evidence that Bank of America's attempt to tender payment was not futile. Accordingly, the Court finds that Bank of America was excused from sending valid tender because Nevada Association Services made it clear that it would reject that tender and proceed with its planned foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (# 80) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiff RH Kids's Motion for Summary Judgment (# 82) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    For clarity, the Court will refer to the Defendants collectively as \"Bank of America\" unless otherwise necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The original plaintiff in this case, Diakonos Holdings, LLC, was substituted by current plaintiff RH Kids, LLC by stipulation of the parties in September of 2018.
