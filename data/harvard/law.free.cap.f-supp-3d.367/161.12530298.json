Talarico claims that this alleged practice violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the analogous guarantees of the New York State Constitution, and she seeks individual and class-wide relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 1983\") and New York law. The Port Authority has moved to dismiss certain of Talarico's claims and to strike all of her class allegations. (Dkt. No. 15.) For the reasons that follow, the Port Authority's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For purposes of resolving the Port Authority's motion, the Court draws its factual recitation from the allegations in Talarico's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Charlene Talarico numbers among the Port Authority's roughly 8,000 employees. (Dkt. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 13.) On August 4, 2016, after receiving a hand injury in an altercation with a coworker, Talarico visited one of the Medical Services Offices that the Port Authority provides for the exclusive use of its workers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 16.) There, she received an examination from a Port Authority physician in a private examination room. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 30-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following this incident, Talarico initiated legal proceedings in a New Jersey municipal court against the coworker who\n   had injured her. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 34.) During the course of discovery, the Port Authority allowed Talarico to view several video recordings, one of which showed Talarico's August 4, 2016 medical examination in its entirety. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 35-36.) The recording appeared to have been taken from a wall- or ceiling-mounted camera that had been pointed directly into the examination area. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 37-38.) Talarico had not previously been aware of the recording, and she had never consented to having her examination recorded. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 1, 2018, Talarico initiated the instant lawsuit against the Port Authority on behalf of herself and a proposed class of all other employees who had been and would be subjected to \"covert video surveillance\" during a medical examination at any of the Port Authority's Medical Services Offices. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 19.) Talarico's four-count complaint claims that the Port Authority's alleged practice of covertly filming its employees' medical examinations without their consent violates the guarantees against unreasonable searches enshrined in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (Count One) and Article I, \u00a7 12, of the New York State Constitution (Count Three), and that the practice also violates the privacy guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (Count Two) and Article I, \u00a7 6, of the New York State Constitution (Count Four). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-60.) Talarico pursues her federal claims by way of Section 1983, a remedial federal civil-rights statute, and she pursues her state-law claims directly under the New York State Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition to class-wide relief, Talarico seeks compensatory and punitive damages on her own behalf. (Compl. \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 27, 2018, the Port Authority moved to dismiss or strike several of Talarico's claims. (Dkt. No. 15.) Specifically, the Port Authority argues that Talarico's Section 1983 claims, as well as her claim for punitive damages, must be dismissed in their entirety for failure to state a viable legal claim. (Dkt. No. 18 at 4-6, 20.) To the extent that Talarico\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   stated a claim under federal law, the Port Authority further argues that her state-law claims must be dismissed in light of the available federal remedy. (Dkt. No. 18 at 6-8.) Finally, the Port Authority moves to dismiss or strike all of Talarico's class claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court first considers the Port Authority's argument that certain of Talarico's claims must be dismissed for failure to state a viable legal claim and then turns to the Port Authority's motion to strike Talarico's class claims from her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, it argues that Talarico has failed to state a Section 1983 claim as to any plaintiff, or at least as to any plaintiff other than Talarico herself. (Dkt. No. 18 at 4-6, 8-12.) Second, to the extent that any of Talarico's Section 1983 claims survive, the Port Authority argues that the corresponding state-law claims must be dismissed in light of the available federal remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 18 at\n   6-8.) Finally, the Port Authority argues that any claim for punitive damages must be dismissed as a matter of law. (Dkt. No. 18 at 20.)

Accordingly, to state a Section 1983 claim against the Port Authority, Talarico must plausibly allege \"(1) an official policy or custom that (2) causes [her] to be subjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847909\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/393/#p397\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Batista\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847909\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/393/#p397\">\n    702 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   397 ).

Of course, the complaint alleges that the Port Authority has a \"policy, practice, or custom of covertly video surveilling employee medical examinations.\" (Compl. \u00b6 6.) But the Port Authority argues that this allegation is a mere \"conclusory statement\" devoid of the factual specificity required to survive a motion to dismiss. (Dkt.

Jan. 24, 2013) ). In this case, though, the factual allegations surrounding the single known instance of surveillance \"tend[ ] to support, at least circumstantially, ... an inference\" of a more widespread practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Lopez v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 Civ. 1650,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20213243\">\n    2017 WL 213243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y.

June 18, 2009) ). Specifically, Talarico alleges that she was covertly videotaped by a camera that appeared to be \"a fixture in [an] examination room\" (Compl. \u00b6 38) used \"solely for the provision of medical services to [the Port Authority's] employees\" (Compl. \u00b6 16). And the complaint nowhere suggests that the conduct of Talarico's examination was in any way unusual. If, as is alleged, the Port Authority used an installed camera to videotape one run-of-the-mill medical examination, it is plausible to infer that the Port Authority regularly recorded others too. If anything, it is the Port Authority, not Talarico, that asks the Court to draw an implausible inference: that the video camera somebody had taken the trouble to set up as a permanent installation in a Port Authority examination room was not generally being used to record what happened in that room and that the fact of Talarico's examination having been recorded-rather than an indication that the camera was being used to perform the function cameras typically perform-was simply an inexplicable outlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the weakness in its main argument, the Port Authority shifts gears in its reply brief. There, it argues that even if Talarico has plausibly alleged that\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   -perhaps a rogue employee-was habitually recording the private examinations that took place in the Port Authority's medical offices, the complaint's allegations fail to plausibly support an inference that the Port Authority itself approved, or even knew of, this practice. (Dkt. No. 28 at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This argument, too, strains credulity. It is certainly plausible to infer that an individual with sufficient access to install a permanent video camera in a non-public area within the Port Authority's premises (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31) acted with the Port Authority's approval. Moreover, the complaint makes clear that the Port Authority was aware of the footage being produced: after all, it was the Port Authority that provided Talarico with the recording of her examination in the first place. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) It is thus plausible that discovery could turn up evidence that the Port Authority \"endorsed\" or at least had \"constructive knowledge\" of a practice of filming its employees' private examinations,\n   <em>\n    Guzman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205018553\">\n    2013 WL 5018553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Saenz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202735867\">\n    2008 WL 2735867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ), and Talarico has therefore adequately alleged an official policy or custom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Constitutional Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Port Authority next argues that Talarico's Section 1983 claims must be dismissed, at least in part, for failing to plausibly allege that any \"constitutional violation actually occurred\" as a result of any alleged policy or custom. (Dkt. No. 18 at 5.) Specifically, the Port Authority argues that the complaint fails to plausibly allege that any plaintiff other than Talarico suffered a Fourth Amendment violation (Dkt.

To the contrary, in the context relevant here-that of governmental intrusions into medical confidentiality-the Second Circuit has indicated that \"less culpable mental states\" than malice can support Fourteenth Amendment liability where \"a context-specific balancing\" reveals state action to be \"egregious\" in light of the privacy interest it violates.\n   <em>\n    Hancock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/#p65\">\n    882 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court acknowledges that the Port Authority may ultimately be able to demonstrate that its covert collection of its employees' private medical information is handled in such a way, and is supported by such necessity, that it is justifiable.

Punitive Damages Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the Port Authority argues that Talarico's punitive-damages claims must be dismissed because governmental entities such as the Port Authority are immune from such damages. (Dkt. No. 18 at 20.) Talarico makes no argument to the contrary, and this Court observes that \"the Third Circuit and the overwhelming majority of district courts within this Circuit have held\" that \"punitive damages are not available against the Port Authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Urbina v.

Motion to Strike Class Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having concluded that Talarico is entitled to proceed solely on her Section 1983 claims, the Court now considers the Port Authority's motion to strike Talarico's class allegations insofar as it relates to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The complaint here seeks class treatment under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and 23(b)(3). (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Rule 23(b)(1) allows for class treatment in cases where multiple individual proceedings could prejudice the interests of non-party class members or impose inconsistent standards of conduct on the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1). And Rule 23(b)(3) allows for class treatment where \"questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and ... a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Finally, any class action-whether under Rule 23(b)(1) or 23(b)(3) -must satisfy four preconditions set out in Rule 23(a) : (1) the class must be \"so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\"; (2) there must be \"questions of law or fact common to the class\"; and the class\n   representatives must (3) have claims typical of the class claims and (4) be able to \"fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In support of its motion to strike Talarico's class claims, the Port Authority argues that Talarico's allegations fail to sufficiently plead that the requirements of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) have been satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 18 at 12-16.) For example, the Port Authority points out that the complaint fails to allege how many other employees' medical examinations were videotaped, describe the circumstances under which any other videotapes were made, or establish that the circumstances under which the videotape of Talarico's examination was viewed were typical of the circumstances under which any other videotapes may have been viewed.

Because Rules 23(c)(1)(A) and 23(d)(1)(D), which deal specifically with class claims, are more obviously applicable here, and because the Port Authority never argues that a Rule 12(f) analysis would differ from an analysis under the class-claim rules, the Court analyzes the motion to strike under Rules 23(c)(1)(A) and 23(d)(1)(D).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Port Authority also argues that all state-law claims of all putative class members other than Talarico herself must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because those putative class members have not complied with the state-law statutory requirements for overcoming the Port Authority's default immunity to suit.
