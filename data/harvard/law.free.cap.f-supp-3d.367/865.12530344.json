Tollefson (\"Tollefson\"), is charged in a two-count indictment with soliciting an underaged girl over the Internet to send him pictures of her performing sex acts. (Docket # 10). On May 25, 2018, Tollefson filed separate motions to dismiss each count of the indictment. (Docket # 21 and # 22). On August 29, 2018, Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph submitted a report and recommendation (the \"Report\") recommending that this Court deny Tollefson's motion to dismiss Count One in part and reserve ruling in part until a factual record is developed at trial. (Docket # 38). Magistrate Joseph further recommended that the motion to dismiss Count Two be denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tollefson filed an objection to the magistrate's Report, (Docket # 40), the government filed a response thereto, (Docket # 41), and Tollefson filed a reply, (Docket # 42). For the reasons stated below, Tollefson's objection will be overruled, the Report will be largely adopted, and Tollefson's motions to dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    2. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When reviewing a magistrate's recommendation, this Court is obliged to analyze\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   \"those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C).

RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Tollefson does not dispute Magistrate Joseph's factual findings in the Report. The Court therefore adopts the magistrate's findings of fact for purposes of resolving Tollefson's motions. A summary of those facts, taken from the magistrate's Report and the evidence submitted in conjunction with the motions, is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 6, 2017, the Pierce County Sheriff's Office was dispatched to speak to a couple whose thirteen-year-old daughter, identified in the parties' motion papers as\n   M.H., had been exchanging explicit pictures and videos online using her cell phone. A deputy interviewed the parents of M.H., who reported that M.H.'s grandmother had caught her talking to an older man on Skype. A Pierce County investigator then interviewed M.H., who admitted to communicating with two older men on Skype and Live.me. Both of them had asked her to \"finger herself\" and \"show her boobs.\" M.H. told the investigator that she sent one video and fewer than ten photos of herself nude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A forensic examination of M.H.'s phone revealed child pornography. Pierce County issued a subpoena to Live.me for the account information associated with one of the users with whom M.H. had communicated and determined that user was Tollefson, a 43-year-old man living in the Milwaukee area with his longtime girlfriend and their five-year-old daughter. Tollefson apparently held himself out to be a fifteen-year-old boy named Chord Bennett and used as his profile picture an image of a teenager he found on the Internet. From another subpoena issued to Live.me, investigators obtained a log of private messages between M.H. and Tollefson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket # 25). The log reflects that the chats between M.H. and Tollefson began sometime on or around October 16, 2017 with the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Tollefson: u r hot r u single\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   MH: Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Tollefson: age\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Tollefson: can I see pic u r so hot\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   MH: 13 and no\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   MH: So\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Tollefson: that is me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   MH: Not seeing it\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Tollefson: only can see it when off your live\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MH: Ok\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Docket # 25 at 1-2).

The \"castle\" Tollefson offered M.H. (and the \"Porsche\" he offered later in the chat) were virtual gifts offered in exchange for the photos. Live.me sells \"coins,\" a type of virtual currency, which can be used to purchase gifts that appear as graphic icons within the Live.me app. When a viewer gives a broadcaster a gift, its value in \"diamonds\" is credited to the broadcaster's account. The broadcaster can convert the diamonds into coins, at a slightly lower rate, to purchase Live.me gifts for others or can cash them out into U.S. currency. The castle was the most valuable single gift available within Live.me and would have had a monetary value to M.H. of approximately $ 100. Sending and receiving virtual gifts also increases the user's status in the Live.me app in proportion to the value of the gift. Receiving a valuable gift would have increased the visibility of M.H.'s videos within the app, gaining her a larger audience and enabling her to send rating-boosting gifts to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The chats between M.H. and Tollefson continued, with M.H. continuing to ask for another dare. Tollefson's requests became increasingly more explicit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Tollefson: dare u to take underware off\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   MH: Do I have to take a pic\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Tollefson: yes or take a vid of it\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   MH: Done\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   MH: Different\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   MH: Dare\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Tollefson: dare u to take video of u showing inside it spread it open with fingers\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   MH: Ok\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   MH: But can we do it at night\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   MH: Ok\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Tollefson: can u just show that quick\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   MH: Because my brother is home and my dad will be home soon\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Tollefson: go in bathroom quick and do it\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The logic of this discrepancy is that, unlike the recipient, distributor, or possessor of child pornography, the producer \"confronts the underage victim personally and may reasonably be required to ascertain that victim's age.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332234\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/64/#p76\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Congress has placed the risk of mistake of age on the producer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Tollefson moved to dismiss Count One on the ground that Section 2251 is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied to him, because it imposes strict liability with regard to a victim's age even for people who confront the child victim over the Internet, not face-to-face.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket # 21). Without face-to-face contact, he says, the pornography producer has no real opportunity to ascertain the victim's age.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The statute is facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment, he argues, because it is likely to chill protected speech-namely, sexting and virtual roleplaying between adults-because it is difficult to confirm the age of online partners.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. It is also unconstitutional as-applied to him, he says, because it imposes strict liability unfairly, given that he had no reasonable opportunity to learn the fact that made his actions criminal. Magistrate Joseph recommended denying Tollefson's facial overbreadth challenge and reserving ruling on his as-applied challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1.1 Facial Versus As-Applied Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   To begin, the Court first notes the confusion in the parties' briefing as to whether Tollefson's challenge is primarily as-applied or facial, and whether he abandoned his facial challenge in objecting to the magistrate's Report. Tollefson states in his original motion that his challenge is both as-applied and facial, but he does not make distinct arguments to that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket # 21 at 16). Magistrate Joseph construed his motion as presenting both types of challenges, but found that the thrust of Tollefson's argument was an as-applied challenge. (Docket # 38 at 9).

Nonetheless, the\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   court's analysis can reasonably be extended to this case. As to the statute's alleged overbreadth, Tollefson, like Fletcher, has not shown that Section 2251 reaches a \"substantial\" number of impermissible applications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095721\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095721\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/395/#p401\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It may well be true that Live.me and other virtual spaces are rife with fake profiles and people lying about their ages. Even so, Tollefson has not established that any more than a small fraction of the population desires to participate in sexting and role-playing online with anonymous strangers, whose age is difficult to verify. There are fewer still who, after employing reasonable efforts to verify an online partner's age, would still be tricked.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095721\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095721\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/395/#p401\">\n    at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]lthough the theoretical possibility exists that every diligent attempt at age verification may fail, we think such a risk is small and does not create a 'substantial' burden on protected expression.\").

It applies, for example, where the defendant surreptitiously recorded himself having sex with a fifteen-year-old girl and provided her with drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

His argument generally follows this line of logic: strict liability is constitutional only if the child pornography producer confronts his victim face-to-face, because that is the only way for the producer to gain \"knowledge of the only fact which makes his conduct a crime\" (Docket # 21 at 15); Tollefson did not confront his victim face-to-face; and therefore strict liability cannot attach to him. Magistrate Joseph characterized this argument as an as-applied challenge (under which constitutional provision, she did not say) and recommended reserving ruling until more facts are developed at trial about Tollefson's opportunity to learn M.H.'s age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Tollefson also does not explicitly say which constitutional provision he believes underlies his major premise that Congress can impose strict liability (as to one element of an offense) only where the defendant has a reasonable opportunity to learn the fact that makes his conduct a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Perhaps he believes it is the First Amendment, because the Supreme Court has expressed concern about the First Amendment implications of strict liability criminal statutes involving speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Rather, the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   court considered whether convincing a child to masturbate in front of a webcam, or asking a child to watch an adult masturbate, constituted \"sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a crime\" as that phrase is used in the federal child enticement statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n    at 256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 2246 defines \"sexual act\" to include, among other things not relevant here, \"the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of another person who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(D).

The Court agrees, instead, with Magistrate Joseph, who found the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   analysis inapplicable here. First and most obviously, the terms and statutes at issue are not the same; this Court is not bound to follow the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of a completely different law. Further, unlike the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , Section 1591 contains its own definition section. For the definition of \"commercial sex act,\" Congress chose not to cross reference Section 2246's definition of \"sexual act.\" It certainly could have, as it did in Section 2423. Finally, the goals and objectives of the various statutes that comprise Title 18 are different, and therefore it does not necessarily follow that the terms \"sex act\" or \"sexual act\" or \"sexual activity\" all have the same meaning in each section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In the absence of authority from the Seventh Circuit on how to construe the term \"sex act\" in Section 1591, this Court must apply the usual rules of statutory construction to determine its meaning. \"Statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Olofson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236561\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/652/#p658\">\n    563 F.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658 (7th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The court assumes that \"the purpose of the statute is communicated by the ordinary meaning of the words Congress used; therefore, absent any clear indication of a contrary purpose, the plain language is conclusive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236561\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/652/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This generally means looking to the meaning of the word \"at the time the statute was enacted, ... often by referring to dictionaries[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Blitt &amp; Gaines, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352282\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/860/#p863\">\n    833 F.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 863 (7th Cir. 2016) (quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Magistrate Joseph turned to the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines \"sex act\" as \"a sexual action or activity, especially the act of sexual intercourse.\" The same dictionary defines \"masturbation\" as \"[t]he stimulation, usually by hand, of one's genitals for sexual pleasure; the action or practice of masturbating oneself or (less commonly) another person.\" Because stimulating one's genitals for pleasure is a \"sexual action or activity,\" she reasoned, masturbation is a sex act. The government cited the Collins English Dictionary, Wiktionary, and International-Dictionary.com, which define \"sex act\" as \"any act involving sexual stimulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Tollefson replies by arguing that some narrower dictionary definitions of \"sex act\" that include language about the involvement of \"another\" would not encompass masturbation. He cites Merriam Webster, Vocabulary.com, and the Concise Oxford Dictionary, which define \"sex act\" as, respectively: \"an act performed with another for sexual gratification,\" \"the act of sexual procreation between a man and a woman,\" and \"the act of sexual intercourse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The parties did not cite any dictionaries from the time of the statute's enactment, which was 2000. The Court's own research turned up a 2000 edition of Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, which defines \"sex act\" as \"sexual intercourse; copulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The Court finds that the ordinary meaning of sex act does not require physical contact; it includes masturbation. The narrowest definitions cited by Tollefson (and which the Court found independently) limit \"sex act\" to the ultimate sexual act-intercourse. The statute is clear that \"sex act\" includes more than just intercourse: it defines \"commercial sex act\" as \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   sex act, on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) (emphasis added). The\n   inclusion of the word \"any\" indicates that more than one type of sex act-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   not just the ultimate sex act, intercourse-is encompassed in the definition. Therefore, the narrowest definition clearly does not apply. All of the other definitions cited by the magistrate and the parties (including the Merriam Webster definition on which Tollefson relies, \"an act performed with another for sexual gratification\") encompass acts of sexual gratification generally, and no one disputes that masturbation is an act of sexual gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Therefore, the government's factual allegations in Count Two of the indictment are sufficient to state a claim under Section 1591. Tollefson's motion to dismiss Count Two will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    5. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Tollefson has not shown that Count One of the indictment violates his constitutional rights nor that Count Two of the indictment fails to state a claim. The Court will, therefore, overrule his objection, (Docket # 40), adopt Magistrate Joseph's Report in all respects apart from her recommendation to reserve ruling on Tollefson's as-applied constitutional challenge, (Docket # 38), and deny Tollefson's motions to dismiss, (Docket # 21 and # 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Should Tollefson wish to resolve this case short of trial and remain eligible for acceptance of responsibility credit, counsel for Tollefson must notify the Court of such intention, including the filing of a written plea agreement, within\n   <strong>\n    twenty-one (21) days\n   </strong>\n   from entry of this Order.
