PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (the \"NRDC\") brings claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (the \"APA\") to challenge the issuance of a directive by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\"), which purportedly purges the EPA's advisory committees of scientists from academic and non-profit backgrounds in favor of those from industries the EPA regulates (the \"Directive\"). The EPA moves, as a threshold matter, to dismiss the NRDC's claims on jurisdictional grounds under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Both parties also move for summary judgment under Rule 56 on the merits of the NRDC's claims. Various states and former EPA personnel have submitted\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   briefs in support of the NRDC's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The implications of the Directive are potentially far reaching, and similar challenges have reached at least two other federal courts. Whatever the merits of these challenges, however, this Court's determination is narrow-only that\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is the proper party to challenge the agency action. The NRDC's lack of Article III standing to bring this action compels the dismissal of its claims without prejudice. Therefore, the EPA's motion to dismiss is granted, and the parties' dueling motions for summary judgment are denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 31, 2017, Scott Pruitt-then the Administrator of the EPA-issued the Directive and an accompanying memorandum regarding the eligibility of individuals to receive competitive research grants from the EPA and to serve on the EPA's nearly two-dozen federal advisory committees (the \"Memorandum\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These advisory committees provide expert and technical advice as well as recommendations to the EPA. At its core, the challenged portion of the Directive prevents those who have received an EPA research grant from simultaneously serving on an advisory committee. According to the NRDC, the Directive-under the guise of promoting independence and removing financial\n   conflicts of interest-functionally targets qualified scientists from academic, non-profit, and other independent institutions. The NRDC claims that the Directive in effect serves as a pretext to skew representation on the advisory committees in favor of individuals employed or funded by industries that the EPA regulates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal advisory committees are bodies established by Congress, the President, or federal agency heads to provide expert advice and recommendations on various issues. As relevant here, the EPA relies on approximately two dozen such committees to advise on a broad range of environmental issues and provide peer review of the science it uses. (Amended Complaint, ECF No. 13 (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 (\"FACA\") governs the establishment, management, oversight, and operation of federal advisory committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C.

Similarly, FACA and its implementing regulations do not set forth any specific membership or eligibility requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the other hand, the statutes that establish some of the EPA advisory committees set forth membership requirements in varying degrees of granularity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (requiring members of the Science Advisory Board to be \"qualified by education, training, and experience to evaluate scientific and technical information on matters referred to the Board\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207409\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A) (mandating that the Clean Air Scientific\n   Advisory Council be \"composed of seven members including at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences, one physician, and one person representing State air pollution control agencies\"); 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136w(d)(1) (requiring the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Science Advisory Panel to \"consist of 7 members appointed by the [EPA] Administrator from a list of 12 nominees, 6 nominated by the National Institutes of Health and 6 by the National Science Foundation,\" to be \"selected on the basis of their professional qualifications to assess the effects of the impact of pesticides on health and the environment\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202625\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(3) (providing that the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals must be \"composed of representatives of such science, government, labor, public health, public interest, animal protection, industry, and other groups as the [EPA] Administrator deems to be advisable, including representatives that have specific scientific experience in the relationship of chemical exposures to women, children, and other potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Directive\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In broad strokes, the Directive-which neither party disputes was issued without notice and comment-proclaimed four new principles for the EPA to apply in establishing the membership of its advisory committees. These principles are aimed toward \"strengthen[ing] and improv[ing] the independence, diversity and breadth of participation on EPA federal advisory committees.\" (Compl., Ex. A (the \"Directive\").) As relevant here, NRDC challenges the portion of the Directive that purports to prohibit simultaneous receipt of EPA grants and service on advisory committees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That portion provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Strengthen Member Independence:\n   </em>\n   Members shall be independent from EPA, which shall include a requirement that no member of an EPA federal advisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA grants, either as principal investigator or co-investigator, or in a position that otherwise would reap substantial direct benefit from an EPA grant. This principle shall not apply to state, tribal or local government agency recipients of EPA grants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Directive.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to this mandatory principle, the Directive also articulates three aspirational principles-namely, that \"committee balance should reflect prominent participation from state, tribal and local government,\" that \"membership should be balanced with individuals from different states and EPA regions\" (especially historically unrepresented or underrepresented ones), and that \"membership should be rotated regularly.\" Finally, the Directive contains two disclaimers. First, it states that it \"is intended to improve the internal management of EPA\" and disavows the creation of any \"right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, EPA, its officers or employees, or any other person.\" Second, the Directive reserves to the EPA administrator the discretion to depart from the principles it announces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Memorandum purports to explain the principles underlying the Directive. (Compl., Ex. B (\"Memorandum\"), at 2.) As relevant to the challenged portion of the\n   Directive, its prefatory language reaffirms FACA's \"fair balance\" requirement, the importance of qualified candidates, and the need for candidates to be \"independent from the Agency,\" to \"avoid any conflicts of interest within the scope of their review,\" and to be \"fully committed to objectively serving the Agency and public.\" (Memorandum, at 2.) This language also explains that the other three principles, which generally seek to broaden the diversity of advisory committee composition, are grounded in \"cooperative federalism and recognition of the unique experience of state, tribal and local government officials.\" (Memorandum, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   More specifically, the Memorandum states that advisory committee members \"should avoid financial entanglements with EPA to the greatest extent possible,\" and that \"[n]on-governmental and non-tribal members in direct receipt of EPA grants while serving on an EPA [advisory committee] can create the appearance or reality of potential interference with their ability to independently and objectively serve as [an advisory committee] member.\" (Memorandum, at 3.) Consequently, it reiterates that \"in addition to EPA's existing policies and legal requirements preventing conflicts of interest among the membership of the Agency's [advisory committees],\" EPA advisory committee members may not \"currently receive EPA grants, either as principal investigator or co-investigator, or in a position that otherwise would reap substantial direct benefit from an EPA grant.\" (Memorandum, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The NRDC's Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the issuance of the Directive, qualified scientists employed by academic and non-profit research institutions were removed from EPA advisory committees. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7, 46.) According to the NRDC, they were replaced by many individuals who are employed or funded by the industries the EPA is responsible for regulating. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7, 36, 47.) For instance, as the NRDC alleges, 30 of 44 members of the Science Advisory Board are now affiliated with regulated industries. (Compl. \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Complaint asserts three APA claims. First, the NRDC asserts that the EPA's issuance of the Directive was arbitrary and capricious because the agency does not explain (1) how the Directive comports with FACA's requirements that advisory committees be \"fairly balanced\" and not \"inappropriately influenced\" by special interests; (2) how it complies with statutory requirements that advisory committees have members with relevant scientific expertise; (3) why it exempts state, local, and tribal grantees; (4) how it squares with federal conflict-of-interest regulations; or (5) why the receipt of EPA grants would create a conflict of interest. Second, the NRDC claims that the Directive's issuance was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA did not explain the reasons for reversing its prior position that advisory committee members could simultaneously receive EPA grants. Relatedly, the NRDC faults the EPA for failing to explain why it disregarded the factual determinations underlying that position. Third, as a procedural matter, the NRDC avers that the EPA flouted the APA's notice-and-comment requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under Rule 12(b)(1), a case is \"properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction ... when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Makarova v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757397\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/110/#p113\">\n    201 F.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 (2d Cir. 2000).

The EPA contends that this Court lacks both the constitutional and statutory authority to adjudicate this case for three primary reasons. First, it attacks the NRDC's Article III standing to assert the claims in the Complaint. Second, the EPA seeks to dismiss this lawsuit based on prudential ripeness concerns. Third, it maintains that the NRDC's claims are not reviewable under the APA because the Directive does not constitute final agency action, and also because no meaningful standards of review apply to the challenged agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, this Court concludes that the NRDC lacks Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley Forge Christian Coll. v.

Moreover, it is not evident how the NRDC's ability to pursue its advocacy and litigation activities would be impaired by the Directive-if anything, the filing of this action appears to be squarely within the NRDC's core activities.

It bolsters this contention with decisions by two sister courts of appeals purportedly recognizing that a violation of FACA may confer a constitutional injury on those affected by an advisory committee's work. But the NRDC reads too much into those decisions. Those cases do not stand for the proposition that violations of FACA's \"fair balance\" requirement injure any person with an abstract interest in or who may be affected by the work of advisory committees in general-instead, they explain that a cognizable injury may lie for those with a direct interest in or who are themselves directly affected by a specific advisory committee's work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cargill, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kaufman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12-13; Sarnat Decl. \u00b6 12; Adams Decl. \u00b6 14; Driscoll Decl. \u00b6 8.) The facts in the declarations do not suggest that the NRDC's members faced such loss or imminent loss when the NRDC filed this action in January 2018. Importantly, and by way of comparison, at least one plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Physicians\n   </em>\n   had allegedly\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   been removed from an advisory committee when that lawsuit commenced-thus, it is unsurprising that the\n   <em>\n    Physicians\n   </em>\n   court did not engage in a lengthy analysis on the existence of an injury-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although this Court concludes that the NRDC fails to establish standing based on lost professional opportunities, it also considers whether the NRDC had standing at the outset of this litigation based on its allegation that its members who are currently advisory committee members would be precluded from competing for EPA grants, and that those who are current recipients of EPA grants would be barred from the opportunity to seek appointment to an advisory committee. (Compl. \u00b6 48.) The EPA does not dispute that as a general matter, the loss of\n   an equal opportunity to compete for a benefit may give rise to a cognizable injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mantena v.

Cir. 1989) (\"[A] plaintiff suffers a constitutionally cognizable injury by the loss of an opportunity to pursue a benefit ... even though the plaintiff may not be able to show that it was certain to receive that benefit had it been accorded the lost opportunity.\" (emphasis removed) ). Thus, the NRDC is correct that it need not allege that its members actually applied for and were denied an EPA grant or committee position-the injury itself is the deprivation of an equal opportunity to compete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v.

But in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   context, the Second Circuit has stated that the requirement of \"imminent\" or \"certainly impending\" harm in this context means that a plaintiff must at least allege that it actually applied for a benefit or \"very likely would have\" applied for the benefit but for defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MGM Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276102\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/40/#p46\">\n    861 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   47 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527655\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/337/308/#p320\">\n    337 F.Supp.3d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, for example, the\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood\n   </em>\n   court found that Planned Parenthood had \"asserted specific facts sufficient to support its contention that it 'very likely would have bid' absent [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'] allegedly unlawful actions\" based on representations that it applies for grants in furtherance of its core mission, that it has applied for the relevant grants \"at every opportunity,\" and that it had taken concrete exploratory steps to apply for a particular grant before ultimately deciding not to apply.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527655\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/337/308/#p320\">\n    337 F.Supp.3d at 320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This is not to say that Article III necessitates the showing made by Planned Parenthood. But \"imminence\" requires more than an interest in an undefined benefit or opportunity at some point in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MGM Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276102\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/40/#p46\">\n    861 F.3d at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding bare allegations of interest in development opportunities and exploratory studies without any \"concrete plans to enter into a development agreement\" or \"serious attempts at negotiation\" to be insufficient). Thus, that some of the NRDC's members may maintain a general interest in pursuing EPA grants and serving on advisory committees-without more-does not satisfy the \"imminence\" inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schlesinger Decl. \u00b6 10; Rosi-Marshall Decl. \u00b6 9.) Other members of the NRDC state that they have previously served on committees or received EPA funding, and that they may be deterred from applying for such opportunities in the future. (Kaufman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10; Sarnat Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 14; Adams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 16.) Certainly, a party's\n   past practice may be probative as to the likelihood of future action, which \"is concededly a somewhat elastic concept.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   565 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the factual record in this action yields a meaningfully weaker inference that an NRDC member \"very likely would have\" applied for a future advisory committee position or EPA grant when the NRDC filed this action. For instance, the NRDC's declarations do not identify any particular position or grant or specify any concrete action taken in furtherance of applying. Nor do they suggest a similarly consistent historical practice of applying for such positions or grants, or even that certain members had applied for\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   governmental grants since the issuance of the Directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although the \"imminence\" of an alleged injury lies on a spectrum that defies a binary categorization, it \"cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes-that the injury is\n   <em>\n    certainly\n   </em>\n   impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   565 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (quotation marks omitted).
