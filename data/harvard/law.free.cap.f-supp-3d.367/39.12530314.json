Defendants have responded with a motion to dismiss, arguing procedural and substantive infirmities in Plaintiff's pleadings that cannot be redressed by amendment. For the reasons stated in this Opinion, certain of Plaintiff's claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the \"ADA\") survive, and the remainder of Plaintiff's claims are dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts as true the well-pleaded allegations of Plaintiff's pleadings. Plaintiff, who is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , is legally blind; in 2017, he was detained at the Otis Bantum Correctional Center (the \"OBCC\"), and then at the North Infirmary Command (the \"NIC\"), both of which are part of the Rikers Island correctional facility complex in New York City. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 29-32).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Cynthia Braun is the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction (the \"DOC\"); she replaces Joseph Ponte, the former DOC Commissioner whom Plaintiff initially named in the Complaint. (Compl. \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Compl. Caption). Defendant Carolyn Sanders is the Warden and highest ranking official at NIC. (Compl. \u00b6 6). Defendant Nadene Pinnock is the Deputy General Counsel of the DOC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Defendant Vicki Burgess is a DOC correction officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). Defendant Nina Edwards is a DOC disability rights coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to entering DOC custody, Plaintiff sustained injuries that included \"[b]lindness in both eyes, broken finger, [s]titches in right leg open wounds (tibia fibula), swelling and lacerations of facial area closed eye, contusion of left leg, high fever,\n   and dizziness.\" (Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 6). According to Plaintiff, these symptoms were initially ignored, and Plaintiff was denied medical care over the course of 32 hours, while he was in the new admittance holding pen at Rikers Island. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Plaintiff was eventually transferred to a medical unit within OBCC and provided with crutches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff there informed the medical staff of his pre-existing condition of advanced glaucoma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From January 8, 2017, until January 20, 2017, Plaintiff was housed in the Security Risk Group (or \"SRG\") at OBCC, in an upper dormitory reached by three flights of stairs, along with other inmates who were gang members, despite Plaintiff's having \"injuries to the right leg and contusions on the left leg with crutches and a broken finger and [being] clearly disabled[.]\" (Compl. \u00b6 29; Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was also transported on a general population bus, rather than a \"para van transport\" for people with disabilities. (Compl. \u00b6 31). Plaintiff feared for his safety, causing him \"difficulties using the rest room, [using the] telephone, writing letters, showering, safe keeping personal items, and protecting himself from harm.\" (Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 8). Plaintiff \"repeatedly sign[ed] up for sick-call and filed complaints to try to get properly housed in handicap housing[.]\" (Compl. \u00b6 31).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After placing sick calls daily, and lodging complaints repeatedly, Plaintiff was eventually examined by an eye specialist, who diagnosed him as legally blind. (Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. E (September 8, 2017 diagnosis of legal blindness by physician at NIC) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 20, 2017, Plaintiff was transferred to NIC, where he was \"informed that handicap housing was shut down,\" and placed in a medical unit dormitory. (Compl. \u00b6 32; Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 10). While in the medical unit, Plaintiff was issued a \"short\" blind mobility cane. (Compl. \u00b6 33). Plaintiff alleges that he should have been issued a \"tall\" blind mobility cane, and that the cane provided to him \"was too short\" for him to use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff also lacked an inmate mobility assistant, or sighted guide, to assist him in his movements around the facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). The Court understands that Plaintiff is not only challenging prison officials' failure to act on his requests for accommodations, but also their failure to advise him of available resources for blind inmates. As stated in the pleadings, Plaintiff was compelled to \"[c]ontinue on crutches, without [a] mobility guide, social worker,\n   <em>\n    or information on Reasonable Accommodations\n   </em>\n   within [the] facility [which] should have consist[ed] of,\n   <em>\n    free matter for the blind mail, mobility guide, Blind cane, video Court, and devices within facility law library, corrective lenses, social worker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    phone system, large lettering commissary purchases, [and] Braille courses.\n   </em>\n   \" (Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 10 (first emphasis added, second emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was also allegedly denied access to assistive devices in the law library, and this denial forms a significant portion of\n   his factual allegations against Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the operative Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff went to the law library, and asked Defendant VICKI BURGESS, the law library officer, about assistive devices to utilize for \"legally blind\" and visually impaired inmates. Plaintiff showed the Defendant his grievance about reasonable accommodations and letter from [Deputy] of Programs Ms. Chaplin, and Defendant NINA EDWARDS about assistive devices being in the law library, and Defendant BURGESS denied plaintiff from utilizing the assistive devices, stating his medical documents of being legally blind and paper work had no[ ] merit, and that he could not utilize any assistive devices which fall[ ] under reasonable accommodations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 36). Plaintiff's March Supplemental Complaint further specifies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In and around [July 20, 2017,] plaintiff entered the Law library at (NIC) North Infirmary Command. Seeking assistance in utilizing devices, under Reasonable Accommodations relating to visual Impairment, such as qualified readers, taped texts, or other effective methods available to individuals with visual impairment, acquisition, or modification of equipment or devices. Upon entering[, Plaintiff] received little if any assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff contacted Defendant Nina Edwards to request reasonable accommodations. (Compl. \u00b6 37). According to the Complaint, \"[w]hen plaintiff contacted defendant NINA EDWARDS, she referred the request for reasonable accommodations to [another person] when she [was] supposed to have handled it herself[,]\" suggesting that Defendant Edwards may have delayed or impaired Plaintiff's attempts to access accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additional information is provided in Plaintiff's March Supplemental Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [A] law Clerk directed him to [a] posting containing Nina Edwards's incorrect information of location. Plaintiff addresse[d] a letter to Nina Edwards resulting in return to sender due to incorrect address.... [P]revious complaints ... were ignore[d] at the hands of Nina Edwards. Plaintiff filed a grievance. On [August 13, 2017,] due to no response [Plaintiff] filed a second grievance involving reasonable accommodations within [the] court system ... and communication barriers. (DOCS) fail[ed] to make such facilities privileges, advantages, or Accommodations available through alternative methods.... In and around the date of [August 18, 2017, Plaintiff] receive[d] [a] visit from\n   <em>\n    Deputy of Programs Ms. Chaplin.\n   </em>\n   [Plaintiff stated his] grievance pertaining to devices, under Reasonable Accommodations within the facility law library.... In and around [August 18, 2017, Plaintiff] entered the law library and was told by [Defendant Burgess that she was] unaware of any access to devices[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Mar. Supp. Compl. \u00b6 29). Plaintiff filed a grievance with both the superintendent and Defendant Edwards in or about August 30, 2017, to no avail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges here that his \"inability to utilize the law library [caused him to] suffer[ ] injuries\" because it impeded his ability to advocate for himself in his legal proceedings\n   and left him \"[u]nable to determine contents of documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Copies of Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodations of his disability at the law library are attached to his pleadings. The first request is contained in an Inmate Grievance and Request Program (\"IGRP\") statement form dated July 20, 2017, wherein Plaintiff stated: \"I am requesting a device to use inside of [the] law library to read ... documents because I'm unable to see due to being legally blind.\" (Compl., Ex. 1 at 4). Also attached is a response, dated August 18, 2017, which states: \"Please be advised that the Disability Rights Coordinator for Inmates has received your request for an accommodation ... you will be informed of a determination as soon as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The second grievance, an appeal to the Warden of NIC dated August 18, 2017, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I have been informed that the assistive devices [were] in the law library, however the law library officer has stated that I'm unable to use it and I've been denied reasonable accommodations Under the American with Disabilities Act, the ADA coordinator was suppose[d] to assure that I got reasonable accommodations, and suppose[d] to respond better to request for it[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Compl., Ex. 1 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's third grievance, an appeal to the DOC dated August 31, 2017, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   There is no assistive device in the law library that \"legally Blind\" and visually impaired inmates can utilize[ ], I was told that there was some in the law library then told by the law library officer BURGESS that I couldn't utilize the assistive devices which she discriminated against me in regards to programs and services available.... I would like to know exactly what reasonable accommodations purchases were made ... because there [are] no assistive devices in the law library and I was denied from utilizing them by law library officer Burgess.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Compl., Ex. 1 at 7-8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Among the exhibits to Plaintiff's December Supplemental Complaint is a different IGRP form, dated August 13, 2017, in which Plaintiff grieves the lack of reasonable accommodations in his housing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I am \"legally blind\" and requesting reasonable accommodations of a mobility guide to assist me with my daily living[. T]here is suppose[d] to be two inmates employed to assist legally blind and visually impaired inmates with their daily living however the disability Dorm is closed down and in Dorm 2 they have dis[a]bled inmates with inmate assistants available].] I need help. [A]lso I am being transported via regu[lar] bus when I [am supposed] to be transported by para van transport with the shoulder strap, in accordance with the \"ADA\" requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Dec. Supp. Compl., Ex. D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Separately, Plaintiff alleges that the NIC facility lacked several accommodations for inmates in wheelchairs or who have difficulty hearing, such as non-slip shower mats and wheelchair-accessible exits, handrails, and proper ramps. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 42-58). Plaintiff also alleges that he was retaliated against for filing complaints and grievances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on November 30, 2017. (Dkt. # 2).

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 67-80). Plaintiff also brings claims for contempt of court, and state-law claims for negligence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-88, 94-97). He seeks injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98-101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed the first of several supplemental factual allegations (Dkt. # 16), which he later informed the Court were not intended to replace the original Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 20). Given Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, the Court will nonetheless consider the facts alleged in Plaintiff's later submissions as supplemental to his Complaint. Additional factual submissions were filed on April 16, 2018 (Dkt. # 25), and May 3, 2018 (Dkt. # 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On December 19, 2018, after briefing on the motion to dismiss had concluded, Plaintiff submitted an additional set of factual allegations, entitled \"Supporting Evidence of Federal Claims.\" (Dkt. # 41). The document contains many of the same allegations, and attaches many of the same exhibits, as his prior two submissions. However, as described above, it contains an additional IGRP form from August 12, 2017, in which Plaintiff seeks a mobility guide and \"para van\" transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Instant Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On July 30, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety. (Dkt. # 35). Plaintiff submitted a memorandum in opposition on August 13, 2018 (Dkt. # 38), and Defendants replied on October 5, 2018 (Dkt. # 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiff's ADA Claims Against the Institutional Defendants Survive in Part and Are Dismissed in Part\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff's ADA claims against the institutional Defendants for monetary damages remain to be considered. Defendants concede that Plaintiff is a \"qualified individual with a disability as defined by the ADA,\" and that the institutional Defendants - DOC (subsumed by Defendant City of New York) and HHC - are subject to the ADA. (Def. Br. 16). However, Defendants maintain that Plaintiff has failed adequately to plead the third, denial-of-services prong of an ADA claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On that prong, Plaintiff's pleadings present three categories of ADA-related allegations that the Court will address in turn: (i) failure to provide assistive devices in the law library; (ii) failure to provide accommodations with respect to Plaintiff's housing, including a mobility guide, separate housing, a longer cane, and separate busing, as well as a failure to provide free postal services; and (iii) non-compliance with ADA guidelines and alleged contempt of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Plaintiff's ADA Claim for Denial of Reasonable Accommodations in the Law Library Survives\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he requested access to assistive devices in the law library, and that he was not provided with such devices, including specifically that Defendant Vicky Burgess denied him access to such devices. (Compl. \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 14). Plaintiff filed multiple written grievances seeking access to the law library, copies of which are appended to the Complaint. (Compl. \u00b6 36, Ex. 1). He also showed Defendant Burgess a letter indicating the existence of the assistive devices, all without success. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Plaintiff contends that he was \"unlawfully denied to utilize visual impairment devices during a critical stage of his criminal proceedings[.]\" (Pl. Opp. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Relatedly, Plaintiff argues that the law library \"falls below any known acceptable standard\" because it lacks sufficient volumes, and has \"outdated software, inoperable typewriters, [and] limited employees with neither knowledgeable insight nor law experience.\" (Pl. Opp. 13). In Plaintiff's view, \"reasonable accommodations for his visual impairment [include] devices such as\n   <em>\n    Sensorial disability law clerk, computers with Thin Client software, zoom-in features, and key boards with large case lettering, also free matter for the blind postage.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants' brief initially appears to seek dismissal of all of Plaintiff's ADA claims, including his claims for denial of access to assistive devices in the law library and blind mail, on the grounds that \"[Plaintiff] has not alleged that he was denied\n   <em>\n    meaningful\n   </em>\n   access to prison services or programs, and because he does not allege that he actually requested any particular accommodation and was subsequently denied such accommodation.\" (Def. Br. 16 (emphasis added) ). One page later, Defendants qualify this argument: \"Plaintiff alleges that he was denied numerous accommodations.... Other than with respect to Plaintiff's allegations regarding the law library and blind mail however, Plaintiff fails to allege that he was prevented from participating in or benefitting from prison programs because of his disability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). And one page after that, Defendants qualify their argument even further: \"[A]part from assistive devices in the law library, nowhere in the Complaint, or any other part of his pleadings, does he allege that he actually requested the accommodations which he alleges he was denied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Therefore, specifically as to assistive devices in the law library, the Court understands Defendants to acknowledge that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that he actually requested the accommodations he was denied. Nonetheless, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's ADA claim should fail because, in Defendants' view, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that he was denied\n   <em>\n    meaningful\n   </em>\n   access to prison services or programs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 18 (asserting that Plaintiff has failed adequately to plead a denial of \"\n   <em>\n    meaningful\n   </em>\n   access to prison services or programs\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Second Circuit has explored the intersection of the ADA concepts of \"reasonable accommodation\" and \"meaningful access\" in the prison context in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York State Department of Corrections\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349764\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/64/#p73\">\n    831 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73-76 (2d Cir. 2016). The plaintiff in that case was confined to a wheelchair; he challenged the mobility assistance program implemented state-wide by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (\"DOCCS\"), which program, among other things, contained a blanket proscription on motorized wheelchairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349764\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/64/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349764\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/64/#p73\">\n    at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff does not contend that he was denied access to any prison programs or services because of his transportation on general population buses; that his ability to access any programs or services was in any way impaired because of the use of these buses; or that he was in any way dissuaded from using the general population buses. Instead, Plaintiff states only that he was transported to these programs and services in a regular bus, rather than a \"para van transport with the shoulder strap.\" (Dec. Supp. Compl. at 30). These allegations do not suffice to state a claim under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Plaintiff's Claims for Non-Compliance with ADA Guidelines and Contempt of Court Are Dismissed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As a third category of ADA claims, Plaintiff alleges that DOC has failed to comply generally with ADA Guidelines and is in contempt of various consent decrees and settlement agreements. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-59, 94-97). To the extent Plaintiff raises them as civil rights violations, the claims fail. \"The remedy for breach of [a consent decree] is a suit for breach of contract or enforcement of the decree through judicial sanctions, including contempt, not an action under \u00a7 1983.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Batista\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847909\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/393/#p398\">\n    702 F.2d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (2d Cir. 1983).

Sept. 24, 2007) (outlining pleading standards).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   These claims also fail under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. As Defendants observe, Plaintiff \"fails to allege that he suffered any injury related to the alleged\" breaches of the consent decrees and settlement agreements, and, indeed, \"fails even to allege that the noncompliance issues ... pertained to his disability or that his disability required accommodations in these contexts.\" (Def. Br. 20). The ADA Guidelines referenced in Plaintiff's pleadings primarily concern wheelchair accessibility and hearing accessibility. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-59, 97). Plaintiff has not alleged that he used a wheelchair, or that he required accommodations for a hearing impairment, at any point during the relevant period. Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiff's claims of non-compliance with ADA Guidelines address any accommodations other than those for which he was eligible as a result of his disability, those claims are also dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Opp. 15 (emphasis added) ). In support, Plaintiff attaches a copy of the 440.20 Opinion issued on May 30, 2018, from the trial court in Kings County, denying Plaintiff's 440.20 Motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

As to this third purported injury, Plaintiff's March Supplemental Complaint presents additional relevant allegations regarding an earlier lawsuit that Plaintiff filed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the arresting officers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [Plaintiff's] claim was dismissed on the grounds that it was not filed or served within the time frame prescribed....

To start, they assert that the 440.20 Opinion undermines Plaintiff's allegations of injury in the making of his 440.20 Motion - both because it establishes that Plaintiff submitted the motion on March 29, 2018, long after Plaintiff had been transferred from DOC custody on September 14, 2017, and because it dismissed Plaintiff's motion on the merits rather than on procedural grounds. (Def. Reply 6). The Court concurs, and observes as well that the state-court judge who issued the 440.20 Opinion found no infirmities in Plaintiff's guilty plea proceeding, while also finding that Plaintiff's counsel was effective for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and the New York State Constitution.
