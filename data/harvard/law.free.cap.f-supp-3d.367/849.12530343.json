LMMC denied liability, claiming that the UMN positions plaintiffs hold fall within the professional and/or administrative exemptions of the FLSA overtime provisions. Before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and motions to seal. Both parties seek summary judgment on LMMC's administrative and professional exemption affirmative defenses. In addition, Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on LMMC's good faith defense, while LMMC seeks summary judgment on the method for calculating Plaintiffs' overtime pay rate. The court will grant the motions to seal and, for the reasons below, grant in part Plaintiffs' motion with respect to the administrative and professional exemptions and grant in part LMMC's motion with respect to the overtime pay rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Utilization Management Nurse Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Managed care companies, like LMMC, employ nurses to conduct utilization reviews, which determine whether certain requested services or benefits are \"medically necessary\" and thus covered by insurance. LMMC employs a team of UMNs whose primary duty is to conduct these utilization reviews for its workers' compensation insurance products. In certain states, utilization reviews in workers' compensation cases are statutorily required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since 2009, LMMC only hires UMNs with Registered Nurse (RN) licensure, and it requires UMNs to keep their RN licenses current. LMMC prefers, but does not require, UMNs to have a bachelor's degree and three to five years of clinical experience. Although UMNs perform the bulk of LMMC's utilization reviews, LMMC sends a portion of its reviews to a third party vendor that allows only RNs to conduct the reviews. To the extent that LMMC has learned that the third party vendor has allowed a non-RN to review an LMMC file, LMMC has addressed the issue to ensure that only RNs complete LMMC reviews. LMMC has strictly enforced this RN-only principle since it hired Kristal Reich, Utilization Management Department Manager, but whether it enforced the policy prior to Reich's hiring is unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   LMMC's job description for the UMN role lists the following responsibilities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Conducts specialized clinical review for medical necessity of Workers' Compensation (WC) claims based on state regulatory guidelines and nationally accepted protocols.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Utilizes clinical judgment and critical thinking to determine appropriateness of requested treatment within evidence-based clinical guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Demonstrates self-motivation, time management and communication skills in order to meet daily production and quality expectations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. Performs the UM Process within state regulated timeframes by: gathering pertinent medical information and researching the claim; applying appropriate clinical guidelines in conjunction with nursing rationale; initiating referrals for physician review if necessary; documenting accordingly per quality assurance standards; communicating decision to provider and/or claims if required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ECF No. 54-10 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LMMC classifies UMNs as exempt from the overtime requirements of the FLSA. As a result, LMMC compensates UMNs with a salary and does not pay them overtime to the extent that they work in excess of forty hours per week. LMMC's employee handbook states: \"It is Company policy to pay exempt employees their full weekly salary for any week in which they perform any work for the Company, without regard to the number of days or hours actually worked ....\" ECF No. 48-1 at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Utilization Review Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A utilization review can occur before, during, or after the requested medical service is administered. Requests for utilization reviews can be made externally by a claimant-employee's provider-physician or internally by, for example, a claims adjuster. Authorization requests are assigned on a round-robin basis using LMMC's electronic Medical Necessity Review (MNR) system. Each UMN has a queue of reviews that they are responsible for completing. Upon assignment of an authorization request, a UMN will review the request to gain an understanding of the treatment requested. Next, the UMN will look to a guideline for the type of treatment requested. Each state in which utilization reviews are conducted designates a specific hierarchy of medical necessity guidelines to be used for utilization reviews in that state. A frequently used set of guidelines is the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG). In the absence of state-specified guidelines, LMMC requires UMNs to use the ODG. Once the UMN identifies the appropriate guideline, the UMN compares the treatment request to the appropriate guideline. The UMN consults the patient's medical records to identify the presence or absence\n   of various criteria identified in the guideline. In instances where a UMN is not able to certify a request due to missing documentation, the UMN may contact the medical provider to request the necessary documentation. After reviewing all relevant documents and the applicable guideline, the UMN then decides whether to certify (or approve) the request. UMNs may only certify requests that are medically necessary. If a UMN cannot certify a request, the UMN sends the request to a physician to undergo peer review. Whether certifying a request or sending it to peer review, UMNs must provide written rationale for their decision, including identification of the specific portions of the appropriate guideline(s) relied upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Accreditation Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) is a nonprofit organization that issues accreditations to companies that conduct utilization review services focusing on quality and confidentiality. URAC is one of the largest accreditation organizations for workers' compensation. Some states require that companies conducting utilization reviews be URAC-accredited. LMMC has been URAC-accredited since 1996, and it is re-accredited every three years. URAC requires that UMNs use written clinical review criteria, such as the medical necessity guidelines, when reviewing treatment requests and that non-certified requests be reviewed by a physician. LMMC establishes its policies and procedures related to the utilization management process to comply with URAC standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To achieve URAC compliance, LMMC conducts quality assurance audits of its UMNs' work product. Although URAC permits the use of Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) to perform utilization reviews, LMMC has elected to require RN licensure to perform this function. LMMC hires only RNs in the UMN position because RNs have additional education and experience compared to LPNs and because the RN-only practice helps to differentiate LMMC in the market. Rego and all of the representative plaintiffs are licensed RNs, and each has past experience working in clinical settings. At all times relevant to this suit, Plaintiffs worked as UMNs at LMMC; Devore and Trisvan eventually obtained senior status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

That Plaintiffs generally agree that LMMC's UMN job description, which utilizes words like \"clinical judgment\" and \"critical thinking,\" accurately describes their work does not carry the day in the discretion and independent judgment inquiry because Plaintiffs' actual work, rather than the employer's description of the work, is what is relevant here. For instance, although Jaster described \"review[ing] the tactic or procedure or medication that's been proposed to determine whether it fits within the guidelines\" as exercising \"judgment,\" the label Jaster assigned her work is irrelevant to the fact the work itself reflects inspector-type work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jaster Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 51:4-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   LMMC's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Roe-Midgett\n   </em>\n   to argue that Plaintiffs exercised discretion and independent judgment is similarly unpersuasive.

In cases where the treatment request did not match the guideline, Plaintiffs could not \"negotiate\" like claims adjusters.

Indeed, Plaintiffs repeatedly testified in their depositions that their nursing backgrounds, while helpful for understanding terminology in medical records, was not required to perform utilization reviews given the specificity of the guidelines they were required to follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rego Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 48:24-51:2; Devore Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 16:9-10; Trisvan Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 85:24-86:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   LMMC insists that Plaintiffs' work involved using advanced knowledge because they employed \"nursing rationale\" when conducting utilization reviews.

That is the-one of the key things in utilization review is staying objective, looking to the guidelines and staying objective to the review.

To the extent Devore admitted to using \"nursing judgment\" as a UMN, it is unclear what she understood such judgment to mean in light of her testimony that nursing judgment is ingrained in her, that she uses nursing judgment to some degree in everything she does, and that a nursing degree is likely not necessary to perform the UMN role.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:9-10, 38:9, 40:22-24. Indeed, to the extent Devore described utilization review in the abstract, she emphasized the need to remain objective, follow the guidelines, and avoid using nursing judgment. Other deposition testimony from Plaintiffs regarding their use of nursing rationale, clinical judgment, or critical thinking is similarly inconsistent. That Plaintiffs may use the words \"nursing rationale\" or \"clinical judgment\" when speaking about their work does not transform the nature of the work itself. To allow the use of such terminology to trigger an exemption without a close look at the job duties would undermine the purpose of the FLSA maximum hours provision.

Not only are the cases relied upon distinguishable, but also the testimony fails to demonstrate use of advanced knowledge. The testimony reflects a list of expectations about what a case file might show, but it does not \"demonstrate\" the use of advanced knowledge. To the extent the nurse lists patient symptoms typical in physical therapy cases, such information can be gathered from repeated encounters with physical therapy cases and does not imply use of advanced knowledge. It should also be noted that in\n   <em>\n    Crowe\n   </em>\n   the court ultimately denied summary judgment to the employer on the ground that a factual dispute existed as to whether the job of a UMN \"requires prolonged, specialized instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180650\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/136/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180650\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/136/16/\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the court determined that Plaintiffs' primary duty as UMNs was not the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge, this exemption is not satisfied. Even if the court found that Plaintiffs' work required advanced knowledge, such knowledge was not customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. \"The phrase 'customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction' restricts the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.301\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). \"The best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of the appropriate academic degree.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The learned professional exemption \"does not apply to occupations in which most employees have acquired their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While registered nurses generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption, licensed practical nurses and other similar health care employees do not. \u00a7 541.301(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   LMMC argues that Plaintiffs' advanced knowledge was customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction because \u00a7 541.301(e)(2) recognizes that registered nurses generally satisfy the exemption and because LMMC requires that all of its UMNs and all third-party UMNS performing LMMC utilization reviews have RN licenses. This requirement, LMMC contends, carries with it the expectation that LMMC UMNs will perform higher quality utilization reviews that rely on their RN backgrounds. Plaintiffs argue that although LMMC maintains an RN-only policy, LMMC cannot demonstrate that utilization review work itself requires RN-level knowledge. Plaintiffs assert that, in fact, utilization review work only requires LPN-level knowledge, meaning Plaintiffs cannot be said to have used advanced knowledge customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction under \u00a7 541.301(e)(2). The parties agree that courts should examine\n   the minimum requirements of the UMN job in assessing whether the specialized instruction prong is met, but they disagree on what requirements are relevant. LMMC insists that the employer's requirements are controlling, while Plaintiffs contend that the de facto requirements necessary to perform the job are controlling. LMMC thus insists that its RN-only policy carries the day, while Plaintiffs insist that this prong is not satisfied because LPNs can perform utilization reviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court agrees with Plaintiffs' interpretation.

The standard prerequisite for utilization review work, as judged from the accreditation requirements of URAC, which is one of the largest accreditation organizations for companies performing utilization reviews, is LPN-level credentials.

Similarly, Trisvan testified that she was paid the same salary no matter how many hours she worked each week and that LMMC had a no-overtime policy. Trisvan Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 29:11-31:11. York-Winkler testified that, aside from periodic bonuses based on yearly evaluations and LMMC's performance, the only compensation she was owed for her UMN work was her salary. York-Winkler Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 31:2-32:10. Devore testified that she understood that she was a salaried, exempt employee, although she did not expect to work ten to twelve hours a day. Devore Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 20:7-18. Jaster testified that she would receive the same fixed salary and that she also expected to receive merit and cost-of-living raises, additional \"comp time,\" and other \"awards\" that were sometimes monetary. Jaster Dep., ECF No. 48-1, at 11:6-12:24. This testimony sufficiently demonstrates that Plaintiffs understood their salaries to compensate them for all hours worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs' testimony about receiving compensation beyond their salaries (e.g. bonuses, raises, awards) and about their hours expectations does not create a triable issue of fact on the question of whether they understood their salaries to compensate them for all hours worked. Plaintiffs did not testify that any additional compensation they received was tied to overtime hours. Rather, regarding overtime, several of the plaintiffs acknowledged that they were exempt from overtime and that their salaries compensated them for all hours worked. That some of the plaintiffs expected to work fewer or a fixed number of hours is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Urnikis-Negro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049633\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/665/#p670\">\n    616 F.3d at 680-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the district court's finding that the employer and employee had a mutual understanding that the employee's salary compensated her for all hours worked where she expected to work but routinely worked more than forty hours per week);\n   <em>\n    Ransom v.
