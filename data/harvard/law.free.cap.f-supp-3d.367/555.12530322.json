However, the Committee cautions that these jurisdictional determinations should be made largely on the basis of readily available information. Allowing substantial, burdensome discovery on jurisdictional issues would be contrary to the intent of these provisions to encourage the exercise of federal jurisdiction over class actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   court interpreted the Committee's statement that jurisdictional discovery under CAFA is to be \"not unlike what is necessitated by the existing jurisdictional statutes\" to mean jurisdictional discovery is limited to the questions of citizenship and amount-in-controversy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This holding is consistent with the Third Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Kaufman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Opelousas General Hospital Authority v.

The Court holds it may consider only the allegations in Plaintiff's state court petition in determining whether the local controversy exception applies. As a result, the Court denies Plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff has shown the proposed plaintiff class seeks significant relief from Jefferson Parish.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"A proposed plaintiff class seeks 'significant relief' from a particular defendant when the relief sought from that defendant constitutes a significant portion of the entire relief sought by the class.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]hether a putative class seeks significant relief from an in-state defendant includes not only an assessment of how many members of the class were harmed by the defendant's actions, but also a comparison of the relief sought between all defendants and each defendant's ability to pay a potential judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"CAFA does not specifically provide a definition of 'significant,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the courts interpreting this provision have not set forth a numerical benchmark to use to determine whether relief is significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is rare that a court has found a defendant is not a significant defendant. In\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Severn Trent Envtl. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that \"[t]here are at least two factual situations where courts have found that a defendant is not a 'significant' defendant. The first is when only a small portion of the class members have claims against that particular defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second situation occurs in cases in which \"the relief sought (or reasonably expected) from a particular defendant is 'just small change' in comparison to what the class is seeking from the other co-defendants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged their tap water was contaminated and sought relief from Plaquemines Parish and from a foreign corporation administering the water system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   They alleged Plaquemines Parish had \"ultimate oversight and responsibility over the quality of the drinking water.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because all of the plaintiffs sought relief from Plaquemines Parish, the court found the case was not one in which only a small portion of the class members have claims against the local defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the plaintiffs alleged Plaquemines Parish had ultimate responsibility over the quality of the drinking water, the court found the class was seeking more than \"just small change\" from the local defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the court found the proposed class sought significant relief from Plaquemines Parish. Similarly, in this case, all class members have made claims against all defendants. This case is not one in which only a small portion of the class members have claims against the local defendant. Because the state court petition alleges Jefferson Parish owns the entire Landfill and hires contractors to operate different phases of the facility,\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   the class seeks more than just small change from Jefferson Parish. As a result, the proposed class seeks significant relief from Jefferson Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This conclusion is supported by the claims brought by the proposed class. Plaintiff defines the proposed class as citizens of Jefferson Parish who \"sustained legally cognizable damages in the form of nuisance, interference with the enjoyment of their properties and/or diminution in value of their properties\" as a result of the emissions from the Landfill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   The proposed class brings a claim for nuisance and interference with enjoyment under article 667 of the Louisiana Civil Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Article 667 provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Although a proprietor may do with his estate whatever he pleases, still he cannot make any work on it, which may deprive his neighbor of the liberty of enjoying his own, or which may be the cause of any damage to him. However, if the work he makes on his estate deprives his neighbor of enjoyment or causes damage to him, he is answerable for damages only upon a showing that he knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that his works would cause damage, that the damage could have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care, and that he failed to exercise such reasonable care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Article 667, as one of the \"vicinage\" articles, \"establish[es] certain limitations on the scope and extent of the right of ownership in immovable (real) property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The article is \"an expression of the\n   <em>\n    sic utere\n   </em>\n   doctrine that limits the rights of proprietors in the use of their property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The\n   <em>\n    sic utere\n   </em>\n   doctrine is an embodiment of the maxim '\n   <em>\n    sic utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas\n   </em>\n   '-'use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article 667 imposes liability on the proprietor of an estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Yokum v. 615 Bourbon St., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs sought damages from a landowner, alleging they had been subjected to loud noises by a lessee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court held that \"a proprietor/landowner can be responsible for the works or actions on its property that may cause damage to neighboring proprietors....Merely because a proprietor/landowner utilizes his right as a property owner to lease his property to another does not eradicate his or her responsibilities and obligations\" as a landowner under article 667.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Lombard v. Sewerage &amp; Water Bd. of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court held the City of New Orleans and the Sewerage &amp; Water Board of New Orleans could be held liable for damages caused by a contractor under article 667.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court held there is \"no exculpatory principle, except sovereign immunity, which relieves public bodies or municipalities of the obligation to compensate those whose property it has damaged in carrying on public works.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Similar to the landlord in\n   <em>\n    Yokum\n   </em>\n   , Jefferson Parish cannot relieve itself of its obligations under article 667 by leasing its property to the other Defendants in this case. Similar to the City of New Orleans in\n   <em>\n    Lombard\n   </em>\n   , Jefferson Parish's hiring contractors to operate the Landfill does not relieve it of its obligation as a proprietor and landlord to compensate the members of the proposed plaintiff class, whose property it has allegedly damaged. Jefferson Parish, as the alleged owner of the Landfill, may be found liable for nuisance under article 667.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court finds the class seeks significant relief from Jefferson Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff has not shown Jefferson Parish's conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To establish the local controversy exception applies, Plaintiff also must show a local defendant's \"alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This statutory provision \"relates the alleged conduct of the local defendant, on one hand, to all the claims asserted in the action, on the other....[I]t requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims asserted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plaintiff need not provide a \"definitive analysis of the measure of damages caused by each defendant,\" but must provide \"detailed allegations...[concerning] the local defendant's conduct in relation to the out-of-state defendants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   The allegations must show whether the local defendant \"played a significant role in the alleged [harm], as opposed to a lesser role, or even a minimal role.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Third Circuit has explained this requirement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In relating the local defendant's alleged conduct to all the claims asserted in the action, the significant basis provision effectively calls for comparing the local defendant's alleged conduct to the alleged conduct of all the Defendants. Indeed, all the claims asserted by the Plaintiffs reflect the alleged conduct of all the Defendants. If the local defendant's alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant's alleged conduct to the alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In this case, the allegations in the state court petition concerning the conduct of Jefferson Parish and the other defendants are sparse. The petition alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (1) the Landfill was \"owned by Defendant Jefferson Parish\" and \"operated pursuant to contracts issued by Defendant Jefferson Parish\" to Louisiana Regional Landfill Company, \"a wholly owned subsidiary of\" Waste Connections Bayou, Inc. and Waste Connections US, Inc.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (2) Louisiana Regional Landfill Company, under its former name IESI LA Landfill Corporation, operated and managed the Landfill from the date of the initial emission of noxious odors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (3) Louisiana Regional Landfill Company is the \"current operator and manager\" of the Landfill; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (4) Aptim manages the \"gas and/or leachate collection system(s)\" of the Landfill, and \"improperly covered solid waste is at least one 'point source' of the noxious odors and gases.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The petition does not otherwise differentiate between the conduct of Jefferson Parish and the conduct of the other Defendants. Because of this lack of allegations, Plaintiff has failed to establish that Jefferson Parish's conduct is significant in relation to the conduct of the non-local Defendants. In fact, the only\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   of Jefferson Parish mentioned in the petition is its alleged issuing of contracts to Waste Connections Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Opelousas\n   </em>\n   , a hospital brought a putative class action against three defendants for violations of the Louisiana Racketeering Act: a foreign bill review company, a foreign insurance company, and a local insurance company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit found the plaintiff had not alleged that the local defendant's conduct formed a significant basis of the claims asserted because\n   \"the complaint ma[de] no effort to quantify or even estimate the alleged illegal underpayments made by [the local insurance company] versus those made by\" the foreign insurance company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the state court petition in this case states merely that the Landfill was owned by Defendant Jefferson Parish and operated pursuant to contracts issued by Jefferson Parish, but does not sufficiently differentiate between its conduct and the conduct of the other Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In light of the narrow construction of the local controversy exception and the burden of proof on Plaintiff to show the exception applies, the Court finds Plaintiff has not met his burden of showing Jefferson Parish's alleged conduct forms a significant basis of the claims asserted. As a result, the local controversy exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The \"home-state exception\" does not apply because Plaintiff has not shown Defendant Jefferson Parish is the only primary defendant.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Under the home state exception, a district court must decline jurisdiction if \"two-thirds or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate, and the primary defendants, are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[T]he home state exception applies if all of the primary defendants are citizens\" of the state where the action was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In this case, Jefferson Parish is the only defendant that is a Louisiana citizen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Waste Connections Defendants and Aptim Corp. are not Louisiana citizens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state court petition brings claims against all Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff does not argue Waste Connections Defendants and Aptim Corp. are not primary Defendants.
