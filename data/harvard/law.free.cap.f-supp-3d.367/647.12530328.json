LUDINGTON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On June 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Nick Lyon, and Richard Snyder. Compl., ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs are Michigan children and their families who claim that Defendants are providing them with inadequate mental health care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 7, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims. ECF No. 17. Plaintiffs filed a response and Defendants filed a reply. ECF No. 20, 21. On October 29, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a sur-reply in opposition to Defendants' reply. ECF No. 22. On November 7, 2018, the motion was denied. ECF No. 23. The next day, Plaintiffs filed a motion for corrected judicial assignment from the Northern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan to the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan. ECF No. 24. For the following reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for corrected judicial assignment will be denied and Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs bring their claim as a class action on behalf of \"[a]ll current or future Michigan Medicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21 with a behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric disorder who are or may be eligible for, but are not receiving, home and community-based services.\" ECF No. 1 at 12. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' failure to provide adequate mental health care services in their homes and communities have required some Plaintiffs to enter institutions (such as psychiatric hospitals and juvenile delinquency facilities) while the other Plaintiffs are at risk of requiring institutionalization in the future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nationally, the Medicaid program is funded through joint contributions by federal and state governments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. If a state wishes to participate in the Medicaid program and receive federal funding, it must comply with certain requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. One of these requirements is that it provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment services (\"EPSDT\") for eligible individuals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The state of Michigan receives Medicaid funds to assist in its facilitation and provision of health services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant the Michigan Department of Health (the \"Department\") is responsible for facilitating the Medicaid program throughout Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To assist in this, the Department has contracted with ten Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (\"PIHPs\") and local County Medical Health Service Programs (\"CMHSP\") to provide health services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Plaintiffs contend that the PIHPs are not fulfilling Medicaid's requirements and as such, the Department should be held responsible. Plaintiffs raise six claims against Defendants for violating the following: the federal Medicaid\n   EPSDT Mandate, the federal Medicaid reasonable promptness requirement, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the due process provisions of the Medicaid Act, and due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The complaint lists seven plaintiffs: K.B. and M.B. from Roscommon County, P.S. from Muskegon County, G.P. from Iron County, D.P. from Isabella County, G.G. from Lapeer County, and J.W. from Ingham County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-10. Each of these Plaintiffs claim to have mental health needs that Defendants are not adequately addressing. Plaintiffs estimate that the class numbers more than 32,000 individuals with approximately half of the class residing in the counties located within the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan. ECF No. 25 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for judicial reassignment will be addressed followed by Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they filed their complaint seeking its assignment to the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan. ECF No. 25 at 4. When completing the Civil Cover Sheet, Plaintiffs selected Lapeer County as the \"County in which action arose\" because Lapeer is the county where Plaintiff G.G. resides, the fifth named Plaintiff in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiffs explain that they selected Lapeer County intentionally because it is within the Southern Division. The Southern Division has 20 assigned U.S. District Judges. The Northern Division has but one. When entering the names of the individual plaintiffs in the Civil Cover Sheet and on the complaint, Plaintiffs listed K.B. as the first plaintiff, who resides in Roscommon County which is located in the Northern Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' preference for the Southern Division is grounded on their assertion that they believe that over half of the putative class resides in the Southern Division. ECF No. 25 at 2. Plaintiffs also prefer the Southern Division because Plaintiffs' lead attorney, David Honigman, has a \"severe medical condition that can be exacerbated by travel to the Bay City courthouse, and even result in death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Plaintiffs contend that trying the case in the Southern Division rather than the Northern Division would be better for Mr. Honigman's health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After filing, Plaintiffs' complaint was initially assigned to the Southern Division. One day later, a \"Notice of Corrected Judicial Assignment Due to Clerical Error\" was entered by the Court's Clerk. ECF No. 8. The notice explained that according to Administrative Order No. 11-AO-016, Plaintiffs' complaint was being reassigned to the Northern Division because of an attorney's error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Administrative Order 11-AO-016 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It appearing that when a CM/ECF filing user erroneously identifies the county where the civil action arose, it can result in an improper assignment to a place of holding court, as well as a mistaken designation of the presiding judicial officer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It further appearing that pursuant to Local Rule 83.10(c), if a case is improperly assigned to a place of holding court, then the case shall be transferred to the proper location by order of the Court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   NOW THEREFORE IT IS ORDERED that if it reasonably appears an attorney through a clerical error has incorrectly identified the county where the civil action arose, then in the interests of the administrative efficiency of the Court, the Clerk is directed to correct such an improper judicial assignment by entering a Notice of Judicial Assignment. The\n   Notice shall include a notation that it is entered pursuant to this Administrative Order and that it was made necessary due to the filing attorney's clerical error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs contacted the Clerk's office and were told that the case was reassigned because the first named plaintiff resided in a county within the Northern Division. ECF No. 25 at 6. Plaintiffs now bring this motion to correct the judicial assignment of the case to the Southern Division of the Court to be randomly assigned to a judge of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Assignment of cases is governed by Local Rule 83.10(b) which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b) Civil cases shall be assigned by the Clerk to a place of holding court by reference to the counties in (a) in the following order of priority:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1) If an action is removed from State Court, the county in which the case was pending in State Court (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2) If an action is local in nature, the county in which the real estate is located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3) The county in which a plaintiff resides.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   4) The county in which the claim arose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   5) In a case in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his or her official capacity, or under color of legal authority, or an agency of the United States, the county in which an office of a defendant is located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   6) A county in which a defendant resides or has a place of business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   7) The place of holding court in which the case is filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   L.R. 83.10(b). The rule goes on to explain that \"[a] case improperly assigned to a place of holding court shall be transferred to the proper location by order of the Court.\" L.R. 83.10(c).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   also provides that a district court \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,...may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Local Rules 83.10(b)(1)-(2) do not apply to Plaintiffs' claim because this action was not removed from state court nor is it local in nature. The next factor in the order of 83.10(b)'s priority is \"[t]he county in which a plaintiff resides\" followed by the factor \"[t]he county in which the claim arose.\" L.R. 83.10(b)(3)-(4). The rule however, does not state that a case is assigned based on the county of residence of the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   plaintiff listed in the complaint. Rather, it provides that it is assigned based on the county of residence of \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). G.G. is a resident of Lapeer County. Thus, the complaint could have been assigned to the Southern Division where G.G. resides, the Northern Division where D.P., K.B., and M.B. reside, or the Western District of Michigan where P.S., J.W., and G.P. reside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ECF User Manual on the Eastern District of Michigan (the \"Manual\") does not specifically address how a case will be assigned when it involves multiple plaintiffs. It instructs the plaintiff to select the appropriate county according to Local Rule 83.10. However, the Manual misquotes the rule by stating \"[t]he county in which\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   plaintiff resides\" rather than stating \"[t]he county in which\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   plaintiff resides.\"\n   <em>\n    Electronic Case Filing User Manual\n   </em>\n   , U.S. District Court Eastern District of Michigan, 29 (2015) https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/pdffiles/ECF_user_manual.pdf (emphasis added); L.R. 8.10(b)(3) (emphasis added). When filing a complaint, the plaintiff is prompted to\n   \"Enter the county in which action arose\" and then \"Enter county in which the first listed plaintiff resides.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Electronic Case Filing User Manual, 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Civil Cover Sheet used to file a complaint instructs the plaintiff that the complaint will be assigned according to Local Rule 83.10. The sheet asks the plaintiff to identify the county of the first named plaintiff, but does not inquire about the county of any other plaintiff. Accordingly, the case is assigned to the county of the first listed plaintiff because Rule 83.10 provides that the county of a plaintiff is given priority over the county where the incident occurred. Plaintiffs contend that they were unaware of this nuance, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 83.10 (and the Civil Cover Sheet referencing Rule 83.10) provide that priority is given to the county of a plaintiff's residence and not the county where the incident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if Plaintiffs were responsible for the assignment of the case to the Northern Division under Rule 83.10 because of the way in which they completed the Civil Cover Sheet, they have not presented sufficient justification for the Court to reassign the case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) provides \"[u]pon motion...any action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature or any motion or hearing thereof, may be transferred, in the discretion of the court, from the division in which pending to any other division in the same district.\" The standards governing transfer pursuant to \u00a7 1404(b) are the same as those of \u00a7 1404(a), but are set to a less rigorous degree.\n   <em>\n    Braxton v.

These factors are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) the convenience of witnesses; (2) the location of relevant documents and relative ease of access to sources of proof; (3) the convenience of the parties; (4) the locus of the operative facts; (5) the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses; (6) the relative means of the parties; (7) the forum's familiarity with the governing law; (8) the weight accorded the plaintiff's choice of forum; and (9) trial efficiency and the interests of justice, based on the totality of the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Overland, Inc. v.

Mich.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs have provided no information as to the location of their intended witnesses, \"relevant documents,\" or \"sources of proof.\" There is no reason at this stage of the development of the case to conclude that transferring the case to the Southern Division will provide ready access to any of these. However, at such an early stage in the development of their case, it is not practical to expect Plaintiffs to know the location of this information. As such, it would be premature to come to a determination on these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, as represented by Plaintiffs, the locus of operative facts does not center in the Southern Division. By Plaintiffs' own admission, \"the events and omissions that are the subject matter of this aggregate litigation have occurred, and continue to occur, in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   Michigan county and therefore arise in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   Michigan county.\" ECF No. 25 at 2 (emphasis added). Furthermore, only one of the seven named Plaintiffs resides in the Southern Division. Accordingly, the Northern Division is just as suitable as the Southern Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that the case should be reassigned because their lead\n   attorney, Dave Honigman, has a \"severe medical condition that can be exacerbated by travel to the Bay City courthouse, and even result in death.\" ECF No. 25 at 11. Mr. Honigman however, is one of Plaintiffs' attorneys and not a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago, Rock Island and Pac. R.R. Co. v. Igoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"515899\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/220/299/#p304\">\n    220 F.2d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (7th Cir. 1955) (holding that the convenience of counsel is not a factor to be considered in a motion to transfer). And as Defendants note, Mr. Honigman is only one of seven attorneys representing Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have not presented any information that keeping the case in the Northern Division would inconvenience or endanger the wellbeing of any of the Plaintiffs or the other six attorneys representing the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants also note that Mr. Honigman has appeared in cases within the last two years in California, Tennessee, and New York. ECF No. 14. The distance from Mr. Honigman's office in Troy to these venues is much farther than the distance to Bay City, Michigan. Mr. Honigman contends that travelling for those cases was not as hazardous to his health because it was accomplished by airplane. ECF No. 28 at 6-7 (\"Although travel by airplane poses some risk to Mr. Honigman's health and can induce considerable pain, the pain and risks caused by airplane travel are much less than travel by car.\") The Bay City courthouse is however, close to an airport. The MBS International Airport is 15 miles from the courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for judicial reassignment will not be granted because the factors discussed above, at least at this stage of the case's development, do not weigh in favor of reassignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants have moved for dismissal of all six of Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

After examining the text and the structure of the statute, we do not believe \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10) require the State to provide medical services directly. The most reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 1396a(a)(8) is that all eligible individuals should have the opportunity to apply for medical assistance, i.e., financial assistance, and that such medical assistance, i.e., financial assistance, shall be provided to the individual with reasonable promptness. The most reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 1396a(a)(10) is that medical assistance, i.e., financial assistance, must be provided for at least the care and services listed in paragraphs (1) through (5), (17) and (21) of \u00a7 1396d(a).

Soon after Congress amended the definition, the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    John B. v.

The court addressed Congress's amendment to the definition of \"medical assistance\" when it explained that \"[t]he definition of 'medical assistance' has changed since we decided\n   <em>\n    Westside Mothers II\n   </em>\n   , but the new definition does not affect this holding because a state may still fulfill its Medicaid obligations by paying for services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n. 2. As referenced by the court, the current definition of \"medical services\" gives a state three different options: provide services directly, pay for services, or both provide and pay for services. As such, the 2010 amendment to the definition does not disturb the holding in\n   <em>\n    Westside Mothers\n   </em>\n   .

Failure alone to provide services is inadequate grounds to find a violation of \u00a7 1396a(10)(A). Both failure to provide services and a failure to finance services are necessary to find a violation of \u00a7 1396a(10)(A) since the definition of \"medical services\" permits a state to engage in either. Plaintiffs do not contend that Defendants have failed to provide financing for services.

Section 1396a(a)(8)'s language requiring that such assistance \"be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals,\" has been explained by the Sixth Circuit to require the State to determine eligibility and provide payment for services with reasonable promptness.

However, the fact that these rules exist does not alone mean that Defendants are complying with them. It is possible that Defendants are not complying with their due process obligations, despite having these Michigan rules in place. As such, this is not a valid basis for dismissal of Plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendants also argue that they are fulfilling their notice obligations because \"Plaintiffs need not wait to request administrative hearings until they receive formal notices of reductions or suspensions of benefits. They can also pursue this avenue of relief when their requests for assistance are not promptly acted on, or when an agency has not taken his or her choice of service into account.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20431.210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20431.210\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument sidesteps the issue by reasoning that regardless of whether Defendants provide adequate notice, Plaintiffs can receive a hearing. This does not address Plaintiffs' claim which alleges that Defendants are not providing adequate notice of individuals' rights to a hearing. Regardless of whether an individual is entitled to a hearing, the possibility remains that Defendants are not providing adequate notice of such a right. The requirement to furnish notice and the requirement to furnish a hearing are separate and distinct. They are related, but satisfying one does not automatically satisfy the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In their reply brief, Defendants attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility by arguing that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [B]efore reaching a full administrative hearing, there are review mechanisms through the CMHs, to the PIHPs, each of which requires appropriate notices. Each such notice can and should be addressed by the agency that issued it. Unless that action and notice is brought to the Department through the appropriate channels, Plaintiffs cannot show that the Department violated the U.S. Constitution or federal law by failing to review each such action or notice individually.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   ECF No. 21 at 6-7. This argument is akin to Defendants' arguments contending that their contracts with the PIHPs alone satisfied their obligations to arrange for services under the Medicaid Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   III.A.3. As discussed above, a contractual relationship with the PIHPs does not absolve Defendants of assuring or auditing to be sure that the requirements of the Medicaid Act are being met.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20431.210\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Defendants represent that they have delegated some of their notice and hearing responsibilities to the CMHs and PIHPs. Delegation of these responsibilities is permissible, but it does not excuse the Department from its obligation to provide notice and a hearing. If notice is not given or is defective due to the CMH or a PIHP, the Department is still responsible because the obligation to the individual recipient ultimately lies with the Department. Defendants have not demonstrated that the Medicaid Act or the Constitution remove the burden from them by virtue of delegating the responsibility to a CMH or a PIHP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs have sufficiently asserted a violation of the notice requirement under the Medicaid Act and the Constitution.
