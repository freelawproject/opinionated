Juror alleges that if these Missouri statutes are enforced it will violate her free speech rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney has moved to dismiss the complaint on numerous grounds. Because the complaint fails to state a claim I will grant the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Juror began serving as a grand juror for the Circuit Court of St. Louis County on May 7, 2014. That grand jury's term of service was originally set to expire on September 10, 2014. On August 9, 2014, while on duty as a police officer for the City of Ferguson, Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown. Robert McCulloch, the Prosecuting Attorney for St. Louis County at the time, presented the matter to the grand jury to decide whether there was probable cause to believe Officer Wilson violated any Missouri state criminal laws in the death of Mr. Brown. The St. Louis County Circuit Court extended the term of the grand jury from September 10, 2014 to January 7, 2015 to allow the grand jury to consider the Wilson matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Prosecuting Attorney's staff presented evidence regarding the case to the grand jury over a several week period. On November 24, 2014, upon completion of their investigation of the Wilson matter, the grand jury returned a \"no true bill\" declining to indict Officer Wilson. During his announcement of the grand jury's decision, McCulloch made public statements at a press conference about the jury's investigation and its decision not to issue an indictment. McCulloch also released evidence presented to the grand jury, including transcripts, reports, interviews, and forensic evidence. However, the transcripts and documents were redacted in a manner to keep secret the identities of the grand jurors, witnesses, and other persons connected to the investigation. In addition, McCulloch did not release the votes or deliberations of the grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Juror's complaint alleges that, from her perspective, the Prosecuting Attorney's presentation of the evidence in the Wilson matter to the grand jury was markedly different from \"hundreds of matters presented to the grand jury earlier in its term.\" Juror alleges that the \"State's counsel\" to the grand jury \"differed markedly and in significant ways from the State's counsel\" in hundreds of previous matters; the investigation had a stronger emphasis on the victim than in other cases; and, the \"presentation of the law to which the grand jurors were to apply the facts was made in a muddled and untimely manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Juror alleges that McCulloch's statements at the press conference \"characterizes the views of the grand jury collectively toward the evidence, witnesses, and the law, in a manner that does not comport with [Juror's] own opinions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Juror now wants to speak out about her experience as a grand juror and to express opinions about the evidence and the investigation in the Wilson matter in particular, and about other grand jury cases generally for the purpose of comparison. Juror wants to comment on whether McCulloch's release of records and statements at the press conference accurately reflected the grand jurors' views of the evidence and\n   witnesses in the Wilson matter. Juror also wants to express the view that the evidence and law were presented differently in the Wilson matter than Juror had experienced in other cases presented to the grand jury. Juror asserts that her motivation behind these proposed disclosures is to \"aid in educating the public about how grand juries function\" and to use Juror's \"own experiences to advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted in Missouri.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Juror alleges that four State of Missouri statutes have a \"chilling effect\" which imposes a limitation on her speech. The statutes cited by Juror are Missouri Revised Statutes sections 540.080, 540.120, 540.310, and 540.320. Juror seeks a declaratory judgment that \"Missouri laws criminalizing speech by [Juror], about [Juror's] experiences as a state grand juror for the investigation of the [Wilson matter], are unconstitutional as applied.\" Juror asserts that her free speech rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution override the oath of secrecy she took as a grand juror, and, as a result, void any Missouri state statute which would criminalize Juror's proposed speech regarding the grand jury's proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Prosecuting Attorney moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds, including the doctrine of abstention. I granted the motion to abstain to allow Juror to seek relief in state court on state law grounds to avoid the necessity of ruling her federal First Amendment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case was stayed until Juror resolved her state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Juror subsequently filed a lawsuit in the St. Louis County Circuit Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief which the circuit court denied.

Cir. Ct. December 13, 2016) ] Juror's state court petition alleged three counts. [Doc. # 89, Ex. A, Pl.'s Pet.] In Count I, she alleged a claim under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, the same cause of action she asserted in this Court. In Count II, Juror sought a declaration that \u00a7 540.320 R.S.Mo.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (a statute that bars grand jurors from revealing evidence presented to the grand jury or the name of any witness who appeared before them), was no longer applicable or valid as applied to Juror. In Count III, Juror sought a court order declaring that Juror is relieved from the oath she took, under \u00a7 540.080 R.S.Mo., to keep the grand jury proceedings secret. Juror expressly stated in the petition that she did not want the state court to rule her First Amendment claim and that she was reserving that claim in the event she returned to federal court. Juror reserved her First Amendment claim under an\n   <em>\n    England\n   </em>\n   reservation.\n   <em>\n    England v.

The circuit court ruled that a declaratory judgment forbidding the Prosecuting Attorney from enforcing \u00a7 540.080 (the oath of secrecy the grand jurors take)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \u00a7 540.310 (a statute providing that no grand juror be obliged or allowed to declare how grand jurors voted or what opinions were expressed by any grand juror about the issues before them)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   would be have no practical effect because the Prosecuting Attorney cannot bring criminal charges for a violation of those statutes. The circuit court concluded that any claim for relief under those statutes must be addressed to the St. Louis County Circuit Court which has the inherent power to punish for contempt and to try contempt-of-court cases. [Doc. # 8, Ex. A,\n   <em>\n    Grand Juror Doe v. McCulloch\n   </em>\n   , No. 15SL-CC01891 at 6.] Moreover, the circuit court found that Juror's desire to reveal her experiences as a grand juror, including how she voted or what she said or discussed during jury deliberations, did not fall within any exception to the long tradition of grand jury secrecy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Juror contended that the Prosecuting Attorney's disclosure of some grand jury information freed from her oath of secrecy. The circuit court found that the release of some grand jury information did not \"necessarily require the release of everything.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10] The circuit court stated that '[c]omplete transparency is an anathema to the very nature of a grand jury, which depends upon secrecy and anonymity for its proper functioning.\" [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720386\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/411/#p421\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ] The circuit court concluded that Juror was not entitled to a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 540.320 was no longer applicable or valid as applied to Juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because the basis of Juror's claims in her petition was the \"chilling effect\" on her speech imposed by Missouri law, the circuit\n   court addressed her claim as a violation of the free speech guarantee of Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Missouri Constitution. The circuit court also considered this claim in light of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because Article 1, \u00a7 8 has been found to be comparable to the First Amendment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11] In its free speech analysis, the circuit court stated that the grand jury system was \"deeply rooted in federal and state courts [ ] and that the First Amendment has never been found to permit grand jurors to disclose information learned in the course of their grand jury service.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12]. The circuit court noted that \"grand jury secrecy is intended to protect the public welfare.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10]. The circuit court found that Juror's grounds for relief did not fall under a statutory exception that allows the disclosure of grand jury materials when required by the public interest or in the protection of private rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720386\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/411/#p421\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ] As a result, the circuit court rejected Juror's claims for relief based on both the Missouri Constitution and on the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's decision. [Doc. # 89, Ex. B.\n   <em>\n    Grand Juror Doe v. McCulloch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655970\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/354/\">\n    542 S.W.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. Ct. App. 2017) ] The court of appeals held that any declaratory or injunctive relief preventing the Prosecuting Attorney from enforcing \u00a7\u00a7 540.080 and 540.310 should be denied because they would not have a conclusive effect. Despite an injunction against the Prosecuting Attorney regarding these statutes, the St. Louis County Circuit Court could enforce any violation of the statutes through contempt proceedings. In addition, the court of appeals found that Juror waived her right to preserve her First Amendment claim under\n   <em>\n    England\n   </em>\n   because her claim under Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Missouri Constitution Article by necessity encompassed her claim under the First Amendment. The court of appeals found that the circuit court properly analyzed Juror's grounds for relief and affirmed the dismissal of Juror's lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the conclusion of the state court litigation, Juror returned to this Court and sought to reopen her case for the resolution of her First Amendment claim. The Prosecuting Attorney argued that this case should not be reopened because the state courts appropriately reached the First Amendment issue and that their rulings should be given preclusive effect under the Full Faith and Credit Clause,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because nothing in the record in the present case indicated that Juror broadened the scope of her state law claims to include the First Amendment claim she reserved in this Court, I granted Juror's motion to reopen this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsequently, the Prosecuting Attorney filed an amended motion to dismiss. The Prosecuting Attorney moves to dismiss based on: (1) the preclusive effect of the state courts' proceedings; (2) lack of Juror's standing to sue for relief; (3) Juror's claim is not ripe; (4) sovereign immunity; and (5) failure to state a right under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Full Faith and Credit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I have already rejected the assertion that Juror's First Amendment claim is precluded in my ruling of Juror's motion to reopen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grand Juror\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. McCulloch\n   </em>\n   , 4:15 CV 6 RWS (Doc. # 67 filed April 16, 2018). Juror preserved her\n   <em>\n    England\n   </em>\n   motion and, as a result, the state courts' proceedings do not preclude her First Amendment claim in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Prosecuting Attorney argues that Juror does not have standing to assert her First Amendment claim. A plaintiff establishes Article III standing by showing\n   that: (1) she has suffered an injury in fact that is actual or imminent; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not the result of some independent action of a third party not before the court; and (3) it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560-561,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (internal quotations and citation omitted) Juror seeks a declaratory judgement that four Missouri statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 540.080, 540.120, 540.310, and 540.320 chill her right to free speech under the First Amendment. The Prosecuting Attorney asserts that any injuries stemming from three of these statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 540.080, 540.120, 540.310, cannot be redressed through the granting of an injunction. I agree. Section 540.120 does not apply to Juror, it only prevents witnesses who appeared before the grand jury from violating an oath of secrecy imposed by \u00a7 540.110. Neither \u00a7 540.080 (the grand juror oath of secrecy) nor \u00a7 540.310 (jurors not allowed to reveal how any member of grand jury voted on any question or opinions expressed on any question) provide for criminal penalties. As a result, they are not enforceable by the Prosecuting Attorney acting unilaterally. To the contrary, the authority to enforce these statutes lies with the St. Louis County Circuit Court through its powers of contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 89, Ex. B.\n   <em>\n    Grand Juror Doe v.

Any declaration or injunctive relief issued by the Court against the Prosecuting Attorney would not resolve the potential injury Juror faces from state court contempt proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simon v.

As a result, an injunction as to these three statutes is not a definitive and appropriate form of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Prosecuting Attorney also argues that Juror does not have standing to seek injunctive relief for her First Amendment claim challenging the enforcement of \u00a7 540.320 (the disclosure of evidence and witness names revealed during the grand jury proceeding). This statute does make its violation a class A misdemeanor which is enforced by Prosecuting Attorney. To establish standing \"a party need not expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights [but] he must show that his injury is more than imaginary or speculative.\n   <em>\n    Missouri Roundtable for Life v.

There is not any evidence before me that a grand juror has ever violated \u00a7 540.320, nevertheless not been prosecuted for such a violation. Juror's fear of prosecution is not speculative or imaginary, especially in light of the possibility of being held in contempt in addition to being subject to criminal prosecution. (This possibility is especially heightened by the fact that her lawsuit for injunctive relief in state court was dismissed.) As a result, Juror has standing to bring this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Ripeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Prosecuting Attorney asserts that Juror's claim under for injunctive relief is not ripe. In assessing ripeness, a court focuses on whether a case involves \"contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,\"\n   <em>\n    Missouri Roundtable for Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756040\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/665/#p672\">\n    676 F.3d at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation and citation omitted). The Prosecuting Attorney argues that Juror's claim is not ripe because she has not alleged that she\n   plans to disclose evidence or witnesses that have not been previously disclosed. However, \u00a7 540.320 does not state that Juror is free to confirm that any previously disclosed evidence or witness name is correct. Moreover, in her complaint Juror asserts that she would like to reveal her opinions about the evidence and the investigation of the Wilson matter. She also asserts that the she wants to express her opinion how the evidence in the Wilson matter was presented differently than in hundreds of other grand jury matters. Such opinions by necessity would imply that Juror would reveal evidence beyond that revealed by McCulloch as well as revealing evidence in hundreds of other grand jury proceedings. Juror has asserted sufficient facts in her complaint to establish that her claim is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Eleventh Amendment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Prosecuting Attorney asserts that Juror's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

There also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment.

However, the free speech rights at issue in this case are very different than those in\n   <em>\n    Butterworth\n   </em>\n   . In that case a grand jury was investigating alleged improprieties committed by county officials in Florida. A newspaper reporter had obtained information about the alleged improprieties while writing a series of newspaper articles. The reporter was called to testify before the grand jury. After the grand jury investigation was terminated, the reporter wanted to publish a news story and possibly a book about the subject matter of the investigation which would include his own testimony before the grand jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Florida statute barred\n   grand jury witnesses from disclosing their testimony before the grand jury (with certain exceptions not applicable to the case). A violation of the statute was a misdemeanor in the first degree. The reporter sought a declaratory judgment that the statute unconstitutionally abridged his speech and sought to enjoin the State from prosecuting him. The Supreme Court held that \"insofar as the Florida law prohibits a grand jury witness from disclosing\n   <em>\n    his own testimony after the term of the grand jury has ended\n   </em>\n   , it violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5507\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/624/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5507\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/624/#p631\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5507\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/624/#p631\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Juror wants to speak out about her experience as a grand juror. She wants to express her opinions about the evidence and the investigation in the Wilson matter in particular and about hundreds of other grand jury cases generally for the purpose of comparison. Juror seeks to comment on whether McCulloch's release of records and statements at the press conference accurately reflected the grand jurors' views of the evidence and witnesses in the Wilson matter. Juror also wants to express the view that the evidence and law were presented differently in the Wilson matter than Juror had experienced in other matters presented to the grand jury. Juror asserts that her motivation behind these proposed disclosures is to \"aid in educating the public about how grand juries function\" and to use Juror's \"own experiences to advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted in Missouri.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Allowing Juror to reveal the information she gained during her grand jury service would be undermine the proper functioning of the Missouri grand jury system which depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. If Juror is allowed to reveal the votes or opinions expressed by other grand jurors in the Wilson matter, her views may be subject to debate. Other grand jurors on the Wilson panel may disagree with Juror's representations. They would be forced into a dilemma between revealing their identity to publically challenge Juror's representations or to remain anonymous (as they were promised) and let Juror's unfounded representations go unchallenged. Juror's request is not limited to the Wilson matter. She may reveal the votes and opinions of her fellow grand jurors in hundreds of other matters in order to make a comparison to the Wilson matter. Juror also seeks to disclose the evidence, and how it was presented, in the Wilson matter in comparison to the other matters presented to the grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, Juror does not set any limit to her request. She would be free to reveal the names of the other grand jurors on her panel and the names of witnesses not only from Wilson matter but from hundreds of other grand jury matters. The revelation of witness names and the identity of the grand jury members may subject these citizens to the very dangers the tradition\n   of secrecy is in place to prevent. If the names of witnesses and grand jurors are allowed to be revealed after the grand jury's term is complete, many witnesses would be hesitant to testify candidly and jurors would be reluctant to deliberate openly for fear of retribution by the targets of the investigation or by the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Juror may also reveal the names of people who were not indicted which defeats a fundamental reason for the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. All of these concerns impose on the rights of those involved in grand jury proceedings and can be can be protected by maintaining the secrecy of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Grand jurors take an oath as members of the grand jury to keep grand jury proceedings secret\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   All grand jury members take an oath of secrecy regarding their service on a grand jury. That oath is found in section 540.080 R.S.Mo. which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Grand jurors may be sworn in the following form:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"Do you solemnly swear you will diligently inquire and true presentment make, according to your charge, of all offenses against the laws of the state committed or triable in this county of which you have or can obtain legal evidence; the counsel of your state, your fellows and your own, you shall truly keep secret? You further swear that you will present no one for any hatred, malice or ill will; neither will you leave unpresented any one for love, fear, favor or affection, or for any reward or the hope or promise thereof, but that you will present things truly as they come to your knowledge, to the best of your understanding, according to the laws of this state, so help you God.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A St. Louis County Circuit judge required the grand jurors in this case to take the oath twice - both at the beginning of their service and again when the grand jury's term was extended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Juror freely undertook this oath to keep the information she gained as a grand juror secret. By taking this oath she agreed to surrender her First Amendment right to reveal the details of her grand jury service. Juror can keep her oath and still pursue her goal to educate the public about how grand juries function and to advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted in Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The evidence presented to a grand jury, the witness names, the grand juror names, and the way a prosecutor presents her evidence are all types of information that are obtained as a result of a grand juror's participation in the proceedings of the grand jury. The balancing of Juror's desire to reveal this information and Missouri's interest in preserving the confidentiality of its grand jury proceedings weighs in favor of Missouri's interest. Missouri has a compelling governmental interest in keeping this information secret. The imposition of secrecy is narrowly tailored to serve Missouri's compelling interest in the confidentiality of its grand jury proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Prosecuting Attorney's motion to dismiss [79] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff Grand Juror Doe's motion for referral to mediation [91] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff Grand Juror Doe's motion to substitute Wesley J.
