Clarke's habeas petition articulates three claims: (1) he should not have been sentenced to a consecutive five-year sentence for his conviction for violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), (R &amp; R at 3); (2) the trial court violated petitioner's right to speedy trial, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); (3) petitioner did not receive the effective assistance of counsel, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Report found that petitioner's claims were time-barred, (R &amp; R at 10), and as a result Judge Henry B. Pitman did not address the merits of the claims. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In reviewing a Report and Recommendation, a district court \"may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). When timely objections have been made to the Report, \"[t]he district judge must determine\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   any part of the magistrate judge's disposition that has been properly objected to.\" Fed.

United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 08 CIV. 9313,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20924202\">\n    2011 WL 924202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y.

June 22, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Judge Pitman noted that petitioner had filed his habeas corpus petition over four months after the one-year limitations period had expired and further found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that he had been pursuing his rights diligently. (R &amp; R at 4-10). Additionally, the Report notes that petitioner failed to show the presence of \"extraordinary circumstances\" necessary to entitle petitioner to equitable tolling of the limitations period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Judge Pitman further noted that pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (1) (c) and Rule 72 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Petitioner had fourteen days from receipt of the Report to file written objections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, petitioner's objections were due by April 24, 2017. On May 30, 2017, thirty-six days after the limitations period expired, petitioner filed his written objections to the Report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 1). In light of the fact that petitioner's objections were filed over one month after the limitations period expired, his written objections are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if petitioner had timely filed his objections, his claims fail nonetheless. Petitioner raises three objections to the Report: (1) the Report does not address petitioner's claim that the government's invocation of the statute of limitations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is unconstitutional, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3); (2) The Magistrate Judge erred in finding that petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period with regard to his petition for habeas corpus, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); (3) The government and petitioner have come to a private agreement that the one year statute of limitation will not be imposed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his objections, Clarke objected generally to the Report's conclusions and merely restated claims that were raised in his earlier petition. Accordingly, Petitioner's objections only merit review for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Genao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20924202\">\n    2011 WL 924202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Constitutionality Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Clarke first objects to the R &amp; R on the grounds that the Magistrate Judge failed to address petitioner's claim that the government's invocation of AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations is unconstitutional. (Objections at 3). In the R &amp; R, Judge Pitman declined to address this argument, noting, \"In light of my conclusion that the petition is time-barred, I need not address whether petitioner's claims are procedurally barred, or the merits of the claims.\" (R &amp; R at 10). According to Clarke, \"The failure of the Magistrate to address the merits of such a constitutional claim warrants the R &amp; R to be rejected.\" (Objections at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, petitioner provides no legal precedent to support this conclusory contention. This Court is unaware of any case law supporting the notion that a Judge's failure to address an argument on the merits\n   warrants rejection of that opinion in the context of a time-barred claim. On the contrary, it is well accepted that, \"[where] a sufficient basis exists for dismissal of Plaintiffs' complaint on statute of limitations grounds, [the Court] need not address the merits of their claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Y July 21, 2011) (Noting that where a Magistrate Judge's R &amp; R barred a complaint on statute of limitations grounds, the R &amp; R does not address the merits of the complaint.); See\n   <em>\n    Can v.

Jan 21, 2011) (\"failure to bring [an] action within the statute of limitations provides a basis for dismissal of the complaint upon that ground alone.\"). As a result, the R &amp; R's failure to address the merits of petitioner's claims after concluding that they were time-barred does not constitute clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Equitable Tolling Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Clarke claims that the Magistrate Judge erred in finding that he is not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. (Objections at 3). In his objections, petitioner rehashes many of the arguments made in his original equitable tolling application. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Objections at 3-10\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Equitable Tolling Application, dated Feb. 24, 2010, dkt. no 1). As noted in the R &amp; R, equitable tolling of the AEDPA's limitation period is only warranted in \"rare and exceptional circumstances,\" and in order to be entitled to equitable tolling a petitioner must show (1) that he has pursued his rights diligently, and (2) that extraordinary circumstances prevented timely filing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053596\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/298/#p302\">\n    630 F.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302 (2d Cir. 2010) ) ). Judge Pitman found that petitioner failed to satisfy either of these two prongs, and petitioner's objections to the contrary are not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his objections, petitioner relies heavily on the facts in\n   <em>\n    Valverde v. Stinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236019\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/129/\">\n    224 F.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2000), and\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

LEXIS 94393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Pa. July 8, 2013), to claim that his loss of legal papers during prison transfers constituted \"extreme circumstances\" worthy of equitable tolling. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 4-5). However, petitioner's circumstances do not mirror the circumstances in either\n   <em>\n    Valverde\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Valverde\n   </em>\n   , unlike here, the defendant claimed that a corrections officer intentionally and wrongfully confiscated his legal materials. (See\n   <em>\n    Valverde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236019\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/129/\">\n    224 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   133-34 ). It was this alleged \"misconduct on the part of the Correction Officer\" that the court held would constitute \"extraordinary circumstances\" that warrant equitable tolling. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236019\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 135 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In Clarke's case, however, his legal papers were confiscated during routine transfers between prison facilities. Petitioner recognizes in his objections that his papers were confiscated during these transfers, and he makes no argument that any confiscation was intentionally obstructive or wrongful. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 5-6). This difference in circumstances is fatal to petitioner's claim that his circumstances are \"extraordinary\" so as to warrant equitable tolling. \"[C]ourts have routinely held the difficulties in filing a habeas petition created by transfers between prison facilities are not extraordinary circumstances for purposes of equitable tolling.\" (See R &amp; R at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , 03 Civ. 3532 (RMB) (GWG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203145786\">\n    2007 WL 3145786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 2007) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Clarke asserts that \"[t]he circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   greatly mirror that of [petitioner],\" though this is also unpersuasive. (Objections at 5). First,\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   is not binding on this court. Even assuming, for the sake\n   of argument, that the decision were binding, the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   differ from Clarke's circumstances in two critical respects. First, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   had his documents confiscated \"a mere nine days before the filing deadline.\" (See\n   <em>\n    Noble,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203392443\">\n    2013 WL 3392443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *16 ). The\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   court found the fact that the papers were confiscated so shortly before the deadline to weigh heavily in favor of finding that \"extraordinary circumstances\" existed. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203392443\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, Clarke had his materials confiscated four months before the limitations period tolled. Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   noted that deprivation of legal material is generally not sufficient to warrant tolling and that \"[t]his is particularly true when the deprivation occurs 'early in the limitations period when there is adequate time to correct the problem.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11) (citing\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313473\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/128/#p142\">\n    313 F.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142-43 (3rd Cir. 2002) ). Because Clarke had four months to submit his petition after his materials were confiscated, the circumstances preventing his timely filing do not match those in\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Furthermore, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   filed his petition \"as quickly as possible\" after his materials were returned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). In fact, petitioner specifically mentions that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   filed his petition \"[one] week after receiving his property.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 5). In this case, however, Clarke did not file his petition until four months after he received his legal materials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 2-3). Petitioner argues in his objections that he \"needed [the four month period] to not only draft the ineffective assistance of counsel claim but to also research and draft the attached equitable tolling claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 9). Clarke further claims that any attempt to file a petition during the time he did not have his legal materials would have inevitably been rejected. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 6-7). Petitioner's explanations are unavailing, as courts have regularly held that a failure to attempt to file a petition without legal materials demonstrates a lack of diligence.

(Objections at 10). Petitioner raises this argument for the first time in his objections. Due to the fact that \"new claims may not be raised properly at this late juncture,\" such claims should be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.

Apr. 22, 2002) (dismissing the petitioner's objection \"because it offers a new legal argument that was not presented in his original petition, nor in the accompanying Memorandum of Law\"). Even if petitioner had previously raised this argument, his claim must fail nonetheless. The document which petitioner refers to as containing the alleged agreement was prepared by petitioner himself. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections, \"Exhibit 2\" at 1). It is not an affidavit prepared by the government, and there is nothing in the document suggesting that the government or any representative of the government has agreed to the document's terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-9). Consequently, the document can be afforded no weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IV.
