One of those defendants was Albert, who later testified at trial for the government. Armando, along with codefendants Antonio Delgado (\"Antonio\"), Anthony D'Ambrosio (\"D'Ambrosio\"), and Keanu Martinez (\"Keanu\") chose to go to trial. A jury trial commenced on December 5, 2017. After jury selection but before the start of the government's case in chief, Keanu entered into a plea agreement and pled guilty to Count 3. Keanu, like his father Albert, also testified at trial for the government. Following Keanu's guilty plea, the trial proceeded against Armando, Antonio, and D'Ambrosio only.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      At the close of the government's case, all three defendants moved for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court granted D'Ambrosio's and Armando's Rule 29 motions in part, dismissing Count 3 of the superseding indictment against them with the government's consent. The court granted Antonio's Rule 29 motion in full, dismissing all charges against him because the evidence showed that he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged acts and conspiracies. The court permitted the remaining charges-Counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7-against D'Ambrosio and Armando to go to the jury. The jury convicted both D'Ambrosio and Armando on all six counts.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      Following his conviction, Armando timely renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal and moved separately for a new trial pursuant Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Armando contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his six convictions. In his Rule 33 motion, he argues that a new trial is warranted due to discovery violations and prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.

Nevertheless, in the context of a criminal prosecution where the government has the burden to prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, such bare-bones challenges must be answered by the government and considered by the court.

Count 1 of the superseding indictment charges Armando with trafficking a minor for prostitution \"knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact\" that the victim was underage, but it does not contain a citation to subsection (c) or invoke the \"reasonable opportunity to observe\" language. (Doc. 23 at 1-2). There is a paucity of evidence regarding Armando's involvement with any minor victim, let alone evidence that would tend to suggest that Armando knew or recklessly disregarded that victim's underage status. After combing through the nearly 2,000 pages of testimony and relevant exhibits, only the testimony of A.B. links Armando to transportation of a minor for prostitution. A.B. became involved with the prostitution organization in 2013 when she was 17 years old. (12/11/17 Trial Tr. 69:12). She testified that she knew Armando as a driver for the organization and that he had\n     driven her to several \"appointments\" in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 86:18-87:5).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      Unlike other codefendants, there is little in the record suggesting that Armando knew A.B. was a minor or recklessly disregarded that fact.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n      The only possible evidence implicating Armando's\n      <em>\n       mens rea\n      </em>\n      was the testimony of Francis Michael Simmons (\"Simmons\"), a prison informant who had spoken with Armando in prison after Armando's indictment and arrest. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      12/12/17 Trial Tr. 116:16-117:3). Simmons testified that Armando was \"concerned\" because two of the girls involved in the prostitution ring \"were juveniles\" and that Armando knew that two of the victims he worked with were underage. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 124:4-9, 125:6-22). It is possible that the jury inferred from Simmons' testimony that Armando knew A.B. was underage when he transported her for commercial sex acts. But it is equally possible that the jury convicted Armando on Count 1 because driving A.B. to several prostitution appointments could provide \"a reasonable opportunity to observe\" a minor victim. Because the government cannot show \"with certainty\" that the jury did not convict Armando based on the improper jury instruction, the conviction on Count 1 must be reversed.\n      <em>\n       McKee\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3168252\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/225/#p229\">\n       506 F.3d at 231-32\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (citations omitted).\n      <footnotemark>\n       4\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-35\">\n      <strong>\n       2.\n       <em>\n        Count 2 - Transportation of an Individual to Engage in Prostitution,\n        <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n         18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n        </extracted-citation>\n        (a)\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-36\">\n      Armando next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on Count 2, transportation of an individual to engage in prostitution.

The record is replete with evidence establishing that Armando transported or aided and abetted in the transportation of victims to Florida for prostitution purposes. For example, Jasmine Saunders testified that Armando worked for the prostitution organization as a \"body guard\" and would also \"ride with\" the girls. (12/8/17 Trial Tr. 15:21-16:12, 22:21-22). She recounted that Armando drove with her and several other girls to Florida for stripping and prostitution activities. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 16:13-19, 23:14-16, 27:24-28:2, 40:9-13, 41:21-23, 57:5-10, 60:16-19). Kelsey McMaster (\"McMaster\") testified that Armando went to Florida with her and several other women and while there drove McMaster to \"a couple calls,\"\n      <em>\n       i.e.\n      </em>\n      , appointments to engage in prostitution. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 77:5-19, 98:14-99:7). Simmons likewise testified that Armando claimed to have driven to Florida with Albert and several girls and that, while in Florida, some of the girls were \"having sex for money\" and drugs. (12/12/17 Trial Tr. 122:7-18). Armando also gave a handwritten document to Simmons while incarcerated indicating that Armando and Albert and \"four females\" had traveled to Florida, that Armando had driven some of the way,\n     and that Armando believed Count 2 of the superseding indictment was based on this trip. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 121:24-122:23; Gov't Ex. 31). A rational juror could easily conclude that Armando transported or aided and abetted in the transportation of a person across state lines with the intent that said person engage in prostitution. Armando's Rule 29 motion will be denied as to Count 2.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-38\">\n      <strong>\n       3.\n       <em>\n        Conspiracy Charges - Counts 4, 5, and 6\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      Armando was found guilty of participating in three separate conspiracies: conspiracy to transport an individual to engage in prostitution (Count 4), conspiracy to transport a minor to engage in prostitution (Count 5), and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute various controlled substances (Count 6).

But the government puts the cart before the\n     horse. A defendant must first be a\n      <em>\n       member\n      </em>\n      of a conspiracy before he can be held responsible for the actions or statements of coconspirators.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       United States v.

The question is not whether Armando is guilty of the acts of codefendants, but whether there was sufficient evidence to prove Count 4's conspiracy elements. The government again fails to identify any evidence to support the jury's verdict, forcing us to scour the record to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have convicted Armando of conspiracy to transport an individual to engage in prostitution.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-44\">\n      We find that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support Count 4. In particular, as described above, several victims testified that Armando traveled with Albert and approximately four women from Pennsylvania to Florida to have the women engage in stripping and prostitution while there. A trip of this sort, which, according to Jasmine Saunders, involved two vehicles, would likely require planning and coordination between Armando and Albert. Simmons also testified that Armando claimed to have traveled to West Virginia with Albert to recruit girls with drug addictions for prostitution. (12/12/17 Trial Tr. 123:12-17). This testimony further demonstrates an agreement between Albert and Armando and intent regarding the prostitution objective of the conspiracy.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-45\">\n      Finally, McMaster testified that Armando drove her to prostitution appointments while in Florida, confirming Armando's intent to achieve the out-of-state prostitution objective. Sufficient record evidence thus supports the existence of an agreement to transport an individual in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution, Armando's membership in that agreement, and Armando's knowledge of and intent to achieve the conspiracy's common objective. Moreover, the conspirators committed multiple overt acts, not the least of which include driving to Florida and driving McMaster to prostitution appointments while there. Hence, we will deny Armando's Rule 29 motion as to Count 4.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-46\">\n      <strong>\n       b.\n       <em>\n        Count 5 - Conspiracy to Transport a Minor to Engage in Prostitution in Violation of Section 2423(a),\n        <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n         18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n        </extracted-citation>\n        (e)\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-47\">\n      Count 5 charges Armando with conspiracy under\n      <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n       18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (e) to transport a minor to engage in prostitution in violation of Section 2423(a). Notably, after the close of the government's case, the court granted Armando's Rule 29 challenge to Count 3-the underlying substantive offense-due to insufficient evidence. (12/15/17 Trial Tr. 4:9-17). Armando contends that the related conspiracy conviction cannot stand because no evidence establishes his membership or participation in any alleged agreement regarding the transportation of minors across state lines for prostitution. We are constrained to agree.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-48\">\n      The government points to no case law and almost no evidence to support the conviction on Count 5. The entirety of the United States' argument is that \"[t]he record is replete with examples of minors being trafficked out of state on behalf of this organization, such as Keanu Martinez taking [minor] victim D.R. into Maryland and West Virginia for ... prostitution. Keanu Martinez even confirmed Armando Delgado's responsibilities were to 'hold the money and drive, security.' \" (Doc. 559 at 17 (citation omitted) ).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-49\">\n      We agree that there is substantial evidence establishing an agreement between at least two conspirators to transport minors across state lines for prostitution. Keanu testified that he, Antonio, and an unindicted coconspirator worked together on multiple occasions to take minors to\n     Maryland for prostitution. (12/8/17 Trial Tr. 171:7-15, 174:5-15). Keanu pled guilty to this substantive offense. Minor victim D.R. likewise testified that she went to Maryland with Keanu and Antonio on several occasions for prostitution. (12/11/17 Trial Tr. 147:13-18). Minor victim A.B. affirmed that she and D.R. worked in agreement with Keanu and Antonio to travel to Maryland for prostitution purposes. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 82:2-13). This testimony sufficiently establishes the agreement element of the Section 2423(e) conspiracy charge. But the government has not identified, and we cannot find, any direct or circumstantial evidence that would suggest that Armando became a member of this particular unlawful agreement. Nor is there evidence suggesting that Armando had the requisite knowledge of this conspiracy or intent to achieve the common objective of trafficking minors across state lines for prostitution. Indeed, \"those having no knowledge of the conspiracy are not conspirators.\"\n      <em>\n       McKee\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3168252\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/225/#p229\">\n       506 F.3d at 241\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (quoting\n      <em>\n       United States v.

Nevertheless, the superseding indictment charges Armando with three\n      <em>\n       separate\n      </em>\n      conspiracies, each with a distinct objective. The objective of the conspiracy in Count 5 is to transport minors across state lines to engage in prostitution. Armando's membership in the broader prostitution ring does not\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      establish that he was a member of this specific conspiracy or that he had knowledge of the agreement and the intent to further its objectives. As the record is bereft of evidence to substantiate these required conspiracy elements, no rational trier of fact could have found Armando guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

(12/7/17 Trial Tr. 21:24-23:18). He explained that he often gave drugs directly to his female victims or to drivers who would in turn give them to the girls. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 22:9-15). Those drugs included oxycodone (Percocet ), cocaine, heroin, MDA, \"Molly,\" and marijuana. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 22:4, 21-23). He further attested that he gave drugs to both D'Ambrosio and Armando to \"supply the girls.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 23:4-8). Keanu, Albert's son, confirmed that the operation involved drugs, including oxycodone,\n     heroin, cocaine, \"Molly,\" and marijuana, which were often used as a form of payment. (12/8/17 Trial Tr. 178:17-21, 179:16-24). Victims RaeAnn Horne (\"Horne\") and Brooklyn Shearer both testified that they received drugs from Albert and D'Ambrosio, including oxycodone, cocaine, and marijuana. (12/8/17 Trial Tr. 111:17-112:20; 12/7/17 Trial Tr. 195:7-196:5). McMaster echoed this testimony, explaining that drugs were often a form of payment for prostitution activities. (12/8/17 Trial Tr. 67:10-14, 68:11-15, 74:15-23, 78:2-23, 79:1-5). According to Simmons, Armando was \"pretty adamant that he was selling marijuana.\" (12/12/17 Trial Tr. 121:17-18). Moreover, in the handwritten document Armando gave to Simmons, Armando wrote \"Dilverd [sic] controlled sub[stances]\" in the \"True\" column. (Gov't Ex. 31 at 1).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-54\">\n      This evidence clearly establishes a conspiracy under Section 846. It shows existence of an agreement between at least four conspirators to distribute various drugs to female victims, often as a form of payment for prostitution. The evidence also demonstrates Armando's membership and participation in that agreement, as well as his knowledge of the conspiracy and his intent to accomplish its specific objective-the distribution and possession with intent to distribute oxycodone, cocaine, and marijuana.

As Section III(A)(3)(c)\n      <em>\n       supra\n      </em>\n      demonstrates, considerable evidence establishes that Albert and D'Ambrosio, among others, distributed and possessed with intent to distribute oxycodone.

Accordingly, a rational juror could easily find that Armando-a member of these two conspiracies-was liable for the substantive offense of distribution of oxycodone by coconspirators Albert and D'Ambrosio.

The defendant must demonstrate some reasonable probability or likelihood of prejudice. In this regard Armando's claims fall short. Nowhere in his motion or briefing does he explain how any of the alleged discovery violations affected or reasonably could have affected the outcome of his trial.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-65\">\n      For example, Armando contends that investigators took notes during a mid-trial interview with Keanu, but that those notes were never disclosed to defense counsel. The notes, Armando maintains, would have shown that one of the prosecution's potential witnesses who had testified before the grand jury had lied concerning Armando's involvement with minors. Armando, however, does not address the fact that this particular witness did not testify at trial. Nor does he explain how the notes would have provided any more assistance than the already-possessed prison phone recordings in which Keanu outlined to his father what had been discussed during the mid-trial interview. In short, Armando does not establish how the allegedly withheld notes would have had any effect on the trial.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-66\">\n      Armando's claims regarding purported undisclosed agreements or benefits in exchange for testimony are likewise deficient. He contends, for example, that the extent of the deal Simmons received in\n     exchange for testifying-a probability of time served on multiple bank robbery convictions-was only disclosed by the government during trial. Simmons, however, was exhaustively cross-examined regarding his cooperation with the government and forthrightly admitted that he hoped to receive a direct benefit for testifying against Armando and Antonio. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      12/12/17 Trial Tr. 130:21-133:25, 138:3-140:10, 144:7-150:25, 167:18-17:9). Armando has in no way demonstrated a reasonable probability that a more complete or timely disclosure of Simmons' cooperation or expected benefits could have altered the trial's outcome. The same reasoning applies to Armando's other claims of discovery violations concerning benefits in exchange for testimony or undisclosed documents.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-67\">\n      Even assuming Armando's instant allegations are true and that the government's actions contravene\n      <em>\n       Brady\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Giglio\n      </em>\n      , or the Jencks Act, Armando has wholly failed to establish how any of these violations could possibly have caused prejudice that would necessitate a new trial. We will deny Armando's motion for new trial on this ground.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-68\">\n      <strong>\n       2.\n       <em>\n        Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct During Trial\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-69\">\n      Armando's alternate basis for a new trial is that the prosecution made improper and inflammatory comments during summation. A defendant claiming prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments must establish that the government's statements caused him \"substantial prejudice by so infecting the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\"\n      <em>\n       United States v.

The court must follow a two-step process, first determining whether the comments were improper and, if they were, applying a harmless error analysis that asks whether it is \"highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185068\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/278/#p296\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      (quoting\n      <em>\n       United States v.

A \"high probability\" is one that permits the court to possess a \"sure conviction\" that the error did not unfairly prejudice the defendant.\n      <em>\n       United States v. Zehrbach\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413670,6117654\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1252/\">\n       47 F.3d 1252\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1265 (3d Cir. 1995) (\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      ).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-70\">\n      Armando argues that the prosecutor materially misquoted the testimony of Horne, making it appear that Horne unambiguously testified that Armando drove her to Maryland for prostitution. Horne's testimony, however, was more equivocal, as she stated that she \"might have went to Maryland\" with Armando. (12/8/17 Trial Tr. 117:5-7). According to Armando, this misrepresentation likely misled the jury and resulted in an unfair conviction.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-71\">\n      This claim presumably relates to Armando's conviction on Count 2, transportation of an individual in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution in violation of\n      <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n       18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a). We agree with Armando that such misstatement of the evidence by the government is improper, as it injects a quantum of certainty into otherwise ambivalent testimony. We note, however, that after Armando objected to the government's mischaracterization of the testimony, the court provided a curative instruction by admonishing that \"[t]he evidence is for the jury to decide who is properly recalling the facts. It is actually the jury's recollection that controls.\" (12/15/17 Trial Tr. 122:18-21). Even more detrimental to Armando's argument is that there is extensive record evidence regarding his trip to Florida for prostitution purposes.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       supra\n      </em>\n      Section III(A)(2). Armando cannot establish prejudice because, regardless of the government's misrepresentation of Horne's testimony about Maryland, there was considerable evidence\n     regarding the Florida trip. Under these circumstances, we possess a \"sure conviction\" that the prosecutor's error did not contribute to the judgment or violate Armando's due process rights.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Zehrbach\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413670,6117654\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1252/\">\n       47 F.3d at 1265\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-72\">\n      Armando next claims the prosecutor made an improper emotional appeal to the jury during rebuttal. He contends that Assistant United States Attorney Meredith Taylor (\"AUSA Taylor\") \"began crying\" while discussing the impact the charged offenses had on the prostitution victims, including victims who had not testified. (Doc. 480 at 12). AUSA Taylor emphatically denies any emotional outburst occurred.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-73\">\n      Armando's contention is without merit. To be sure, the court did not witness AUSA Taylor \"crying\" or becoming overly emotional during her rebuttal. We further observe that neither defendant objected or sought a sidebar conference to raise this purported issue. Armando cannot prevail on his motion for a new trial by merely alleging an unfair emotional appeal by the government without objecting at trial or proffering any corroborating evidence. We will therefore deny the Rule 33 motion as it relates to this alternative basis for relief.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-74\">\n      <strong>\n       IV.\n       <em>\n        Conclusion\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-75\">\n      We will grant in part and deny in part Armando's motion (Doc. 481) for judgment of acquittal and deny his motion (Doc. 479) for a new trial. We will vacate the conviction on Count 1 due to constructive amendment of the superseding indictment and enter judgment of acquittal as to Count 5 due to insufficient evidence. The government may retry Armando on Count 1 of the superseding indictment only. We will deny in its entirety Armando's motion for a new trial.
