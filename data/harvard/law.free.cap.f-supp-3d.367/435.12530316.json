On June 1, 2018, the court denied the motion [D.E. 4]. On July 3, 2018, Lassiter filed a complaint against North Carolina Community Health Center Association (\"NCCHCA\" or \"defendant\"), seeking relief under Title VII of\n   the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 5]. On August 29, 2018, NCCHCA moved to dismiss Lassiter's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [D.E. 15] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 16]. On December 14, 2018, Lassiter responded in opposition [D.E. 22]. As explained below, the court grants NCCHCA's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 22, 2002, Lassiter joined NCCHCA as the Finance Director.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2. Lassiter is an African-American woman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   During 2012, Lassiter began to suspect that Ben Money (\"Money\"), the President and Chief Executive Officer of NCCHCA, \"preferred to work with [people of] races other than his own.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1. Money is also African-American.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Lassiter developed this impression from comments made by Money. For example, Money stated that another African-American employee \"seemed more comfortable with her [w]hite counterparts,\" and Lassiter inferred that Money felt the same way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Money said that Lassiter, as an African-American, had to \"go above and beyond\" in her job performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2005, Lassiter's position was renamed \"Director of Finance and Human Resources.\" Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2. In 2016, NCCHCA created a new position, Vice President (\"VP\") of Operations and Development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Lassiter alleges that she \"was already doing over half [of] the tasks associated with [the new position].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Money informed Lassiter that she needed to apply for the VP position, even though Lassiter alleges that NCCHCA promoted a white male employee to a new VP position directly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In response, Lassiter asked Money if NCCHCA required her to apply for the new VP position because of her race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1. Money \"uncomfortably\" answered no. Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   NCCHCA initially offered the VP position to an unnamed white woman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1. When the woman did not accept the position, NCCHCA hired an African-American woman named Crystal Shanks (\"Shanks\") for the VP position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Lassiter asked Money why she was not chosen for the VP position, and he responded that NCCHCA decided to bring in a \"fresh face.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2. Money's response shocked Lassiter in part because the VP position required an applicant to have an MBA and Shanks did not have one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1; Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shanks is an African-American woman, but she has a lighter skin color than Lassiter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1. Soon after NCCHCA hired Shanks, Lassiter and Shanks had difficulty working together. On May 4, 2017, Shanks made several comments during lunch that made Lassiter uncomfortable, including that Shanks thought her white husband was a \"blessing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2. On May 5, 2017, Shanks yelled at Lassiter in Lassiter's office after a team meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1; Ex. A [D.E. 16-1] 2. On May 8, 2017, Lassiter reported these conflicts to Money, specifically noting that her conversations with Shanks concerning the race of Shanks's husband had made her uncomfortable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [D.E. 5-1] 1. Thereafter, during a meeting with a human resources representative and Money, Shanks apologized to Lassiter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   On June 12, 2017, Lassiter filed a written complaint with Money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 [D.E. 16-1] 3. On June 13, 2017, NCCHCA terminated Lassiter's employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3; Compl. [D.E. 5] 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about December 9, 2017, Lassiter filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), alleging\n   Title VII violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 [D.E. 16-1]. Specifically, Lassiter alleged that NCCHCA failed to promote her to the new VP position and terminated her employment due to her skin color and terminated her employment in retaliation for protected activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   On March 2, 2018, Lassiter received a Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.
