Ariz. Feb. 27, 2008) (same). ONHIR denied Ms. Kirk relocation benefits in December 2011. (AR 378). Ms. Kirk's Complaint alleges two counts: (1) ONHIR's final decision denying eligibility was \"unsupported by evidence or arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]\" (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A), (E) ); and (2) ONHIR breached its \"fiduciary obligation\" to her by failing to inform her of relocation benefits and delaying its decision. (Doc. 1, \"Complaint\"). She brings both claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 706. (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 45). In the Motion, ONHIR argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over Ms. Kirk's second count because she did not raise it in the administrative proceeding and, therefore, there is no \"final agency action\" to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant facts from the AR and the pleadings are as follows. Ms. Kirk was born July 6, 1969. (AR 337). She is a member of the Navajo Nation who relocated from Hopi Partition Land (\"HPL\") to Navajo Partition Land (\"NPL\") on June 2, 1986. (Complaint \u00b6 15; AR 239, 337). She did not apply for relocation benefits prior to the July 7, 1986 deadline. (AR 23; Resp. at 2). She first contacted ONHIR for relocation benefits in February 1991, but she was turned away. (AR 7-12; Resp. at 2). In 2005, ONHIR contacted her to inform her that the Office would begin accepting late applicants. (AR 18). Ms. Kirk timely applied for Relocation benefits at that time, and ONHIR denied her application on December 19, 2005. (AR 36-40; AR 61-64). She then appealed on January 9, 2006. (AR 66-69; Complaint \u00b6 26). On appeal, ONHIR waived the time limits for holding hearings and taking final agency action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20700.13\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 700.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (AR 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Kirk's appeal was heard by the Independent Hearing Officer (\"IHO\") on June 17, 2011. (AR 238). The IHO denied her appeal in August 2011, concluding that Ms. Kirk was unable to prove she was a self-supporting head of household when she relocated to the NPL. (AR 336-343). She asked the IHO to reconsider his ruling, which he denied on September 23, 2011. (AR 372-73). The Executive Director of ONHIR issued a letter on December 9, 2011, affirming the denial of benefits. (AR 378). Included in the letter was that the Director determined the IHO recommended decision was correct and that the letter constituted final agency action in the matter. (AR. 378).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her Response, Ms. Kirk argues she was not required to exhaust administrative remedies in order to bring this claim, ONHIR cannot rule on its breach of trust, ONHIR is biased, and she raised fiduciary issue before the agency resulting in final agency action. In alleging she raised the issue, she points to the IHO's decision explaining there was no written evidence of her 1985 summer employment. (Resp. at 15; AR 342). She also says her request for reconsideration raised the delay claim but does not specifically cite to where in the request. (Resp. at 15). There is nothing in the IHO's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision addressing an alleged breach of obligation. (AR 336-343). The same goes for his Order denying her request for reconsideration. (AR. 372-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The institutional considerations are strong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   also provides guidance for what to consider when evaluating the individual interests: (1) whether resorting to an administrative prejudice may cause undue prejudice such as an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for administrative action; (2) whether the agency could grant effective relieve; and (3) whether the agency has shown to be biased or has otherwise predetermined the issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p145\">\n    503 U.S. at 146-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p145\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, while the Court is sympathetic to the delay for Ms. Kirk, there is not evidence that the delay in ONHIR proceedings is unreasonable. In the wake of\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   , ONHIR developed new policies and procedures that caused a delay in commencing proceedings. (AR 78-79). They also received \"almost 1300\" additional applicants around that same time. (AR 78-79). Additionally, Ms. Kirk's own delay of almost six years from final agency action to filing suit seems to indicate time is not of the essence for her. Second, Ms. Kirk is incorrect that ONHIR is not able to grant effective relief. As she states herself, ONHIR was \"created by Congress pursuant to the Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 93-531, ... to carry out the relocation of members of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes who resided on land partitioned to the other tribe and provide relocation assistance benefits for households required to relocate.\" Complaint \u00b6 16. There is no reason to believe that she cannot raise her breach of fiduciary duty claim in an administrative hearing, obtain a ruling, and file for judicial review under the APA, much like\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   did. Third, there is no direct evidence that ONHIR is biased or predetermined this issue. Ms. Kirk points to the IHO's low rate of overturning appeals as evidence of ONHIR's bias or predetermination of the issue. This Court, however, is in no position to second guess the IHO's decisions in cases not before it. Accordingly, the institutional considerations favoring exhaustion outweigh Ms. Kirk's individual interests in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Kirk failed to raise the fiduciary duty issue in her administrative proceeding. The general rule is that such a failure prevents judicial review of issues not raised in the administrative proceeding, and Ms. Kirk has not persuaded the Court that her circumstances are one of the exceptions to the rule. Therefore, the Court cannot review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, it is ordered\n   <strong>\n    GRANTING\n   </strong>\n   ONHIR's Motion to Dismiss Count II.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
