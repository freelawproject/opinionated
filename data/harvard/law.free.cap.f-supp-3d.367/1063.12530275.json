BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 27, 2006, Plaintiff Amelia Saldana and her now-deceased husband Jose G. Saldana obtained a home loan secured by a Deed of Trust (\"DOT\") from World Savings Bank, FSB (\"World Savings\") in the amount of $ 420,000.00 (\"Mortgage\"). Compl. \u00b6 12; Compl. Ex. B. The DOT was recorded against 1413 Spring St, Saint Helena, CA 94574-2037 (\"Subject Property\") in Napa County on May 11, 2006. Compl. Ex. B, at 1. The DOT identifies \"World Savings Bank, FSB, its successors and/or assignees\" as the lender and loan servicer, and conveys title and power of sale to Golden West Savings Association Service Co. as the trustee. Compl. \u00b6 7; Compl. Ex. B, at 2. Golden West Financial Corporation (\"Golden West\") was the parent company of both the lender and trustee. Compl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, on or before August 28, 2006, World Savings sold the Mortgage loan to the WORLD SAVINGS REMIC 24, MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES 24 TRUST (\"WSR 24 Trust\"), for which Defendant BNYM allegedly serves as trustee. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11. Plaintiffs aver this must have happened because Golden West's Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2006 purportedly \"confirmed that it securitized substantially all of its residential mortgage loans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (citing Compl. Ex. C). Plaintiffs point to the following language in the Form 10-Q as additional support: \"We often securitize our portfolio loans into mortgage-backed securities. We do this because [mortgage-backed securities] are a more valuable form of collateral for borrowings than whole loans. Securitization activity for the three and six months ending June 30, 2006 amounted to $ 4.0 billion and $ 8.6 billion, respectively, compared to $ 7.0 billion and $ 8.1 billion for the same periods in 2005.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Wachovia Bank acquired Golden West in mid-2008, and later that same year Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia Bank. Compl. \u00b6 8. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, a division of Wells Fargo assumed the role of loan servicer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 19, 2009, the couple \"recorded a Grant Deed granting the Subject Property to the Saldana Family Revocable Trust, with Mr. and Mrs. Saldana serving as joint trustees.\" Compl. \u00b6 1; Compl. Ex. A. The couple's son-Jose G. Saldana Jr.-is purportedly a beneficiary of the trust who resides in the Subject Property. Compl. \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2016, Ms. Saldana and her husband defaulted on the loan, after which Wells Fargo initiated a foreclosure process. Compl. \u00b6 32. Specifically, in April 2017, a Substitution of Trustee was recorded indicating NBS Default Services as the foreclosing trustee under the DOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   NBS recorded a Notice of Default against the Saldanas on May 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33; Compl. Ex. F. In August 2017, the loan's servicing rights were transferred to a new entity and Wells Fargo assigned all of its interest in the DOT to Defendant US Bank, as trustee for the Truman 2016 SC6 Title Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 17, 2018, Plaintiffs Amelia Saldana, as trustee of the Saldana Revocable Family Trust and Jose G. Saldana, Jr., as a trust beneficiary, brought this suit against Defendants Wells Fargo, BNYM, and US Bank, asserting numerous claims related to the Mortgage loan. Plaintiffs seek various damages and to gain an unfettered interest in the subject property, free of liens or encumbrances. The core of Plaintiffs' claims is that, due to the purported \"alienation of World Saving's [sic] beneficial interest under the Saldanas' deed of trust in 2006, when it sold the mortgage to the WSR 24 Trust, Defendant Wells Fargo did not succeed to World Savings' [sic] interest in the mortgage in 2008 as the loan was no longer among World Savings' [sic] assets.\" Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 8(a) requires that a complaint contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). \"Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendiondo v.

The Court thus\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff Jose G.

Loan Securitization Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs' suit is predicated on the factual allegation that because the original lender of the subject loan-World Savings-\"securitized\" the subject loan in 2006, the loan was no longer among World Savings's assets and thus any beneficial interest in the loan could not have passed to Wachovia, Wells Fargo, or US Bank. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-15, 47-51. As Plaintiffs put it, \"World Savings alienated all right, title, and interest in Mr. and Mrs. Saldanas' mortgage loan when it sold it to the WSR 24 Trust in 2006\" and, as a result, neither Wells Fargo nor US Bank have ever \"held a beneficial interest in the Saldanas' loan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 13, 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Loan Securitization Theory's Viability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wells Fargo argues that Plaintiffs' loan securitization theory is not cognizable to support Plaintiffs' claims because \"the power of sale pursuant to the deed of trust is not lost if transferred, sold or assigned to a securities trust, and the beneficiary and its agents continue to retain the rights to initiate a foreclosure upon the borrower's default.\" WF Reply at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kalnoki v.

App. 2017) ); WF Mot. at 6-9. But Wells Fargo mischaracterizes Plaintiffs' theory. Plaintiffs nowhere dispute that a party that securitizes a loan but also retains the requisite beneficial interest loses the power of sale and may not initiate a foreclosure. Plaintiffs instead contend that a party who sells \"all title to, and interest in\" a loan thereafter lacks any beneficial interest in the loan whatsoever and thus has no right to act under the loan, including by initiating non-judicial foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , WF Opp. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiffs' theory viable. Borrowers have standing to challenge a party's ability to foreclose by alleging a void assignment to the foreclosing party, provided the borrowers allege a \"specific factual basis\" for challenging the foreclosing authority.\n   <em>\n    Lundy v. Selene Fin., LP\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-05676-JST,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201059423\">\n    2016 WL 1059423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-13 (N.D.

And in at least one case, a court has found that a borrower provided a sufficiently specific factual basis that defendants lacked authority to initiate a foreclosure by alleging that \"the assignment underlying the foreclosure was void because ... the original assignee of the deed of trust[ ] had transferred it to another entity before its assets were subsequently acquired by\" the foreclosing entity.\n   <em>\n    Lundy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201059423\">\n    2016 WL 1059423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13. But there, the borrower substantiated that factual allegation with a specific basis from which one could fairly deduce that the borrower's loan was previously transferred to another entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Complaint \u00b6 11, Ex.

Application to Saldanas' Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Wells Fargo contends that Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts to support their loan securitization theory because Plaintiffs only allege that World Savings \"may\" have securitized the subject loan based on their general practice of securitizing loans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WF Mot. at 9. Wells Fargo again mischaracterizes the complaint, which states that World Savings in fact securitized the loan, not that it \"may\" have securitized the subject loan. Compl. \u00b6 11. But while the complaint affirmatively states that World Savings gave up any beneficial interest in the subject loan by selling it to the WSR 24 Trust, it also explains that Plaintiffs deduce this fact from information contained in World Savings's parent's Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2006. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Turning to that Form 10-Q-attached as an exhibit to the complaint-Plaintiffs rely on two excerpts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Plaintiffs claim that Table 3 of the Form 10-Q \"confirm[s]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   that World Savings securitized substantially all of its residential mortgage loans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201059423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (citing Compl. Ex. C). That is not what Table 3 shows. Table 3 shows that securitized loans made up roughly 37% of the total loans receivable. Compl. Ex. C at 22 (showing $ 45,661,886 in \"Securitized loans\" and $ 122,192,978 in \"Total loans receivable\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs point to the following language in the Form 10-Q: \"We often securitize our portfolio loans into mortgage-backed securities. We do this because [mortgage-backed securities] are a more valuable form of collateral for borrowings than whole loans. Securitization activity for the three and six months ending June 30, 2006 amounted to $ 4.0 billion and $ 8.6 billion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201059423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this language says nothing, and suggests nothing, about how World Savings or its parent managed the only loan at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court is also concerned that Plaintiffs' counsel appears to have outright misrepresented the language of this portion of the Form 10-Q in the complaint and its briefs. The excerpt, in full, reads: \"We often securitize our portfolio loans into mortgage-backed securities.\n   <em>\n    Because we have retained all of the beneficial interests in these [mortgage-backed securities] securitizations to date, GAAP requires that securitizations formed after March 31, 2001 be classified as securitized loans and included in our loans receivable.\n   </em>\n   We do this because [mortgage-backed securities] are a more valuable form of collateral for borrowings than whole loans.

Ex. C, at 26 (emphasis added). Counsel twice omitted the underlined sentence without so much as an ellipsis. Compl. \u00b6 11; WF Opp. at 4. This omission is particularly troubling because the omitted sentence, on its face, appears to contradict Plaintiffs' entire factual basis for their loan securitization theory.

That is precisely what the Court is faced with here.
