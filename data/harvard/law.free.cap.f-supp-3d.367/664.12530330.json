Requests for Pretrial Hearing and Additional Information Pertaining to Rap Lyrics and Videos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the event the Court considers admitting the rap videos over his First Amendment and Rule 403 objections, Johnson requests that it conduct a pretrial hearing \"to determine whether an extra-judicial statement by one alleged co-conspirator could be used in evidence against another alleged co-conspirator.\" Def. Br. at 17. Johnson refers to this pretrial hearing as a \"James\" hearing, as derived from the case\n   <em>\n    United States v. James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823230\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/575/\">\n    590 F.2d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1979).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. at 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its response, the Government contends in a cursory manner that the rap songs are admissible as admissions of a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A), statements the party manifested that it adopted or belief to be true under Rule 801(d)(2)(B), or statements made by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). Gov't Br. at 14. However, the Government did not squarely address Johnson's request for a pretrial hearing to determine whether hearsay statements in the rap lyrics and videos would be admissible as co-conspirator statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding Johnson's request for a pretrial hearing, the Court first notes that, in the Fifth Circuit, a\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing is one potential method for a district court to address whether co-conspirator statements are admissible under the hearsay exception in Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9484153\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/561/#p576\">\n    264 F.3d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823230\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/575/\">\n    590 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   581 ). In the Sixth Circuit, a similar pretrial hearing is referred to as an\n   <em>\n    Enright\n   </em>\n   hearing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Enright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874574\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/579/980/\">\n    579 F.2d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1978), and it was the subject of both Johnson's and Defendant Carlo Wilson's motions regarding the admissibility of co-conspirator statements (Dkts. 371, 561, respectively). In a separate opinion on those motions, the Court held that the necessity of an\n   <em>\n    Enright\n   </em>\n   hearing will depend on the Government's written proffer of any Rule 801(d)(2)(E) evidence it intends to offer at trial, which is due sixty days before trial, as well as any response by Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mills\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cr-20460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%2077032\">\n    2019 WL 77032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 2, 2019). Because Johnson's concern with the hearsay aspects of the videos will be addressed by the process previously ordered, the Court denies this portion of Johnson's motion without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition to an\n   <em>\n    Enright\n   </em>\n   hearing, Johnson also requests a court order directing the Government to provide the following information, presumably for foundation and authentication purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [W]ho appears in each video; who speaks; what was said; who wrote the lyrics; when was each video produced; who produced it; was it edited; and if so, by whom and when; who will testify for foundation regarding the content of the video and is the testimony based on personal knowledge, did the speaker intend to make factual assertions under FRE 801 ; were the statements in furtherance of the conspiracy; and what is the government evidentiary theory of admissibility as to each video?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Def. Br. at 17. Johnson believes that \"each question must be addressed with regard to each individual video,\" even if \"it is likely some of the answers are unknown.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%2077032\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Government did not squarely address Johnson's requests for additional information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Regarding Johnson's request for additional information about the rap lyrics and videos, the Court grants in part this portion of Johnson's motion. The Government shall file a brief on March 25, 2019, setting forth the proposed foundation to admit the\n   rap lyrics and videos at trial. Defendants may then file a response by April 8, 2019. At that point, the Court will be in a better position to revisit Johnson's request for additional information based on any genuine disputes concerning the foundation and authentication of the rap lyrics and videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court grants in part and denies in part Johnson's motion to preclude the Government from using the nine rap lyrics and videos during trial (Dkt. 367).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Defendants Edwin Mills, Carlo Wilson, Lomnil Jackson, and Donell Thompson have each filed a notice of joinder concurring in the relief sought in this motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Notices of Joinder (Dkt. 432, Mills; Dkt. 437, Wilson; Dkt. 481, Jackson; Dkt. 483, Thompson).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Because oral argument will not aid the Court's decisional process, Johnson's motion will be decided based on the parties' briefing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    E.D.

The court held that much of the inflammatory material in rap videos performed by the defendant, which included references to the Black mafia, Louis Farrakhan, John Dillinger, and statements relating to the killing of Jews, had no bearing whatsoever as to whether the defendant possessed a firearm on the date charged such that any probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201547006\">\n     2017 WL 1547006\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7-8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Of course, nothing in this opinion precludes Johnson or his co-defendants from arguing the weight of the rap lyrics and videos or the meaning ascribed to those lyrics during trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
