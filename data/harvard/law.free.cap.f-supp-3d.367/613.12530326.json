Having considered the matter fully, and being otherwise sufficiently advised, the undersigned will grant in part Defendants Ezee Trans and Garcia's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint [DE 5], insofar as it pertains to Val's negligence, vicarious liability, and negligent entrustment claims, deny in part Defendants Ezee Trans and Garcia's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint [DE 5], insofar as it pertains to Val's Carmack Amendment claim against Defendant Ezee Trans, deny Val's Motion to Remand [DE 7], grant Val's Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint [DE 12], and grant Defendants Garcia and Progressive Northern Insurance Company's Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply to Plaintiff's Reply in Support of Motion to Remand [DE 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 1, 2017, Ezee Trans was hired to pick up a 2016 Mercedes Benz Sprinter Van at Specialty Gulf Coast Yard in Gulfport, Mississippi and transport the Sprinter Van to Val's in Lexington, Kentucky. [DE 1-6, at 3]. Ezee Trans loaded the Sprinter Van onto a flatbed commercial vehicle that was owned by Ezee Trans and driven by Mr. Garcia, an employee of Ezee Trans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On September 2, 2017, while nearing Val's, Mr. Garcia allegedly attempted to drive the flatbed commercial vehicle under a railroad bridge, but in doing so, the Sprinter Van atop the flatbed commercial vehicle collided with the railroad bridge, resulting in damage to the Sprinter Van.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about January 29, 2018, Val's brought this action in Fayette Circuit Court, alleging Mr. Garcia was negligent and Ezee Trans was vicariously liable for Mr. Garcia's actions and omissions and negligently entrusted Mr. Garcia with the flatbed commercial vehicle. [DE 1-1, at 4-5]. Also, Val's asserted a claim of punitive damages against all Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. On March 12, 2018, Val's moved for default judgment against Ezee Trans, and on or about May 24, 2018, the Fayette Circuit Court denied Val's Motion for Default Judgment. [DE 1-7]. On March 19, 2018, Ezee Trans moved to dismiss the state court action, arguing Val's claims against Ezee Trans were preempted by the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [DE 1-7, at 10-18]. On June 8, 2018, Val's amended its Original Complaint [DE 1-1] to add an Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act Violation claim against new Defendant Progressive Northern Insurance Company (\"Progressive\"). [DE 1-6]. All other claims in the Amended Complaint [DE 1-6] remain\n   the same as those found in the Original Complaint [DE 1-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 18, 2018, Defendants Garcia and Progressive removed this action from the Fayette Circuit Court to this Court based on federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction. [DE 1]. First, regarding federal question jurisdiction, Defendants Garcia and Progressive argue the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [This] action is a civil suit which may be removed to this Court by the Garcia and Progressive pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201337\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) in that the Plaintiff alleges a claim involving an Act of Congress regulating commerce, to wit: a claim in excess of $ 10,000 arising under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (\"ICCTA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Carmack Amendment\") ...

Additionally, Defendants Ezee Trans and Garcia allege Mr. Garcia cannot be liable because he is not a \"carrier\" under the Carmack Amendment. [DE 5-1, at 8-9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the filing of Defendants Ezee Trans and Garcia's Motion to Dismiss [DE 5], on July 3, 2018, Val's moved to remand this action to Fayette Circuit Court for several reasons. [DE 7]. First, Val's argues neither Mr. Garcia nor Progressive has a right to remove the case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201337\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because the only motor carrier that is a party to this case is Ezee Trans, and Ezee Trans \"missed its deadline to file a Notice of Removal under the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201337\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201337\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Val's argues Mr. Garcia and Progressive cannot remove their case to federal court based on a federal defense, such as the defenses that Mr. Garcia \"cannot be responsible under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\" and \"a bad faith claim [against Progressive] based on cargo damage isn't actionable by operation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, while admitting complete diversity exists between the Parties, Val's argues, \"[N]either Mr. Garcia nor Progressive can establish that the amount in controversy requirement can be satisfied for removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Positing Val's Reply 16] in Support of Motion to Remand [DE 16] \"sets forth a completely new argument as to why the Carmack Amendment does not completely preempt the claims asserted against Garcia, in that he may have been acting outside the scope of his employment for Defendant Ezee Trans, LLC ('Ezee Trans'),\" Defendants Progressive and Garcia move for leave to file a sur-reply to respond to the allegedly new argument. [DE 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to filing a Motion to Remand [DE 7], on July 18, 2018, Val's moved for leave to file a second amended complaint asserting a claim under the Carmack\n   Amendment. [DE 12]. Believing it has adequately pled a violation under the Carmack Amendment, Val's seeks to file a second amended complaint to specifically assert a claim under the Carmack Amendment only out of an abundance of caution.
