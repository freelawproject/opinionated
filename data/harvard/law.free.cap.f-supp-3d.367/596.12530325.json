In relevant part, \u00a7 107(a) of the Restoration Act provides that \"[a]ll gaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited on the reservation\n   and on lands of the tribe.\" After the Restoration Act was enacted, litigation regarding the Tribe's gaming activities and the Restoration Act's meaning began quickly and has continued for more than twenty-five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The current dispute involves bingo activities on the Tribe's reservation.

The State asserts that the Tribe's activities violate Texas law and the Restoration Act; therefore, the State seeks to enjoin the Tribe's operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Tribe, however, avers that its gaming operations are permissible forms of bingo.

Additionally, the Tribe asserts that Paxton has enforced Texas's gaming laws in a discriminatory manner. Specifically, the Tribe contends that Paxton \"has never brought suit against non-Indians\" to enforce gaming violations pursuant to the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code but \"has worked for years to stop bingo on the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo\" reservation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.

The Tribe has not alleged any Equal Protection claim that a nonsovereign entity could bring regarding the State's regulatory reach.

Yet, the Tribe has failed to put forward any evidence showing that the Bingo Enabling Act has a discriminatory purpose. Additionally, the Court notes that charitable organizations on tribal lands are permitted to apply for a license to conduct charitable bingo, just like a charitable organization in any other community is able to apply for a license to conduct bingo. In fact, the Pueblo volunteer fire department has obtained a bingo license from Texas. Mot. Ex. A (Hisa Dep. Tr. 49:2-3). Thus, it appears that the State did not leave tribes off the list in order to prevent tribal organizations from engaging in fundraising. To the contrary, tribal entities that meet the State's facially neutral criteria may conduct charitable bingo. Accordingly, the Tribe has not shown that Texas's laws regarding bingo discriminate against a suspect class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In addition to applying strict scrutiny when a statute discriminates against a suspect class, courts have found that statutes impinging on certain fundamental rights-e.g., interstate travel, parental rights, and marriage-may be subject to strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v.

Thus, it appears that the Texas legislature determined that religious groups, volunteer fire departments, nonprofit veterans' organizations, fraternal organizations, and nonprofit organizations supporting medical research or treatment are charities that provide important services in Texas communities.

However, the Court is not tasked with determining whether the State drafted the best, or most inclusive, list of organizations that support and provide services to communities.

Thus, the Tribe fails to identify a genuine issue of fact for trial, and the Court determines that summary judgment should be granted in the State's favor on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    A rational basis exists for the State's decision to have the Attorney General-rather than local prosecutors-file this action against the Tribe.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, the Tribe asserts that Paxton has violated the Tribe's constitutional rights because the Office of the Attorney General prosecutes the Pueblo's gaming violations, whereas local district attorneys' offices prosecute nontribal entities' gaming violations. Resp. 14. On the other hand, the State contends that the reason that the Attorney General bring suits against Indian tribes, is \"embedded in the structure of the Texas Constitution.\" Resp. 12. According to the State, gaming violations are typically prosecuted as criminal actions initiated by local county or district attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. However, pursuant to the Restoration Act, \"Texas has limited authority to halt violations of gaming laws on the Tribe's reservation, with this suit being the primary, if not sole, method of doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Considering the limitations imposed by the Restoration Act, it appears that the State's county and district attorneys could not pursue an action against the Tribe in the manner that they typically pursue actions against other entities-that is, via a state-court criminal action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restoration Act \u00a7 107(c) (providing that \"the courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any offense in violation of subsection (a) that is committed by the tribe, or by any member of the tribe, on the reservation or on lands of the tribe\"). It is unclear to the Court whether the State's local criminal prosecutors have the authority to file civil actions in federal court on behalf of the State. However, even if local attorneys do possess the authority to file suits on the State's behalf in federal court, the Restoration Act precludes the State from bringing this suit in the way that it typically pursues lawsuits regarding gaming violations. Specifically, Texas may not pursue a state-court criminal action regarding the Tribe's gaming operations. Thus, a rational basis exists for prosecuting actions against the Pueblo differently than actions against other entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Additionally, the Tribe contends that Paxton has determined that local officials should not initiate actions against Indian tribes because of a lack of political will from local leaders. Resp. 15. Thus, it appears that the Tribe believes that the State has no legitimate reason for determining that the Office of the Attorney General should initiate these suits. To support its point, the Tribe relies on oral argument that occurred in a prior hearing in this litigation. During argument, in response to a question posed by the Magistrate Judge regarding whether a civil suit in federal court is the sole remedy allowed by Restoration Act, Texas's attorney stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   I think there's a reason that Congress set it up this way. I think that you might have a situation - and I'm not specifically saying that it's happening here or not happening here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   But you might have a situation where you have within a local community the elected district attorneys and county attorneys may be hesitant to enforce these provisions against tribes which are important members of those communities\n   and that there may be some political will there, and that Congress was hoping to reserve to the State of Texas, an independent sovereign, the right to have its laws enforced regardless of what local elected officials choose to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Resp. Ex. E (Prelim. Inj. Hearing Tr. 37:20-38:11). Statements made by an attorney who is not under oath are arguments, not evidence. Thus, the Tribe has not proffered any admissible evidence to support its contention that Paxton is making decisions based on political will. In addition, the attorney was offering a hypothetical reason regarding why Congress may have drafted the Restoration Act in the fashion that it did, and the attorney was not offering a statement regarding why Texas's Office of the Attorney General has chosen to bring this action against the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Moreover, even if the Tribe offered admissible evidence showing that the State considers political aims in determining who should prosecute an action, the Tribe has failed to provide any authority suggesting that it would be constitutionally improper for the State to consider local officials' political will. Rather, it appears that the State's policy would further the legitimate governmental interest of ensuring that Texas's laws are enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In sum, because of the limitations imposed by the Restoration Act, the State must initiate actions regarding the Pueblo's alleged gaming violations in a different manner than the State's normal practice in initiating actions against other entities that are not covered by the Restoration Act. Thus, Paxton has a rational basis for using the centralized Attorney General's office to pursue this action: he endeavors to follow the Restoration Act, which is federal law. Having determined that a rational basis exists, the Court is of the opinion that Texas's structure for prosecuting alleged gaming violations does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Thus, for purposes of the Tribe's Equal Protection claims, their charitable bingo provisions rise and fall together. Hereafter, in the interest of brevity, the Court will refer to the list of charitable organizations as that found in the Bingo Enabling Act. The Court's discussion regarding the Bingo Enabling Act is duly applicable to the Texas Constitution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The Tribe contends that \"the Court has confirmed\" that this claim may be brought pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act. Resp. 8. Apparently, the Tribe believes that the Court determined that the Declaratory Judgment Act provides the Court with jurisdiction to hear an Equal Protection claim when the Court granted the Tribe leave to amend its Counterclaim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order Denying Defs.'

Now, having fully considered the issue, the Court determines that the Declaratory Judgment Act does not supply a cause of action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Some scholars have argued that federal question jurisdiction should be understood to include the implied power to issue injunctive relief in constitutional cases, even without Congressional action.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , John F.

Thus, according to the Tribe's logic, strict scrutiny should apply here as well.
