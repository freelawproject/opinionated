On May 25, 2018, the USDA filed the Defendant's Brief (docket no. 27). On June 7, 2018, Davids filed the Reply Brief (docket no. 28). On June 8, 2018, 2018, the matter was referred to Judge Mahoney for issuance of a report and recommendation. On October 16, 2018, Judge Mahoney issued the Report and Recommendation, which recommends that the court affirm the USDA's decision. On October 30, 2018, Davids filed the Objections. On November 6, 2018, the USDA filed a Response (docket no. 32) to Davids's Objections. Neither party has requested oral argument and the court finds that oral argument is unnecessary.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained this approach as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A general objection to the entirety of the magistrate's report has the same effects as would a failure to object. The district court's attention is not focused on any specific issues for review, thereby making the initial reference to the magistrate useless. The functions of the district court are effectively duplicated as both the magistrate and the district court perform identical tasks. This duplication of time and effort wastes judicial resources rather than saving them, and runs contrary to the purposes of the Magistrates Act. We would hardly countenance an appellant's brief simply objecting to the district court's determination without explaining the source of the error. We should not permit appellants to do the same to the district court reviewing the magistrate's report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

The court finds no error in Judge Mahoney's finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   First, the burden of proof to show that the manipulation of the wetlands had only a minimal effect was on Davids because she did not consult with the USDA prior to manipulating the wetlands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130809\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/934/\">\n    537 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   942 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2012.31\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (\"If a person has converted a wetland and then seeks a determination that the effect of such conversion on wetland was minimal, the burden will be upon the person to demonstrate to the satisfaction of NRCS that the effect was minimal.\"). Second, Davids did not provide NRCS with proof of minimal effect. Davids submitted evidence of minimal effect on appeal, only after NRCS had made its determination that 1.55 acres of the Davids's farmland was converted wetland. Moreover, after converting the farm land, Davids did not request a minimal effect evaluation from NRCS. Instead, Davids filed an AD-1026 form, which alerted the USDA that the farmland had a new drainage system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at \u00b6 16; AR at 549. By filing the AD-1026 form, Davids did not request a minimal effect evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penner v.

NRCS was not required to make a functional assessment for purposes of the minimal effect exemption simply because Davids filed an AD-1026 form. Third, in his decision, the Director of the NAD thoroughly addressed the evidence provided by Davids to the NAD regarding minimal effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 387-88. Specifically, the Director found that Davids's \"arguments concerning the volume of runoff water, removal of subsurface saturation, and disparate treatment do not demonstrate that the effect of the wetland conversion was minimal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 388.
