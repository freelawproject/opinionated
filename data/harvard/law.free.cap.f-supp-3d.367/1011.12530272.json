No further public comment was pursued for the new activity. However, the Outdoor Recreation Planner did reach out to the two previously permitted guides for their opinions on the possibility of a new operator entering the same area.

If multiple operators are stacked on the same terrain, they compete for the limited terrain that is suitable and available that day. That creates an incentive for one operator to access it before the other operator to provide the guests with untracked snow. That incentive works against efforts to minimize avalanche risks. It is difficult to build in geographic buffers among multiple operators if all may access the same limited terrain. Stacking operators in the same terrain creates the risk that one group may inadvertently ski onto terrain above a group from another operator, potentially causing an avalanche.

Defendants argue that it was reasonable for BLM to conclude that the ASG permit would not result in significantly different environmental effects given that its proposed operations were nearly identical to those proposed by Triumvirate, and BLM had determined the environmental effects identified in connection with Triumvirate's proposed operations did not meet \"the definition of significance....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants argue that the issue is not whether the later-in-time action is identical to that analyzed in the earlier EA but whether the greater intensity of the later-in-time action, or changed circumstances in the area, are likely to result in significantly different environmental effects. Defendants argue that the Triumvirate EA considered this issue. In the Triumvirate EA, BLM noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[i]ncreased interest from commercial recreation providers, commercial filming companies, and aircraft transportation services may result in increased noise and observed aircraft by other aircraft in the area. Although there has been a slight increase in such commercial recreation opportunities in this area, there is no substantial cumulative impact to the existing quality recreation experience due to the area's expanse where visitors can spread out and avoid ... the sights and sounds of other users. Therefore, cumulative impacts to recreation and visual resources as a result of this permit authorization would be limited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   BLM improperly relied on the DNA to reach its decision to issue a permit to ASG. The Triumvirate EA considered the effects and impacts of only one heli-ski operator making 130 landings per season. The Triumvirate EA did not consider the impacts of three heli-ski operators making 390 landings per season. The effects of three commercial heli-ski operators in the same area are fundamentally different from the effects of one commercial heli-ski operator. But, the DNA does not reflect any consideration of this. Rather, in the DNA, BLM found that the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of ASG's proposed operations \"will be nearly similar to those that have been previously analyzed (for Triumvirate Heli-skiing), as both Triumvirate and Alaska Snowboard Guides will have two helicopters and one airplane.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   This finding ignores the fact that when the Triumvirate EA was completed, there was only one heli-ski operator in the Neacolas, but with the addition of ASG, there would be three. There were changed circumstances which BLM failed to consider. It is not a matter of BLM having considered the changed circumstances and deciding that the changed circumstances would not result in significantly different environmental effects. It is that BLM did not consider the changed circumstances at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The example from BLM's NEPA Handbook that plaintiffs' counsel referred to at oral argument illustrates the problem with BLM's reliance on the DNA in this case. In that example, \"[a]n applicant requests a special recreation permit for a 4-wheel vehicle race on an established route, which is analyzed in an EA, selected in a decision document, and implemented.\" BLM National Environmental Policy Act Handbook, H-1790-1 (2008) at 22. \"Later, another applicant requests a special recreation permit for a motorcycle race on the same route.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Handbook suggests that this is a situation \"in which an existing environmental analysis might be relied upon in its entirety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this example, the 4-wheel vehicle race and the motorcycle race were not taking place at the same time. Rather, one race had been permitted and held and then a second applicant sought a permit for a race in the same area to be held at a different time. In such a situation, it would be entirely reasonable that the EA that was completed for the first race could be relied upon in its entirety when considering the second race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   But that was not the situation here. In the DNA, BLM treated ASG's application as though it was dealing with the equivalent of the foregoing example, which it was\n   not. In addressing the BLM NEPA Handbook queries in the DNA, BLM answered the fourth query as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Are the direct, indirect and cumulative effects that would result from implementation of the new proposed action similar (both quantitatively and qualitatively) to those analzyed in the existing NEPA document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Yes. The effects will be nearly similar to those that have been previously analyzed (for Triumvirate Heli-skiing), as both Triumvirate and Alaska Snowboard Guides will have two helicopters and one airplane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This affirmative answer fails to recognize that ASG's operations and those of the two previously authorized permit holders overlap. They are not sequential. ASG is not taking the place of Triumvirate. Rather, Triumvirate and ASG (as well as Silverton) are operating at the same time in the same area. In order to take a hard look at the environmental impacts of ASG's permit application, as NEPA requires, BLM had to consider the environmental impacts of\n   <em>\n    adding\n   </em>\n   a third heli-ski operator to the same area in which Triumvirate and Silverton were already operating. This BLM failed to do in its DNA and thus its decision to issue a special recreation permit to ASG, based on the DNA, was arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs' motions for the court to take judicial notice are denied as the court did not rely on any of the newspaper articles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted and defendants' cross-motion is denied.
