Plaintiff Gilbert Marroquin, Mrs. Marroquin's husband, brings seven claims under California law against Defendants Pfizer, Inc. (\"Pfizer\") and Mylan Institutional, Inc. (\"Mylan\") for strict products liability, negligence\n   based products liability, breach of warranty, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and concealment.

However, the amiodarone caused pulmonary disease and her resulting death on May 6, 2016. Amiodarone is listed as a cause of death on Mrs. Marroquin's death certificate. The admiodarone administered to Mrs. Marroquin was manufactured and distributed by Pfizer and Mylan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Marroquin alleges that: (1) the amiodarone was defective at the time it left Defendants' control; (2) Defendants breached their duty of care regarding preparation, design, research, development, manufacture, inspection, labeling, market, promotion, and sale of amiodarone ; (3) Defendants' breached the warranty of suitability/fitness with respect to amiodarone ; (4) Defendants failed to adequately warn of amiodarone's potential risks; (5) Defendants intentionally or negligently misrepresented that amiodarone was safe, fit, and effective for human use; and (6) Defendants concealed the fact that amiodarone was not safe, fit, or effective for human use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     PFIZER'S MOTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Arguments\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pfizer argues that the FDA approved label for amiodarone /Cordarone clearly warns of the risks and dangers of developing pulmonary toxicity and that pulmonary toxicity was fatal 10% of the time. In fact, pulmonary toxicity is identified 15 times in the drug label. Each of FAC's claims depend on a finding that the warning label was inadequate. Because the warning label is clear and adequate, no recovery is possible. By operation of California's learned intermediary doctrine, this is true even if Mrs. Marroquin did not read any part of the warning label.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Alternatively, Pfizer argues that the FAC fails to meet any of the applicable pleading requirements. First, the FAC's claims of concealment and negligent and intentional misrepresentation fail to comply with Rule 9(b). The FAC lumps defendants together and makes only conclusory allegations that do not identify the who, what, when, where, and how of any \"fraudulent\" conduct. Second, the first cause of action for \"strict products liability\" does not differentiate between a design defect and a manufacturing defect. However, California law does not recognize a design defect claim with respect to pharmaceutical products, and the manufacturing defect claim does not explain how the manufacturing process deviated from the intended outcome. Third, because the FAC's negligence claim is congruent with first claim for products liability except for an added element of causation, the negligence claim fails for the same reasons as the products liability claim. Fourth, the failure to warn products liability claim fails because the FAC fails to identify any danger about which no warning was given, nor does the FAC allege that any failure to warn was the cause of Mrs. Marroquin's death. Fifth, the FAC fails to allege the terms of any warranty, or that Mrs. Marroquin or her physician relied on any terms of a warranty. Further, any implied warranty theory fails because Mrs. Marroquin relied on the skill and judgment of her physician. Finally, the request for punitive damages fails because no factual allegations suggest oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Opposition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Marroquin argues that not all of his claims are based on a failure to warn, and,\n   under Rule 8, he need not prove anything, rather he need only plead plausible claims. Marroquin also argues that the FAC is adequately pled in general. First, the strict products liability contains allegations that track Judicial Council of California, Civil Jury Instruction ( CACI) 1201, manufacturing defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, Marroquin states that he agrees that he must prove the four elements of negligence, plus the element that the product defect was due to defendants' negligence. However, the FAC does allege that Pfizer breach its duty to Ms. Marroquin, which caused her health. If the Court finds the allegations incomplete, additional facts may be alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, the \"exact terms\" of a warranty do not need to be alleged. Although the FAC adequately alleges breaches of both express and implied warranties, additional allegations regarding Pfizer's advertising to the public that its product was safe, fit, and effective could be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth, a strict liability failure to warn claim has been properly pled. The adequacy of a warning is generally a fact question, it is unknown whether the label proffered by Pfizer is the same label provided on the relevant batch of amiodarone that was administered in this case. These are fact questions that prevent dismissal at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fifth, Marroquin agrees that additional allegations are necessary to allege a plausible intentional misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sixth, there is a growing trend among the district courts within the Ninth Circuit that negligent misrepresentation claims need not comply with Rule 9(b). Because the FAC allegations that Pfizer misrepresented that Amiodarone was safe, fit, and effective, a plausible claim has been stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Seventh, Pfizer's arguments are not clear. The FAC alleges that Pfizer concealed that amiodarone was not safe, fit, or effective for human use and that it had a serious propensity to cause injury or death. These are sufficient facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, the punitive damages claim is based only on the fifth and seventh claims for intentional misrepresentation and concealment. The specific facts alleged under those claims are sufficient to support punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Initially, Pfizer's argument that each of Marroquin's claims involves the adequacy of warnings is not persuasive. As discussed below, the FAC alleges a manufacturing defect claim. The adequacy of any warnings will not defeat a manufacturing defect claim against a drug manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Recurrent ventricular fibrillation. 2. Recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachychardia.

Finally, in the \"Medication Guide\" portion of the label, the first thing that patients are informed is that \"Cordarone can cause serious side effects that can lead to death including: lung problems ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Schwoerer\n   </em>\n   , Marroquin states that the adequacy of a warning is generally a fact question. The Court agrees, but this does not mean that adequacy is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   a question of fact for a jury. Marroquin does not actually address the adequacy of the warnings described above. As quoted above, the FDA label clearly states that Cordarone is approved to treat two serious heart conditions and it is a drug of last resort because of its potentially fatal toxicities. More than once, pulmonary toxicity is clearly and expressly identified as the most dangerous toxicity/potential side effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Percentages of those who experience pulmonary toxicity and the percentage of those who suffer fatal pulmonary toxicity is provided. Importantly, there is nearly two pages of warnings/information devoted entirely to pulmonary toxicity.

Pfizer has presented documentation that Cordarone has been approved by the FDA as a drug of last resort for two types of serious heart arrhythmias since 1985.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 26-2. From the FDA approved warning label in 1985 to the current 2015 warning label, lung toxicity and the statistics regarding those who develop lung toxicity have been listed. Further, the World Health Organization has listed amiodarone in its List of Essential Medicines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for over 30 years, Cordarone /amiodarone has been used and viewed as beneficial by physicians and governmental entities for the treatment of certain cardiac conditions. Amiodarone /Cordarone's continued use since 1985 in the medical profession, despite the express warning about the potentially fatal side effect of lung toxicity, is contrary to the FAC's allegations that amiodarone is \"not safe, fit, or effective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, there are concerns with the element of reliance. Amiodarone would have been prescribed through Mrs. Marroquin's doctor. The factual allegations do not plausibly suggest that Mrs. Marroquin relied on anything other than her doctor's judgment and assessment that amiodarone was the proper medication for her at that time. If Mrs. Marroquin relied on her physician to prescribe the amiodarone while she was in the hospital, it is unclear how she could rely on any representations by Pfizer or Mylan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For these reasons, dismissal of the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Punitive damages are \"merely an additional remedy that [are] dependent on a viable cause of action for an underlying tort.\"\n   <em>\n    569 E.

The Court has serious concerns whether amendment can cure the deficiencies identified in this order. For example, the allegations in the FAC and the judicially noticed documents indicate that there has been a sufficient warning regarding fatal lung toxicity, and it is likely that Mrs. Marroquin relied on her physician to prescribe an appropriate medication. However, the FAC contains mostly conclusory allegations, and the opposition does not address some of the key shortcomings in the FAC beyond requesting leave to amend or stating that the FAC is adequately pled. Given the state of the briefing, and the express request to file an amended complaint, the Court cannot determine at this time that amendment would be futile.

These cases explain that generic drug manufactures (such as Mylan) are required to provide a label for their generic drugs that exactly match the FDA label approved for the name brand drug.

In this respect, a mere distributor sits in the same shoes as a generic manufacturer, neither has the ability to alter or change an approved FDA warning label. Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Mensing\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court accepted the FDA's position that if generic drug manufacturers were permitted to alter labeling, including sending \"dear doctor\" letters with additional information or warnings, \"that would inaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the brand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    Mensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n    564 U.S. at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Brinkley v.

The risk of confusion or being misled by a different or perhaps even conflicting \"label\" would seem to be greater if a mere distributor could add additional warnings that it deems necessary or advisable. Because of the danger of \"confusion,\" and because the Court is unaware of a federally lawful way for a mere prescription drug distributor to include its own warnings or otherwise alter an FDA approved label, the Court agrees with those courts that hold\n   <em>\n    Mensing\n   </em>\n   applies to distributors of prescription drugs, be they brand-name or generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Therefore, Marroquin's request to add an allegation that Mylan was a distributor does not save the fourth cause of action.
