Davis, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This maritime matter is before the Court following a bench trial, and involves a contract dispute between third-party plaintiff CMA CGM, S.A. (\"CMA\") and third-party defendant Marine Repair Services of Virginia (\"MRS\"). Although a trial was necessary in this case, the majority of the facts are not in dispute, and the primary legal issue is whether CMA is entitled to complete indemnity from MRS pursuant\n   to the \"warranty of workmanlike performance\" that has been recognized in this Circuit to apply in maritime stevedoring contracts, ship repair contracts, and at least some towage contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Stipulated Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court adopts, and incorporates herein by reference, the forty-five stipulations of fact set forth in the final pretrial order. ECF No. 94, at 3-13. Reproduced immediately below is an abbreviated version of such stipulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CMA is a French ocean carrier with its headquarters in France, and CMA conducts business in the United States through its agent, CMA CGM (America), LLC (\"CMA America\"). MRS is a Virginia corporation that, among other things, maintains and services refrigerated cargo containers (\"reefers\") at various terminals in the Port of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October of 2016, plaintiff Sea King Corporation (\"Sea King\") contacted defendant Eimskip Logistics Inc. (\"Eimskip\") to arrange for the transport of a cargo of frozen conch meat from Sea King's facility in Atlantic, Virginia to Hong Kong. On October 14, 2016, Eimskip made a \"web booking\" for such shipment with CMA America. Such booking indicated that the cargo was \"frozen seafood\" to be shipped from Virginia International Gateway terminal (\"VIG\") to Hong Kong, in a refrigerated container set at -20\u00b0 Celsius, vents closed. CMA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   sent Eimskip a booking confirmation reflecting such shipping requirements, and Eimskip sent a follow up email to Sea King confirming the booking for shipment through CMA. After Sea King was paid in full for the cargo by the Hong Kong buyer, it executed a written contract with Eimskip for shipment of the frozen conch meat (valued at over $ 250,000) to Hong Kong in a 40-foot reefer set to an internal temperature of -20\u00b0 Celsius. Sea King paid Eimskip approximately $ 5,500 for ocean freight, pre-carriage transport, and insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Virginia International Terminals (\"VIT\"), the entity that operates the VIG terminal, has an \"electronic data interface\" (\"EDI\") system that permitted CMA to electronically forward the electronic booking made by Eimskip to the terminal. However, VIT had an EDI server issue beginning on October 25, 2016 that delayed certain booking entries from posting in the system until late on October 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of the booking with Eimskip, CMA sent an email order to MRS requesting that MRS prepare a reefer for release, listing the required preset temperature as -20\u00b0 Celsius. A reefer is an insulated container with a refrigeration unit powered either by an external source (plugged into shore or ship power) or by a portable generator attached to the container (commonly known as a \"genset\"). A genset is attached to a reefer when it is being transported by truck, and the genset is generally removed when the reefer is stored at a facility that has power or when it is loaded onto a ship. A reefer container is readily distinguishable from a standard cargo container because reefers have smooth sides and dry cargo containers have corrugated sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on CMA's email request, MRS \"pre-tripped\" reefer Container No. TRIU8137918 (the \"Container\"), which was leased by CMA and stored at MRS's\n   \"depot\" in Chesapeake, Virginia. The pre-trip inspection, performed by MRS in Chesapeake, confirmed that the Container's refrigeration system was operating properly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As of October 2016, CMA and MRS had a general course of dealing under which MRS agreed to: (1) pre-trip CMA's containers as needed; and (2) monitor CMA's export container temperatures twice per day after a live container with temperature requirements was in-gated at the VIG terminal. The purpose of the monitoring was to confirm that the temperature stayed within a designated range and to protect the integrity of the cargo. As a matter of practice, when MRS identifies a discrepancy between the booking temperature and the actual temperature of a reefer, it immediately notifies the ship line (here CMA) as a failsafe against cargo damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 26, 2016, third-party defendant Leighton Trucking, LLC (\"Leighton\"), a company hired by Eimskip to transport the empty pre-tripped Container from MRS's Chesapeake facility to Sea King's facility for loading, and then transport the loaded Container to VIG, picked up the Container in Chesapeake. On the morning of October 27, 2016, Leighton brought the Container to Sea King's facility, and the properly functioning reefer was loaded with frozen conch meat and sealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That same morning, Eimskip contacted CMA to inform it that the Container was actively being loaded, but that there was not a booking for such reefer in VIT's computer system (a fact that resulted from the EDI server issue). In response to this email, a CMA employee\n   <em>\n    manually input\n   </em>\n   the booking data into VIT's system, and although such booking identified the Container as a loaded reefer for export, it\n   <em>\n    failed to reflect a temperature requirement\n   </em>\n   for the Container.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   VIG is an automated terminal that minimizes personal contact with containers moving through the terminal facility. The gate-in process is handled remotely, with inspection of incoming and outgoing containers performed though video and photographs. With respect to \"live\" reefer containers, however,\n   <em>\n    VIT reefer mechanics\n   </em>\n   ensure that reefers are visually checked at VIG before a delivering driver is released from the terminal. The steamship lines, like CMA, also take special precautions to ensure that human or mechanical failures do not compromise frozen cargo. At VIG,\n   <em>\n    all gensets are removed by MRS employees\n   </em>\n   and MRS charges all carriers, such as CMA, for genset removal services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Leighton truck arrived at the VIG gate and entered the terminal at 2:55 p.m. on October 27, 2016. The genset mounted on the Container was operating and the Container displayed a digital temperature of -20\u00b0 Celsius. However, because of CMA's error in omitting the temperature requirement from the manual booking, VIT's booking information indicated that the Container was a reefer with\n   <em>\n    no temperature requirement\n   </em>\n   , i.e. not a \"live\" container. Although VIT inspected the Container upon arrival at VIG by video and photographs, its clerks did not notice the discrepancy between the booking information and the \"live\" reefer that appeared at the gate. The Container was admitted to VIG and the driver received a routing ticket from the unmanned kiosk at the gate, instructing him to take the Container to \"yard location 08L.\" Although it is not indicated on the ticket, yard location 08L is a\n   <em>\n    non-powered\n   </em>\n   \"stack\" of containers that is not suitable for storing a \"live\" reefer with a temperature requirement. The Routing Ticket instructed the driver that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   If you are dropping off reefer in the stacks, proceed to 407 row first to have the genset removed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ** If parking reefer in the reefer rows WAIT WITH THE CONTAINER UNTIL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   REEFER MECHANIC ARRIVES TO CHECK THE CONTAINER IN!**\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ** DO NOT GO TO THE STACK WITH GENSET ATTACHED**\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the time, VIT's Operations Manual provided detailed instructions for the handling of live export reefers assigned to the \"reefer rows,\" where the truck chassis, with reefer attached, would be parked in an assigned slot. The driver was required to wait with the reefer in the reefer rows until a\n   <em>\n    VIT reefer mechanic\n   </em>\n   verified the container temperature. If the temperature was acceptable, VIT would plug the container into shore power and the driver would be released. At VIG,\n   <em>\n    VIT is the entity responsible for plugging reefer containers into both shore power and vessel power\n   </em>\n   . Because live\n   <em>\n    export\n   </em>\n   reefers were not ordinarily stored in \"the stacks,\" VIT's Operations Manual provided no procedure for sending live export reefers to the stacks. The practice of sending a live export reefer to the stacks was considered by VIT to be unusual and abnormal and only done when the reefer rows were full. Only rows 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 of the stacks contained reefer slots (i.e., these rows had shore power).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In accordance with the instructions on the printed VIG gate ticket, the Leighton driver drove to \"row 407,\" where two of\n   <em>\n    MRS's reefer mechanics\n   </em>\n   confirmed (from looking at the gate ticket) that the Container was headed for the stacks, and not the reefer rows, and it therefore had to have its genset removed at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Container's refrigeration unit was switched off by MRS at 4:41 p.m. that day (Oct. 27, 2016), and the genset was removed. The Container was then taken to the stacks and was never connected to shore power at VIG, nor to ship power during oversees transport. Although the Container was powered-off on October 27, 2016, the cargo remained frozen and undamaged at the VIG terminal through at least October 28, 2016. The cargo was discovered to be a total loss upon delivery in Hong Kong in December of 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When pre-tripping the reefer in Chesapeake, MRS posted a placard on the Container next to the control panel at eye level stating the booked temperature (-20\u00b0 Celsius). Both MRS reefer mechanics working at VIG on the day the Container arrived have testified that they did not know that stack 8 at VIG had no powered reefer slots. At a corporate level, MRS was aware that row 8 of the stacks did not contain reefer slots. MRS Reefer Mechanic Glen Carpenter filled out a Reefer Receive/Release\n   Log showing that the Container had been received at VIG (identified by container number) and that the temperature setting was -20\u00b0 Celsius. This was the only CMA reefer received at VIG on October 27 and this log page included just one entry. Carpenter turned the log page into his MRS foreman at the end of his shift on October 27, 2016. The MRS foreman, Leo Castellanos, was responsible for preparing a Refrigerated Tracking and Monitoring log. Castellanos, or occasionally other MRS reefer mechanics, would check the temperature on CMA containers twice per day and record them in this log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   VIT's server problem was fixed late on October 27, and at 7:38 p.m., the VIT system finally showed the original booking made by CMA back on October 25, which included the proper temperature setting for the Container. Such updated booking did not, however, change any container-specific information in the VIT system, meaning that if MRS accessed VIT's system for information regarding the Container (as opposed to searching the system based on the booking number) the system would indicate that the Container was a loaded export reefer but would\n   <em>\n    not indicate a temperature requirement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties agree and stipulate that the contract or contracts between CMA and MRS involved in this case were maritime contracts within the meaning of that term for purposes of the Court's admiralty jurisdiction and choice of law in this case. The original plaintiffs settled their maritime claims against Eimskip, and CMA and Eimskip settled its third-party claims with VIT and Leighton. CMA settled with Plaintiffs by agreeing to pay them $ 260,000 in consideration of complete releases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facts Determined by the Court as Factfinder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1. MRS and CMA's business relationship is not governed by a written contract, but rather, such entities have established, through a long-term course of dealing, that MRS provides CMA with three distinct services relevant to this case: (a) MRS \"pre-trips\" reefer containers for CMA and arranges for their release; (b) MRS provides CMA with genset mounting and dismounting services at VIG, a service that is also provided to all other carrier companies that move reefers through VIG; and (c) MRS provides reefer temperature monitoring and container repair for CMA's reefers at VIG, although unlike the mounting/dismounting services, such monitoring service is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   provided to all other carriers, as some carriers contract directly with VIT for similar monitoring services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   2. Although MRS monitors CMA's live reefers twice daily while they are stored at VIG, unlike other terminals in the area, MRS is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   responsible for, nor is it permitted, to intake such containers at VIG and plug them into shore power. Such intake duties, which include both confirming that the reefer is operating at the time of intake within an acceptable temperature range, and connecting the reefer to shore power, are borne solely by VIT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3. MRS bills CMA separately for each aspect of its services as they are performed. Accordingly, an invoice is issued when MRS's storage facility in Chesapeake, Virginia releases a pre-tripped container, an invoice is issued for genset removal after gensets are installed or removed from CMA's containers at VIG, and an invoice is issued for the twice daily monitoring of the CMA reefers at VIG. No written contracts govern such services\n   beyond the emails/orders sent by CMA to MRS to arrange for the pre-tripping/release of reefers needed for upcoming exports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   4. In order to conduct its monitoring services at VIG, the MRS foreman maintains a handwritten monitoring log. Each morning, and each afternoon, the foreman accesses the on-terminal \"SPARCS\" computer database maintained by VIT and prints a list of all CMA reefer containers that have been in-gated with temperature requirements. The SPARCS information is \"live\" and updates constantly, including updates to the current location of each container at VIG, and this system can only be accessed by MRS while physically at the terminal. MRS cross-references the updated SPARCS list to its handwritten log twice a day to ensure that CMA's reefers are accounted for and being monitored. Pursuant to its course of dealing with CMA, MRS visually inspects each CMA reefer container with an assigned temperature requirement\n   <em>\n    twice a day\n   </em>\n   to ensure that the reefer is maintaining a temperature consistent with the booking information (the temperature requirement is available in the SPARCS system and is printed on the MRS \"sticker\" that is affixed to the exterior of the reefer when it leaves MRS's Chesapeake depot). Should there be any issues with a reefer, MRS performs necessary repairs without further guidance from CMA (and bills CMA for such repairs) except in those cases where the repair is major, in which case MRS contacts CMA to work out a plan for addressing the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   5. When a pre-tripped reefer is released from the MRS depot, certain MRS employees are aware of the intended local export terminal as well as the approximate date that the reefer will arrive at such terminal. However, because MRS turns over custody of the reefer, and because CMA does not notify MRS of any changes to the shipping timeframe, to include changes to the export vessel, export terminal, or the number of days that the container will be stored at the terminal prior to export, MRS does not \"track\" the released container. CMA failed to present evidence at trial demonstrating that MRS had an obligation, whether express, implied, or through \"course of dealing,\" to track a reefer after it is pre-tripped and released. Rather, MRS merely reacts when a CMA reefer is in-gated at a local terminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   6. MRS has no functions at the VIG gate, nor does it have any direct communications with the gate regarding which containers have entered the terminal. MRS also has no role in: (a) assigning the VIG location where truck drivers should deliver a reefer designated for export; or (b) moving, or directing the movement of, reefers at VIG. Rather, VIT controls the movement of all containers at VIG. If a reefer being monitored by MRS is repositioned by VIT, VIT does not communicate with MRS either before or after the container is moved, and MRS is only \"informed\" of the move through accessing the real-time SPARCS system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   7. Because MRS has no control over where containers are stored at the VIG terminal, it has no ability to group containers by client in order to facilitate more efficient/effective monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   8. As established through the deposition of CMA's Rule 30(b) (6) representative,\n   <em>\n    CMA believed\n   </em>\n   that MRS knew when a live reefer arrived at VIG through two channels: (1) MRS received a \"printout\" of the reefers that arrived each day (the SPARCS information); and (2) MRS created its own log from the \"temperature check\" it performed in \"the lane\" as part of the receiving function at VIG. CMA believed that MRS would cross-check these lists to ensure that all live CMA reefers were accounted for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   9. Although CMA's representative may have accurately summarized how MRS tracks reefers at\n   <em>\n    other local terminals\n   </em>\n   where MRS does in fact perform initial intake temperature checks, he was mistaken as to the procedure at VIG. Notably, at VIG, the initial temperature check is performed by VIT personnel, rather than MRS personnel, and MRS therefore does not create a log of live reefers passing through a temperature check \"lane\" that it can later cross check against the SPARCS \"printout.\" MRS's 30(b) (6) representative testified that MRS does maintain a log of the CMA reefers visually identified (twice daily) in the reefer rows and powered reefer stacks and cross checks that log against the SPARCS list. MRS would, of course, investigate the matter if its employees discovered a CMA reefer parked in the reefer rows, or powered reefer stacks, that did not appear on the SPARCS list; however, the Container at issue was not assigned to, nor stored in, either of these two appropriate areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   10. Reefer containers are sometimes used to ship dry goods that do not require refrigeration, including situations where there are humidity concerns and when there is a surplus of reefers in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   11. MRS reefer mechanics perform genset install and removal for\n   <em>\n    all reefers\n   </em>\n   that arrive or depart VIG regardless of whether the carrier contracts with MRS for any monitoring services. MRS creates a genset \"Mount Dismount Log\" and a \"Reefer Receive/Reefer Release\" log when it installs or dismounts a genset at VIG, but MRS does not cross-check either of these logs with its monitoring log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   12. Because the Container at issue was in-gated\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   a temperature requirement (due to the EDI server issue, the CMA manual input error, and the failure of the VIT gate inspection to discover that the Container was \"live\") VIT never performed an initial temperature check nor did it take any steps to plug the container into shore power. The Container never appeared on the relevant SPARCS list, and MRS never attempted to locate it or monitor it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   13. Based on CMA and VIT's errors, which dictated/controlled the handling of the Container at VIG, the Container was placed in a dry stack where: (1) there was no available power; and (2) it was essentially impossible for MRS, or anyone else, to visually \"discover\" the Container, and/or see the MRS \"sticker\" while monitoring other reefers because the unpowered stacks are physically inaccessible, rendering such misfiled Container effectively \"hidden\" once it entered the unpowered stacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   14. CMA was aware of the disappearance/non-existence of the booking in the VIT system before the Container was \"hidden\" at VIG, yet it failed to take precautions to ensure that such reefer was properly accounted for. Specifically, CMA did\n   <em>\n    not notify\n   </em>\n   MRS about the fact that it had to make a manual entry on October 27 to allow the Container entry to the VIG terminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   15. If it had more robust procedures in place, and/or more knowledgeable reefer mechanics that knew which rows in the VIG stack were powered, MRS clearly \"could have\" discovered the error caused by CMA's and VIT's conduct. Had such error been discovered, MRS would have been obligated to investigate such issue on behalf of CMA because, within reason, MRS acts as CMA's \"eyes and ears\" at VIG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That said, if it had more robust\n   procedures in place, CMA likewise clearly \"could have\" discovered the error caused by its erroneous manual booking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   16. Although MRS had an established \"course of dealing\" with CMA aimed at protecting CMA's cargo, there was not a course of dealing that rendered MRS the virtual insurer of CMA's cargo. MRS did not operate VIG, did not assign container locations, and most notably, did not \"intake\" reefers to confirm temperature settings and/or \"plug in\" live reefers to shore power. MRS was clearly obligated through course of dealing to have procedures in place to monitor the integrity of CMA's refrigerated cargo at VIG, but its primary role was to ensure that the refrigeration units\n   <em>\n    continued to function properly\n   </em>\n   . The trial evidence failed to establish that course of dealing required MRS to adopt the best possible procedures, regardless of the cost or likelihood that such procedures were necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated differently, the Court rejects CMA's suggestion that MRS was obligated to act as a \"failsafe\" against all errors, including booking errors committed by CMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   17. Consistent with MRS's post-trial argument, through course of dealing, MRS was obligated to monitor all CMA reefers at VIG that were in-gated with a temperature requirement (and thus appeared on the relevant SPARCS printout), and it had the further duty to \"discover\" any CMA live reefer parked in the powered reefer stacks, or the reefer rows, that displayed a MRS \"sticker\" reflecting a temperature requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As set forth in the Final Pretrial Order, CMA asserts that MRS breached its contract with CMA, that such breach caused the damage for which CMA faced liability to other parties, and that MRS is liable, under maritime law,\n   <em>\n    to indemnify\n   </em>\n   CMA for the entire $ 260,000 settlement paid by CMA. MRS agrees that maritime law governs the instant dispute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   but asserts that it did not commit any breach of contract or violate any existing course of dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   MRS further asserts that indemnity is not appropriate even if there was a contractual breach. The key legal disputes center on whether the maritime \"warranty of workmanlike performance\" applies and was breached, and whether indemnity is an available remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rather, as discussed below, the Court agrees with MRS that the trial record demonstrates that, because of the booking error committed by CMA, \"control\" over the Container was never effectively turned over to MRS for twice daily monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Although it is clear that the Container was briefly encountered by MRS at the\n   VIG terminal for the limited purpose of genset removal, such removal function was properly performed, and the Container was then taken to an area of the VIG terminal that was not accessible to MRS. The trial evidence establishes that no duty to monitor the Container arose unless there was: (1) an actual transfer of custody to MRS, or at a minimum, a transfer of the Container to the \"reefer rows\" or physically accessible powered reefer stacks at VIG; (2)\n   <em>\n    proper\n   </em>\n   notice to the MRS personnel responsible for monitoring CMA's containers that a \"live\" reefer with a temperature requirement had arrived at VIG (i.e., notification through \"SPARCS\"); or (3) proof of an established course of dealing requiring MRS to use its genset mount/dismount area at VIG to double as an \"intake verification\" area such that MRS was obligated to ensure that CMA/VIT had not mis-booked and misclassified a live reefer. At trial, CMA failed to demonstrate that any of such triggers occurred in this case, and thus, MRS's duty to monitor was never triggered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   CMA's 30(b) (6) representative, who did not testify at trial, but instead appeared through deposition, indicated under oath that he believed that MRS was responsible for performing the initial temperature verification during the intake process at VIG. CMA later stipulated that it was actually VIT personnel who perform such duties\n   <em>\n    at VIG\n   </em>\n   ; however, CMA's earlier-in-time mistaken understanding of MRS's role/responsibilities at VIG illustrates the absence of a \"meeting of the minds\" regarding the scope of MRS's monitoring services. More specifically, the Court finds that there was not a meeting of the minds, or otherwise an \"implied\" obligation for MRS to: (1) track a CMA reefer from the time it leaves the MRS depot in Chesapeake until the time it is transferred to the stevedore for loading on a vessel at VIG; (2) track, verify, or inspect, every CMA reefer container that entered VIG, irrespective of whether the VIG SPARCS booking information for such container included a temperature requirement; and (3) utilize its genset removal lane to verify that two separate business entities with their own respective roles and responsibilities (CMA and VIT), including roles performed solely to ensure the safekeeping of refrigerated cargo, properly completed their booking, intake, and storage assignment duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Such finding is not tantamount to a finding that MRS had no duty to \"troubleshoot\" known or suspected incidents at VIG and/or that it had no duty to act as CMA's \"eyes and ears\" at the terminal. Although VIT was the entity responsible for both verifying the arrival temperature of live export reefers and plugging such containers into shore power, it would be improper to conclude that MRS's monitoring obligation was never \"triggered\" unless a reefer was properly booked and/or that it was not triggered until a reefer was plugged in by VIT. Rather, MRS's obligation typically began when a container was in-gated with a temperature requirement in its electronic booking and allowed to remain at the VIG terminal-had a truck\n   driver parked such container in the wrong place, and/or had VIT failed to plug such container in, MRS would still be on notice from the SPARCS data that it was on the premises and would have an obligation to locate it and ensure that it continued to operate properly. Similarly, even if a proper booking did not exist, if a CMA reefer with the MRS \"sticker\" on its exterior was parked in the reefer rows, or the powered reefer stacks, yet did not appear on the SPARCS list, MRS would have been obligated to investigate the situation in order to protect CMA's cargo. However, neither of such factual scenarios occurred in this case, and CMA failed to demonstrate that the abnormality that did occur \"should have\" been identified by MRS on these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Consideration of which entity was \"best situated\" to avoid the loss, a factor referenced in multiple\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   indemnity cases from this Circuit, further supports such analysis. VIT's server error caused the initial proper booking to be ineffective for several days, an error that VIT was \"the party best situated\" to control for and/or avoid.\n   <em>\n    Tebbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2112459\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/407/1055/#p1058\">\n    407 F.2d at 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CMA then failed to enter the critical temperature requirement into the replacement \"manual booking,\" an error that CMA was the party \"best situated\" to control for and/or avoid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that it would have been difficult for CMA to discover its manual booking error after it occurred, CMA was still fully aware of the \"missing\" electronic booking, the need for the manual entry, and it later discovered the EDI server issue, yet CMA never contacted MRS to share the fact that there may be a problem with the SPARCS data, data that CMA\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that MRS used to facilitate MRS's monitoring services. CMA therefore arguably remained in the best position to avoid cargo damage because, unlike MRS, CMA had, at a minimum, a reason to question the accuracy of the \"live\" SPARCS data before the cargo damage occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   After the above errors were committed, a MRS employee performed his genset removal responsibilities as required under a course of dealing between CMA and MRS that was\n   <em>\n    separate and distinct\n   </em>\n   from monitoring services. MRS disconnected all gensets for all carriers at VIG irrespective of whether MRS had an independent agreement to perform monitoring for such carrier. MRS also billed its genset install/removal separately from its monitoring services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   After disconnecting the genset in a manner fully consistent with MRS's established course of dealing, and fully consistent with the \"real-time\" instructions the MRS mechanic received\n   <em>\n    from VIT\n   </em>\n   through\n   the VIG gate ticket, the MRS mechanic reasonably assumed, within the scope of his responsibilities and within the scope of MRS's course of dealing with CMA, that VIT performed its obligations to assign the Container to a proper location and plug it in to shore power. MRS's genset mechanic surely \"could\" have discovered the booking/stack assignment errors had he been more knowledgeable about the layout of the VIG \"stacks,\" and MRS likewise \"could\" have discovered the error had its foreman reviewed the records prepared by the genset mechanic. However, in the absence of evidence suggesting that MRS was hired by CMA to perform \"screening\" at the genset removal lane in order to advance the efficacy of their monitoring services, its mechanic's physical proximity to the \"live\" reefer at VIG is insufficient to convince the Court that MRS was \"in the best position\" to avoid the damage in this case. Stated differently, even if MRS was in the\n   <em>\n    best location\n   </em>\n   to avoid the damage (because its employees were physically at the terminal), CMA fails to demonstrate that the parties' course of dealing contemplated that MRS would perform the \"cross-check\" monitoring that CMA now asserts was deficiently omitted. Because the Container was never parked in the VIG reefer rows or powered reefer stacks, and because it was not otherwise handed over to MRS for monitoring (it was handed over to MRS for the limited purpose of removing the genset before it was immediately released back into the custody of the truck driver), the warranty of workmanlike performance never \"attached.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fire Ins.

Reefer Mechanic\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The \"expertise\" of the MRS mechanic that removed the genset involved: (1) installation and removal of gensets; and (2) mechanical repair to the refrigeration units on reefers. His expertise reasonably did not involve the proper storage locations for reefers in \"the stacks\" at a terminal operated by another entity. Moreover, even though storing a live export reefer in the stacks at VIG was \"unusual,\" the best interpretation of the factual record is that the MRS mechanic had\n   <em>\n    no duty\n   </em>\n   to stop performing his assigned function and question the VIT routing ticket in the busy genset install/removal lane where hundreds of reefers may be processed on a given day. Rather, the mechanic confirmed from the VIG ticket that genset removal was necessary in \"the lane,\" he removed the genset (presumably in a workmanlike manner), he documented his actions in written logs that can be used to verify the specific genset that was installed or removed and the specific inbound or outbound reefer container, and he reasonably presumed that VIT had performed, and would continue to perform, its roles in a workmanlike manner regarding the proper intake and handling of such Container (to include plugging it into shore power).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As evidenced by the trial testimony, the reefer mechanic's primary responsibility at VIG is to keep \"the line\" of trucks moving by installing a genset on every outbound truck departing with a live reefer, and removing a genset from any inbound truck with a VIG ticket indicating that such reefer was assigned to \"the stacks.\" While it is stipulated that the MRS mechanic both recognized that the Container was \"live,\" and powered down such reefer (as was necessary to remove the genset), he did so with the reasonable expectation that it would be powered back up by VIT shortly after it was taken to the stacks. Based on the evidence documenting the parties' course of dealing\n   <em>\n    at this terminal\n   </em>\n   , and MRS's limited control/supervision over reefers at VIG during the intake process, CMA fails to demonstrate that the scope of the services undertaken by MRS was sufficiently broad such that the warranty of workmanlike performance was breached by the MRS mechanic that removed the genset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2. MRS Foreman\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The MRS foreman was responsible for tracking, and performing twice daily monitoring, of live CMA reefers at VIG to ensure that such reefers continued to function properly and maintain the required temperature. While a closer call than the evaluation of the reefer mechanic's performance, the Court finds that CMA has not demonstrated that the MRS foreman failed to perform with the requisite level of diligence by failing to review logs associated with\n   <em>\n    a separate business function\n   </em>\n   (mounting/dismounting) in order to verify that VIT employees, and/or CMA employees, did not commit errors when performing their distinct obligations (booking, in-gate inspection, initial temperature check, plugging in live reefers). Rather, the better interpretation of the trial record is that MRS was hired to verify that: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   every CMA reefer that arrived (and remained) at VIG with a temperature requirement in its booking maintained the required temperature during storage; and (2) every CMA reefer parked in the reefer rows or powered reefer stack was accounted for and monitored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The fact that the MRS foreman was physically present at VIG does not establish that MRS failed to perform in a workmanlike manner because it did not cross-check records from one business function with records from the other. Notably, driven by CMA's booking error, VIT essentially \"reported\" to the MRS foreman through the SPARCS system that the Container at issue did\n   <em>\n    not need to be monitored\n   </em>\n   . As acknowledged by CMA, the applicable legal standard does not permit recovery if CMA's actions \"prevented or seriously handicapped [MRS] from performing its duties,\"\n   <em>\n    Heyman\n   </em>\n   , 1992 A.M.C. at 2657, and based on the scope of MRS's duties as established through course of dealing, CMA appears to have seriously handicapped MRS by causing the Container to be \"hidden\" in the unpowered stacks, an act that directly interfered with MRS's monitoring activities. Furthermore, CMA never told MRS about the need for the manual booking on October 27, 2016, and at least some individuals at CMA knew about the EDI server issues by the early afternoon on October 28, 2016; communication with MRS on that date could still have avoided the cargo loss. In sum, because MRS was not hired to perform \"intake\" functions beyond the manual process of removing gensets, MRS, through its foreman, performed with \"reasonable care, skill, and diligence\" based on the scope of the services MRS agreed to undertake.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Robbins Maritime\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7814247\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/906/309/#p314\">\n    906 F.Supp. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the reasons stated in detail herein, the Court finds that CMA fails to demonstrate that it is entitled to complete indemnity from MRS because: (1) the parties did not have a contractual relationship, or course of dealing, that expressly or impliedly provided for indemnity; (2) the implied \"\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   indemnity\" remedy available in a case where a maritime contractor violates the warranty of workmanlike performance is not applicable in the absence of a \"special relationship\" between the maritime contractor and a vessel or vessel owner; and (3) even if complete indemnity is an appropriate legal remedy when a shore-based container company violates the warranty of workmanlike performance, CMA fails to demonstrate that the warranty attached in this case, or that any such attached warranty was breached by MRS based on the case-specific evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Accordingly, the Clerk is\n   <strong>\n    INSTRUCTED\n   </strong>\n   to enter judgment in favor of MRS. The Clerk is further requested to send a copy of this Opinion and Order to all counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The footnotes in this section do not reflect stipulations but are instead clarifications offered by the Court based on the findings it makes as factfinder.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    It is undisputed that CMA America is an agent for CMA, and from this point forward, consistent with the parties' treatment of these entities in the stipulations, the Court refers to them collectively as CMA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The \"stacks\" are an area where reefer and non-reefer containers are stacked and stored by a large mechanical crane. A genset attached to a reefer would compromise VIT's ability to safely stack the container. Accordingly, a reefer assigned to the stacks must have its genset removed before it is taken to the stacks by a delivery driver. When proper procedures are followed, after genset removal, the reefer is stacked in a row\n    <em>\n     that has shore power\n    </em>\n    , and subsequent to stacking,\n    <em>\n     VIT personnel\n    </em>\n    manually connect the reefer to shore power. In addition to the stacks, which are an available but atypical place to store live export reefers, the \"reefer rows\" are an area of the terminal where live export reefers are typically delivered and parked. In the reefer rows, there is no \"stacking,\" but rather, the entire truck chassis is left behind with the reefer attached. Accordingly, a truck driver delivering a live reefer to an assigned spot in the reefer rows does not need to have the genset removed before the reefer/chassis is parked.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Had the Container been assigned to the reefer rows, the MRS mechanics would\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    have removed the genset\n    <em>\n     at that time\n    </em>\n    , but would instead have directed the driver to park the chassis in the assigned spot in the reefer rows. VIT personnel would then \"check\" the reefer's temperature and plug it into shore power located in the reefer rows. The MRS mechanics would come around and remove the gensets from the newly arrived reefer-row containers at the end of the day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Accordingly, the only remaining claim in this case is CMA's contention that it is entitled to complete indemnity from MRS for the settlement CMA paid to the original plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The primary factual disputes in this case center around whether it was appropriate for MRS to perform its monitoring services at VIG without cross-referencing the reefer receipt log created during genset install/removal. Favoring MRS is the fact that VIT, rather than MRS, was responsible for intake/plug-in of all reefers at VIG, calling into question whether MRS's duty to monitor was ever triggered. Favoring CMA is the fact that, largely by happenstance, a MRS employee at VIG had actual knowledge that the Container at issue was \"live\" when it arrived at VIG (although he lacked the knowledge that the Container would later be \"hidden\" in the stacks).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    For further context, the trial evidence established that equipment exists that can be mounted to a live reefer to allow real-time tracking of a container's temperature. CMA did not elect to pay for this equipment for the Container at issue. Similarly, while MRS \"could have\" discovered CMA/VIT's errors if it performed more robust monitoring services, including a cross-check of SPARCS data to data MRS happened across as part of its separate duty to remove/install gensets for all carriers, CMA failed to demonstrate that it had elected to pay MRS to perform such function over time. Stated a little differently, the trial record failed to demonstrate that the parties' course of dealing allocated such responsibility to MRS.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    In light of the parties' stipulation, the Court assumes that maritime law governs the dispute involving MRS's alleged failure to safeguard export cargo loaded into a maritime shipping container while such container was at the VIG terminal awaiting delivery to the stevedore.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wemhoener Pressen v.

Law \u00a7 5:15 (noting that, as a contract doctrine, the warranty is \"not fully applicable to towing contracts ... at least insofar as it conflicts with the admiralty rule imposing liability only for negligent conduct\"). It appears unjust, and unnecessary, to extend the complete indemnity remedy to all manner of maritime service contracts, particularly if such indemnity right is triggered by a standard that approaches strict liability.

Because VIT was responsible for intake/screening functions at VIG, if a container was rejected by VIT during intake based on a non-compliant temperature, MRS's duty to monitor such container would plainly never arise. Similarly, when VIT both fails to perform an initial temperature check, and in essence \"hides\" a live reefer from MRS by assigning it to the unpowered stacks, MRS is under no duty to monitor such container absent a more clearly defined \"course of dealing\" or written contract outlining such obligation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    CMA contends that MRS would have caught the booking error had its foreman at VIG simply reviewed the genset/container logs in MRS's possession.

As VIT was responsible for \"automating\" the VIG gating system, and was responsible for performing the initial screening of inbound live reefers, VIT was arguably the entity at VIG in the best position to catch CMA's booking error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The same reefer mechanics that removed gensets \"occasionally\" performed monitoring services; however, they only did so at the instruction of the MRS foreman, who was responsible for preparing the monitoring log and overseeing the monitoring activities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    To the extent that the above findings are insufficient to address any ongoing dispute regarding whether the parties' contract/course of dealing included an implied contractual agreement (untethered to\n    <em>\n     Ryan\n    </em>\n    ) that MRS would provide indemnity, the Court agrees with MRS that the there was no such contractual term.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    CMA did not present evidence seeking to demonstrate the proportion of damages it purportedly suffered as a result of MRS's alleged contractual breaches (as compared with the cargo damage caused by VIT and/or the stevedore's failure to ensure that the Container was plugged into vessel power).
