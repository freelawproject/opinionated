Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second Nature is licensed by the state of Utah as an \"Outdoor Youth Treatment\" program. R. 878. Utah also offers licensure as a \"Residential Treatment Program,\" which Second Nature has not obtained. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 16-17. Second Nature's website describes it as \"more than a wilderness program,\" and states that it offers weekly individual therapy sessions and\n   group therapy sessions during field days. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 17; R.A. 436-37. Second Nature also makes medical and \"support staff\" available 24/7. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 17; R.A. 439.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff submitted a claim for coverage under the Plan for the treatment she received at Second Nature from February 18, 2015, to May 26, 2015. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 28. The Plan provides that \"[i]npatient benefits ... will ... be provided for the diagnosis and/or Treatment of Inpatient Mental Illness in a Residential Treatment Center.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The Plan defines \"Residential Treatment Center\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [A] facility setting offering a defined course of therapeutic intervention and special programming in a controlled environment which also offers a degree of security, supervision, structure and is licensed by the appropriate state and local authority to provide such service.\n   <em>\n    It does not include half-way houses, supervised living, group homes, wilderness programs, boarding houses or other facilities that provide primarily a supportive environment and address long term social needs, even if counseling is provided in such facilities\n   </em>\n   .

The facility was contacted and staff there confirmed Second Nature Therapeutic is not licensed as [a] Residential Treatment Facility.

Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Second Nature qualifies as a \"residential treatment center\" (\"RTC\") as defined by the Plan, despite the Plan's exclusion for \"wilderness programs.\" Plaintiff further contends that, to the extent Second Nature is excluded as a wilderness program, that exclusion violates the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Act of 2008 (\"the Parity Act\"), Pub. L. No. 110-343,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%203765\">\n    122 Stat. 3765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185a ), as well as Illinois's corresponding statute providing for mental health and addiction parity, 215 Ill.

Pl.'s Mem. Supp. at 8, ECF No. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant in turn contends that Plaintiff's reading of the clause violates the \"last antecedent rule,\" and that the phrase \"provide primarily a supportive environment and address long term social needs\" describes only the \"other facilities\" excluded under the Plan. Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 12, ECF No. 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Both parties are half right. The last antecedent rule provides that \"[r]elative and qualifying phrases, grammatically and legally, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent.\"\n   <em>\n    Shelby Cty.

Accordingly, under a plain reading of the Plan's terms, \"provide primarily a supportive environment and address long term social needs\" modifies \"other facilities,\" not \"wilderness programs.\" But Defendant ignores other relevant principles of contract interpretation, such as the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   refers to the principle that \"when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.\"\n   <em>\n    Ali v.

A significant limitation in relying on this case law, however, is the varying language used in the respective plans. Because each contract must be interpreted according to its own terms, the results of these cases are, predictably, all over the map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to this Plan, the Court concludes that there is no Parity Act problem. Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, wilderness programs do not include programs that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be considered RTCs but for their location. Instead, as explained earlier, RTCs are defined as one type of program, offering therapeutic intervention in a controlled environment, medical monitoring, and 24-hour onsite nursing. By contrast, wilderness programs offer a different service providing merely a supportive environment and methods to address social needs. Accordingly, there is no geographic limitation on RTCs that is not present in the Plan's coverage of SNFs. Rather, as previously explained, \"[t]he citation to wilderness programs here serve[s] as a mere illustration of a treatment that does not meet\" the definition of an RTC under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    Welp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203263138\">\n    2017 WL 3263138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529965\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/363/834/\">\n    363 F.Supp.3d at 841-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20340471\">\n    2019 WL 340471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (concluding that the plaintiff had failed to plead a Parity Act violation because the plan equally covered RTCs and SNFs, but did not cover \"wilderness programs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Of course, defining RTCs to exclude the types of services offered by wilderness programs could still violate the Parity Act if similar services were not also excluded from medical care under the Plan. But here, the Plan makes clear that it does not cover admission to SNFs \"for the primary purposes of providing Custodial Care Service, convalescent care, rest cures or domiciliary care\"; nor does the Plan cover \"[t]he use of skilled or private duty nurses to assist in daily living activities, routine supportive care or to provide services for the convenience of the patient and/or his family members.\" Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 30. Accordingly, under the Plan, neither SNFs nor RTCs cover services that are primarily supportive in nature as opposed to necessary to treat a medical or mental health issue. The Court concludes that these definitions are in parity.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.G.\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20340471\">\n    2019 WL 340471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 ;\n   <em>\n    Michael P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204011153\">\n    2017 WL 4011153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (noting that some differences between mental healthcare and medical care can be tolerated under the Parity Act where \"the difference in requirements is not necessarily an improper limitation on mental health care, but recognition of the inherent difference in treatment at [different] facilities\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Plan in this case is distinguishable from those in cases that have found Parity Act violations.

Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 22. Plaintiff's diagnoses upon her admission included ADHD, PTSD, cannabis use disorder, major depressive disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and borderline personality disorder traits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. While at Vista, Plaintiff received individual, family, and group therapy on an intensive basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. She was also prescribed Pristiq for anxiety and depression, and Vyvanse for ADHD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After Plaintiff was admitted to Vista, Defendant undertook regular reviews of the \"medical necessity\" of her treatment there. Under the Plan, Defendant covers only hospitalization or healthcare services that are \"medically necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The Plan states that \"Medically Necessary\" means \"a specific medical, health care, supply or Hospital service is required, for the treatment or management of a medical symptom or condition and that the service, supply or care provided is the most efficient and economical service which can safely be provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.

Def.'s SOF \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In making the medical necessity determination, Defendant may apply the Milliman Care Guidelines (among other guidelines and policies).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The Milliman Care Guidelines provide that residential care is no longer needed if (1) the patient has not made a suicide attempt or act of serious self-harm, and has no suicidal or homicidal thoughts; (2) the patient understands follow-up treatment and can participate in monitoring; (3) the provider and \"supports\" are available at a lower level of care; (4) no essential function is impaired or cannot be managed at a lower level of care; and (5) the patient's medical needs are absent or manageable at a lower level of care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant first determined that Plaintiff's treatment at Vista was medically necessary on June 1, 2015, and approved benefits at that time for May 26 to June 9. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 21. Defendant went on to determine that Plaintiff's treatment was medically necessary for short periods again on June 9, June 15, June 25, July 6, July 8, and July 22.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 26-27, 30. Reviews typically noted that Plaintiff met the Milliman Care Guidelines based on a variant of the following factors: (1) treatment at the \"highest non-residential level of care has failed and/or is not feasible without acute intervention or modification\"; (2) Plaintiff had a history of self-harm; (3) Plaintiff manifested poor impulse control, lying, stealing from peers, and stealing from stores; and (4) Plaintiff had manifested a decrease in functioning, poor school and home functioning, stealing from peers, and a need for additional \"family work.\" R. 2006, 2007-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On the last of these occasions-July 22, 2015-the initial reviewer, Heather Toby, concluded that Plaintiff did not meet the Milliman Care Guidelines for continued care at Vista. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 30. Toby \"escalated\" the review to a physician, Dr. Webster, who determined that treatment was medically necessary for another seven days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Webster stated that, although Plaintiff had \"made some progress since admission,\" she still had \"behaviours [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] that would make it difficult for her to function in a longer term placement such as a therapeutic boarding school.\" R. 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff's treatment was again found medically necessary on July 29, August 6, August 12, and August 19.

Finding of No Medical Necessity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On August 31, 2015, Toby again concluded that treatment at Vista was no longer medically necessary. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 38. She determined that Plaintiff no longer met the Milliman Care Guidelines because (1) Plaintiff denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and psychosis, and (2) she had \"improving insight, judgment and impulse control,\" as well as an \"increase in overall functioning and ... a more stable mood.\" R. 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On September 1, Dr. Rasik Lal concurred with Toby's findings. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 39. Dr. Lal noted that Plaintiff recently had a positive visit with her parents, had not stolen anything, had no \"major incidents,\" and was listening to staff and following directions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. He further noted that Plaintiff denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and psychosis, and that her mood was \"stable\" and \"pleasant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Lal stated that Plaintiff's judgment, insight, and impulse control were improving, and that Plaintiff's parents were \"supportive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Lal omitted, however, the opinion of Vista counselor Toni Mazzaglia that \"[Plaintiff] would be at high risk if she were to return home.\" Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant then concluded that treatment at Vista was no longer medically necessary as of September 1, 2015, and communicated that finding to Plaintiff in a letter the same day. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 42. The letter explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   There was no report of psychosis or mania. You were not reported as being a[ ] danger to self or others. There was no evidence of inability to adequately care for yourself with functioning in multiple sphere areas. You were not reported as being aggressive or threatening.

Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 37, 50, 60. And on May 3, 2016, Defendant sought the opinion of Dr. Timothy Stock, the Medical Director for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. Dr. Stock agreed with Dr. Lal's determination that Plaintiff's treatment at Vista was no longer medically necessary as of September 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 4, 2016, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff explaining its conclusion that she did not meet the Milliman Care Guidelines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   On the dates in question you were not an acute danger to yourself. You were not an acute danger to others. You were not behaviorally dyscontrolled. You were tolerating medication. You were medically stable. You were not reported to be psychotic.

From the clinical evidence presented, you could have been safely treated at the MENTAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT level of care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Plaintiff appealed the determination again, but Defendant upheld its determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Non-Covered Period (September 1, 2015 to May 16, 2015)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff remained at Vista for eight more months after Defendant's finding that her stay there was not medically necessary. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 25. The parties dispute whether or not the evidence during this period shows that Plaintiff continued to meet the Milliman Care Guidelines for residential care. Defendant focuses on evidence showing Plaintiff's relative improvement, and on statements made in certain clinical notes that she presented \"no identifiable risk.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 45-50. Plaintiff, by contrast, points to statements made in other clinical notes that she presented a \"high risk outside of [a] controlled environment.\" Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. She further points to evidence that her improvement was limited and that her behavioral problems recurred throughout her time at Vista.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at SOF \u00b6\u00b6 51-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court finds the parties' focus on the \"risk assessments\" in the clinical notes almost entirely unhelpful. Contrary to Defendant's assertion that the \"vast majority of Plaintiff's risk assessment status reports indicate[d] Plaintiff had 'no identifiable risk,' \" the Court finds a roughly equal amount of \"no identifiable risk\" findings compared to \"high risk\" findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both risk assessments made the day Plaintiff's coverage ended were for \"high risk.\" R. 6905, 6907. Furthermore, throughout her stay, Plaintiff would be described variously as \"no risk\" or \"high risk\" within a matter of days; in fact, on November 24, 2015, counselors made opposite findings on\n   <em>\n    the same day\n   </em>\n   . R. 6761, 6756. Moreover, the counselors' risk assessments seemingly bear little relation to what was discussed during the sessions. Frequently, counselors reported that Plaintiff presented \"no risk\" but stated that her behavior and emotions were still struggling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But just as frequently, a \"high risk\" finding corresponded with notes of progress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court accords little weight to the \"risk assessments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant points to other evidence purporting to show Plaintiff's improvement while at Vista, but misstates the significance of some of these facts. For instance, Defendant points to a \"weekly academic update\" that begins: \"Girls Team: No Red Flags, woohoo!\" R. 6898. Defendant suggests that this means Plaintiff was exhibiting no \"red flag\" behaviors. But a review of other similar academic updates shows that each one begins with a listing of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   girl on the \"girls team\" who was considered to be on \"red flag\" status in a particular academic subject.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 6688. Defendant does not clarify why the mere fact that Plaintiff was not flagged in an academic subject means that she was no\n   longer suffering from problems requiring residential care. In fact, the same academic update Defendant points to explains that Plaintiff had \"low test scores,\" was not doing \"very well getting her work in,\" and had turned in an assignment \"to avoid the red flag list.\" R. 6898. Her school work fluctuated after that point, and on October 19, she was put on the \"red flag\" list for math, with her teacher noting that she needed support in prioritizing. R. 6822;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 6772.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff points to further evidence that she continued to struggle past September 1 with the issues for which she entered Vista. For instance, on September 16, Plaintiff's counselor noted that she had recently lied to peers and was not able to be honest about it until confronted; furthermore, although she was \"creating new habits and patterns,\" the \"old ones [were] still present.\" R. 6881. Counselors continued to note Plaintiff's lying, manipulating, impulse control issues, and \"sneaky behaviors\" throughout her time at Vista.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6630, 6633, 6664, 6688-89, 6695, 6697, 6777, 6816, 6822, 6840, 6859, 6877. Additionally, although her depression and anxiety improved somewhat, in October she reported that her depression was still at a 5 out of 10, and her psychiatrist accordingly increased her depression medication. R. 6830. Plaintiff also continued struggling to be open and vulnerable about her experiences; in particular, she used her later time at Vista to work through the difficult process of opening up about sexual trauma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6667, 6672, 6765, 6777, 6815, 6829. Plaintiff also continued to \"self-sabotage\" throughout her time at Vista.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6620-21, 6627.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Although there is evidence of some improvement and good days,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 1233, 1245, 1346, 6675, 6709-10, 6716, 6724, 6741, 6753, 6793, 6819, 6872, 6893, the Court finds that this evidence is significantly outweighed by the evidence of Plaintiff's substantial ongoing issues. First, these good days and moments of improvement were often treated by Plaintiff and her counselors as being temporary.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 1245 (\"[Plaintiff] discussed her recent positive trend.\"); 6675 (\"[Plaintiff] stated she feels she is in an upswing with her mood, and honesty with herself.\"). Second, the mere incidence of some improvement does not mean treatment was no longer medically necessary. For instance, just because Plaintiff reported having a positive time with her parents on September 1,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 6905, does not mean that her parent-child issues no longer necessitated the same level of care. Rather, she continued to have difficulty interacting with her parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6810, 6859. Similarly, just because Plaintiff had not lied or stolen immediately prior to September 1 does not mean that her impulse control issues were drastically improved; she went on to experience later cycles of the same behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6633, 6689, 6822, 6877, 6881, 6900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Significantly, many of the behaviors and problems Plaintiff continued to experience after September 1 are the same as those that caused Defendant initially to declare her treatment at Vista medically necessary. For example, Defendant stated that Vista treatment was necessary because of Plaintiff's manifestation of poor impulse control, lying, and stealing; as already described, Plaintiff continued to experience these issues after September 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6630, 6633, 6664, 6688-89, 6695, 6697, 6777, 6816, 6822, 6740, 6859, 6877, 6881, 6900. Similarly, Defendant considered Plaintiff's treatment necessary because of her poor school and home functioning and need for additional \"family work\"; these needs did not cease to exist on September 1 either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 6772, 6810, 6822, 6859. And Defendant further stated that treatment at Vista was necessary because treatment at the highest level of non-residential care had previously failed and Plaintiff had a history\n   of self-harm; this continued to be true. Accordingly, several of Defendant's reasons for denying further coverage-that she had improved insight, judgment, and impulse control; that she had a positive visit with her parents; and so forth-do not present a complete picture of Plaintiff's status after September 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   More troubling is the fact that many of the reasons Defendant gave for eventually finding Plaintiff's treatment not medically necessary are essentially unrelated to Plaintiff's treatment needs. Defendant, in denying coverage, noted that Plaintiff denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and psychosis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 2005, but none of these was noted as an issue necessitating treatment to begin with. Similarly, although Plaintiff was reported to be listening to staff and following directions and to have a \"stable mood,\" Def.'s SOF \u00b6 41, it is not clear why those facts would mean that Plaintiff's depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, or ADHD were significantly improved. Along these same lines, the fact that Plaintiff was not \"aggressive or threatening,\" had not been reported medically unstable, and was not an \"acute danger to others\" are entirely unresponsive to Plaintiff's original reasons for seeking treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court is cognizant of the fact that it is not reviewing the decisions made by Defendant's claims administrators\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . Still, Defendant's own evaluation of Plaintiff's medical needs under the Milliman Care Guidelines when she arrived at Vista deserves a great deal of weight with regard to the extent of her\n   <em>\n    later\n   </em>\n   medical needs under those same guidelines. Plaintiff has shown that the same factors that caused her to need Vista treatment initially continued beyond September 1, 2015. Although she may have had a good day on August 31 or September 1, and although she had other good days and good clinical sessions later, this does not prove that her conditions improved to such a degree that she could be effectively treated at a lower level of care. What is more, it cannot be ignored that whatever improvement Plaintiff was able to achieve, she did so by participating in intensive, round-the-clock therapy and residential care; accordingly, it sheds little light on how she would respond to outpatient care, particularly given her limited improvement and the recurrence of negative behaviors and emotions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The weight of the evidence shows that, by the time she was discharged from Vista, Plaintiff had made some strides in terms of recognizing and communicating about her issues, but continued to experience struggles with depression and inappropriate behaviors, and required ongoing structure and support. R. 2194-96. Plaintiff's progress in therapy shows that she had begun learning coping and communication skills, but not that her psychological or educational needs were significantly reduced. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met her burden to prove that her needs could not have been managed at a lower level of care, and that she met the Milliman Care Guidelines for residential care from September 1, 2015, to May 15, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Thus, Plaintiff's treatment during that time was \"medically necessary\" under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the Court holds that Plaintiff's treatment at Vista was \"medically necessary\" under the Plan, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is entitled to recover unpaid benefits for the period from September 1, 2015, to May 15, 2016, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiff asserts that she paid approximately $90,880.00 out of pocket for her care at Vista from September 1, 2015, to May 15, 2016. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 64.

This standard is obviously met, as the Court has concluded that Defendants wrongly withheld benefits for a period of eight and a half months of residential treatment. But the inquiry does not stop there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court also must decide whether the non-prevailing party's position was substantially justified and taken in good faith, or whether it was intended to harass Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herman v. Cent. States, Se. &amp; Sw. Areas Pens.

Here, the Court finds that Defendant's position, although non-meritorious, was substantially justified. The question of Plaintiff's eligibility\n   for residential care was primarily a factual one, and there were some facts, including physicians' opinions, pointing in Defendant's favor. There is no evidence that Defendant intended to harass Plaintiff or that it denied benefits in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For the reasons provided, the Court grants in part and denies in part the parties' Rule 52 motions. The Court finds in favor of Defendant as to Plaintiff's claim for coverage of her stay at Second Nature. The Court further finds in favor of Plaintiff as to her claim for coverage of her stay at Vista Residential Treatment Center from September 1, 2015, to May 15, 2016. The Court directs the parties to meet and confer regarding the amount of back payments owed for this period and the amount of prejudgment interest. The parties should file a status report by April 1, 2019 reflecting their agreement as to these amounts. If the parties cannot agree, Plaintiff may file a motion, accompanied by a brief of no more than 7 pages, by April 8, 2019, seeking to have the Court determine the amounts. Defendant's response to the motion will be due by April 22, 2019, and will be limited to 7 pages as well.
