No other state's system comes close. ASORCNA applies to adult offenders no matter when or where they were convicted. It bans them from living or working within 2,000 feet of a school or daycare, even if the offender never harmed a child. Between 10:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., no offender can be in the same house as a minor niece or nephew - not even for a minute. An offender's driver's license is branded with \"CRIMINAL SEX OFFENDER\" in bold, red letters. Offenders must report lawful internet activity - such as connecting to the Wi-Fi at a new McDonald's, or anonymously commenting on a news article - to the police. Even a minor violation of any of these provisions may result in years behind bars. And unless a narrow exception somehow applies, offenders must comply with ASORCNA for life.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    Ala.

That is a compelling state interest. But sex offenders are not second-class citizens. The Constitution protects their liberty and dignity just as it protects everyone else's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about whether certain ASORCNA provisions violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs are five registered sex offenders covered by ASORCNA. Their claims are before the court on cross-motions for summary judgment. (Docs. # 139, 147, 154.) For the reasons below, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their First Amendment claims. The branded-identification requirement unnecessarily compels speech. The internet-use reporting requirements also go too far, chilling free speech. But the State of Alabama is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claims. Though Plaintiffs have made several good legal arguments, one Fourteenth Amendment claim fails on the merits, and Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ASORCNA is a comprehensive statute that severely limits how sex offenders live their lives. It brings together most of the restrictive features used by other states, adds new restrictions, and punishes minor violations with years in prison. Plaintiffs John Doe 1, John Doe 3, John Doe 7, John Doe 9, and John Doe 10 are registered sex offenders who must comply with ASORCNA. Their hopscotch numbering reflects that other plaintiffs have been dropped from this case during the three years of litigation. Defendants are state officials charged with implementing and enforcing ASORCNA. Because Defendants are sued in their official capacities, however, the court refers to them collectively as \"the State of Alabama\" or \"the State.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Challenged Statutory Provisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State of Alabama enacted its first sex-offender statute over five decades ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ala. Act No. 1967-507. That law merely required offenders to submit their name to their county sheriff,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341228\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1336/#p1345\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1, and only law enforcement could access that roster,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341228\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1336/#p1345\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2. But over the years, Alabama has repeatedly amended its sex-offender laws to make them broader and more restrictive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGuire v.

Doe 1 served a six-month suspended sentence for each charge. He did not have to register as a sex offender in Wisconsin. Nor did he have to register when he moved to Alabama in 1994. It was only in 2008 that Alabama forced Doe 1 to register. Since then, he has twice been convicted of violating ASORCNA: once for failing to report a change of address, and once for redacting his branded identification. (Doc. # 138, at 8-9, 22, 32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   John Doe 3 was convicted of murder in 1968. He was thirteen. In 1985, while in prison, he pleaded guilty to first-degree sodomy of another adult inmate. Doe 3 registered as a sex offender upon his release from prison in 2010. He has committed no crimes since his release. (Doc. # 138, at 10; Doc. # 156-1, at 4-5, 25.) Doe 3 has a close relationship with his adult niece. That niece invited Doe 3 to live with her, but he cannot do so for two reasons. First, his niece lives within 2,000 feet of both a school and a childcare facility. Second, his niece's thirteen-year-old son and one-year-old grandson live with her. (Docs. # 140-1, 156-2, 156-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   John Doe 7 pleaded guilty to second-degree sodomy of an adult jail inmate in 1987. He registered as a sex offender upon his release from prison in 2011. In 2015, he was convicted of violating ASORCNA's residency restrictions. In 2018, he was charged with two more residency violations. (Doc. # 138, at 11-12, 24-25; Doc. # 150-7; Doc. # 156-4, at 4-5, 29.) When he was released from prison in 2011, Doe 7 had planned to live with his sister, but she lives within 2,000 feet of a school. His sister's granddaughter (age five) and great-granddaughter (age eight) also live with her several nights a week. (Docs. # 140-2, 156-6.) Doe 7 has a close relationship with his niece, and she is willing to let Doe 7 live with her. But her home is within 2,000 feet of two childcare facilities, and her four-year-old daughter lives with her. (Docs. # 140-3, 140-4, 156-3, 156-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   John Doe 9 was convicted of sexual battery of an adult female in 2005. He registered as a sex offender in Alabama in 2006. (Doc. # 138, at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   John Doe 10 pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor, in 1990. He registered as a sex offender at that time. In 2009, he went to Kansas for a year-long drug-treatment program. When he returned home to Alabama, he was convicted of failing to report that he moved to Kansas. (Doc. # 138, at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in August 2015. (Doc. # 1.) They filed amended complaints in November 2015 and August 2016. (Docs. # 39, 81.) The State moved to dismiss both the first amended complaint and the second amended complaint. (Docs. # 43, 87.) Those motions were granted in part and denied in part. (Docs. # 51, 125.) In April 2018, Plaintiffs moved for leave to supplement their second amended complaint. (Doc. # 132.) That motion was largely denied, though Plaintiffs were allowed to make a small addition to one claim. (Doc. # 137.) As things stand now, Plaintiffs have four operative claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Count One argues that the minor-cohabitation rule violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is an as-applied challenge brought by Doe 3 and Doe 7, who claim the rule deprives them of their fundamental right to associate with their family. (Doc. # 81, at 45; Doc. # 138, at 46.) They previously challenged the 2,000-foot exclusion zone under the same family association theory, but that part of Count One was dismissed in 2016. (Doc. # 51, at 31-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Count Three claims the residency and employment restrictions are facially void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause. All five Plaintiffs bring this claim. (Doc. # 81, at 48; Doc. # 138, at 46.) The supplemental second amended complaint lists a vagueness challenge to reporting requirements (Doc. # 138, at 47), but that claim was dismissed (Doc. # 125, at 29), and leave to amend was not granted (Doc. # 137, at 8-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Counts Four and Five raise First Amendment claims. Count Four is an as-applied challenge to ASORCNA's branded-identification requirement as applied by the State. According to Plaintiffs, that requirement compels speech in violation of the First Amendment. (Doc. # 81, at 49; Doc. # 138, at 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Count Five is a First Amendment overbreadth challenge to the internet-use reporting requirements. Plaintiffs claim those reporting requirements unduly chill free speech. (Doc. # 81, at 50; Doc. # 138, at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Now before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment on all counts. (Docs. # 139, 147, 154.) Each side has filed three briefs and several exhibits. (Docs. # 140, 149, 155, 158, 159, 161.) The issues are ripe for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their claims that the branded-identification and internet-use reporting requirements violate the First Amendment. The court has already held that Plaintiffs have a cause of action on which relief may be granted. (Doc. # 51, at 43-48; Doc. # 125, at 33-49.) Undisputed material facts now show that Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But the State is entitled to summary judgment on the Fourteenth Amendment claims. Though the court found before that Plaintiffs alleged valid claims under the Fourteenth Amendment (Doc. # 51, at 21-28, 33-40; Doc. # 125, at 17-20, 24-32), the facts in discovery do not bear out those claims. Doe 3 and Doe 7 lack standing to challenge the minor-cohabitation rule because the relatives they want to live with also live within 2,000 feet of schools and childcare facilities. As for the employment exclusion zones, Plaintiffs have not been affected by any vagueness in that part of the statute. Some Plaintiffs are disabled, and others concede that desired jobs are within an exclusion zone. Finally, Plaintiffs fail to trace arbitrary enforcement of the residency restrictions to any vagueness in the text of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their First Amendment claims.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The First Amendment prohibits governments from \"abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const. amend.

The issue in\n   <em>\n    Wooley\n   </em>\n   was that New Hampshire printed its motto, \"Live Free or Die,\" on most license plates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 707 &amp; n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p714\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . George Maynard disagreed with that ideological message. The Court held that it was unconstitutional to force Maynard and others to use their cars to propagate the state's message. More specifically, New Hampshire's license plate law compelled speech, and the state had no compelling interest in doing so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p714\">\n    at 715-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p714\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Wooley\n   </em>\n   and its progeny to argue that printing \"CRIMINAL SEX OFFENDER\" on state-issued identification cards is unconstitutional. Plaintiffs are correct. The branded-ID requirement compels speech, and it is not the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling state interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The branded-identification requirement compels speech.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The first step in a\n   <em>\n    Wooley\n   </em>\n   -style analysis is to determine whether the state has, in fact, compelled speech. This is a four-part test. There must be (1) speech; (2) to which the plaintiff objects; (3) that is compelled; and (4) that is readily associated with the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Cressman v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333088\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/938/#p949\">\n    798 F.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949-51 (10th Cir. 2015). All four elements are satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, just as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Wooley\n   </em>\n   \"had no trouble\" finding that \"Live Free or Die\" was speech, neither does this court have trouble finding that \"CRIMINAL SEX OFFENDER\" is speech.\n   <em>\n    Cressman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333088\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/938/#p949\">\n    798 F.3d at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The State tries to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Wooley\n   </em>\n   as a case about ideological speech. Yet the words here call to mind philosophical and moral messages about crime, victims, retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation. And even if they did not - even if the words here were purely factual with no ideological implications - the compelled speech doctrine would still apply. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

But that argument has several flaws. One is that it incorrectly assumes the Act applies only to \"sexual predators.\" Not every offender is a \"predator,\" and the State poisons the well by implying otherwise. Another flaw is that it assumes one must report several times before reporting is a burden. In reality, offenders experience a burden each time they must report their online activity.

There is no objective limiting principle to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The sheriff of one county could require offenders to report in-person each time they create a new online identifier, while the sheriff of a neighboring county could let offenders report such changes over the phone. Indeed, nothing keeps police officers from requiring one offender to report in-person while allowing others to report over the phone.

Yet every offender must report when they connect to a new Wi-Fi spot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The failure to account for risk is a problem throughout ASORCNA. Not all sex crimes are the same. Nor are all offenders the same. Instead, as Dr. Karl Hanson explains (Docs. # 159-1, 159-2, 159-3), one can classify sex offenders based on their risk of committing another sex offense (\"sexual recidivism\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some offenders have a low risk of sexual recidivism; others have a medium or a high risk. Also, the older someone gets, and the longer they go without committing a new crime, the less likely they are to reoffend. At a certain point, \"most individuals convicted of a sexual offense will be no more likely to commit another sexual offense than the rate of spontaneous 'out-of-the-blue' sexual offenses in the general population.\" (Doc. # 159-1, at 5.) Low-risk offenders cross that threshold upon release from prison. Medium-risk offenders cross it ten to fifteen years later. Even high-risk offenders, after twenty years offense-free, pose no more of a threat to the public than does the average man walking down the street.

(Doc. # 125, at 24-28.) That was for three reasons.

Finally, offenders are criminally liable only if they \"knowingly\" violate the rules.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    Ala.

The court granted leave to supplement the complaint, but it did not judge the merits of Plaintiffs' addition. (Doc. # 137, at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 125, at 28 n.13.) The court now finds that any arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement does not result from vagueness in ASORCNA's text. The State is thus entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that two phrases in ASORCNA's legislative findings lead to arbitrary enforcement. One is a statement that offenders have a \"reduced expectation of privacy,\" and the other is a reference to \"monitoring and tracking\" offenders.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -20A-2(1), (5). But those phrases do not prescribe or proscribe anything. Consider the context of the legislative findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Sex offenders, due to the nature of their offenses, have a reduced expectation of privacy. In balancing the sex offender's rights, and the interest of public safety, the Legislature finds that releasing certain information to the public furthers the primary governmental interest of protecting vulnerable populations, particularly children. Employment and residence restrictions, together with monitoring and tracking, also further that interest. The Legislature declares that its intent in imposing certain registration, notification, monitoring, and tracking requirements on sex offenders is not to punish sex offenders but to protect the public and, most importantly, promote child safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-20A-2(5). The phrase \"reduced expectation of privacy\" does not invite law enforcement to violate constitutional rights; it is a justification for publishing an offender's personal information online. And because offenders must report where they live, work, and travel, they are indeed monitored and tracked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiffs point out that local police conduct \"home checks\" to see if offenders live at their reported address. Home checks are unannounced and warrantless. (Doc. # 150-1, at 5, 7-8; Doc. # 150-2, at 4, 8; Doc. # 150-3, at 4, 17.) At least one police officer uses the Act's reference to a \"reduced expectation of privacy\" to justify home checks. (Doc. # 150-1, at 5.) And during home checks, officers sometimes violate the Fourth Amendment, demand that offenders prove their residence by producing mail or clothing, and treat lawful behavior as evidence of wrongdoing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 150-1, 150-2, 150-3, 150-4, 150-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiffs try to turn these problems into evidence of vagueness, arguing that ASORCNA does not \"provide clear guidance as to the boundaries under which law enforcement shall conduct themselves.\" (Doc. # 149, at 5.) That misses the point. The vagueness doctrine is concerned with ambiguity in what a law prohibits. It does not require statutes to lay out how police officers may (or may not) investigate potential violations. The problems raised by home checks are \"addressed, not by the doctrine of vagueness, but by the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p304\">\n    553 U.S. at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p304\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and by the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiffs present evidence that four offenders (each of whom committed offenses against minors) live at noncompliant addresses even though Plaintiffs (none of whom committed offenses against minors) cannot live in exclusion zones. The court refers to the offenders living at noncompliant addresses by their initials: J.B. (Doc. # 150-2, at 39-41, 50; Doc. # 150-9); T.D. (Doc. # 150-1, at 13-14; Doc. # 150-2, at 14-15, 38); F.W. (Doc. # 150-2, at 56); and H.B. (Doc. # 150-2, at 57; Doc. # 150-10; Doc. # 150-14). But the evidence about J.B., T.D., F.W., and H.B. does not show that the residency restrictions are vague. Plaintiffs' attorney deposed police officers responsible for enforcing the law against those four men. Counsel asked whether J.B., T.D., F.W., and H.B. should have been allowed to live at noncompliant addresses. The officers admitted they should not have been allowed to live at noncompliant addresses. (Doc. # 150-1, at 14, 17, 19; Doc. # 150-2, at 18-20; Doc. # 150-11, at 6.) That police officers made mistakes does not mean that the law is vague.

The police explained that his chosen address was \"approx. 850 feet\" from an elementary school. (Doc. # 150-13.) In fact, the house is 750 feet from the school. (Doc. # 150-10, at 3.)

He instead argues that, based on the facts of his case, he never violated the residency restrictions. That is not an appropriate argument for a facial vagueness challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla. Businessmen for Free Enter. v.

The court previously allowed their claim to proceed, stating that \"registrants can only guess at whether their place of employment falls within a zone of exclusion\" and that \"the employment restriction remains confoundingly opaque.\" (Doc. # 125, at 28-29.) That was at the motion to dismiss stage, however. On summary judgment, Plaintiffs must back up\n   their claims with evidence. But Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that they ever had to guess whether a potential employer was in an exclusion zone. There is no evidence that Plaintiffs cannot tell what the law requires. Most Plaintiffs are disabled. And there is no evidence at all about Doe 1's employment status. The State is therefore entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Only three Plaintiffs - Doe 3, Doe 7, and Doe 9 - describe their attempts to find jobs.

But rather than state that he was not sure whether the shops were ASORCNA-compliant, he testified that the shops turned him away because of his branded identification.

That statement implies Doe 7 turns down jobs because he knows some construction sites are within 2,000 feet of a school or childcare facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his deposition, Doe 7 does not even mention the employment exclusion zones. Instead, he says that he was turned down for a job when the employer saw his branded identification. (Doc. # 156-4, at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, Doe 9 alleges that \"ASORCNA prohibits [him] from working in the vast majority of businesses in his hometown because of the employment zones of exclusion.\" (Doc. # 138, at 31.) Once again, this shows that the exclusion zones are not vague as applied to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   There is another problem with Plaintiffs' vagueness claim: Doe 3, Doe 7, and Doe 10 are disabled and receive Social Security disability payments. Doe 3 admits that disability payments are his sole source of income, that he proved he was physically unable to work to get those payments, and that he does not foresee his condition improving enough to obtain work. (Doc. # 156-1, at 7-8.) Doe 7 likewise admits that he proved he was physically unable to work and that he does not foresee his condition improving enough to work \"in the near future.\" (Doc. # 156-4, at 7.) The only evidence about Doe 10's employment status is that he \"is disabled\" and receives disability payments. (Doc. # 138, at 15.) Doe 3 does claim he can work as an auto body painter and that he would accept reduced disability benefits if he could work. (Doc. # 156-1, at 14.) Doe 7 also testifies that he cleans construction sites one or two days a week. (Doc. # 156-4, at 12.) But as explained above, those facts do not allow Plaintiffs to bring a vagueness challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Finally, the complaint alleges that some offenders are allowed to work in exclusion zones, even if their crimes were against children. (Doc. # 138, at 42-43.) But there is no evidence supporting that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   There is no way to tell if it is based on personal knowledge. And again, one \"who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306266\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/489/#p495\">\n    455 U.S. at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306266\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/489/#p495\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Di Pietro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711674\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1369/#p1372\">\n    615 F.3d at 1372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   None of this is to say that ASORCNA's employment restrictions are clear in every respect. The statute still lacks a preapproval process. It still does not address what happens when a worker makes a service call, performs intermittent work at different sites across town, or drives a car for a living.

(Doc. # 156-8, at 8-9.) But Dr. Scurich describes those who, by definition, have more than one victim. \"Instead of concluding that 1-in-10 individuals with a history of sexual crime will offend against both adults and children, the studies reviewed by Dr. Scurich actually state that\n    <em>\n     if the individuals were to reoffend sexually\n    </em>\n    , there is a 1-in-10 chance that it would be against a victim in a different age category.\" (Doc. # 159-3, at 2.)
