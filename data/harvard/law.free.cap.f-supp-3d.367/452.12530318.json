Brown, II's (\"Defendant Brown\") Motions to Dismiss. (ECF Nos. 81, 101.) Defendant Hynie's Motion was filed on September 11, 2018, while Defendant Brown's Motion was filed on August 10, 2018. (ECF Nos. 81, 101.) Within their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs Deanna Brown-Thomas, Yamma Brown, Michael D. Brown, Jeanette Mitchell Bellinger, Sarah LaTonya Fegan, Ciara Pettit, and Cherquarius Williams's (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") Complaint (ECF No. 1) must be dismissed for insufficient service of process under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5). (ECF No. 81 at 20; ECF No. 101 at 13.) The court held arguments on this matter on January 22, 2019. (ECF No. 144.) For the reasons stated herein, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Hynie's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 81) and Defendant Brown's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 101), both under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5). However, the court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs to properly serve Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention and laws of the United Kingdom within one hundred twenty (120) days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   James J. Brown (\"James Brown\") was an American singer that was born in Barnwell, South Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harry Weinger &amp; Cliff White,\n   <em>\n    Biography About James\n   </em>\n   , JAMES BROWN , http://www.jamesbrown.com/bio (last visited Jan. 20, 2019).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He married Defendant Hynie in December 2001. (ECF No. 1 at 10 \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Through the union of Defendant Hynie and James Brown, Defendant Brown was born in 2001. (ECF No. 81 at 10.) On the morning of December 25, 2006, James Brown died. (ECF No. 1 at 3 \u00b6 7.) James Brown's will omitted Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 \u00b6 41.) In 2007, Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown brought challenges to James Brown's will and trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 \u00b6 42.) Defendant Hynie filed for her spousal rights in South Carolina, which would have entitled her to a statutory elective share and a one-half omitted spouse's share, while Defendant Brown asserted his state statutory child share as a lawful heir. (ECF No. 80-1 at 3.) James Brown's adult children also brought challenges to set aside his will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886564\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/403/411/\">\n    403 S.C. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886564\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/403/411/\">\n    743 S.E.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750-51 (2013). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 80-1 at 3; ECF No. 80-2 at 29.) As a result of these collective challenges, James Brown's will was submitted to the Probate Court of Aiken County, South Carolina. (ECF No. 1 at 11 \u00b6 42.) Eventually, the Probate Court of Aiken County, South Carolina, transferred the administration of James Brown's estate to the Aiken County Court of Common Pleas. (ECF No. 1 at 11 \u00b6 43; ECF No. 80-1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following litigation in the Aiken County Court of Common Pleas, in 2013, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the trial court's approval of a family settlement regarding James Brown's estate, upheld the removal of several fiduciaries, and remanded the case for the appointment of new fiduciaries. (ECF No. 85 at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886564\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/403/411/\">\n    743 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   768 ).) On October 1, 2013, the Aiken County Court of Common Pleas appointed Defendant Russell L. Bauknight (\"Defendant Bauknight\") to serve as the personal representative of the estate and trustee of the trust. (ECF No. 85-1 at 27-29.) On October 10, 2013, Defendant David C. Sojourner, Jr. (\"Defendant Sojourner\") was appointed as a limited special administrator of James Brown's estate and tasked with defending the estate against challenges. (ECF No. 85-1 at 35-36 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, the Aiken County Court of Common Pleas determined that Defendant Hynie was the surviving spouse of James Brown. (ECF No. 80-1 at 6.) During that same year, the lower court held that Defendant Brown was the biological son and a lawful heir to James Brown. (ECF No. 101-4.) In 2018, the South Carolina Court of Appeals also held that Defendant Hynie was the surviving spouse of James Brown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12652182\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/818/770/\">\n    424 S.C. 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12652182\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/818/770/\">\n    818 S.E.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 (S.C.

(ECF No. 1.) First, Plaintiffs seek relief from the court under the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20203\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304, and the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22 \u00b6\u00b6 74-77.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have \"conspired ... to usurp [their] rights and interests in [James] Brown's [c]ompositions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 13.) Plaintiffs seek a declaration establishing that a \"Settlement Agreement\" or any \"Concealed Terms,\" specifically among Defendants, is unenforceable and void as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 \u00b6 76.) Plaintiffs believe that Defendants have wrongfully deprived them of their termination interests pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Concealed Terms and failed to comply with the appropriate procedures of the Copyright Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, 20-21 \u00b6\u00b6 60-62, 75-76.) Further, Plaintiffs maintain that they are \"entitled to a preliminary injunction during the pendency of this action, and thereafter to a permanent injunction....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 \u00b6 77.) Secondly, Plaintiffs bring a range of claims arising under South Carolina law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-31 \u00b6\u00b6 78-114.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the following state law claims: (1) accounting; (2) conversion; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; (5) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage; and (6) common law unfair competition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23, 27-28, 30 \u00b6\u00b6 79, 84, 97, 102, 109.) The United States District Court for the Central District of California transferred this matter to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina on August 7, 2018. (ECF No. 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Hynie filed her Motion to Dismiss on September 11, 2018. (ECF No 81.) Defendant Brown filed his Motion to Dismiss on October 10, 2018. (ECF No. 101.) Within their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants bring legal challenges to the court's subject-matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201338\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (ECF No. 81 at 12-18; ECF No. 101 at 4-10.) In addition, Defendants allege that they were improperly served under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(f), requiring dismissal of Plaintiffs' Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5). (ECF No. 81 at 20; ECF No. 101 at 13.) As it relates to insufficient service of process, Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown, both of whom reside in the United Kingdom,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   maintain that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the prescribed methods of service authorized by the Hague Convention. (ECF No. 81 at 20; ECF No. 101 at 13.) Plaintiffs responded to Defendant Hynie\n   and Defendant Brown's Motions to Dismiss on October 4, 2018, and October 24, 2018, respectively. (ECF Nos. 96, 111.) Plaintiffs submit that Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown's claims concerning insufficient service of process are meritless because they were properly served pursuant to the laws of the United Kingdom. (ECF No. 96 at 23; ECF No. 111 at 28.) Critical to their argument, Plaintiffs contend that they could serve Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown under any method permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(f). (ECF No. 96 at 24; ECF No. 111 at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 22, 2019, the court heard arguments from Plaintiffs and Defendants regarding the sufficiency of process under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (ECF No. 144.) Although Defendants were conspicuously silent as to whether service of process was proper as to Defendant Brown, they forcefully maintained that service of process was improper as to Defendant Hynie. Nevertheless, Defendants requested that the court dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint for insufficient service of process as to both Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown. By contrast, Plaintiffs continued to argue that service of process was proper as to both Defendant Hynie and Defendant Brown and suggested that Plaintiffs were at liberty to choose any delineated method of service under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(f). Plaintiffs also maintained that they were not required to comply with the Hague Convention's mandates.

Rule 6.3(1) permits novel methods of service in comparison to methods within the United States.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.3(1)(a)-(e),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 4(e)(1)-(2). For example, it specifically allows service by \"fax or other means of electronic communication\" or \"any method\" authorized by a court order. CPR 6.3(1)(d)-(e). However, Rule 6.3(1) mirrors the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the extent it authorizes personal service upon an individual and permits a plaintiff to \"leave\" a \"claim form\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   at an individual's last known or usual residence.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.3(1)(a)-(c),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 4(e)(2)(A)-(C). As it specifically concerns the delivery of a claim form, Rule 6.3(c) states that a plaintiff can accomplish service by \"leaving it at a place specified in rule 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, or 6.10....\" Rule 6.8 allows service at a specific address provided by a defendant, while Rule 6.9 permits service at an individual's \"usual or last known residence\" when the plaintiff does not wish to effect personal service pursuant to Rule 6.5 and other service rules are inapplicable. CPR 6.8(a), 6.9(1)-(2). Therefore, construing Rule 6.3(1) with Rule 6.9(2), there are circumstances in which it is permissible for a plaintiff to simply leave a complaint at an individual's residence within the United Kingdom. However, as it relates to foreign documents, there is a wrinkle to this otherwise straight-forward scheme. Specifically, Rule 6.48 mandates further procedural requirements for \"any document in connection with civil or commercial proceedings in a foreign court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.48, 6.50. When Rule 6.48 applies, a \"Senior Master will serve a document,\" and he or she \"will determine the method of service.\" CPR 6.50. If a party follows these provisions, he or she should have \"a certificate, sealed with the Seal of the Senior Courts for use out[side] of the\" United Kingdom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.52(2). These provisions specifically apply to signatory countries of the Hague Convention, including the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.31(c), 6.49(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, the process server, under penalty of perjury, testifies that he attempted to personally serve Defendant Hynie on two different days and was unable to obtain a reply.

In a third attempt, the process server was met by \"an adult male ... who confirmed that [Defendant Hynie]\" resided at the address where the process server was trying to accomplish personal service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 5.) The process server tried to personally serve Defendant Hynie for a fourth time, but was unsuccessful yet again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 6.) During his fifth visit to Defendant Hynie's residence, the process server inserted the Complaint and Summons through Defendant Hynie's \"letterbox.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 7.) Under Rules 6.3(1)(c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   and 6.9, the process server was permitted to \"leave\" Plaintiffs' Complaint at Defendant Hynie's last known residence. There is no evidence suggesting that Defendant Hynie provided another address to properly effect service, which would have required the process server to act pursuant to Rule 6.8 as opposed to Rule 6.9. Additionally, there is no evidence suggesting that Defendant Hynie was required to have personal service, which would have narrowed the permissible methods of service at the process server's disposal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.5(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although it seems that the process server acted properly under some of the laws of the United Kingdom, the process server did not comply with Rule 6.48.

When Rule 6.48 applies, it specifically requires a Senior Master to serve a foreign document and specify the method of service upon a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPR 6.50, 6.51. Based upon the affidavit of Plaintiffs' process server, there is no indication that he acted pursuant to the directions of a Senior Master. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17.) Instead, the process server testifies that he was exclusively authorized to serve Defendant Hynie by Plaintiffs' undersigned, not by a Senior Master.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17.) At least one other federal court has determined that a process server's failure to work with a Senior Master renders service of process defective within the United Kingdom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miramontes v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 81, 81-2.) In her own affidavit, Defendant Hynie does not state that she either did not receive or is unaware of Plaintiffs' Complaint that was allegedly delivered to her residence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81-2 at 3-4 \u00b6\u00b6 11-21.) Additionally, during the hearing, Defendant Hynie's counsel did not make any argument claiming that his client was never provided with the Complaint.

Defendant Hynie, on the other hand, uses the last name \"Brown.\" (ECF Nos. 81, 99.) Upon careful consideration of the parties' strong opinions on this matter, and given the number of parties with the last name \"Brown,\" the court will utilize \"Hynie\" within its orders because the action has been filed in the name of Tommie Rae Hynie (ECF No. 1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the court is permitted to \"take judicial notice on its own.\" Fed.
