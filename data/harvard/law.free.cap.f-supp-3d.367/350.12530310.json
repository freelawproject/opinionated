PAPPERT, Judge\n   On September 21, 2018, Communications Test Design, Inc. filed this lawsuit against Contec LLC seeking declaratory judgments that its test systems do not infringe two Contec patents. Six days later, Contec sued CTDI for patent infringement in the Northern District of New York. Contec moves to dismiss CTDI's Complaint, arguing that CTDI acted in bad faith and engaged in forum shopping when it filed this lawsuit. Such conduct, according to Contec, warrants the Court's disregarding the case's \"first-filed\" status. In the alternative, Contec requests that the case be transferred to the Northern District of New York pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), or stayed pending the conclusion of that action. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the Motion to Dismiss and declines to exercise jurisdiction over CTDI's declaratory judgment action in favor of Contec's patent infringement case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   CTDI is a global engineering, repair and logistics company that provides solutions and services to the communications industry. (Keith Montone Decl. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since at least 2007, CTDI has developed, manufactured and used \"Gen3\" and \"Gen5\" test systems within the United States for testing set-top boxes and multimedia devices. (Compl. \u00b6 14, ECF No. 1.) These test systems were designed and developed at CTDI's global headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania. (Montone Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Contec provides repair, test and reverse logistics for electronics hardware used in a broad range of markets. (Hari Pillai Decl. \u00b6 5, ECF No. 5-2.) Contec is the owner by assignment of Patent Nos. 8,209,732 (the \"'732 Patent\") and 8,689,071 (the \"'071 Patent\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10.) The '732 Patent relates to an \"Arrangement and Method for Managing Testing and Repair of Set-Top Boxes,\" and the '071 Patent relates to a \"Multimedia Device Test System.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-13.) Both patents were designed and developed at Contec's corporate headquarters in Schenectady, New York. (Pillai Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 6, 2017, Contec wrote to CTDI to determine whether CTDI's test systems infringed any claims of the '732 and '071 Patents. (Compl. \u00b6 15.) Over the following year, CTDI and Contec, in an effort to resolve Contec's concerns, exchanged numerous emails and letters and held various telephone and in-person meetings and conferences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) In Contec's September 12, 2018 letter, counsel stated that \"the parties' extrajudicial process for obtaining information about CTDI's systems, without the full discovery obligations that would be imposed during litigation, has proved unsatisfactory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20; Ex. 7 to Coby S. Nixon Decl. at 2, ECF No. 5-13.) Counsel explained that it had \"obtained or uncovered sufficient information about CTDI's systems to have a good faith basis for believing that CTDI infringes at least one claim of both the '732 Patent and '071 Patent.\" (Ex. 7 to Nixon Decl. at 2.) The letter requested a response from CTDI before the \"close of business on September 19\" as to whether\n   it was willing to \"discuss potential terms for a patent license agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Otherwise, Contec would sue for patent infringement and, toward that end, attached to its letter a draft of its proposed complaint. (Compl. \u00b6 20; Ex. 7 to Nixon Decl. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On Wednesday afternoon, September 19, Jerry Parsons, CTDI's Chairman and CEO, spoke on the phone with Hari Pillai, Contec's CEO, about a possible license for Contec's patents. (Gerald Parsons Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 9; Pillai Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) After Pillai proposed initial terms, the executives agreed to talk again on Monday, September 24, when Parsons indicated he would make a counterproposal. (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the call, Pillai emailed Parsons at 4:09 p.m. EST, stating he \"look[ed] forward to [Parsons'] counter proposal [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to the per unit IP license fees. As discussed, let's connect by phone on Monday [September 24] afternoon....\" (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 26; Ex. 1 to Pillai Decl., ECF No. 5-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At around 5:30 p.m. EST that day, CTDI's counsel emailed a letter in response to Contec's September 12 Letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Mot. Dismiss at 7, ECF No. 5; Ex. 8 to Nixon Decl., ECF No. 5-14). Memorializing the discussion between Parsons and Pillai, counsel wrote \"to express once again, that CTDI will consider potential terms as requested in your most recent letter....\" (Ex. 8 to Nixon Decl. at 1.) At the end of the letter, counsel reiterated that, \"[d]espite our firm position on non-infringement and without admission, in an attempt to avoid an impasse, we remain willing to consider reasonable licensing terms and so, we encourage a continued conversation between the executives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On Friday, September 21, at 3:09 p.m. EST, CTDI filed its Complaint in this Court. (ECF No. 1.) At 3:36 p.m. EST, Parsons responded to Pillai's September 19 email: \"As you know I am not interested in a per unit cost but will put a proposal together. 3:30 Pacific Time Monday [September 24] afternoon works for me.\" (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 27; Ex. 2 to Pillai Decl., ECF No. 5-4.) There was no mention of CTDI's Complaint. (Ex. 2 to Pillai Decl.) Rather than send Mr. Pillai a proposal, CTDI sent Contec on September 24 a copy of the Complaint it filed three days before. (Nixon Decl. Ex. 9, ECF No. 5-15.) On September 27, Contec filed its complaint alleging patent infringement by CTDI.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Since Contec's Motion to Dismiss raises a question as to whether the Court should retain or decline jurisdiction under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), the Court cites to the declarations and corresponding exhibits attached to Contec's Motion and CTDI's Response, which the parties rely on to support their respective positions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Land v.

Parsons, however, contends that \"[a]t no time during that telephone discussion was mention made of directing lawyers to do or not do anything.\" (Parsons Decl. \u00b6 4.)

It further argues that\n    its conduct does not indicate forum shopping or bad faith because there was \"no real prospect for non-judicial resolution of their dispute.\" (Resp. Opp'n at 11.)

On September 12, Contec sent CTDI a draft complaint attached to a letter giving CTDI until the \"close of business on September 19\" to notify Contec if it was willing to \"discuss potential terms for a patent license agreement.\" (Compl. \u00b6 20; Ex. 7 to Nixon Decl. at 3.) The letter also stated that Contec would otherwise be \"forced to proceed with litigation.\" (Ex. 7 to Nixon Decl. at 3.) Armed with the knowledge that Contec intended to sue if the parties did not enter into a patent license, CTDI continued the pretense of good faith negotiations. On the day of Contec's deadline, September 19, Pillai and Parsons spoke on the phone about licensing terms. (Parsons Decl. \u00b6 2; Pillai Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) In fact, Pillai proposed initial terms, and the parties agreed to discuss Parson's anticipated counterproposal on Monday, September 24. (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 24.) Following their call that day, Pillai sent Parsons an email at 4:09 p.m. EST, confirming the September 24 call. (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 26; Ex. 1 to Pillai Decl.) About an hour later, CTDI's counsel wrote to Contec, \"express[ing] once again, that CTDI will consider potential terms\" and \"encourage[ing] a continued conversation between the executives.\" (Ex. 8 to Nixon Decl.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    CTDI instead sued Contec Friday afternoon, September 21, at 3:09 p.m., something Parsons made no mention of in his response later that very day to Pillai's September 19 email.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 27; Ex. 2 to Pillai Decl.). Neither did Parsons express \"that terms for a licensing agreement would probably not be reached between Contec and CTDI,\" which he claims became apparent to him after his call with Pillai on September 19. (Parsons Decl. \u00b6 8.) CTDI beat Contec to the courthouse by filing its Complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 1). Contec found out about the declaratory judgment action on September 24-the date Pillai and Parsons were supposed to discuss the proposals in more detail. (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 26; Ex. 1 to Pillai Decl.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The crux of CTDI's argument is that Parsons abruptly realized, on September 19, that the year-long negotiations would not be fruitful and that CTDI needed to move forward with its lawsuit and eradicate the \"cloud\" Contec's allegations created over CTDI's business, marketing activity and customer relations. (Resp. Opp'n 5-6; Parsons Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Unfortunately for CTDI, Parsons' agreement to continue negotiations the following week, his intention to offer a counterproposal and CTDI's counsel's letter promising a desire for a non-judicial resolution and continued negotiations contradict CTDI's position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    CTDI had every right, in its business and legal judgment, to break off negotiations and resort to litigation. What CTDI did not have the right to do, if it expected the Court to honor its first-filed Complaint, was to string Contec along just long enough to get the judicial drop and file this lawsuit in its own backyard. CTDI's conduct was inconsistent with the policy promoting extrajudicial dispute resolution, not to mention sound judicial administration and the conservation of judicial resources. It would be unjust to excuse this conduct with a rote adherence to the first-filed rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    3\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Although courts may consider \"whether a party intended to preempt another's infringement suit,\" this is \"merely one factor in the analysis.\"\n    <em>\n     Elecs. for Imaging v.

(Parsons Decl. \u00b6 2; Pillai Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Ex. 2 to Pillai Decl.) CTDI's counsel also reassured Contec on September 19 of its desire to continue negotiations between the parties. (Ex. 8 to Nixon Decl.) CTDI took advantage of the fact that Contec deferred filing its complaint based on Contec's reasonable belief that licensing discussions were taking place in earnest, with the obvious hope that litigation would not be necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Additional considerations supporting a court's decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action include \"the convenience and availability of witnesses, or absence of jurisdiction over all necessary or desirable parties, or the possibility of consolidation with related litigation, or considerations relating to the real party in interest.\"\n    <em>\n     Genentech\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516063\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/931/#p937\">\n     998 F.2d at 938\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . (citation omitted). The Federal Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Serco Services Company\n    </em>\n    affirmed the district court's dismissal of the declaratory action because it considered the convenience of the parties in addition to the anticipatory nature of the suit:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    [A]ll of [the patentee's] witnesses were located in Wisconsin while [the alleged infringer's] were scattered throughout the country.

CTDI's global headquarters and principal place of business is in West Chester, Pennsylvania. (Montone Decl. \u00b6 6.) CTDI alleges that many, if not most, of the CTDI witness with testimony relevant to Contec's infringement claims are located at the West Chester facility. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 14.) However, CTDI has over ninety facilities worldwide, including Glenville, New York, where its test systems have been used. (Resp. Opp'n at 2.) On the other hand, Contec's corporate headquarters are in Schenectady, New York. (Pillai Decl. \u00b6 4.) Both Glenville and Schenectady are within the Northern District of New York and within reasonable proximity to Albany. Contec has no witnesses, physical facilities or place of business in Pennsylvania. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 22.) Its employee files for its current and former employees, its email server and its record databases are maintained in the Schenectady facility. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 20.) Three of the six inventors of the patents at issue are current residents of New York. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 13.) With respect to the absence of jurisdiction over necessary parties, five of these inventors, who would serve as key witnesses, are beyond the subpoena power of the Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P 45(c)(1).\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, these considerations support the\n    Court's decision to dismiss the declaratory action in favor of Contec's later-filed infringement action, where CTDI is free to defend that its test systems do not infringe Contec's patents. The Court obviously need not address Contec's alternative requests to transfer or stay the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    An appropriate Order follows.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-51\">\n     Darby Racey, an inventor on the '071 Patent, left Contec in 2012 and is a consultant in the greater Albany area.
