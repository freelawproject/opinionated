Defendants William Fulbright and Timothy Fox (the \"State\") have moved for summary judgment on all claims. (Doc. 52.) United States Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch recommends the State's motion be granted and the case dismissed. (Doc. 67.) Myers filed untimely objections,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 71), to which the State responded, (Doc. 72).

(Doc. 71.) Myers is a disbarred lawyer proceeding on his own behalf.

However, the statutes in question included the basic element or phrase at issue, providing an arguably ambiguous starting point from which the Court could apply a narrowing construction. Here, the statute at issue does not mention \"actual malice\" or falsity. That omission also distinguishes this case from that of\n   <em>\n    Phelps v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   , a Tenth Circuit case addressing Kansas's criminal defamation statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"179224\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/1058/\">\n    59 F.3d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1995). The Kansas statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   read:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Criminal defamation is maliciously communicating to a person orally,\n   in writing, or by any other means, false information tending to expose another living person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to deprive him of the benefits of public confidence and social acceptance, or tending to degrade and vilify the memory of one who is dead and to scandalize or provoke his living relatives and friends.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) In all prosecutions under this section the truth of the information communicated shall be admitted as evidence.

Notably, the statute contains both the words \"maliciously\" and \"false.\" Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   , when the Tenth Circuit construed the statute to require \"actual malice\" it was interpreting statutory language that included the ambiguous terms.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179224\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/1058/\">\n    59 F.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   court went a step further, addressing the omission of an actual malice requirement.
