As often as not, the provider contacts the insurance company and receives what it understands to be a pre-authorization. But sometimes the insurance company ends up deciding not to pay for what the provider thought was pre-authorized. So the question becomes whether the medical provider may recover in court against the insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   That's essentially the question now before me in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff is a medical provider who alleges that defendants failed to pay for surgeries despite pre-authorizing the provider to perform the surgeries. Defendants now move to dismiss principally on grounds that the Center has not adequately alleged its state law claims and that the Center's claims are otherwise preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). I mostly agree and will grant defendants' motion to dismiss except as to the plaintiff's claim for promissory estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts as alleged by the plaintiff in the amended complaint are accepted as true for purposes of ruling on defendants' motion to dismiss. Doc. # 7. Plaintiff Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Center, LLC, is a medical practice located in Louisiana run by Dr. Alireza Sadeghi, who specializes in reconstructive breast surgery. Dr. Sadeghi performed a medically necessary mastectomy on a patient in March of 2016, and then performed a medically necessary follow-up surgery on the same patient in July of 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The patient worked for defendant Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., which sponsored her employee health plan. According to the complaint, defendant United Healthcare Group, Inc. (UHG) acted as the claims administrator for the plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the plan is governed by ERISA. The Center was an out-of-network provider under the patient's plan. Doc. # 12-1 at 87. Under the terms of the plan, the patient could not assign her benefits under the plan to her medical provider without UHG's consent, Doc. # 12-1 at 88, and it is uncontested that the patient did not assign her benefits to the Center.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 22 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although the plan did not require it of an out-of-network provider prior to treating a patient,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 12-1 at 87, the Center contacted UHG to request prior authorization before each surgery at issue in this case. UHG authorized rendering surgery in each instance. The Center alleges that the authorization created an implied contract by defendants to pay the Center a reasonable amount for the Center's services, and in the alternative, that the authorization was a promise to pay the Center a fair and reasonable rate for its services. After the surgeries, the Center billed defendants for a total of $ 390,700, which the Center alleges to be a reasonable rate for the surgical services performed. Defendants paid none of the billed charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Center has filed this federal diversity lawsuit against defendants alleging the following causes of action: breach of contract (Count 1), promissory estoppel (Count 2), account stated (Count 3), and fraudulent inducement (Count 4). Defendants now move to dismiss. Doc. # 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For purposes of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court must accept as true all factual matters alleged in a complaint, although a complaint may not survive unless the facts it recites are enough to state plausible grounds for relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

This \"plausibility\" requirement is \"not akin to a probability requirement,\" but it \"asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the focus must be on what facts a complaint alleges, a court is \"not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\" or \"to accept as true allegations that are wholly conclusory.\"\n   <em>\n    Krys v. Pigott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074168,4065546\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/117/\">\n    749 F.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (2d Cir. 2014). In short, my role in reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is to determine if the complaint-apart from any of its conclusory allegations-alleges enough facts to state a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Claims against Jacobs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that Jacobs was the patient's employer but does not allege any actions taken by Jacobs to agree to or induce the Center to perform surgery for the patient. In the absence of any allegations that it was Jacobs who had dealings with the Center or did anything other than employ the patient, I will grant Jacobs' motion to dismiss as to all of the Center's claims against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Claims against UHG\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Center's amended complaint names \"United HealthCare Group, Inc.\" as a defendant and the entity that administered the patient's insurance plan. Doc. # 7 at 1, 3 (\u00b6 4). A company identifying itself as \"UnitedHealth Group, Inc. s/h/a United Healthcare Group, Inc.\" (whom I will assume to be the same as the named defendant, UHG) has filed this motion to dismiss, and it argues that the Center has sued the wrong corporate party, because the actual plan administrator was UHG's corporate subsidiary, UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company. Doc. # 12 at 1-2 &amp; n.1, 8, 9; Doc. # 12-2 at 2-3 (\u00b6 4). UHG has filed alongside its motion to dismiss an affidavit attesting to this corporate relationship, as well as a copy of its Jacobs Engineering Group plan. Doc. # 12-1; Doc. # 12-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The corporate identity and affiliations of UHG are questions of fact, and for purposes of evaluating a motion to dismiss the Court must accept as true for pleading purposes all of plaintiff's allegations subject to any documents that are referenced in or otherwise integral to the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goel v. Bunge, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255661\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/554/#p559\">\n    820 F.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (2d Cir. 2016). The Jacobs Engineering Group plan repeatedly refers to any United entity just as \"UnitedHealthcare,\" and provides contact information for the claims administrator at a Minnesota address associated with \"United Healthcare Services, Inc.\" Doc. # 12-1 at 133. This entity name is\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   from the one (\"UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company\") that UHG in its briefing claims to be the true administrator of the plan. Doc. # 12 at 2 n.1. Therefore, the Court does not have a proper basis to conclude at the pleading stage that the Center has sued the wrong party.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 25-3 at 1 to\n   <em>\n    Taylor Theunissen, M.D., LLC v. United HealthCare Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 18cv606 (D. Conn. 2018) (cover of certificate of coverage identifies UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company and names same as offeror and underwriter of coverage).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because I must draw factual inferences in the Center's favor at this stage of the proceedings, I therefore will allow the case to proceed at this time against UHG without prejudice to a motion for summary judgment on this basis at a future time. The Court encourages counsel to consult in good faith to determine whether they can simply agree on this issue of the proper defendant to be sued rather than expending the Court's and clients' resources on the litigation of an issue that should be readily ascertained from appropriate documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Adequacy of fraud allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), a plaintiff alleging fraud \"must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud,\" such that the plaintiff must \"(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Chorches v. Am. Med. Response, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269781,12275486\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/71/\">\n    865 F.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (2d Cir. 2017). Moreover, a complaint must allege \"facts that give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent,\" such as facts \"to show that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   or \"that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\"\n   <em>\n    Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644965\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/273/#p290\">\n    459 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290-91 (2d Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The only statement that the Center contends was fraudulent was the generalized \"authorization\" it alleges defendants made to the Center. At the same time, the Center fails to disaggregate defendants as speakers-let alone identify who provided the authorization with any greater degree of particularity. Nor has the Center identified any facts to support a fraudulent motive underlying defendants' inducement of the Center's services without pay, as opposed to nonpayment for some other reason, nor any facts to support a mental state of conscious misbehavior or recklessness. Doc. # 7 at 8-9 (\u00b6\u00b6 47-53). I will therefore dismiss the fraudulent inducement claim as inadequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERISA preemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   UHG contends that ERISA preempts all of the Center's remaining claims. Doc. # 12 at 17. To begin with, it's helpful to clarify that \"preempted by ERISA\" can mean two different things. ERISA has two preemption provisions, located at Sections 502 and 514 of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), 1144(a). The first of those provisions, \u00a7 502, is referred to by some courts as \"complete\" preemption and makes a federal ERISA claim the exclusive vehicle to enforce the terms of an ERISA plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wurtz v. Rawlings Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152358\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/232/#p238\">\n    761 F.3d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238-39 (2d Cir. 2014). Section 502 is therefore jurisdictional: while a defendant who seeks to remove a claim to federal court must usually show that a federal question is presented on the face of the complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow Pharms. Inc. v.

Aetna Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276489\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/141/#p145\">\n    857 F.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (2d Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But because this lawsuit began in federal court, UHG is asserting the second form of ERISA preemption: \"express\" preemption under \u00a7 514(a) of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 22 at 9. Save for some statutory exceptions that are not relevant here, a defendant may assert \u00a7 514 defensively to preempt (and defeat) any state law claims that \"relate\" to an ERISA plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gobeille v.

This is expansive language-indeed, one of the Act's sponsors named the federalization of employee benefit law \"the crowning achievement\" of the Act, 120 CONG. REC. 29,147 (1974) (statement of Rep. Dent), and courts have described ERISA as containing \"one of the broadest preemption clauses ever enacted by Congress,\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Safeco Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540612\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/1437/#p1439\">\n    916 F.2d 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1439 (9th Cir. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As UHG sees it, then, the Center's claims should of course be preempted: \u00a7 514 applies to any state claim relating to an ERISA plan, is meant to be construed broadly, and the Center would not have contacted UHG for a pre-authorization absent the provisions of the patient's ERISA plan. And as UHG correctly points out in its briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 12 at 18, the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 514 can preempt \"common law causes of action\" that are \"based on the improper processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan,\"\n   <em>\n    Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208979\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/41/#p47\">\n    481 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208979\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/41/#p47\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208979\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/41/#p47\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Thus, on UHG's view, even though the Center claims that\n   its lawsuit is based on what it labels as \"United's promise[ ] to reimburse\" the Center, Doc. # 15 at 9, because there is still a logical relationship between promise and plan, the Center's claims are preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If only it were so simple. Since\n   <em>\n    Pilot Life\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has made clear that when approaching the question of \u00a7 514 preemption, courts \"must go beyond the unhelpful text and frustrating difficulty of defining ['relate' under \u00a7 514(a) ], and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

It then held that the assignment of a patient's benefits allowed a provider to sue under ERISA, that the plaintiff's contractual and quasi contractual claims that it had a right to be paid implicated the scope of coverage under the patient's plan, and that the defendant's phone conversations with the plaintiff authorizing medical services had not created a sufficiently independent duty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383695\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/321/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Second Circuit has since held that the question shakes out differently when the patient does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   validly assign her benefits to a non-network medical provider.

And so the court in\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   ruled that the provider's promissory estoppel claim was not preempted by ERISA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276489\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/141/#p145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276489\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/141/#p145\">\n    at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   , of course, is not directly on point. The court dealt with \u00a7 502 of ERISA rather than \u00a7 514, only considered a single claim for promissory estoppel, and addressed a question of how much an insurer would pay rather than if the insurer would pay at all. Although I am concerned that doing so may open the door to new litigation over a fairly common phenomenon \"as anti-assignment clauses have become an increasingly prominent feature of health insurance contracts,\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

First, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   helps illustrate the proper measure of whether \u00a7 514 preempts a common law claim, the analysis from\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   should then guide the application of\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   for claims, like the ones here, where a plaintiff provider has not been assigned its patient's benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, the\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning casts light on other principles of \u00a7 514 preemption.

Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   court's determination that the plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim did \"not implicate the actual coverage terms of the health care plan or\n   require a determination as to whether those claims were properly applied,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276489\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/141/#p145\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276489\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/141/#p145\">\n    at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , shows that a resolution of the estoppel claim does not implicate what the Supreme Court reserved for federal law in\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   : how an ERISA plan is administered or what the plan covers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602419\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/936/#p943\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   's rule is consistent with the result reached by several other circuits that\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   indeed considered whether and how \u00a7 514 preempts state law claims by third party medical providers whom have not been assigned a patient's right to ERISA plan benefits but who alleged they were assured of payment by the insurer. In the Fifth Circuit, for example, \"[a] defendant pleading preemption under [\u00a7 514] must prove that '(1) the state law claims address an area of exclusive federal concern, such as the right to receive benefits under the terms of an ERISA plan; and (2) the claims directly affect the relationships among traditional ERISA entities-the employer, the plan and its fiduciaries, and the participants and beneficiaries.' \"\n   <em>\n    Access Mediquip L.L.C. v.

Thus, the Fifth Circuit held that \u00a7 514 did not preempt a non-assignee's promissory estoppel claims against an insurer that depended on an alleged oral misrepresentation, although \u00a7 514 preempted other quasi-contract claims that depended on whether there was actual coverage under the ERISA plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 383-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Other circuits have generally followed the Fifth Circuit's lead.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hospice of Metro Denver, Inc. v.

A contract claim requires proof of consideration as an element.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gianetti v. Norwalk Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"540883\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/211/51/\">\n    211 Conn. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20A.2d%201249\">\n    557 A.2d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253-54 (1989). The Center contends that the benefit or consideration UHG received from the alleged implied contract was the ability to \"offer health coverage and/or benefits in exchange for premiums.\" Doc. # 15 at 12. This is similar to the theory of quasi-contract and unjust enrichment claims that the Fifth Circuit\n   rejected in\n   <em>\n    Access Mediquip\n   </em>\n   : that \"without [the plaintiff's] services, another provider would have had to procure or finance [those services].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852432\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/376/#p382\">\n    662 F.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit held those claims to be preempted because the plaintiff could only recover to the extent those services were in fact covered by patients' plans, and as such, the plaintiff's claims effectively served as a tool to collaterally enforce the plan once the insurer had denied benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852432\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/376/#p382\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852432\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/376/#p382\">\n    at 386-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The situation here is similar. UHG's supposed benefit, in the Center's view, is the ability to fulfill its obligations under the patient's plan through the Center's services, rather than to do so from elsewhere. Determining the merits of the Center's claim therefore would require a look to and reliance on the actual coverage terms of UHG's plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This result is consistent with the Second Circuit's framework for analyzing \u00a7 514 preemption of common law claims. Of course, it remains true that the Center is not an entity capable of suing under ERISA, and so does not satisfy the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   test. Yet because the Center seeks to bring a claim that derives from what a plan beneficiary-in this case, the patient-would be entitled to under the plan, the Center's claim still seeks to \"rectify a wrongful denial of benefits\" under the plan and does not arise from any independent duty existing between it and UHG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paneccasio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032362\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/101/\">\n    532 F.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As with the contract claim, I will also dismiss the Center's claims for account stated. An account stated claim arises when a creditor delivers a debtor a statement of the debtor's account with canceled checks for the charges, and the debtor then retains for an unreasonable time the statement without disputing those charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Credit One, LLC v.

These claims arise from a contractual relationship between the parties to extend credit, rather than equitable promises or misrepresentations.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20A.%20296\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; David T. Martin, 1 CONN. CONTRACT LITIG. \u00a7 6.03[9] (2018).

The Center claims that UHG's authorization for the surgeries Dr. Sadeghi performed constituted a promise to pay him a reasonable amount for those services.

Rather, \"it is immaterial whether the alleged statements regarding the extent that the patient['s] plan[ ] covered [the Center's] services were correct or incorrect as descriptions of the plan['s] terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Access Mediquip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852432\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/376/#p382\">\n    662 F.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, evaluating the merits of the Center's claim for estoppel requires determining only \"(1) the amount and terms of reimbursement that [the Center] could reasonably have expected given what could be fairly inferred from the statements, and (2) whether United's subsequent disposition of the reimbursement claims was consistent with that expectation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852432\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/376/#p382\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Such a result does not bear on any relationships between core ERISA entities, does not implicate the substantive terms of the patient's plan, and does not create any ongoing legal obligations\n   under the plan.

Doc. # 12 at 13-14; Doc. # 22 at 6-7. I do not agree. When a provider wants to know whether it can reasonably expect reimbursement for caring for a patient, \" 'it is a customary practice to communicate with the plan agents to verify eligibility and coverage,' \" and \"an ERISA plan can avoid liability under [State-law claims based on misrepresentations] by taking care that it does not mislead providers regarding what they can expect to be paid if they render services for the plan's insureds.\"\n   <em>\n    Access Mediquip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852432\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/376/#p382\">\n    662 F.3d at 381, 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535151\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/904/236/#p245\">\n    904 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   246 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although UHG complains that the Center should have described aspects of the interaction between the Center and UHG with greater particularity, a claim for promissory estoppel is not one for \"fraud or mistake\" that is subject to the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b). Because the Center plausibly alleges that it received an authorization from UHG, that this authorization was a promise to receive reasonable payment for its services, and that the Center then relied on the promise to its detriment, I conclude that the Center has adequately stated a claim for promissory estoppel against UHG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 7 at 7 (\u00b6\u00b6 38-41). I will allow the promissory estoppel claim against UHG to proceed at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants' motion to supplement the record\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While this motion was pending, defendants moved to supplement the record and have the Court consider two pre-authorization letters that United claims to have sent to the Center for the surgeries. Doc. # 28 (motion); Docs. # 29-1; # 29-2 (letters). These letters are similar to the pre-authorization letter entered into the record with the consent of the plaintiff in the\n   <em>\n    Theunissen\n   </em>\n   case that is also before me.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 48; # 48-1 to\n   <em>\n    Taylor Theunissen, M.D., LLC v.
