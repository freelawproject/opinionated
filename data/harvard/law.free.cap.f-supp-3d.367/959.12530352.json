In short, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") ordered Petitioner deported and removed to Somalia, and Petitioner appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). Petitioner also filed this Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , challenging his ongoing detention under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and seeking release from custody pending removal. [ECF No. 1.] In the R &amp; R, the Magistrate Judge concluded that Petitioner's continued detention without a bond hearing would deprive him of his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. (R &amp; R at 16.) The Magistrate Judge recommended that the \u00a7 2241 petition be granted in part - in that Petitioner be provided with a bond hearing before an IJ to determine whether his continued detention is necessary to protect the public or prevent him from fleeing during the pendency of immigration proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) The Magistrate Judge recommended that the Petition be denied with respect to Petitioner's request for immediate release.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 16, 2019, Petitioner filed his response to the government's objections, stating that the R &amp; R should be adopted in full. [ECF No. 22 at 2.] Because no party has objected to the R &amp; R's conclusion that \u00a7 1226(c) applies to Petitioner and that the request for immediate release should be denied, the Court reviews those conclusions for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Recently, the Supreme Court has rejected using the canon of constitutional avoidance to employ an implicit temporal limitation on pre-removal detention, finding the plain language of \u00a7 1226(c) unambiguously \"makes clear that detention of aliens within its scope\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   continue 'pending a decision' on removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

The parties differ, though, on when detention becomes so unreasonably long as to violate due process. Specifically, the government contends that only in \"extraordinary cases\" when the government causes unreasonable delay should a petitioner be entitled to a bond hearing.

In assessing due process challenges to \u00a7 1226(c) detentions, courts consider several factors to determine when \"continued detention becomes unreasonable and the Executive Branch's implementation of \u00a7 1226(c) becomes unconstitutional unless\" a bond hearing is provided.\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (citation and quotation omitted).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resps' Obj. at 6.) According to the government, this approach requires speculation and improperly considers the length of an appeal to the Eighth Circuit, which would be under a different statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The IJ denied Petitioner's claims for relief and ordered him removed on June 8, 2018. [ECF No. 7-1, Ex. A at 46.] Petitioner appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA on June 18, 2018. [ECF No. 1-1, Ex. 1 at 1-5.] In December 2018, the BIA requested supplemental briefing. [ECF Nos. 20 at 4; 22 at 1-2.] The Department of Homeland Security agrees that Petitioner's appeal should be remanded for adjudication on whether Petitioner is entitled to reinstatement of his conditional permanent residence and the filing of new charges of removability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Petitioner has opposed the remand.

Accordingly, because Petitioner may be detained for many months before removal proceeds are complete, this factor supports granting relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The third factor considers the conditions of the petitioner's detention. \"Aliens held under \u00a7 1226(c) are subject to civil detention rather than criminal incarceration.\"\n   <em>\n    Muse,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citation and quotation omitted).

Whitaker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529543\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/853/#p859\">\n    358 F.Supp.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 859-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20549722\">\n    2019 WL 549722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Minn. 2019) (citation and quotation omitted). The government does not dispute that Petitioner is being held at a criminal correctional facility (Resps' Obj. at 8.) and, thus, this factor weighs in Petitioner's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The fourth factor weighs whether the detainee has caused any delays in the removal proceedings. The government concedes that Petitioner has not caused any delays, (Resps' Obj. at 8.), and the Court agrees Petitioner has not engaged in dilatory tactics and finds this factor favors granting relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ly v. Hansen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047969\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/263/#p272\">\n    351 F.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (6th Cir. 2003) (balancing petitioner's right to \"explore avenues of relief\" against engaging in dilatory tactics to stall deportation and compel release from detention). Petitioner is entitled to raise legitimate defenses to removal, including filing a petition for conditional residence, and such challenges to his removal cannot undermine his claim that detention has become unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Decker,\n   </em>\n   No. 18-CV-5026 (ALC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203579108\">\n    2018 WL 3579108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2018) (\"the mere fact that a noncitizen opposes his removal is insufficient to defeat a finding of unreasonably prolonged detention, especially where the Government fails to distinguish between bona fide and frivolous arguments in opposition\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The fifth factor considers any delays in the removal proceedings caused by the government. The Court agrees with the government that it has not caused any delays in the removal proceedings and, like Petitioner, has the right to makes arguments in support of its position, including filing a motion in support of remanding the proceedings to the IJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muse,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (concluding that the government did not engage in dilatory tactics when it only advanced non-frivolous arguments). Therefore, this factor supports continued detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The last factor weighs the likelihood that the removal proceedings will result in a final order of removal. The Court agrees it is not in the position to weigh the merits of the removal order and thus finds this factor neutral. Despite the government's argument that \"ICE has prevailed on the challenges [Petitioner] has raised thus far to his removal,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner has filed a new I-751 request for conditional permanent residence and the government seeks new charges of removability. The Court cannot predict what will occur with the new filings and Petitioner's appeal, and thus does not have a sufficient basis to determine whether Petitioner will likely be removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In sum, the majority of factors weigh in favor of granting relief. The Court therefore rules that Petitioner is entitled to a bond hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether he is a flight risk or danger to the community. Continued detention without a bond hearing would otherwise deprive Petitioner of his rights under the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"Such a hearing will protect both Muse's rights under the Due Process Clause and the government's legitimate interest in detaining a removable alien when such detention is necessary to serve the purposes of \u00a7 1226(c).\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Portillo\n   </em>\n   , 322 F.Supp.3d at 708-09.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and on all the files, records, and proceedings herein, the Court OVERRULES Respondents' objections [ECF No. 20], and the R &amp; R [ECF No. 14] is ADOPTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [ECF No. 1] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1.

(Resps' Obj. at 2 n.1.)
