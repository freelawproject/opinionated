Orange Lake and Wilson Finance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Orange Lake and Wilson Finance (\"\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n   \") are at the forefront of a legal battle that has emerged in the billion-dollar timeshare industry. Orange Lake develops, finances, manages, and sells timeshare resort properties, and Wilson Finance provides mortgage financing to purchasers of those properties. (Doc. 251, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 44, 45). Like many other providers of timeshares and timeshare financing, Plaintiffs have gone on the offensive against companies \"whose business models profit from ... disrupting ... valid legal contracts between [timeshare] resorts and their owners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the instant case, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants - Reed Hein &amp; Associates d/b/a Timeshare Exit Team (\"\n   <strong>\n    TET\n   </strong>\n   \"), Thomas Parenteau (\"\n   <strong>\n    Parenteau\n   </strong>\n   \"), Brandon Reed (\"\n   <strong>\n    Reed\n   </strong>\n   \"), Trevor Hein (\"\n   <strong>\n    Hein\n   </strong>\n   \"), Schroeter Goldmark &amp; Bender, P.S. (\"\n   <strong>\n    SGB\n   </strong>\n   \"), and Sussman - engaged in a scheme designed to induce timeshare owners, including owners of Orange Lake timeshares (\"\n   <strong>\n    Orange Lake Owners\n   </strong>\n   \" or \"\n   <strong>\n    Owners\n   </strong>\n   \"), to breach their timeshare agreements for Defendants' pecuniary gain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. TET, Reed, Hein and Parenteau's Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, Reed and Hein founded TET, which brands itself as a \"consumer protection firm,\" dedicated to releasing timeshare owners from their contracts with timeshare developers. (Doc. 224-2, \u00b6 3; Doc. 189-1; Doc. 189-2). Thereafter, Reed, Hein, and Parenteau (TET's Chief Operating Officer) began enticing timeshare owners to hire TET by making false promises to relieve them of their timeshare obligations. (Doc. 251, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51). To do this, Reed, Hein, and Parenteau spend one million dollars per month advertising through TET's website,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   paid celebrity endorsements, and other marketing tools. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 189-1; Doc. 189-2; Scott Loughran Dep., Doc. 189-3, p. 97).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For example, on its website,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   TET advertises that it will utilize its \"proprietary process\" to get rid of an owner's timeshare contract \"Safely. Legitimately. Forever.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 189-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 189-2). As illustrated by the \"Frequently Asked Questions\" section of the website, TET targets timeshare owners who are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Not using their timeshare as much as they intended to\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Frustrated by unexpected \"special assessments\" and skyrocketing maintenance fees\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Financially set back by their timeshare maintenance fees and special assessments\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Frustrated by their failure to sell the timeshare through a listing company\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Concerned about their children inheriting their timeshare and then consequently becoming financially responsible for it\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Bothered they can't vacation where they want, when they want\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Tired of going to the same place every year\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Aggravated with exchange companies\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Realizing that there are more ways to go on vacation for much less\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Widowed or divorced, or are no longer able to travel with their loved ones\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Inheritors of a timeshare they don't want or use\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Part of resort scams\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Doc. 189-1, p. 1). Through these Frequently Asked Questions, TET \"falsely portray [that] timeshare owners do not need any legal[ ] ... basis to terminate [their] timeshare contract[s].\" (Doc. 251, \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"This marketing strategy generates in-bound calls through which prospective [clients] contact TET regarding its advertised services.\" (Tanya Freeman Decl.,\n   Doc. 224-2, \u00b6 3). The in-bound leads are handled by TET-trained representatives, who gather background information from prospective clients and schedule in-person meetings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). During those meetings, TET representatives advise prospective clients \"that TET has a 'proprietary process' through which it can negotiate the termination of timeshare contracts in just three to nine months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). \"This promise is backed by a supposed 100% money-back guarantee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the direction of TET, the representatives also instruct prospective clients to cease all communication with their timeshare developers and to stop making payments under their timeshare agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-6). Nonpayment is a key component of TET's sales pitch, as it allows TET's representatives to close the sale and collect an upfront fee for TET. (Doc. 224-2, \u00b6 6). It is also used as \"leverage\" when TET attempts to \"exit\" timeshare owners from their timeshare agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"This 'leverage' is crucial as TET does not have a 'proprietary process' and does not conduct an actual investigation into whether a particular timeshare owner has any valid basis to breach his/her timeshare obligations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8). In fact, no attorneys participate in TET's client-intake process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   TET charges an upfront fee for its services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). This upfront fee is not based on any specific analysis of the prospective client's timeshare contract or the amount of work that is required for TET to deliver on its promise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rather, TET deliberately offers a fee that falls below the cost of the prospective client's contractual obligations to his or her timeshare developer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After a prospective client executes TET's retainer documents, he or she is reminded \"to make no further payments to their respective timeshare developer and to cease all communication with the developer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11; Doc. 224-6; Doc. 189-22). Thereafter, TET transfers the client's file to a \"vendor attorney\"-such as SGB and Sussman-to execute TET's advertised \"proprietary process\" of getting rid of an owner's timeshare contract. (Doc. 224-2, \u00b6 14; Doc. 189-4, pp. 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sussman's Participation in the Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   TET hired Sussman as a vendor attorney on December 12, 2013. (Doc. 197-3, \u00b6 4). Pursuant to their client retainer agreement, TET pays Sussman a fixed fee (in most cases, $ 500 per file) in exchange for \"proprietary information[ ] regarding the liquidation and return of timeshares\" belonging to TET's clients. (Doc. 224-4; Doc. 197-3, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 15; Doc. 224-7, p. 34). Sussman is expressly aware that TET's clients, including Orange Lake Owners, have entered into contracts with timeshare developers (Doc. 224-7, p. 125), but he never asks for their timeshare agreements or investigates any of the clients' cases prior to rendering services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36, 98). In fact, Sussman does not communicate with any of TET's clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36, 60-61, 181).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Sussman assigns TET's client files to \"associates,\" who work for him as independent contractors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51). His associates are responsible for sending boilerplate letters to the developers for all of TET's clients, including Orange Lake Owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-9). In the letters for TET's clients, Sussman: (1) accuses the developer of misrepresentation\n   and fraud, regardless of the circumstances underlying the client's case (Doc. 224-7, pp. 54-55, 212-213); (2) instructs the developer not to communicate with the client (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 196); and (3) informs the developer that the client will not be paying any financial obligations associated with their timeshare ownership and that the developer can take the timeshare back (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 203-04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sussman has never filed a lawsuit for any of TET's clients, including Orange Lake Owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95, 272). Instead, with TET's knowledge and approval, Sussman employs three methods to \"exit\" Orange Lake Owners from their timeshare contracts-(1) the \"resignation\" method, (2) the \"deed back to [Plaintiffs]\" method, or (3) the \"deed to associate\" method. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-91, 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1. Resignation method\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the first method, Sussman sends notices to Plaintiffs, informing them that the Orange Lake Owner is resigning from his or her timeshare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-77). Sussman is aware that Plaintiffs do not accept resignations as valid cancellations of an Owner's timeshare contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 104 (acknowledging that \"[Plaintiffs] do not accept anything\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 272). Nevertheless, Sussman claims that his notice of an Owner's resignation constitutes a \"valid exit\" and that it is incumbent upon Plaintiffs to \"to take whatever legal action they wish to take to invalidate what [he] feel[s] is a valid resignation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-76). Sussman admits that Orange Lake Owners are required to comply with the terms of their timeshare contract if they have not paid in full at the time of the resignation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77). But Sussman never informs the Owners, thereby leaving them at risk of suit by Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2. Deed back to Plaintiffs method\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Sussman also uses the \"deed back to Plaintiffs\" method. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93). Under this method, Sussman conveys the Owner's timeshare interest back to Plaintiffs via unilateral deed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93, 101). To accomplish this, Sussman pays various attorneys to prepare deeds designating Plaintiffs as the grantees. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 240, 254-55, 257, 258-59, 294;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Andre Young Decl., Doc. 224-10). The Owner signs the deed and then Sussman has the deed recorded. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-14, pp. 7-8). Each deed recites that Plaintiffs (the grantees) paid Owner (the grantor) ten dollars in consideration for the timeshare. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). But, in actuality, no consideration changes hands. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 286-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Sussman is aware that Plaintiffs do not accept unilateral deeds and that his deeds have resulted in \"hundreds\" of foreclosure actions, but Sussman never makes Orange Lake Owners aware of these facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104-105; Doc. 224-10, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). Instead, Sussman deems the transfer \"valid\" and issues a congratulatory letter informing the Owner that he or she is no longer contractually obligated to pay Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-14, p. 6; Doc. 224-7, pp. 282-85). Unless the Owner specifically requests that Plaintiffs be informed of the recorded deed, Sussman does not do so. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 272-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    3. Deed to associate method\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sussman sometimes utilizes the \"deed to associate\" method. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93-94). For this method, Sussman will have the Owner convey his or her timeshare interest to one of his associates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Each deed states that the associate (grantee) paid the Owner (grantor) consideration in the amount of ten dollars (or some other amount). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-14, p. 7). But this consideration is never exchanged. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 133-134). Sussman simply pays the associate $ 100 to accept the deed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110, 112).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Sussman admits that he does \"nothing\" to ensure that his associates have the ability and intent to pay the financial obligations associated with the timeshare interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-12, 134-35, 300). Once the transaction is effectuated, Sussman receives billing statements from Plaintiffs, but he does not forward those statements to his associates-the alleged new owners of the timeshares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 239-40). According to Sussman, the statements are \"trash.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Prior to employing the \"deed to associate\" method, Sussman fails to give Plaintiffs an opportunity to exercise their right of first refusal as provided in the Owners' timeshare contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135-136). Furthermore, after Sussman \"transfers\" a timeshare to one of his associates, he does not provide Plaintiffs with any notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 366-367). Despite Plaintiffs' lack of notice, Sussman claims that his \"deed to associate\" method is \"absolutely\" effective if Plaintiffs never challenge it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146). He also claims that his deeds absolve timeshare Owners of liability, not because of any legal process, but rather because anti-deficiency statutes may limit any remedy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   122-24). Sussman is aware that Plaintiffs do not consider these deeds as legitimate transfers of an Owner's timeshare interest, but Sussman never informs the Owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Damage to Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Through this purported scheme, Sussman and TET have advised thousands of clients that they were exited from their timeshare agreements when in fact they were not. (Doc. 224-2, p. 5, n.4;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-14, pp. 7-8). Rather than informing the clients affected by the inaccurate information, TET and Sussman \"elected to not tell the [clients] the truth.\" (Doc. 224-2, p. 5, n.4). Instead, they \"instructed the account coordinators to conceal the information\" and profited to the tune of millions of dollars. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 224-7, pp. 32-34 (Sussman's testimony that he received approximately 7,800 referrals from TET and was paid at least $ 500 per file, which amounts to approximately $ 3.9 million in revenue for Sussman alone) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants on August 24, 2017, seeking monetary and injunctive relief. (Doc. 1). On December 5, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint (Doc. 251) asserting claims for tortious interference with existing contracts (Count I), civil conspiracy (Counts III &amp; IV), violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.201\">\n    Fla.

(Docs. 197, 237). Plaintiffs oppose Sussman's motion. (Doc. 224). Therefore, this matter is ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Evidence of a Conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To prevail on a claim for conspiracy, a plaintiff must prove: (1) an agreement between two or more parties, (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (3) the doing of some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) damage to plaintiff as a result of the acts done under the conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Charles v.

He argues that there is no proof of a conspiracy because his \"client attorney agreement\" with TET \"is neither unlawful[,] nor does it require [him] to perform a lawful act by unlawful means.\" (Doc. 197, p. 5). However, \"[c]onspiracies are rarely evidenced by explicit agreements[ ] and must almost always be proven by inferences that may be fairly drawn from the behavior of the alleged conspirators.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeLong Equip.

Therefore, the Court must look beyond a defendant's bald denial of concerted action and look to the evidence to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538357\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/887/1499/#p1515\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to the evidence submitted by Plaintiffs, TET lured timeshare owners, including Orange Lake Owners, into retaining its services by making false promises to relieve owners of their timeshare obligations. Specifically, TET advertised that it would utilize its \"proprietary process\" to get rid of an owners' timeshare contracts \"[s]afely\" and \"[l]egitimately\". (Doc. 189-1; Doc. 189-2; Doc. 224-2, \u00b6\u00b6 3-11). As a result, Orange Lake Owners executed retainer agreements with TET,\n   and at TET's direction, stopped making payments under their timeshare agreements with Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-6). But TET had no proprietary process. (Doc. 224-2, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 17). TET simply transferred the Owners' files to contract attorneys, like Sussman, who received at least $ 500 per file. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; Doc. 197-3, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Doc. 224-7, \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Sussman did not communicate with the Owners or investigate the specific circumstances underlying their cases. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 36, 60-61, 98, 181). Instead, Sussman sent formulaic letters to the Plaintiffs informing them that the Owners would no longer be making contractually obligated timeshare payments and that Plaintiffs could \"take back their timeshare[s].\" (Doc. 224-7, p. 98, 203-204). With the knowledge and approval of TET, Sussman then employed three \"exit\" strategies that he knew Plaintiffs did not accept as valid cancellations of a timeshare contract. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 104, 272; Doc. 224-10, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Sussman and TET also represented to Orange Lake Owners that they were released from their contractual obligations to Plaintiffs when in fact they were not. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-14, pp. 6-8; Doc. 224-2, p. 5 n.4). As a result, Plaintiffs have initiated foreclosure actions against hundreds of Owners, thereby subjecting the Owners to negative credit reporting implications. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 224-14, p. 9; Doc. 224-7, 105-06; Doc. 224-2, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24). Based on these facts a jury could reasonably find that TET and Sussman conspired to interfere with the timeshare agreements between Plaintiffs and Orange Lake Owners. Accordingly, the Court will not grant Sussman's motion on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Privilege to Interfere\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   An action for civil conspiracy only exists if \"the basis for the conspiracy is an independent wrong or tort which would constitute a cause of action if the wrong were done by one person.\"\n   <em>\n    Blatt v. Green, Rose, Kahn &amp; Piotrkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624348\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/456/949/#p951\">\n    456 So.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 951 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984). As noted above, Plaintiffs allege that TET and Sussman conspired to interfere with the timeshare agreements between Plaintiffs and Orange Lake Owners (Count III). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 251, \u00b6\u00b6 102-109). Therefore, Plaintiffs' claim for conspiracy is grounded in its claim for tortious interference with existing contracts (Count I). (Doc. 251, \u00b6\u00b6 89-101, 102-109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Florida courts generally hold that an agent cannot be held liable for tortiously interfering with the contract of his principal because the agent is privileged to act in the principal's best interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sloan v.

Relying on this principle, Sussman argues that Plaintiffs' claim for tortious interference (and therefore their claim for conspiracy) fails because, as the agent for Orange Lake Owners, he was privileged to interfere with their timeshare contracts. (Doc. 197, pp. 6-8). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   An agency relationship exists in Florida when the principal acknowledges that the agent will act for him, when the agent accepts the undertaking on the principal's behalf, and when the principal controls the actions of the agent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldschmidt v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 224-2, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15, 16). Nor did they instruct, advise, or control the means by which Sussman attempted to \"exit\" them from their timeshare contracts. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 224-6 (affidavits from Owners who affirm that they were\n   not aware that Sussman was working on their cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Sussman was acting as an agent for, and at the direction of, TET. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 197-3, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 197, p. 7 (admitting that \"Sussman was acting ... at the direction of his\n   <em>\n    client\n   </em>\n   TET\") (emphasis added). Sussman admits that he never consulted with, met with, or otherwise communicated with any of TET's clients, including Orange Lake Owners. (Doc. 224-7, pp. 36, 60-61, 181). In fact, if one of TET's clients called him to inquire about their case, Sussman would \"let them know that they needed to discuss the matter directly with [TET]\" because he was \"not being paid for\n   <em>\n    customer\n   </em>\n   service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On these facts, the Court cannot reasonably conclude that an agency relationship existed between Sussman and Orange Lake Owners. Even if Sussman had an agency relationship with Orange Lake Owners, his \"privilege to interfere\" with their contracts was not absolute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sloan v.

(Doc. 224-7, pp. 36, 98). He merely sent form letters to Plaintiffs and then employed one of his three \"exit\" strategies. (Doc. 224-7, at 96, 98, 50-51). Despite knowing that Plaintiffs do not accept any of his \"exit\" strategies, Sussman falsely informed Orange Lake Owners that they were successfully \"exited\" from their timeshare agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104, 272; Doc. 224-10, \u00b6 8; Doc. 224-14, p. 6; Doc. 224-2, p. 5 n.4). As a result, Plaintiffs filed foreclosure actions against hundreds of Orange Lake Owners, subjecting them to negative credit reporting consequences.

(Doc. 37 at 2-3). As support for his position, Sussman largely relies on\n   <em>\n    Silverhorse Racing, LLC v.

(Doc. 197, p. 9). He also relies on\n   <em>\n    Marco Island Cable, Inc. v.

July 3, 2006), in which the court found that the defendant's act of sending cease and desist letters to distributors, demanding that they stop selling unlicensed and infringing products, was immunized from civil liability pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201814333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Sussman's letters differ significantly from the letters in\n   <em>\n    Silverhorse\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Marco Island\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the letters in those cases, Sussman's letters do not demand that Plaintiffs stop committing an illegal act. Nor do those letters assert any legal claims against Plaintiffs or threaten to sue. Furthermore, Sussman has never filed and (according to his client retainer agreement with TET) would not \"file legal action [against Plaintiffs] in either state or federal court\". (Doc. 224-4, p. 2; Doc. 224-7, pp. 95, 272). Accordingly, Sussman has not engaged in the type of prelitigation activity that is shielded from liability under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Even assuming Sussman had engaged in prelitigation activity by sending the letters, the Court still could not conclude that he is immune from liability for two reasons: For starters, Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim is not premised solely on the letters he sent to the Plaintiffs, but also on the methods he used to \"exit\" Orange Lake Owners from their timeshare contracts. And genuine issues of fact remain as to\n   whether Sussman's letters fall within the sham exception of the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   doctrine. As Plaintiffs note, a jury could reasonably conclude that Sussman's letters were objectively baseless and not reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome because (1) Sussman sent boilerplate letters to Plaintiffs without ever communicating with Orange Lake Owners to determine they could legitimately and lawfully \"exit\" their timeshare agreements; (2) Sussman never investigated the circumstances underlying an Owner's case; and (3) he employed one of three \"exit\" methods that he knew were expressly rejected by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Likewise, a jury could find that Sussman had the subjective intent to interfere with the timeshare contracts between Plaintiffs and Orange Lake Owners - rather than to petition the government for redress - because he never threatened or initiated litigation against Plaintiffs and his client retainer agreement with TET expressly states that litigation was completely outside the scope of his services. Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that Sussman is entitled to immunity under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Florida's Litigation Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Florida's litigation privilege affords absolute immunity for acts or statements during the course of judicial proceedings if they have some relation to the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Levin, Middlebrooks, Mabie, Thomas, Mayes &amp; Mitchell, P.A. v.

However, Sussman's has supplied no evidence showing that his letters were required by statute or by contract as a condition precedent to suit. Nor has he provided evidence showing that his letters were related to the prosecution or defense of a suit. As noted above, Sussman has never filed, and according to his agreement with TET, he would not file suit against Plaintiffs. Therefore, the Court does not find that Sussman's letters fall within the ambit of Florida's litigation privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trent v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230947\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/618/1356/#p1360\">\n    618 F.Supp.2d 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1360 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (declining to extend the litigation privilege to \"pre-suit communications\" where such communications were not required by law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Intra-corporate Conspiracy Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Sussman also contends that Plaintiffs' claim for conspiracy fails because he is an attorney/agent for TET, and pursuant to the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine, an agent cannot conspire with his corporate principal or employer. (Doc. 197, p. 14). However, Florida courts recognize the \"personal stake\" exception to the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Richard Bertram, Inc. v.

Under this exception, where an agent has a \"personal stake in the activities separate from the principal's interest,\" the agent can be liable for civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9407541\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/820/963/#p966\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To prove such a personal stake, an agent must have \"a personal stake in the activities that are separate and distinct from the corporation's interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Lipsig v.

Fla. 2008) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In the present case, Plaintiffs have proffered evidence showing that TET profited from the alleged conspiracy by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , collecting upfront fees from timeshare owners, including Orange Lake Owners. (Doc. 224-2, \u00b6 11; Doc. 224-6, pp. 4, 9, 14, 17). Sussman, on the other hand, profited by receiving $ 500 for every client file he received from TET. (Doc. 224-7, p. 34). Indeed, Sussman admits that he has received approximately 7,800 referrals from TET, which amounts to approximately $ 3.9 million in revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-34). These facts are sufficient to allow a jury to conclude that Sussman had a personal stake in the conspiracy that was separate and distinct from TET. Accordingly, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs' claim is barred by the intra-corporate doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
