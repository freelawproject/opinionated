For the reasons explained below, Defendants' motion is granted. Defendants' Motion for\n   Judgment on the Pleadings as to Plaintiff's Claim for Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (Sixth Cause of Action) [Doc. # 128], filed as to the initial complaint which has now been amended, is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action began in December 2017 when Plaintiff P&amp;L Development LLC (\"PLD\") sued Defendants Bionpharma Inc. and Bionpharma Healthcare LLC (collectively \"Bion\") alleging claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Compl. [Doc. # 7].) In January 2018, PLD moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and the temporary restraining order was granted in limited part. Prior to the scheduled hearing on the preliminary injunction and other matters, the parties reached an agreement on the preliminary injunction. During the hearing, their motion for a stay until June 1, 2018 was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the period of stay ended, Bion filed its Answer and Counterclaim and moved for judgment on the pleadings as to PLD's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim. Afterwards, PLD amended its complaint by modifying the factual and legal allegations and adding a claim of fraud. (Am. Compl. [Doc. # 126].) Bion answered and once again moved for judgment on the pleadings as to PLD's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PLD, a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in New York, and Bion, Delaware companies\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with their principal places of business in New Jersey, were successor parties to four agreements (\"Agreements\") entered into in 2003, 2004, 2011, and 2012 according to which Bion and its predecessors would manufacture, imprint, and bulk package pharmaceuticals (\"Products\") which PLD and its predecessor would then market and sell as a private label or store brand. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 4; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4; Ex. C to Am. Compl., 2003 Ibuprofen Agreement; Ex. D to Am. Compl., 2012 Naproxen Agreement; Ex. E to Am. Compl., 2011 Cetirizine Agreement; Ex. F to Am. Compl., 2004 Loperamide Agreement.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Each of the Agreements had a defined Term that would automatically renew at the end of the Term for one year unless a party gave the requisite written notice of non-renewal. (Ibuprofen Supply Agreement \u00a7 8.1 &amp; Amends.; Naproxen Supply Agreement \u00a7 10.1; Cetirizine Supply Agreement \u00a7 10.1; Loperamide Supply Agreement \u00a7 8.1.) In September 2017, Bion notified PLD of its intent not to renew the Agreements \"upon expiration of their current terms on March 31, 2018.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. B to Am. Compl., Letter from Bion to P&amp;L Dev. of N.Y. Corp. (Sept. 11, 2017).) The Agreements obligated Bion \"to provide Products to PLD at least through March 31, 2018, and later under certain Supply Agreements if outstanding firm orders were received prior to\" that date. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 42.) Despite this obligation, and well before notifying PLD of its intent not to renew the Agreements, Bion began reducing or rejecting PLD's orders and\n   instructing Patheon Softgels, Inc. (\"Patheon\"), the manufacturer of the Products with whom Bion contracted, to redirect its manufacturing from PLD to Bion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Agreements called for PLD to place its orders with Bion which forwarded them to Patheon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30, 50, 74, 96, 113.) After Patheon manufactured the Products at its High Point, North Carolina facility, it would ship them directly to PLD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 74, 96, 113.) However, in May 2017, Bion began reducing or rejecting some of PLD's purchase orders for Ibuprofen and Naproxen, at times taking the position that it was entitled to do so and at other times taking the position that there was a shortage of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (\"API\") for the Products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 75-76, 78-79, 137.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In emails to PLD in October 2017, Bion rejected two purchase orders for Ibuprofen because \" 'there continue to remain issues with API for IBU, etc.' \" and then explained that there were \" 'shortages in raw material' \" beyond Bion's control, including the lack of \" 'any commitments beyond Oct supply of API' \", that could \" 'impact [Bion's] ability to fulfill an order' \". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 221.a., 221.b.) In November, after PLD complained of Bion's purchase order rejections, Bion emailed PLD to say once again that there was a shortage of API \" 'due to circumstances beyond [Bion's] reasonable control' \" and that Bion could not fulfill one specific purchase order \" 'based on the supply situation' \". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 221.c., 221.d.) Later that month, Bion's general counsel, Lavesh Samtani, spoke with PLD's general counsel, Charles Cain, who was in North Carolina at the time, and explained that Bion had not been able to supply PLD with the Products \"because of an API shortage, which was out of Bion's control.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 221.e.) In an email two days later, Samtani repeated to Cain, in North Carolina at the time, and others that \" 'due to lack of supply of materials and for reasons out of [Bion's] control\", Bion could not supply Products to PLD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 221.f.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yet, according to Patheon's representative, there was no API shortage that impacted Patheon's ability to manufacture all of the Products PLD had ordered, had Bion submitted the orders to Patheon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 81, 146, 223;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 80 (suggesting that to the extent there was any minor shortage of API for Patheon, there was API from alternate sources).) When PLD representatives visited Patheon's manufacturing facility on December 1, 2017, they saw \"ample quantities of the necessary API to satisfy PLD's orders\", \"active manufacturing lines running with both Ibuprofen softgels and Naproxen softgels\", and \"large quantities of Ibuprofen softgels and Naproxen softgels packaged and ready for shipping with PLD's address affixed to the pallets stored in Patheon's warehouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141.) PLD notified Bion of its observations, and on December 4, 2017, Samtani emailed Cain, who was in North Carolina, that \"Bion was making 'reasonable and good faith efforts to supply [PLD] with all products' \", denied \" 'withholding any products from PLD' \", and stated that there was \" 'simply no need for PLD to go to Patheon' to check the status\" of its orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 221.h.) PLD relied on these representations when it failed to contact \"alternate suppliers\" because \"an API shortage in the industry\" made it \"likely that other suppliers would be experiencing the same problem and not be able to fill any orders that PLD might place because the raw materials were not available.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 228.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September, Bion began reducing or rejecting PLD's purchase orders for Cetirizine and Loperamide and would not direct or allow Patheon to fill those orders, taking the same position it had with the other Products - that it was entitled to do so\n   under the terms of the Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97, 100, 114-117.) Had Bion submitted the orders to Patheon, Patheon could have filled all of PLD's orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102, 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Patheon questioned why PLD's orders had fallen, Bion still did not forward the orders to Patheon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Instead, as early as July 2017, Bion began instructing Patheon to focus on making the Products for Bion and not to make them for PLD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 83, 99, 146.) In September 2017, Bion requested Patheon create new codes and print formats to distinguish Bion's Products from PLD's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63, 136.) By January 2018, Bion had received from Patheon for its own use more than 260 million Ibuprofen softgels, 36 million Naproxen softgels, 25 million Cetirizine softgels, and 22 million Loperamide softgels which it was stockpiling at a warehouse in Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 83, 99, 119, 225.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a result of Bion's conduct, there was a shortage of Products which caused PLD to lose substantial sales and goodwill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 68-70, 86, 92, 109, 126, 148, 154, 157;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103, 121 (alleging that the \"substantial shortage of Cetirizine\" and \"Loperamide softgels\" \"hindered PLD's ability to meet its contracts with its customers\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PLD has alleged that Bion committed unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n    N.C.

Products in the marketplace by refusing PLD's purchase orders\", and \"instructing Patheon to re-direct some of the manufacturing capacity ... to make Products for Bion ... so that it would have a substantial inventory of products ... when the ... Agreements expired\". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 236-41.) In addition, Bion refused to ship Products in December 2017 \"unless PLD provided Bion with detailed information about PLD's customers and the quantities of Products those customers have ordered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 247.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed - but early enough not to delay trial - a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" A court considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings must \"view the facts presented in the pleadings and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Atwater ex rel.

To the extent PLD is suggesting that the governing law provisions in the Agreements dictate that North Carolina law apply to its unfair and deceptive trade practices claim, both the language of the Agreements and the law belie that argument. Each of the Agreements provides, in relevant part, that \"\n   <em>\n    [t]his Agreement\n   </em>\n   shall be governed and construed in all respects by and under the laws of North Carolina, without regard to any choice of law principles that would obtain a different result.\" (Ibuprofen Agreement \u00a7 14.3 (emphasis added); Naproxen Agreement \u00a7 17.6 (emphasis added); Cetirizine Agreement \u00a7 17.6 (emphasis added); Loperamide Agreement \u00a7 13.6 (emphasis added).)

(Pl.'s Br. in Opp'n at 20.) PLD contends that \"Bion made misrepresentations to PLD in North Carolina\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and it alleged that, on November 20, November 22, and December 4, 2017, Samtani told Cain - who was in North Carolina at the time - that there was a shortage of API. PLD looks to these three occasions on which Cain, present in North Carolina at the time, received emails and a telephone call from Samtani as support for its position that Bion's misrepresentations took place in North Carolina. Even so, as the\n   <em>\n    Harco\n   </em>\n   court explained, the focus is not where the alleged misrepresentation took place. Instead, the question is where PLD suffered harm from those misrepresentations. There is no allegation that PLD, a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in New York, detrimentally relied on or felt the economic impact of those misrepresentations in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   PLD correctly notes that Bion too narrowly focuses on PLD's allegations of misrepresentations and omits allegations that Bion's other conduct was also unfair and deceptive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to PLD, \"[t]he bulk of PLD's claim is premised on Bion's\n   <em>\n    actions\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These actions include Bion's failure to submit PLD's orders to Patheon, instructing Patheon not to deliver Products to PLD, work with Patheon to develop codes and imprints for Bion's exclusive use, and causing Patheon to use API to manufacture Products for Bion instead of PLD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.) According to PLD, \"[a]ll of these unfair and deceptive acts took place in North Carolina and support PLD's Chapter 75 claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There is no disputing that Patheon, the High Point, North Carolina manufacturer of the Products, was an integral part of Bion's alleged unfair and deceptive acts. However, Patheon is not a party to this action and is not alleged to have acted unlawfully. Despite PLD's argument that it \"affirmatively alleged that Bion's acts ... occurred in North Carolina\" and that \"Patheon's re-directing its manufacturing operations for the Products - which occurred pursuant to Bion's mandate in North Carolina\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22), PLD is simply not alleged to have suffered damages in North Carolina, despite its argument otherwise, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   PLD tries to recharacterize its injury from that which it alleged - loss of substantial sales and reputation - to \"physical deprivation of Products in North Carolina\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). But, this case is not like\n   <em>\n    United Virginia Bank\n   </em>\n   , where the alleged injury was sustained in Virginia when a plane was sold below the promised price, or\n   <em>\n    Lloyd v.

While PLD did not receive all of the Products it ordered, the alleged resulting injury is loss of sales, which was not alleged to have been felt in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   PLD argues that\n   <em>\n    SmithKline Beecham Corp.\n   </em>\n   supports the application of North Carolina law. There, the alleged injury to the plaintiff, GSK, was nationwide lost market share and profits from sales of Lexiva, an HIV drug, after the defendant, Abbot, increased the price to GSK of Abbot's booster drug, Norvir, 400 percent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201051123\">\n    2017 WL 1051123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, *8. GSK was a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal office in Pennsylvania, but with headquarters in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

While GSK \"may have suffered injury in Pennsylvania\", the court found North Carolina was \"where it felt the damages associated with the loss in market share and lost profits related to the HIV market and Lexiva\" and, therefore, applied North Carolina law to the unfair and deceptive practices claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. PLD argues that this \"is precisely what happened here\" because the \"Agreements were formed in North Carolina\", \"Products were manufactured exclusively in North Carolina\", \"PLD inspected the manufacturing facilities in North Carolina\", and \"[t]he withholding of the Products in North Carolina damaged PLD.\" (Pl.'s Br. in Opp'n at 23-24.) Although PLD argues that \"[u]nder the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    GSK\n   </em>\n   , North Carolina law must apply,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24), the facts of\n   <em>\n    SmithKline Beecham Corp.\n   </em>\n   and this case are easily distinguishable. PLD's only alleged presence in North Carolina is its general counsel's office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and its visits to Patheon's manufacturing facility; whereas, GSK's research and development facilities and commercial operations for its HIV/AIDS business were in North Carolina. The reasoning of\n   <em>\n    SmithKline Beecham Corp.\n   </em>\n   does not require application of North Carolina law here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   PLD included among its reasons to apply\n   <em>\n    SmithKline Beecham Corp.\n   </em>\n   the assertion that \"Products were\n   <em>\n    delivered to PLD in North Carolina\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 13, 15 (all stating that Products were delivered to PLD in High Point).)

Stryker Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 02Civ.8613LAK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021660339\">\n    2003 WL 21660339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, 4 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). However, the court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [a]lthough consumers eventually stood to be affected by any defects in the product at issue, the questions whether Pfizer told Stryker the truth when it represented that the business was in compliance with law and whether it intended to comply with its notice and related obligations are essentially private matters. This was a custom-crafted, $ 2 billion transaction between two large, sophisticated parties. It does not come within Section 349.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the disputed conduct is more akin to that in\n   <em>\n    Pfizer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   than any of the cases involving consumer-oriented conduct. First, the gravamen of the Amended Complaint is harm to PLD, not to the public at large. Although PLD alleged harm to consumers, those allegations are sprinkled throughout the complaint alongside allegations of injury to retailers and Patheon's operations, (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60, 88, 89, 107, 108, 124, 125, 149), and are secondary to the allegations of harm to PLD. For example, while Bion's conduct allegedly \"injured the consumers of generic Ibuprofen softgels in North Carolina by limiting business productivity and product availability\" and causing consumers \"who preferred the softgel dosage ... to pay a higher price to purchase the brand product\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65), the same conduct allegedly caused PLD \"to lose substantial sales\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 68), lose \"goodwill\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69), and suffer \"damages and irreparable harm\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70). The allegations of harm resulting from Bion's conduct with respect to generic Naproxen, Cetirizine, and Loperamide are similar to those above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 104, 121, 150 (harm to consumers), \u00b6\u00b6 86, 90, 92, 106, 123, 126, 148, 154, 155 (harm to PLD) ). This harm to PLD is repeated often and highlighted in the Complaint. For example, at the conclusion of the factual allegations related to each of the Agreements, PLD alleges that Bion \"has caused damages and irreparable harm to PLD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 92, 109, 126.) The essence of PLD's complaint is that Bion's alleged anticompetitive conduct was designed to place Bion in the best position\n   possible to compete with PLD once the Agreements expired and, in the meantime, PLD suffered substantial lost sales, reputational damages, and irreparable harm \"in excess of $ 5 million.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, this dispute is not between parties with disparate bargaining power. Bion and PLD are sophisticated businesses involved in the manufacture and sale of generic pharmaceuticals to well-known national retailers, all under the watchful eye of the Food and Drug Administration which granted Bion manufacturing approval, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). PLD essentially served as an intermediary between Bion's allegedly tortious conduct and consumers, providing protection for consumers unsuspecting of Bion's ulterior motives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, these parties and their predecessors have contracted with each other since 2003 for the manufacture and sale of millions of capsules of these Products, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66, 91, 122), and these contracts and their amendments are tailored to the parties' capabilities and needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, Bion's alleged conduct does not have \"a broader impact on consumers at large\" and, is, thus, not consumer-oriented. Instead, this is essentially a private dispute between sophisticated parties that is not covered by the prohibitions of \u00a7 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Memorandum Opinion, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Plaintiff's Claim for Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (Seventh Cause of Action) [Doc. # 136] is GRANTED and that Plaintiff's Seventh Cause of Action is DISMISSED.
