NORTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following matter is before the court on Jane Vaden Thacher (\"Thacher\") and Vaden of Beaufort Inc's (\"the Corporation\"), (together, \"defendants\") motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ECF No. 5, and motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, ECF No. 7. For the reasons set forth below, the court grants the motion to dismiss Thacher for lack of personal jurisdiction and grants in part and denies in part the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Ashley Shane Gault (\"Gault\") brings this action against the Corporation and against Thacher, the President and majority shareholder of the Corporation. Gault argues that Thacher and the Corporation engaged in a course of self-interested dealings that depleted the Corporation's assets and therefore harmed him by decreasing the value of his 10% ownership interest in the Corporation. The Corporation is incorporated under the laws of Georgia, has its headquarters in Georgia, and has its principal place of business (\"PPB\") in Georgia or South Carolina. Defendants attached to their motions to dismiss the Shareholders' Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement that Gault signed in order to obtain his shares in the Corporation. While the Shareholders' Agreement states that the Corporation's PPB is in Savannah, Georgia, the Stock Purchase Agreement states that the Corporation's PPB is in Beaufort, South Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both documents were signed on November 16, 2011. These documents constitute an agreement between Gault, the Corporation, and Vaden of South Carolina (\"Vaden of SC\"). Thacher signed each agreement on behalf of the Corporation and on behalf of Vaden of SC. Gault's complaint and his responses to the motions to dismiss treat these agreements as though they exist between Gault, the Corporation, and Thacher as an individual. However, it is clear that he actually entered into an agreement with the Corporation and Vaden of South Carolina, another corporation of which Thacher is the President. Defendants have not asked the court to pierce the corporate veil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011, Gault became a 10% shareholder in the Corporation and his ownership interest fully vested in 2016. Sometime after October 2017, Gault resigned. He now contends that Thacher and the Corporation engaged in a course of conduct that disadvantaged the Corporation, and thus diminished the amount of money that Gault received for this 10% stock ownership, while benefitting other businesses owned by members of Thacher's family (\"Vaden Family Entities\"). On October 19, 2018, Gault filed suit in the Beaufort County Court of Common Pleas and then filed an amended complaint on November 7, 2018. Defendants removed the action on November 21, 2018. On November 26, 2018, defendants filed their motions to dismiss. ECF Nos. 5 and 7. On December 8, 2018, Gault filed its responses to these motions. ECF Nos. 10 and 11. On December 17, defendants filed their replies. ECF Nos. 15 and 16. The court held a hearing on these matters on February 5, 2019. The motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

While Thacher's role as an officer of the Corporation does not alone justify the court's jurisdiction over her, the court may still exercise jurisdiction over her if it finds that she otherwise engaged in sufficient directed activity in South Carolina in relation to Gault's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In determining whether Thacher exercised sufficient minimum contacts in South Carolina to commit the wrongdoings alleged by Gault, the court may rely on information set forth in the complaint, Thacher's affidavit attached to her motions to dismiss, Gault's affidavit attached to his response to the motion to dismiss, and the various agreements submitted by both parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gault's main grievance is that the Corporation and Thacher diverted funds from the Corporation to the other Vaden Family Entities. He argues that Thacher and the Corporation engaged in a course of self-interested dealings that depleted the Corporation's assets and therefore harmed him by decreasing the value of this 10% ownership interest in the Corporation. He claims that \"Thacher authorized the Corporation to enter into agreements by which the Corporation guaranteed debts incurred by other Vaden Entities, which was not in the best interests of the Corporation or its minority shareholder Shane.\" Am. Comp. \u00b6 6. There is no allegation in this claim that Thacher was doing anything in South Carolina. This is a decision that would have been made at the Georgia headquarters. Thacher Affid. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. Gault then claims that \"Thacher took purposeful and calculated actions to transfer funds from the Corporation in South Carolina to herself and other entities in which she had or has an interest.\" Am. Comp. \u00b6 7. He refers to the \"Corporation in South Carolina,\" but there is no separate corporation in South Carolina; it is headquartered in Georgia, where all agreements are made. Thacher Affid. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. Gault may be referring to the physical dealership in South Carolina, but this is merely an asset of a Georgia Corporation. Gault further specifies in his affidavit that \"[f]unds were transferred from the Beaufort store at Thacher's direction for the use of other Vaden Entities.\" Gault Affid. \u00b6 30. Even presuming Gault's claims to be true, Thacher, as an individual, did\n   not have sufficient minimum contacts with South Carolina simply because she, as an officer of the Corporation, chose to move around money made in South Carolina within the Corporation. Additionally, the Corporation is a single corporate entity, not a parent company in Georgia with a distinct subsidiary company in South Carolina; as such, the income from the Corporation's dealership in South Carolina cannot be considered to exist separately from the overall income generated by the Georgia-based Corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Gault alleges that the \"Corporation also pays management fees to Vaden Family Entities. It also has the opportunity to sell insurance products to its customers. Defendants allowed other Vaden Family Entities to profit from these activities, diverting potential revenue from the Corporation.\" Am. Comp. \u00b6 20. Later, Gault reiterates that \"Thacher required the Corporation to pay 'management fees' and 'support fees' to other Vaden Family Entities for salaries and benefits of administrative personnel despite the fact that the Corporation employed its own administrative personnel since it needed staff knowledgeable in South Carolina DMV, Tax, and other legal requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Specifically, Gault claims that when he began as the General Manager of the dealership, the store was paying $ 10,500 a month in management fees to other Vaden Entities, and that they were paying $ 43,500 in fees by the time he resigned. Gault Affid. \u00b6 36. Again, these allegations do not demonstrate that Thacher purposefully availed herself of the benefits of operating South Carolina in relation to this alleged wrongdoing. This is clearly a shareholder's complaint about minimized returns due to corporate mismanagement. These corporate decisions would have been made at the Georgia headquarters, and Gault has not alleged otherwise. Thacher Affid. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Gault also claims that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Thacher transferred corporate opportunities, funds, and assets of the Corporation in excess of nine million dollars [ ] to other Vaden Family Entities. While those funds appear as receivable on the books of the Corporation, no promissory notes were signed, no repayment terms were required, and no interest has been charged. Thus, Defendant Thacher, as controlling shareholder and Board Member, charged [Gault] 4% interest for his loan, but no interest for $ 9 million in loans to the Vaden Family Entities, in which she had an interest. This has deprived the Corporation of approximately $ 1.5 million in interest payments from the Vaden Family Entities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Am. Comp. \u00b6 30. Here, Gault is talking about the transfer of\n   <em>\n    the Corporation's\n   </em>\n   opportunities and funds. The Corporation is incorporated and headquartered in Georgia. Just because it has a profitable dealership in South Carolina does not mean the Corporation's decisions-which form the basis for the alleged wrongdoing-are made in South Carolina. Those are the types of decisions made by the officers and directors at the Corporation's Georgia headquarters. Thacher Affid. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Gault also takes issue with the manner in which the Corporation handled property leasing matters in South Carolina. The dealership initially leased its property from a third party. Gault claims that when an opportunity arose to purchase land and build a new location, one of the Vaden Family Entities became the landlord and raised the rent significantly, all the while depriving Gault of the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. Am. Comp. \u00b6 19. While the building of the new property and raising of the rent took\n   place in South Carolina, Gault has not alleged that Thacher personally had any contacts in South Carolina\n   <em>\n    in regards to\n   </em>\n   these actions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia Briargate Co. v. First Nat. Bank in Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874427\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/1052/#p1055\">\n    713 F.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1063 (4th Cir. 1983) (\"What is required is some showing of direct, personal involvement by the corporate officer in some decision or action which is causally related to [the tort that caused] the plaintiff's injury.\"). On the contrary, Thacher has reiterated that all major decisions regarding the corporation took place at the headquarters in Georgia by Georgia residents. Next, Gault claims that \"[w]hen another tenant vacated property owned by a Vaden Family Entity and located near the dealership, the Corporation was required to pay the lease from the property rather than locating another tenant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Although this action took place in South Carolina, Gault alleges that the Corporation wrongly paid the lease, and does not allege that these actions were taken by Thacher personally. Additionally, these sorts of decisions were made by those in the Georgia headquarters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Gault also raises several miscellaneous claims. First, Gault claims that \"Thacher had a duty to hold regular Board and Shareholders meetings but failed to do so. This failure prevented Shane from being informed of business practices detrimental to him.\" Am. Comp. \u00b6 17. This alleged harm has nothing to do with South Carolina. It is merely Gault's complaint as a shareholder that the officers and directors-all of whom are based Georgia, along with the Corporation's headquarters-failed to hold regular meetings. The Corporation's shareholder meetings take place in Georgia. Thacher Affid. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   None of these allegations give rise to the court's personal jurisdiction over Thacher because they either involve (1) allegations that the Corporation, not Thacher, committed the wrongdoing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (2) decisions regarding the corporation that were made at the Corporation's headquarters in Georgia by officers and directors who reside in Georgia. Thacher Affid. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10-13. For those few allegations which actually specifically reference Thacher, none of them involve her individually directing enough activity into South Carolina to give rise to personal jurisdiction. Gault asks the court to find that Thacher had enough \"direct personal involvement\" in South Carolina because she was the \"guiding spirit behind the wrongful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Briargate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874427\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/1052/#p1055\">\n    713 F.2d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regardless of whether Thacher was the \"guiding spirit\" for some of the Gault's harms, those harms stem solely from decisions made and actions taken in Georgia. The court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over her as an individual due to \"direct personal involvement\" in activities that took place in Georgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This case resembles\n   <em>\n    Sheppard v. Jacksonville Marine Supply, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7842862\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/877/260/#p267\">\n    877 F.Supp. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 (D.S.C. 1995), in which this court found it had personal jurisdiction over the foreign president of a foreign corporation that did business in South Carolina but declined to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign vice president of the corporation. The president, Thomas Shanty (\"Shanty\"), travelled multiple times a year for about ten years to the Jax Marine warehouse that his Florida-based company operated in South Carolina. Shanty and the plaintiff had conducted several meetings in South Carolina regarding the plaintiff investing in Shanty's business. The plaintiff eventually invested in the company, and the defendants' failure to return that investment after becoming insolvent was the entire basis for the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   By contrast, the court found that \"the litigation does not directly rise as a result of [the Vice President's] involvement with the Jax Marine warehouse in South Carolina and its sales and distribution activities within the state\" and that \"the allegations asserted against [the Vice President] are general in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7842862\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/877/260/#p267\">\n    877 F.Supp. at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia had to decide whether to exercise personal jurisdiction over two corporate officers who resided in Virginia and who had been involved in the merger of a company that was to now exist in West Virginia. These directors had solicited another company's proxy to vote its shares in favor of the proposed merger. The court found that it had jurisdiction over the foreign officers because \"[w]herever the actual acts took place in soliciting the proxy or wherever the proxy was mailed from and to, it could have been given effect only in West Virginia by virtue of the laws of West Virginia under which [the company] operated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768009\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/522/#p527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768009\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/522/#p527\">\n    at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that, under certain circumstances, \"[e]xcellent reasons exist for allowing a State to assert jurisdiction over non-resident directors of domestic corporations\" and that states have \"a strong, even compelling interest in providing a forum for redressing harm done by corporate fiduciaries,\n   <em>\n    harm endured principally by a resident of that State, the corporation\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768009\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/522/#p527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   differs significantly from this case. The defendants in\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   , while not physically travelling to West Virginia, had played an integral role in a merger which resulted in a new corporation existing under the laws of West Virginia. Thus, their actions were clearly directed towards West Virginia, and they had availed themselves of the benefits of operating under West Virginia law with this newly merged corporation. By contrast, Gault has not alleged that Thacher directed actions towards South Carolina that had as substantial an impact on the state of South Carolina such as creating a new corporation that operates under the laws of South Carolina. Gault claims that Thacher came to Beaufort, South Carolina \"six or seven times to view the store and to review the profits and losses in the sales and services departments,\" and that he \"spoke frequently with Thacher by telephone from the Beaufort store regarding the financial operations of Vaden of Beaufort.\" Gault Affid. \u00b6 33, 34. A handful of visits and regular phone calls do not provide the court with enough evidence to find that Thacher availed herself of the opportunity of operating in South Carolina in regards specifically to Gault's claims of corporate malfeasance. The harms of which Gault complains are shareholder losses, which result from the corporate decisions made\n   in Georgia, not from purposeful actions by Thacher individually in South Carolina. Therefore, the court grants Thacher's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Those claims are always brought by shareholders against officers, directors, or majority shareholders of a corporation-sometimes as derivative suits on behalf of a corporation-but never directly against the corporation alone. Since the only officer in this suit, Thacher, has been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, the court finds that Gault cannot sustain his breach of fiduciary duty claim against the Corporation alone.

However, defendants do not specify what they mean by \"activities\" or even which portion of the Shareholders' Agreement authorizes these activities.

Craft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026952\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/372/1/\">\n    372 S.C. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026952\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/372/1/\">\n    640 S.E.2d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (S.C. Ct. App. 2006). Gault has not demonstrated in his complaint that defendants' actions have adversely affected the public interest or will in the future. He alleges that \"Defendant's conduct is capable of repetition and directly affects the public interest,\" but has not offered anything in support of this conclusory statement. Gault's arguments at the hearing did not persuade the court on this\n   issue. Thus, the court dismisses this cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ix. Tenth Cause of Action: Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Yet again, defendants' main argument in support of dismissing this cause of action is that \"[f]or the reasons explained above, the conduct complained above by Plaintiff was specifically authorized by the Agreement, which he executed.\" ECF No. 5 at 16. Defendants also argue that Gault has not alleged any wrongful acts by the Corporation that could constitute a conversion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026952\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/372/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, Gault merely claims that \"the Agreement did not allow funds to be transferred to other Vaden Entities to the detriment of Vaden of Beaufort and [Gault],\" and that \"defendants are given fair notice of this claim.\" ECF No. 10 at 21. The court is unimpressed with the lack of arguments by both parties regarding the cause of action and is uninterested in making their arguments for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, the court notes that the conversion claim only alleges that \"\n   <em>\n    Thacher\n   </em>\n   [ ] converted to her own use and benefit property belonging to [Gault] by diverting assets to other Vaden Family Entities, thereby reducing the benefits of his ownership interest.\" Am Comp \u00b6 89 (emphasis added). The conversion cause of action does not mention any wrongdoings by the Corporation. Although the complaint, when recapping the allegations against defendants, states that \"defendants' ... divert[ed] retained earnings of the Corporation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40, all of the allegations of fact in the amended complaint preceding this statement assert only that Thacher was diverting funds, and do not specify that the Corporation did as well,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, 33, 34, 39. As such, the court dismisses the tenth cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    x. Eleventh Cause of Action: Specific Performance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Gault's claim for specific performance is based on the provision in the Shareholders' Agreement stating that the value of Gault's shares will be based upon the certified financial statement of the Corporation for the last year in which he was employed. Gault notes in his response to the motion to dismiss that defendants produced a copy of a \"certified financial statement\" after suit was filed, but that he still has questions regarding the work undertaken by the CPA to certify the statement which is identical to the previously uncertified report. As such, he asks the court to order the Corporation to provide him with a certified financial statement for 2017. Defendants argue that the Agreement does not provide that defendants will make a copy of this statement available to the Gault. They are correct. Section 3 of the Shareholders' Agreement states that Gault's stock value will be calculated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The 'Stockholder's Equity' in the corporation as defined by the certified financial statement of the corporation for the year immediately preceding the triggering event shall be increased by an amount equal to 75% of the corporation's LIFO reserve as defined in that same financial statement. This total value shall be divided by the total number of shares of the corporation outstanding and that individual share value shall then be multiplied by the number of shares owned by Gault as the retiring or selling shareholder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Gault's resignation was a \"triggering event.\" Section 3 provides that his stock value shall be calculated based on the financial statement but does not offer to provide a copy of this statement to Gault. For this reason, the court dismisses the eleventh cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over Thacher, ECF No. 7, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ECF No. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    AND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    At the hearing, Gault began to argue that the court had general personal jurisdiction over Thacher. When the court pointed out that these arguments were not raised in Gault's briefs, he persisted that his response to the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction did in fact properly argue that the court had general jurisdiction over Thacher. However, upon review of his response, the court affirms that he did not present a general jurisdiction argument in regards to Thacher. Gault devotes the majority of his brief to specific personal jurisdiction and devotes six sentences to general jurisdiction. Of these, five sentences lay out the law of general jurisdiction, with the final sentence contending that \"[t]his court clearly has general jurisdiction over Vaden of Beaufort, even if specific jurisdiction is absent, because it has 'continually endeavored to exploit the South Carolina market' for over 10 years.' \" ECF No. 11 (internal quotations omitted). In contrast to his argument that the court has general personal jurisdiction over the Corporation, which defendants concede, Gault has not made any claim regarding the court's general personal jurisdiction over Thacher individually. Gault did not offer sufficient arguments at the hearing on this motion regarding general personal jurisdiction over Thacher to supplement his brief's shortcomings on this front, leaving the court unconvinced that it has general personal jurisdiction over Thacher.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    \"Where, as here, there has been no evidentiary hearing and the Court proceeds upon the written submissions, plaintiffs must make only a prima facie showing that jurisdiction exists.\"\n    <em>\n     Magic Toyota, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"148763\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/784/306/#p310\">\n     784 F.Supp. at 310\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"In reviewing the record before it, a court may consider pleadings, affidavits, and other evidentiary materials without converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     VDI Technologies v.
