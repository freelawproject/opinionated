Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As alleged in their complaint, Plaintiffs Jesus Sarmiento and Juan Chavez are former employees of Sealy's mattress manufacturing facility in Richmond, California. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Sarmiento \"worked concurrently as a loader, taper or sewer\" during his employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), Sarmiento was entitled to a different hourly rate for each job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Sealy did not \"pay Sarmiento and other putative class members the higher hourly rates when required.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that they regularly worked shifts exceeding twelve hours a day without receiving the proper overtime rate, and that Sealy furnished wage statements that omitted required information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that an incident occurred at the facility on May 26, 2017, when two Sealy management officials introduced a new points-based disciplinary system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. After the system was introduced, Chavez asked management why they had not informed employees of the new system, given that it had already gone into effect on May 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The confrontation escalated into shouting, and when Sarmiento attempted to intervene, one of the management officials threatened him as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the employees dispersed for lunch, Sarmiento became ill and decided that he need to go home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Although Sarmiento communicated this reason to a co-worker, he was unable to get in touch with either his supervisor or his union representative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Within two hours, Sarmiento received a call informing him that he had been terminated\n   for job abandonment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sarmiento did not receive his final paycheck until June 2, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Chavez was placed on administrative leave after the May 26, 2017 town hall meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.
