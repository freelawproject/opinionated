The Court has reviewed the Motion, all supporting and opposing submissions and exhibits, the record, and the applicable law, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from an automobile accident that occurred on September 30, 2017. Defendant admitted liability. Following a three-day jury trial commencing on\n   November 6, 2018 on the issue of damages, the jury returned verdicts in favor of each Plaintiff. As to Plaintiff Alejandro Torres, the jury awarded past medical expenses ($ 396,261.13), past pain and suffering ($ 600,000.00), and future pain and suffering ($ 1,500,000.00). As to Plaintiff Juan Torres, the jury awarded past medical expenses ($ 877,604.38), past pain and suffering ($ 1,050,000.00), and future pain and suffering ($ 3,000,000.00). ECF No. [109]. On November 13, 2018, the Court entered Final Judgement in favor of the Plaintiffs for a total award of $ 7,423,855.51. ECF No. [4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 11, 2018, Defendant filed the present Motion for New Trial, or, in the alternative, that remittitur be awarded, based on juror non-disclosure of prior litigation history and because the jury awards for past medical expenses and future pain and suffering are against the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Among other relief, a court may grant a new jury trial under Rule 59 \"for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a). For instance, a party may assert that \"the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, that the damages are excessive, or that, for other reasons, the trial was not fair to the party moving.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v.

Specifically, Defendant provided court documents demonstrating that Juror YC had been sued three times by banks to recover debts, twice in foreclosure, and once by the State of Florida\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [141-2].

Defendant argues that the responses of Juror YC and Juror ES to question 10 of the juror questionnaire and their silence in response to the oral question concerning prior litigation history amount to a failure to honestly answer a material question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    1. Dishonesty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   test, the Court must determine whether a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on\n   <em>\n    voir dire.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the Jurors' answers were dishonest. Plaintiff specifically addresses question 10 of the juror questionnaire, arguing that the question is ambiguous because it defines being \"a party to a lawsuit\" as having \"sued someone or been sued by someone.\" Because each lawsuit Defendant identified in the litigation history of Juror YC and Juror ES was initiated by a corporation, not an individual, the Plaintiff contends that the jurors could have believed that they had not been sued by\n   <em>\n    someone.\n   </em>\n   The record evidence presented by the Defendant certainly supports the Plaintiffs' argument. However, for purposes of the Motion and further analysis, the Court will assume that the Jurors' answers on the juror questionnaire were dishonest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BankAtlantic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293151\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/955/1467/#p1473\">\n    955 F.2d 1467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1473 (11th Cir. 1992) (affirming denial of motion for new trial for failure to show actual bias where district court assumed that jurors' non-disclosure during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   was dishonest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court cannot find, however, that Jurors YC's and ES's silence when\n   questioned during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   amounts to dishonesty. Jurors were asked: \"Is there anyone that has been involved in a civil lawsuit that has shaped your view either negatively or positively about the legal system that you believe would have an effect on your ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror.\" First, merely being involved in prior litigation does not necessarily shape one's view about the legal system. Second, to the extent that a juror's litigation history did shape his or her view of the legal system, it certainly does not necessarily follow that the juror believes that it has\n   <em>\n    affected\n   </em>\n   his or her ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror. The Court will not engage in second-guessing this kind of opinion-based juror expression which could only be speculated to be dishonest, nor is the Court required to hold an evidentiary hearing to investigate the issue further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New v.

ECF No. [137] at 5. Defendant further contends that because \"Plaintiffs' entitlement to recover the full amount of their hospital bills, notwithstanding a hospital's potential right of subrogation\" was at issue during trial, \"jurors who had been repeatedly sued for non-payment of a debt\" are reasonably likely to be biased in favor of Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant has failed to demonstrate bias.

On the surface, there is little to no connection between the present case and a lawsuit by a bank to recover a debt, a foreclosure, a lawsuit by a condominium association to recover unpaid assessments, or a personal bankruptcy. And the Court is not persuaded by Defendant's attempt to link the present case and the cases in Juror YC's and Juror ES's past as involving a \"David versus Goliath\" atmosphere, causing the jurors to be biased against corporations. The Court finds little reason to presume that an individual who had been sued by a bank to recover unpaid credit card bills, for example, would be biased against an unrelated corporation such as First Transit. An individual's history of having been sued by corporations bears only a very general connection to a case in which an unrelated corporation is a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nor is the Court persuaded by Defendant's argument that because Plaintiffs' entitlement to recover the full amount of their hospital bills was at issue during trial, jurors who had been sued for non-payment of a debt are reasonably likely to be biased in favor of Plaintiffs. Defendant argues that jury selection demonstrated that the question of whether jurors could fairly try Plaintiffs' entitlement to recover the full amount of their hospital bills, notwithstanding a hospital's right of subrogation, was a potential issue in this case. But, the purported connection between lawsuits for non-payment of a debt and a personal injury case in which a jury must determine the reasonableness of Plaintiffs' medical bills is distant, and certainly far more attenuated than the connection between a gender discrimination claim and racial discrimination claim that the Eleventh Circuit considered in\n   <em>\n    Darnell\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, there is no evidence that Jurors YC or ES had a motive to intentionally omit from their jury questionnaire that they had been defendants in lawsuits for recovery of debts so that they could serve on a jury to award Plaintiffs the full amount of their medical bills, particularly given that jurors completed the questionnaires before they were made aware of this potential issue.\n   <em>\n    BankAtlantic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293151\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/955/1467/#p1473\">\n    955 F.2d at 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no bias where jurors had no \"motive to conceal information just to get on the jury and find against [plaintiff]\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Additionally, this Court questioned all the potential jurors as to whether they could serve as fair and impartial jurors and specifically addressed the issue of potential bias against corporations.

Neither Juror YC or ES answered in the affirmative to any of these questions. Accordingly, the record indicates the Jurors YC and ES were willing and able to be fair and impartial in this case and Defendant has failed to show any actual bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

Specifically, Defendant takes issue with the jury's award of the full amount of each Plaintiffs' medical bills from Delray Medical Center-$ 669,779.21 as to Juan Torres and $ 356,744.81 as to Alejandro Torres. Additionally, the jury awarded Alejandro Torres $ 1.5 million and Juan Torres $ 3 million in future pain and suffering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    1. Past Medical Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to prove the reasonableness and necessity of the Delray Medical Center bills. Defendant contends the only evidence before the jury concerning the reasonableness of the Delray Medical Center bills was the expert testimony of Dr. Zeide, opining that a reasonable charge for the hospital services would have been 15% of the charged amounts. Defendant\n   concedes that a plaintiff's testimony that medical bills were incurred as a result of an injury will suffice to allow the bills into evidence but insists that a plaintiff's testimony may only link the medical treatment to the injuries resulting from the accident, not show the reasonableness of the amount of the medical bills. ECF No. 152 at 9-10. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Florida Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Garrett v. Morris Kirschman &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   concluded that the plaintiff's testimony alone \"made it a question for the jury to decide ... whether [medical] bills represented reasonable and necessary expenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9670274\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/336/566/#p571\">\n    336 So.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (Fla. 1976). Applying the holding in\n   <em>\n    Garrett\n   </em>\n   , courts have found that the introduction of medical bills combined with testimony linking the medical bills to the accident at issue is sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the bills.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Walerowicz v.

Rather, as Defendant states, \"[t]he issue here is the reasonableness of the\n   <em>\n    charges\n   </em>\n   for which Delray billed.\" ECF No. [152] at 10 (emphasis in original). That issue was for the jury, who was free to give Dr. Zeide's testimony as much or as little weight as it deemed appropriate. Accordingly, the jury's award of the full amount of the Delray Medical Center bills was supported by the evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    2.
