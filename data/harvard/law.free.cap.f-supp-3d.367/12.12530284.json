In 2016, the conspirators sold to overseas customers shipping containers of scrap metal that had been padded with cheaper metal. PSR \u00b6 4. More valuable scrap metal was placed on top of the cheaper, filler metal to make it appear that the entire container was filled with the valuable scrap metal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant provided places to load the shipping containers. PSR \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In late 2017 and early 2018, Burnell and a conspirator contracted with a customer to ship $ 100,000 worth of valuable harness wire to China. PSR \u00b6 9. In early 2018, instead of filling a shipping container with harness wire, Burnell, the conspirator, and a third person filled it with cheap rotors, adding a layer of harness wire inside so it appeared that the container was filled with\n   the more valuable scrap. PSR \u00b6 12. Defendant was arrested as he and his co-conspirators were waiting for a truck to move the container.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was a \"sting\" operation.

Guilty Plea\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant pled guilty on July 10, 2018, to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 1349 and 1343. Minute Entry, July 10, 2018, ECF No. 25; PSR \u00b6 1.

In many instances, it is necessary to observe the employer's and familial ties to the defendant. A judge applies mental impressions of many tangible and intangible factors when imposing a sentence.\"). At the hearing, Burnell had the support of more than a half-dozen family members and friends, including his wife, his mother, and his sister. His role as an emotional and financial support to his family was evident in observing the attendees, as was the commitment his family members and friends have to supporting him following his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Hr'g Tr. 27:11, Jan. 31, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties disagreed about the loss amount. The government contended that the loss amount was more than $ 95,000, because the defendant intended to ship two containers of harness wire each with a value of approximately $ 50,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sent'g Mem. 6, Jan. 28, 2019, ECF No. 33. This conclusion was supported by Burnell's own statements on audio recordings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201349\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant contended that the loss amount was less than $ 95,000 because the cost of materials shipped must be taken into account when calculating the loss and, even if not taken into account, the defrauded recipients of the containers received some material of value. Sent'g Mem. Behalf Paul Burnell 13. The government's contention was accurate. The relevant loss is the \"intended loss\"-the pecuniary harm that the offense would have inflicted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 n.3(A)(ii). In addition to the approximately $ 100,000 Burnell and his co-conspirator would receive had the scheme been successful, there is also the pecuniary loss that would have been incurred to customs officials and the recipients of the products as a result of having to sort through the padding material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 24:6-19; 25:23-25, Jan. 31, 2019.
