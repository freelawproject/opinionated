Rangel has moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the underlying removal was legally defective under the Supreme Court's recent ruling in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). He argues that, because of the defect, his prior removal cannot, as a matter of law, serve as an element of the present charge. After reviewing the record and controlling authority, the Court concludes that the motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 26, 2010, Rangel was arrested for driving on a suspended license and other offenses. United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initiated removal proceedings by serving the defendant with a notice to appear (NTA) the same day. The NTA directed Rangel to appear before an immigration judge on a date and time \"to be set.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties appear to agree that ICE subsequently issued three hearing notices that specified the times, dates, and locations of proceedings that occurred in the following months, though there is some disagreement about whether each was properly served on Rangel. The parties also agree that Rangel appeared by video conference at three hearings in February and March 2011. After the third hearing, which occurred on March 15, 2011, Rangel was released on bond. The parties disagree about whether Rangel was notified of his next court date at the time of his release, and neither side has obtained a transcript of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record says little about what happened in the year following Rangel's bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And neither party has produced records of any hearings that may have occurred during the remainder of 2011, though Rangel offers the observation that ICE's internal record system suggests no such hearings occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next relevant proceeding included in the record was a hearing in February 2012. Specifically, on February 22, 2012, eleven months after Rangel was released on bond, the immigration court conducted a removal hearing and ordered him removed from the United States. But Rangel was not present at the removal hearing because he had been arrested on a DUI charge in late January and was in state custody pending trial. In short, he was ordered removed\n   <em>\n    in absentia.\n   </em>\n   Rangel was then convicted of DUI in August 2012 and served another year in state custody before he was released to ICE custody in September 2013. ICE caused him to be physically removed from the United States on September 24, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two days after his removal, Rangel was again apprehended in the United States. ICE reinstated the removal order and immediately removed him to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point between then and August 2018, Rangel again reentered the United States. He was arrested by Chicago police on August 13, 2018. A grand jury then indicted him on a charge of illegal reentry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In relevant part, section 1326(a) makes it a crime when \"any alien who ... has been deported[ ] or removed ... thereafter ... enters, or attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rangel has moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his initial removal was defective under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held, in an arguably analogous context, that the NTA statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), requires date and time information be provided to a respondent in order for that document to have effect. Rangel alleges that the government's failure to include time and date information in the 2010 NTA rendered it legally ineffective and that as a result, his removal following issuance of that NTA cannot, as a matter of law, serve as a basis for this indictment. The government contends that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is readily distinguishable and ought not to apply here. Alternatively, it contends that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) sets out specific statutory requirements for collaterally attacking the removal order underlying an indictment like this one and that Rangel has failed to satisfy those requirements. The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    's applicability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the threshold, the parties dispute whether\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is applicable here at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Section 1229b(b)(1)(A) provides relief from deportation for noncitizens who have \"been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of [an] application\" for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). The stop-time rule is a carve-out that stops a noncitizen from accruing time toward eligibility for cancellation of removal \"when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229b(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 1229(a), entitled \"Notice to appear,\" sets out the requirements for the written notice that \"shall be given ... to the alien\" who is subject to removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229(a). Among other things, section (1)(G)(i) requires an NTA to include \"[t]he time and place at which the removal proceedings will be held.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i). Before\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , agency regulation and practice did not follow the letter of this requirement. Specifically, the relevant regulation required only that NTAs provide \"[t]he time, place, and date of the initial removal hearing,\n   <em>\n    where practicable.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010332\">\n    62 Fed.

The Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   that (1) the agency's interpretation of the statute was not owed deference under\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

It points to the Supreme Court's characterization of \"[t]he narrow question\" in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   : \"If the government serves a noncitizen with a document that is labeled 'notice to appear,' but the document fails to specify either the time or place of the removal proceedings, does it trigger the stop-time rule?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, the Court's answer to that question-its holding-specifically refers to the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"No. [Such inadequate] notice ... does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"). In the government's view, \"the Supreme Court's repeated use of the same phrase-'trigger the stop-time rule'- cannot be accidental, and it leaves no doubt that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   only addressed the question of what triggers the stop-time rule.\" Gov.'s Br. in Opp., dkt. no. 10, at 8. And the government emphasizes that several district courts assessing this question have concluded that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to NTAs for the purposes of a section 1326(a) charge.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Morales-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-18-00365-TUC-RCC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204492377\">\n    2018 WL 4492377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

Oct. 15, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rangel proposes a more expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   . He argues that, regardless of the Supreme Court's characterization of the question before it,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   construed the requirements of section 1229(a), which applies broadly to the initiation of deportation proceedings. After all,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   reasoned that section 1229\"speak[s] in definitional terms\" about the meaning of the words \"notice to appear,\" and that, therefore, when that phrase is \"used elsewhere in the statutory section, including as the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria....\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rangel then argues that \"[w]ithout a valid charging document initiating removal proceedings, jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   vests in the immigration court,\" rendering any action taken pursuant to such a document null and void. Def.'s Br. in Supp., dkt. no. 8, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In other words, Rangel asserts that because the NTA served upon him lacked time and date information, it did not meet the statutory requirements of section 1229(a) and thus did not vest the immigration court with jurisdiction to order removal. He contends that the removal order was therefore invalid and cannot not serve as a basis for the present section 1326(a) charge. Rangel notes that several district courts have held such a defect sufficient to require dismissal of a charge under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Some courts have concluded that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is limited to its context and thus construes section 1229(a)'s requirements only for the purposes of the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Kan. Nov. 21, 2018). Others have found that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding extends to contexts beyond the stop-time rule, including to NTAs that initiated the removal proceedings underlying 1326(a) charges.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Zapata-Cortinas\n   </em>\n   , the court weighed the same arguments presented here and concluded that \"it would be incongruous to interpret the plain language of [ section] 1229(a)(1) differently depending on the [g]overnment's stated purpose....\"\n   <em>\n    Zapata-Cortinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528872\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/978/#p988\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the Supreme Court held that \" Section 1229(a)... speak[s] in definitional terms\" using \"quintessential definitional language.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would be difficult to draft a clearer statement that section 1229(a) was intended to define the minimum requirements of an NTA. And the Supreme Court dispelled any remaining lack of clarity by explaining, near the beginning of its analysis of the government's protests to its holding, that \"when the term 'notice to appear' is used elsewhere in the statutory section,\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   as the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by [ section] 1229(a).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Section 1326(d)'s bars to collateral attack\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Contrary to Rangel's contentions, the analysis does not stop there. Even though the Court has concluded that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   applies and that the 2010 NTA was defective, it must still assess the legal significance of that defect. Specifically, the Court must first determine whether the defective NTA obviates the need to assess Rangel's motion under section 1326(d), which outlines three requirements that must be satisfied before a section 1326(a) indictment may be attacked collaterally. If section 1326(d) does apply, the Court must determine whether Rangel has satisfied its requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Rangel must satisfy section 1326(d)'s requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even among district courts that have concluded that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's section 1229(a) holding applies in the context of a section 1326 charge, there is significant disagreement on the legal impact of a defective NTA. Some district courts have concluded, as Rangel argues, that indictments based on previous removals initiated by defective NTAs must be dismissed because the underlying proceeding was conducted without subject-matter jurisdiction, which these courts note is an issue typically not subject to forfeiture or waiver.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tzul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528359\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/345/785/\">\n    345 F.Supp.3d at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Larios-Buentello\n   </em>\n   , a defendant appealed his conviction for illegal reentry and sought relief despite his failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

The record is less than clear on this point. The government points to a couple of statements in documents from Rangel's immigration file that suggest he acknowledged the removal order and did not wish to reopen or otherwise challenge the determination. If the government was responsible for communicating Rangel's administrative remedies to him, there is a good chance it would lose on this paltry record. But it bears no such responsibility. The Seventh Circuit has made clear that \"[i]n immigration law, as in tax law-and criminal law, too, where knowledge of the law is presumed-the Constitution permits the government to leave people to their own research.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimenski v.

Rangel's argument therefore lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, Rangel did not exhaust his administrative remedies to challenge the underlying removal proceeding as required by section 1326(d)(1).

Deprivation of judicial review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   If Rangel could satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirement, he would still need to demonstrate that \"the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). This statutory language is more or less directly adopted from\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , which further explained that some \"abuses could operate, under some circumstances, to deny effective judicial review of administrative determinations.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    481 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839 n.17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rangel again argues that he automatically satisfies this requirement because the immigration court never had proper jurisdiction. He argues that this is precisely the type of abuse depriving a defendant of \"effective judicial review\" of which\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   warned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But, again,\n   <em>\n    Larios-Buentello\n   </em>\n   defeats this argument. There, the Seventh Circuit held that it was the defendant's own choice not to administratively appeal his removal determination that \"also prevented a request for judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Larios-Buentello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362779\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/176/#p177\">\n    807 F.3d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Larios-Buentello\n   </em>\n   could have appealed and argued for a change in existing law, so too could Rangel have moved to reopen his removal case, appealed to the BIA, and eventually gained review by an Article III court. At each stage of the process, he could have argued that the 2010 NTA was defective and thus undermined subject-matter jurisdiction. He did not. And, as the court in\n   <em>\n    Larios-Buentello\n   </em>\n   held, the relative unlikelihood of his success in making such arguments is no basis to excuse the requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362779\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/176/#p177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that a belief that any appeal would have failed \"does not make the opportunity 'unavailable' \" for the purposes of section 1326(d)(2)\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He then suggests that the prejudice element should be waived because jurisdictional issues distinguish this case from relevant precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Rangel spends most of his energy again attempting to analogize his case to\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   . There, the Supreme Court held that \"a collateral challenge to the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense must be permitted where the deportation proceeding effectively eliminates the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    481 U.S. at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   is, at least for this purpose, readily distinguishable. For one thing, in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   the government did not appeal the Eighth Circuit's decision that the underlying deportation proceeding \"was fundamentally unfair\" and thus violated the defendants' due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 834 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus the Court addressed only whether a collateral attack must be allowed in some circumstances. After concluding that\n   <em>\n    some form\n   </em>\n   of collateral attack must be available to satisfy due process, the Supreme Court simply affirmed the lower court's dismissal without addressing whether the underlying proceeding violated the defendants' due process rights (which, again, the government had not appealed).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p834\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, in contrast, no one contests that, under the appropriate circumstances, the removal order underlying a charge under section 1326(a) may be attacked collaterally.

The record further suggests that he accepted the immigration judge's order for removal and that he declined to make a statement contesting the removal determination, though counsel raised, during oral argument in this case, concerns about the conclusiveness of that evidence. Regardless, the uncontested portions of the record are sufficient to conclude that Rangel's removal\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   did not violate his due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the prejudice element is also dispositive. In his opening brief, Rangel\n   seems to suggest that he was denied mandatory relief from removal-apparently in the form of a jurisdictional dismissal by the immigration judge-and that this denial satisfies the prejudice requirement. But in his reply brief, he retreats from that position, instead suggesting that the prejudice requirement should be waived, again for fundamental unfairness reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Based on the briefs and oral argument, the Court is not persuaded. As discussed above, even assuming that the 2010 NTA was defective, Rangel must satisfy the requirements of section 1326(d) to collaterally attack the underlying removal order. One of those requirements is fundamental unfairness, which under controlling authority requires a showing of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arita-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684303\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/487/#p493\">\n    607 F.3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rangel's argument that the prejudice requirement should be waived is conclusory and does not grapple with that authority. It therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, Rangel has failed to demonstrate that his removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For foregoing reasons, the Court denies defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment [dkt. no. 8].\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Both parties refer to the defendant simply by the first of his surnames. This Court will do the same.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    At oral argument, the government suggested that this gap is itself the result of Rangel's release on bond; the Department of Homeland Security apparently retains records of hearing notices only while a respondent is in custody and his release caused the department's record to be incomplete.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The government assures the Court that a request was made to the Department of Homeland Security in November 2018 for records from Rangel's case. It suggests that the delay may be a product of then-ongoing partial government shutdown. In any case, the Court concludes that the motion to dismiss can be resolved on the current record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The parties do not dispute whether\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    should be read to have retroactive effect.
