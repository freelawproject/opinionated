(\"Title IX\"), as well as Tennessee state law. On September 27, 2018, the Court dismissed all of Counts I, IV, IX, X, and most of Count II of the Complaint. (Doc. Nos. 40, 41.) Now before the Court is Belmont's Motion for Summary Judgment on all remaining allegations of the Complaint. (Doc. No. 44.) Doe has responded in opposition (Doc. No. 50) and Belmont has replied (Doc. No. 58). The parties have filed statements of facts and responses thereto (Doc. Nos. 51, 59) and numerous exhibits (Doc. Nos. 47-1 to 47-12, 48-1 to 48-9, 51-1 to 51-13, 63-1 to 63-12, 66-1 to 66-4.) In addition, Belmont has filed a Motion to Strike Exhibit A to Doe's Response (Doc. No. 60) that is opposed by Doe (Doc. No. 66). For the following reasons, Belmont's motions will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Belmont's Motion to Strike\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court must first resolve Belmont's Motion to Strike because it will determine, in part, the evidence before the Court for purposes of summary judgment. Belmont moves to strike Exhibit A to Doe's response to the motion for summary judgment because (1) Doe did not timely identify that document without substantial justification and (2) his failure to do so resulted in harm when Doe relied upon that document to oppose Belmont's dispositive motion. Doe calls the motion \"strange.\" It is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As discussed at length in the Court's Memorandum Opinion on Belmont's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. No. 40), this case involves Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy, the relevant version of which was contained in the 2016-2017 Belmont Student Handbook (\"Bruin Guide\"). Page 21 of the Bruin Guide contains specific language that is relevant to the disposition of certain claims in this case. The Complaint, filed in 2017, did not attach the Bruin Guide, but Belmont attached it in PDF version to its Amended Answer prior to filing the motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Doc. No. 21-2.) Exhibit A to Doe's summary judgment response is page 21 of the Bruin Guide that is slightly\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   than the PDF version produced by Belmont so long ago. Doe contends that this is the online version (i.e., \"magazine version\") of the Bruin Guide that he and his counsel have relied on\n   <em>\n    since 2016.\n   </em>\n   But Exhibit A is a\n   <em>\n    December 8, 2018 screenshot\n   </em>\n   of the online version of the Bruin Guide. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 63-1.) Doe has never before disclosed the purported existence of any alternate version of Page 21 or any theory of liability relying on it. Doe argues that, because Belmont should be familiar with its own materials, Doe cannot be at fault for not disclosing his purported reliance on an alternate version of the Bruin Guide prior to his response to the motion for summary judgment. As discussed below, the Court finds very significant problems with Doe's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Even if Doe had put Belmont on notice that he generally intended to rely on the Sexual Misconduct Policy, at no point prior to the response to the motion for summary judgment did Doe or his counsel disclose or describe the purported alternate page 21 (i.e., Exhibit A) or discuss any legal theories based upon purported differences between versions of the Bruin Guide in existence in 2016-2017. Doe did not identify the purported alternate page 21 in his initial disclosures or in response to interrogatories concerning bases for liability. (Doc. No. 61.) Moreover, in the briefing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, Doe made no mention of any purported reliance on a purported alternate version of the 2016 Bruin Guide even though the text of the Sexual Misconduct Policy was at issue. (Doc. No. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   These failures to disclose in discovery and motion practice were compounded when Doe was deposed. Counsel for Belmont asked Doe numerous questions regarding Belmont's handling of his investigation. (Doc. Nos. 61, 71.) At no point did Doe refer to the purported alternate Exhibit A specifically (or even the \"magazine version\" of the Bruin Guide generally), nor did Doe espouse a theory of liability based upon either. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) This was particularly evident regarding Doe's negligence claims, where Exhibit A has the most potential impact. At his deposition, Doe responded that, aside from the sanction he received, he could not think of any other asserted breach of care. (Doc. No. 71.) In the response to the motion for summary judgment, citing Exhibit A for the first time, Doe now argues a breach of care related to purportedly different versions of page 21\n   of the Bruin Guide. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 50 at 18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Equally compelling is that Belmont has - to put it mildly - substantially undermined Doe's claim that Exhibit A (i.e., the screenshot of page 21 of the Bruin Guide taken in December 2018) was in existence in 2016. Counsel for Doe submitted a Declaration asserting, without any corroboration, that Exhibit A is \"consistent in all ways\" with the Bruin Guide in use in 2016-2017. (Doc. No. 50-2.) Belmont, however, has offered the sworn Declaration of Lori Chadoin, the current Director of Title IX Compliance and Prevention Programs, stating that Exhibit A\n   <em>\n    contains revised language that was authored in August of 2018 and published online in October of 2018 and thus could not have appeared before then for reliance by Doe or his counsel in 2016-2017.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. No. 62-2.) Ms. Chadoin, who supports her declaration with email correspondence and explanatory references to specific provisions, therefore states her view that the Declaration of Doe's counsel that Exhibit A is \"consistent in all ways\" with the 2016-17 version is necessarily \"false.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.) Specifically, Ms. Chadoin explains that (1) she authored the relevant changes to the Sexual Misconduct Policy in August of 2018, (2) the changes were implemented \"on or about October 1, 2018,\" and (3) after conducting a search, \"there is no record of any [relevant] change ... prior to my change in August of 2018.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3-4.) The Declaration concludes that \"[i]t is\n   <em>\n    not possible\n   </em>\n   that plaintiff or his counsel relied upon the current version ... of Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy [i.e., Exhibit A] in this case because the language in question\n   <em>\n    did not exist\n   </em>\n   in the 2016-2017 timeframe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) requires a party to timely disclose \"all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment.\" The Federal Rules also require that a party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a), or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission, must supplement or correct its disclosure or response \"in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.\" Fed.

In order to assess whether a party's omitted or late disclosure is \"substantially justified\" or \"harmless,\" the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit considers five factors: (1) the surprise to the party against whom the evidence would be offered; (2) the ability of that party to cure the surprise; (3) the extent to which allowing the evidence would disrupt the trial; (4) the importance of the evidence; and (5) the non-disclosing party's explanation for its failure to disclose the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Howe v. City of Akron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055184\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/718/#p748\">\n    801 F.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    Russell v. Absolute Collection Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181763\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/385/#p396\">\n    763 F.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396-97 (4th Cir. 2014) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court takes these factors in order, beginning with the surprise to Belmont. Belmont essentially maintains that Doe's reliance on Exhibit A in the response to the motion for summary judgment is a complete and unfair surprise because (1) during initial disclosures or discovery, Doe never produced a copy of page 21 from a 2016-2017 magazine version of the Bruin Guide with purportedly different language than the PDF version of the Bruin Guide produced by Belmont early in the case; (2) prior to the summary judgment response, neither Doe nor his counsel have ever articulated an argument or theory of liability based upon the existence of purportedly different language on page 21 of the \"magazine version\" of the 2016-2017 Bruin Guide; and (3) during his deposition, Doe never referred to differences between versions of the Bruin Guide or complained of Belmont's conduct in connection therewith. As discussed, Belmont supports its contention of unfair surprise with evidence that Exhibit A did not even exist during the period in which Doe asserts that he relied upon it, to which Doe has offered basically nothing in response aside from personal assurances to the contrary. Because Belmont contends that Exhibit A did not exist in 2016, Doe's contention that its existence should not come as a surprise to Belmont completely misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, it would be very difficult for Belmont to cure the surprise. Having no notice of the purportedly competing version of the page of 2016-2017 Bruin Guide in Exhibit A for the entire discovery period (and believing no changes were made to the policy until the fall of 2018), Belmont did not pursue any discovery concerning the \"magazine version\" of Exhibit A or question Doe during his deposition about his alleged reliance upon it. Discovery has closed, the dispositive motion deadline has passed, and the trial date is only weeks away. Only after Belmont filed its motion for summary judgment did Doe respond with reliance on Exhibit A, leaving Belmont able to respond only by means of a short reply brief. Curing the surprise would involve, at a minimum, reopening\n   discovery (including re-deposing Doe) and re-briefing summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This would be costly and harmful to Belmont, particularly because Doe has gotten a free preview of Belmont's best summary judgment arguments. Notably, the Court of Appeals \"put[s] the burden on the potentially sanctioned party to prove harmlessness.\"\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9348117\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/776/#p782\">\n    325 F.3d at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Doe has made little, if any, attempt to do so. Furthermore, a showing of harmlessness requires \"an honest mistake on the part of a party coupled with sufficient knowledge on the part of the other party.\"\n   <em>\n    Sommer v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9340498\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/686/#p692\">\n    317 F.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (6th Cir. 2003). In this face of the Ms. Chadoin's Declaration, Doe simply does not meet this standard. Given that Ms. Chadoin has declared that Exhibit A did not come into existence until late 2018, Doe fails to establish that Belmont had \"sufficient knowledge\" of Exhibit A's existence between the fall of 2016 and that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, if the evidence were allowed, it would be disruptive to any trial. Allowing the time necessary for additional discovery and re-briefing of summary judgment would require postponing the rapidly approaching pre-trial conference and trial date to a significantly later date in this already-aging case. This is simply not fair. Belmont may already be involved in trial preparations concerning certain theories of the case that would need to be substantially modified. These late-in-the-game changes are what Rules 26 and 37 are designed to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fourth, the evidence is important. It is relevant to multiple claims. In particular, Doe has used it to articulate a theory of negligence. In addition to bearing on substantive claims, it is also relevant to how a jury might view Belmont's credibility regarding implementation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the Court considers Doe's explanations for the late disclosure/production of Exhibit A. The Court will not make judgments about a party's underlying motivations. However, the Court does find Doe's explanation and the disclosure and use of Exhibit A to be highly curious, particularly in the face of Ms. Chadoin's Declaration. Ms. Chadoin has stated under oath that there was no relevant difference between page 21 of the PDF and \"magazine version\" of the Bruin Guide prior to 2018. In the Court's view, Doe has provided no logical justification for not producing an alternative version of Exhibit A if it existed prior to 2018 (or even discussing theories of liability based thereupon).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put simply, if Doe sought to proceed in this\n   litigation under theories of liability based on a different version of the Bruin Guide purportedly available to him in 2016-2017, it was Doe's responsibility to disclose the differing document and reveal his reliance thereupon in the same manner required in any litigation based on any other key document.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State Auto.

(Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 1.) Doe, a resident of Tennessee, matriculated at Belmont in 2015 and intended to graduate. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 2.) Doe - like every other student - was bound by a pledge to at all times \"exemplify behavior which is consistent with the University's Code of Conduct.\" (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Belmont's Relevant Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Belmont's Student Handbook - the Bruin Guide - sets forth certain relevant\n   policies under the overarching Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 3.) Most importantly, at Belmont, students \"have a right to be free from sexual misconduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 5.) The Bruin Guide sets forth a Sexual Misconduct Policy, including definitions of consent, coercion, non-consensual sexual contact, and non-consensual sexual intercourse. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Belmont believes that \"[d]ata suggests false reporting is uncommon in incidents of sexual violence and harassment,\" but, \"[nevertheless], false reports do occur\"; Belmont \"examine[s] those on a case-by-case basis.\" (Doc. No. 63-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Belmont also has a Deceptive Behavior Policy, which prohibits a student from providing false or misleading information to a university official regardless of whether the recipient is deceived. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 42; 48; 21-2 at 26.) In other words, Belmont students are charged with the responsibility of being honest to university officials at all times. When a student is being investigated for another alleged violation, a determination can be made regarding a violation of the Deceptive Behavior Policy based upon a preponderance of the evidence at any time; there does not need to be a separate investigation. (Doc. Nos. 63-3 at 3; 59 at \u00b6 4.) Belmont also has residence hall visitation policies that prohibit overnight guests of the opposite sex in residence hall rooms and prohibit opposite sex guest visitation except during approved visitation hours. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 46.) Under these policies, it is primarily a host's responsibility to make sure that visitors are checked in and follow visitation hours; however, all Belmont students are required to follow the rules at all times, whether they live on campus or not. (Doc. No. 59 at \u00b6 7.) Finally, Belmont has an Honor Pledge concerning academic matters that, among other things, delineates \"unauthorized collaboration on an academic assignment\" as \"Obtaining Unfair Advantage.\" (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 87; 47-10.) Likewise, \"providing material, information or other assistance\" that violates the expectations of the Honor Pledge is considered \"Aiding and Abetting\" a violation. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 87; 47-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Sexual Misconduct Policy Accountability Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Broadly speaking, the Bruin Guide sets forth two \"accountability processes.\" (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 6.) Belmont has a general accountability process for alleged violations of its Code of Conduct, and a specific accountability process for alleged violations of Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Doc. No. 21-2.) Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy accountability\n   process pre-empts the general accountability process. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 12.) Specifically, the Bruin Guide provides that, \"[w]hen an incident involves multiple alleged violations, one of which is an alleged violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, [the Sexual Misconduct Policy accountability process] will control for all violations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 48; 48.) To avoid any disincentive for students to make a complaint of sexual misconduct or participate as a witness in such an investigation, Belmont's Sexual Misconduct Policy provides that the university will not pursue violations of other policies by a complainant or witness discovered during a sexual misconduct investigation. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 49; 21-2 at 12.) There is no such exception for a respondent. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 12.) This special consideration does not excuse any complainant or witness found to have themselves violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy.

Doe and Student S. became close friends and went on outings with Doe's roommates or other mutual friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 9.) As the summer progressed, Doe and Student S.'s relationship became closer; often Student S. would remain in Doe's room late into the night. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 10.) Sometimes, they kissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 11.) In October 2016, however, Student S. complained to Belmont about Doe's alleged sexual misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 12.) Student S. alleged that: (1) on an unspecified date, Doe kissed her and attempted to take her shorts off; (2) on June 3, 2016, Doe asked her to take her shorts off, which she did, and then attempted to have sexual intercourse with Student S.;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) on June 8, 2016, while Doe and Student S. were at Percy Warner Park in a hammock together kissing, Doe attempted to undress Student S. and she stopped him.

In 2007, Zlock received a law degree from Seton Hall University School of Law. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 16.) She has been in good standing with the New Jersey Board of Bar Examiners since 2007, and she remains licensed to practice in that state. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Zlock has practiced law in both the public and private sector, including a judicial clerkship. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Immediately prior to joining the staff at Belmont, Zlock was the Director of Students at Seton Hall University School of Law. She assumed her role at Belmont in 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Zlock has been a member of the Association of Title IX Administrators (\"ATIXA\") since 2015, and she attended\n   the annual ATIXA conference in 2015 and 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) She is a level four certified Title IX Coordinator through ATIXA. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) She has regularly attended training seminars and participated in webinars related to Title IX and is trained in the administration and oversight of Title IX investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In her role as Title IX Coordinator at Belmont, Zlock, along with others, administered and supervised Belmont's Title IX compliance program and Sexual Misconduct Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 17.) After the intake of Student S.'s complaint, on October 7, 2016, Zlock advised Student S. of the finding of reasonable cause to proceed with the Doe investigation and assigned two Resident Directors, Bryan Miller and Hillary Bruner, to serve as neutral investigators of Student S.'s complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 18.) Miller and Bruner had fully participated in an investigator training Zlock conducted in the summer of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 11, Zlock emailed Doe to advise him that a complaint of sexual misconduct had been made against him. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 19.) This email attached a Sexual Misconduct Accountability Form advising Doe of the identity of the complainant, the date of the incident, the reported location of the incident, and that the alleged violations were (1) non-consensual sexual contact and (2) non-consensual sexual intercourse. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Zlock's email and the accountability form provided Doe with a description of the investigatory process as well as a statement of his rights and responsibilities in the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 20.) Pursuant to Belmont's standard practice in this context, Zlock also issued a no-contact order prohibiting Doe and Student S. from contacting each other either directly or through third parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 21.) Zlock encouraged Doe to review the Sexual Misconduct Policy in Belmont's Bruin Guide, and Doe read the Policy multiple times over the next few days. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 22.) Zlock also offered to meet with Doe to discuss the investigatory procedures and answer any questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) At this time, Zlock was unaware that Doe was also under investigation by the Director of Student Accountability for multiple dorm visitation violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 12, Doe and his father met with Zlock to discuss the investigation process. (Doc. No. 71-1 at 40-42.) Doe testified that the process that Zlock explained would be followed during the investigation was consistent with what he had read in the Sexual Misconduct Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 43.) Doe also testified that Zlock assured him that \"it would be a fair and impartial investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 41.) Later that day, Doe emailed Zlock and stated that he felt that he should take a leave from his position on Belmont's student Accountability Council pending resolution of the sexual misconduct investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 25;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   48-3.) Zlock forwarded this email to Belmont's Director of Community Accountability Janelle Briscoe (\"Briscoe\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 25; 48-3.) In Briscoe's role as Director of Community Accountability, she, along with others, administer and oversee Belmont's behavioral and academic policies (i.e., general accountability processes), not including administration or oversight of Belmont's Title IX policies and procedures or Sexual Misconduct Policy. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 63.) Briscoe advised Zlock that she would contact Doe regarding the Accountability Council membership issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 25; Doc. No. 48-3.) Briscoe therefore became aware of the existence of the Title IX investigation. (Doc. No. 59 at \u00b6 12.) However, other than discussing this recusal subject, there is no record evidence that Zlock had any further communications with Briscoe regarding Doe's Title IX investigation, the specifics of Student S's complaint, or Doe's response to the complaint. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 26.) Briscoe was not involved in Zlock's Title IX investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    The Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The investigation of Student S's complaint lasted from approximately October 11 to December 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 27.) Doe was represented by counsel, a common practice in Title IX investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 60.) As part of the investigation, Doe and Student S. each identified relevant witnesses and provided the investigators with any documentation they considered important to the issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) With the exception of Student T., witnesses with relevant knowledge of the complaint and a limited number of character witnesses were interviewed. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Doe was aware of Belmont's Deceptive Behavior Policy and acknowledges that he had an obligation to be truthful to university officials during the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 43; Doc. No. 71 at 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Doe and Student S. were interviewed during the investigation. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 27.) In Doe's initial interview with the\n   Belmont investigators, he described his encounters with Student S, in part, as follows: \"We then kissed for several minutes with our bodies in contact with one another, though no attempt by either of us was made to grab, caress, or otherwise intentionally touch the other in a sexual way.... The full extent of this encounter was kissing while standing up in my room.... My hands were behind her back as were hers behind my back.... [T]here were about five other times, basically the exact same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 37; Doc. Nos. 48; 48-4.) At his deposition, however, Doe \"[did] not deny\" that there were times Student S. spent the night in his room in his bed and that Doe and Student S. physically touched each other. (Doc. No. 63-5 at 6.) Doe conceded that this \"wasn't a point of emphasis\" when he gave his statement to the Belmont's sexual misconduct investigators. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Rather, during his interview, Doe \"pretty much just described to them ... kind of our relationship in the context of work - and how we met through that and became friends during that time frame.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7.) Doe discussed that Student S. came over to his apartment, but, in his words, just because they happened to be \"living in the same building at the time and whatnot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) At his deposition, Doe conceded that he did not \"ever\" recall having that conversation with investigators in which he revealed that \"[Student S.] had slept in the bed with [him] enough that [he was] used to falling asleep with her, and [that] there were times [he] texted her and wanted her to come spend the night with [him].\" (Doc. No. 71-1 at 24.) In her interview with investigators, however, Student S. alleged a more intimate physical relationship - that she and Doe had spent the night together multiple times - and she submitted numerous text messages regarding their relationship as evidence, including one in which Doe stated \"I am kinda used to falling asleep with you beside me now and so I really want you here tonight if you would like. I gotta be up early ish and I'm super sleepy but I just kinda want to snuggle.\" (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 38; 48; 48-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The parties were given the complete investigatory file on October 28, 2016 and were instructed to submit their final statements on the matter. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 28.) On November 2, 2016, Doe's father sent an e-mail complaining that \"[they] were told that Belmont would contact his professors to get him some additional consideration during this time,\" but that Doe \"hasn't seen any evidence that exceptions are being made and he has had to miss several classes and exams as a result.\" (Doc. No. 63-10.) Doe's father asked what could be done to take advantage of accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Record evidence reflects that two weeks earlier Zlock had emailed at least one of Doe's professors requesting leniency and understanding for absences and any need to reschedule exams due to involvement in a confidential traumatic event. (Doc. Nos. 48; 48-2.) In addition, after this time, at Zlock's instruction, an additional witness proposed by Doe (Student T.) was interviewed by investigators, and on November 4, his statement was submitted to both parties for further comment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A response was then submitted on Doe's behalf that sharply attacked the authenticity of the text messages submitted by Student S. and claimed, among other things, that they \"appear[ed] to have been edited,\" \"[we]re clearly doctored,\" were \"glaring forger[ies],\" or were \"suspect at least, total lies at most.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 39; Doc. Nos. 51-9; 51-10.) On November 15, 2016, Zlock requested an inspection of the parties' cell phones. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 30.) Zlock referred the question of the authenticity of the text messages for investigation to Mr. William Ingram, Belmont's Chief Information Officer, and Mr. Randall Reynolds, Belmont's Director of Information Security. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 40.) After conducting an analysis, Mr. Ingram and Mr. Reynolds reported that the messages submitted by Student S. were most likely authentic and had not been modified. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) On November 28, Zlock asked the investigators to submit a clarifying question to Student S. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 30.) On November 30, both parties were given the findings from the cell phone inspection and Student S.'s answer to the clarifying question and afforded an opportunity to submit a limited response. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Given the forensic report and the totality of the responses from each party, Zlock concluded that it was not reasonable to believe that Doe simply forgot about the text messages or the true nature of his relationship with Student S. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 41.; Doc. Nos. 48; 21-1 at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    The Determination Letter, Sanctions, and Appeals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On December 13, 2016, Zlock provided a written outcome letter (\"Determination Letter\"), signed by her, to both Student S. and Doe. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 31; 21-1.) In the Determination Letter, Zlock found that the investigation did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Student S. had suffered non-consensual sexual contact or non-consensual sexual intercourse. (Doc. Nos. 21-1 at 13; 48.) Accordingly, Doe was found not responsible for these alleged violations, and was exonerated under Title IX for any alleged violation of Belmont's sexual misconduct policy. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 13.) Zlock did, however, find Student S.'s statement of the physical relationship between the parties to be both credible and largely corroborated by the text messages and other documentation. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 33; 21-1 at 13.) Zlock found Doe had the opportunity to be truthful in both his initial statement to the investigators and his final statement after having reviewed Student S.'s text messages and instead chose to \"purposefully complicate the investigation\" through the submission of false or misleading information. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 41; 21-1 at 13.) Furthermore, Zlock found that Doe had been \"purposefully untruthful.\" (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 34; No. 21-1 at 13.) Zlock also found that \"the evidence establish[ed] that [Doe]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   repeatedly violated [Belmont's residence hall] visitation policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 35; 21-1 at 13.) Zlock did not issue any finding against Student S. or any witnesses involved in the investigation for any policy violations. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 50.) Zlock testified in her deposition that the visitation violations addressed in the Determination Letter were those \"related to the sexual misconduct investigation\" and \"found through the course of the sexual misconduct investigation process\" (such as, for example, Doe and Student S. \"visiting after hours\"), and were unrelated to Doe's alleged visitation violations that were under parallel investigation by Briscoe in \"a completely different process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 36; Doc. Nos. 48; 70 at 126-129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As a sanction for the violations of the Deceptive Behavior Policy and visitation policies, Zlock suspended Doe for the Spring 2017 semester. (Doc. No. 21-1 at 13-14.) Belmont defines suspension as separation from the university for a specific period with eligibility to reapply to return for the following semester. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Doe completed his exams and received credit for all coursework performed in 2016. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 53.) Accordingly, Doe was eligible to reapply to return to Belmont for the summer of 2017. (Doc. Nos. 21-1 at 13-14; 48.) Upon returning, Doe was to be placed on institutional probation for the remainder of his time at Belmont, precluded from holding a leadership position in any co-curricular organization for the remainder of his time at Belmont, and prevented from having any contact with Student S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 21-1 at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Doe appealed the sanctions he received based upon his Deceptive Behavior Policy and visitation policies violations. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 54.) Doe stated that he was \"not appealing the decision of Ms. Zlock,\" but only the sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) On December 28, 2016, the Assistant Dean of Students for Residence Life, Anthony Donovan, upheld the Determination Letter and sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 55; Doc. No. 48-7.) Among other things, Donovan concluded that \"[t]he preemption clause (outlined in the Bruin Guide, page 20) empowers the Title IX process to subsume all other alleged violations and provides control over all violations including but not limited to those that might be committed in the investigation process.\" (Doc. No. 48-7 at 1.) Donovan further found that Zlock \"exercised great care in separating her finding of [Doe's] impediment of the investigation of lack of truthfulness from unduly influencing her decision in finding [Doe] not in violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1-2.) Donovan found the sanction for untruthfulness severe but allowable and justified, particularly given the cumulative visitation violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 5, 2017, Associate Provost and Dean of Students Jeffery Burgin issued a final outcome letter upholding Donovan's appellate determination. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 56; 48-8.) Burgin concluded that the sanctions were appropriate for someone held responsible for \"mislead[ing] the investigators\n   by questioning the authenticity of text messages, misrepresenting the nature of the physical relationship, and falsely stating when the 'nonprofessional' nature of the[ ] relationship ended.\" (Doc. No. 48-8 at 1.) Burgin also mentioned Doe's visitation violations and reminded Doe that Belmont's response to such breaches of the Code of Conduct \"is assertive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Code of Conduct Violations Handled by Briscoe\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although there are several ways that violations of the Code of Conduct can be handled under the general accountability process, Briscoe routinely handled disciplinary matters administratively for commuter students such as Doe. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 69.) While the sexual misconduct investigation was underway, Briscoe dealt with several alleged Code of Conduct violations by Doe. Although Zlock was aware that Briscoe had charged Doe with these violations, there is no record evidence that she had any involvement with or input into the discipline that Briscoe issued for them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 97; 47 at \u00b6 21; 59 at \u00b6 23; 63-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The first of these incidents occurred around 3:00 a.m. on October 1, 2016, when Doe was involved in a dormitory visitation violation in which he, another male student, and two female students were visiting after hours in a male student's dormitory room. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 65.) The Resident Advisors on duty reported the incident and issued a Notice of Community Responsibility to Doe and the other students involved. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67; Doc. No. 47-3.) Doe admitted the violation and checked the box on the Notice for \"I accept responsibility.\" (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 68; 47-3.) On October 19, Briscoe held an administrative inquiry on the appropriate sanction for this violation. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 69.) Briscoe reviewed Doe's disciplinary file and learned that Doe had accepted responsibility for an earlier visitation violation on June 5 while living on campus as a residential student for Belmont's orientation program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 70.) Because the October 1 violation was Doe's second visitation violation in the span of\n   four months, Briscoe assigned a \"loss of privilege\" as the appropriate sanction. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 72.) Doe was prohibited from visiting in the residence halls for the remainder of the fall 2016 Semester (i.e., approximately two months). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 73.) Briscoe routinely assigned this level of punishment for second visitation violations that occurred less than a year after the first. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   One week later, on October 26, 2016, Doe was again reported by Resident Advisors for a visitation violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 76.) A Notice of Community Responsibility was again issued; it explained that, after spending an hour together in the dorm, Doe and the female resident he was with saw the Resident Assistants for the dormitory, turned around, and went out the back door. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Doc. No. 47-7.) This time, Doe checked the box for \"I deny responsibility.\" (Doc. No. 47-7.) Briscoe emailed Doe on November 1, 2016, to advise him of the reported violation and offer to meet to discuss the disciplinary process. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 77.) Doe eventually agreed to meet for an administrative inquiry adjudicating the alleged violation on November 7, 2016, during which he again denied responsibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 78.) Briscoe reminded Doe that the previously-imposed sanction for the Oct 1 violation had prohibited Doe from visiting in the residence halls for the remainder of the semester under any circumstance. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 80.) On November 9, 2016, Briscoe issued a decision finding Doe responsible for his third visitation violation in five months. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 81.) As a sanction, she extended Doe's loss of privilege of residence hall visitation through the end of spring semester 2017 (i.e., one additional semester). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 82.) Briscoe has stated that this punishment was more lenient than sanctions Briscoe has commonly assigned to other students with three violations in the same short timeframe. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Briscoe also disciplined Doe for an Honor Code violation in this timeframe. In November of 2016, Belmont required students to take and successfully pass an online computer proficiency test on Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 85.) On November 29, 2016, Briscoe received an e-mail from a Belmont employee Facebook monitor, attaching a posting made by Doe on Belmont's Class of 2019 Facebook Page. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 84.) In response to another student's post asking, \"does anyone know how to do computer proficiency,\" Doe posted, \"I did a few for a small fee last year for some folks.

If this were the law, every respondent in a Title IX investigation would have a baked-in retaliation claim simply because they resisted an allegation of sexual misconduct. Indeed, merely defending an allegation of misconduct is as different from actively opposing or complaining of unlawful discrimination as day is to night; the former involves affirming that one has not committed wrongdoing, while the latter rests on the notion, real or perceived, that one has been on the receiving end of or has opposed wrongdoing in the form of illegal discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, Doe's retaliation claim does not allege that he complained to anyone about discrimination on the basis of sex prior to or during the sexual misconduct investigation, and the summary judgment record is devoid of evidence of this requisite protected activity. To the contrary, Doe was, broadly speaking, satisfied with the Title IX process followed by Belmont. (Doc.

Doe testified during his deposition that this finding was not based on any faulty process or procedure, and that Belmont looked at all the evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 18-19.) Doe was only punished by Zlock for Deceptive Behavior Policy and visitation policies violations that arose during the investigation. Regarding the Deceptive Behavior Policy violation, Doe testified at his deposition that he \"d[id]n't dispute the process,\" only the substantive findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 59). In short, there is no evidence from which a jury could conclude that Doe was engaged in the protected activity of complaining about unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX and was retaliated against as a result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore,\n   any general complaints Doe might have had about the handling of his investigation are not the equivalent of specific complaints about unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booker v.

Indeed, this theory of causation defies logic. Four things are clear from the record: (1) Belmont cleared Doe in the Title IX investigation; (2) Doe was generally satisfied with the investigatory process employed by Belmont; (3) Belmont was within its authority, per the Bruin Guide's pre-emption clause, to sanction Doe for collateral violations regardless of the outcome of the Title IX charges; and (4) the investigation provided sufficient evidence from which Belmont could conclude, by a preponderance standard, that (a) Doe and Student S. engaged in multiple visitation violations and (b) Doe was deliberately deceptive during the investigation. Zlock clearly delineated the collateral violations in the well-supported Determination Letter. Doe simply has not put forth evidence that Zlock sought to punish him for\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   other than the cited violations, let alone \"because of\" Doe's Title IX defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, this same fundamental flaw would doom Doe's case for causation even if the Court applied only the more forgiving \"substantial factor\" test; for the same reasons, there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Doe's decision to defend himself against sexual misconduct charges was even the \"likely\" cause of the collateral violation discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is not clear exactly what Doe argues to try to establish causation under any legal test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, at his deposition Doe, despite the fourteen-page Determination\n   Letter, testified that he had \"no idea\" why Belmont disciplined him. (Doc. No. 71-1 at 59.) But, as Belmont indicates, it appears that Doe may implicitly contend that the temporal proximity of the Title IX investigation and his punishment for the collateral violations is satisfactory. It is true that, in certain circumstances, temporal proximity between events can be close enough in time to constitute sufficient evidence of a causal connection for the purposes of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   retaliation case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montell v.

In short, Doe has put forth no evidence that Zlock (or anyone else at Belmont) made an unambiguous, explicit promise that Deceptive Behavior Policy or visitation policy violations that came to light during the sexual misconduct investigation would not be considered for punishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the record is devoid of evidence that the alleged unambiguous, enforceable promise was made to Doe, his own admissions are sufficient for the Court to conclude that no reasonable inference based on the evidence would lead a rational trier of fact to infer the promises asserted by Doe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202365007\">\n    2017 WL 2365007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (granting summary judgment where plaintiff's admissions established that no explicit promise was made).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court need go no further, but it notes that Doe's promissory estoppel claim would fail for other reasons as well. Because Doe acknowledged that (1) he was informed about the Sexual Misconduct Policy and encouraged to read it, and (2) Belmont followed that policy during its investigation, Doe cannot establish a question of fact regarding whether he relied on any promise to his detriment. Also regarding detrimental reliance, Doe was expected to participate in the sexual misconduct investigation and be truthful regardless of whether collateral violations might become a concern. In other words, Doe has not articulated any purported \"reliance\" on Zlock's alleged promise other than the participation\n   and truthfulness in the investigation that was otherwise required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In addition, Doe has not established a question of fact regarding the detriment he allegedly suffered, which must have been a substantial economic harm.\n   <em>\n    Atria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670411\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/142/246/#p256\">\n    142 F. App'x at 256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed in the Court's prior Memorandum Opinion, Doe claims impermissibly speculative damages related to educational opportunities, career prospects, and future earnings. (Doc. No. 40 at 26.) The summary judgment record is of no help to Doe on this point. Belmont suspended Doe for one semester with the ability to re-enroll; assigned institutional probation and loss of co-curricular organization leadership positions; and issued a permanent no-contact order. It was Doe's decision to not return to Belmont. Doe was admitted to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, but he chose not to enroll there. According to Doe, he then had little difficulty securing two different positions in the information technology field. On this record, no reasonable jury could conclude that Doe has suffered substantial economic harm as a result of Belmont's alleged (but unproven) promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Doe's opposition focuses at length on the alleged interplay between visitation violations addressed by Briscoe and visitation violations addressed by Zlock in the Determination Letter. Doe argues that it was only in Zlock's deposition, for the first time, that she asserted that the visitation violations for which she punished Doe in the Determination Letter were different from those considered by Briscoe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 50.) This is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, Doe appears to offer this argument based on the revised position that Belmont's explicit promise was only \"to be fair\" in the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 16.) But where, as here embodied in the Bruin Guide, there is a valid contractual relationship, Tennessee courts only recognize a claim for promissory estoppel in limited cases where the alleged promise operates to expand the terms of a contract.\n   <em>\n    Thomas Energy Corp. v. Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. E2014-00226-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207366676\">\n    2014 WL 7366676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (Tenn.

Because the Bruin Guide promises a fair investigation, Zlock's promise to be fair did not \"expand\" the term of the relationship between Doe and Belmont such that it may form the basis of Doe's promissory estoppel claim. Second, this argument is simply not supported by the record. As discussed above, Belmont has established that: (1) Briscoe and Zlock considered different visitation violations and were not involved in the substantive determinations of each other; (2) Zlock's Determination Letter references visitation violations that arose during the sexual misconduct investigation (based on the parties' statements and e-mails) and are different than those considered by Briscoe; (3) Zlock testified that the visitation violations she addressed in the Determination Letter were the ones she found through the course of the sexual misconduct investigation; and (4) Briscoe testified that the visitation violations she addressed were not part of the sexual misconduct investigation. Doe has not raised any serious challenge to these facts. Moreover, the primary collateral violation for which Doe was punished in the Determination Letter was his violation of the Deceptive Behavior Policy - something Doe does not even suggest that Briscoe was involved with at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, Belmont is entitled to summary judgment on Doe's remaining promissory estoppel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Counts V and VII - Negligence and Gross Negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Under Tennessee law, a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for negligence includes the following\n   five elements: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) conduct by the defendant falling below the applicable standard of care that amounts to a breach of that duty; (3) an injury or loss; (4) causation in fact; and (5) proximate, or legal, causation.\n   <em>\n    Merhson v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    HPT TA Props.

Doe has not identified through discovery any additional duty that Belmont allegedly owed him beyond the obligations set forth in the Bruin Guide and Sexual Misconduct Policy.

Specifically, Belmont argues that the record reflects that the process it used to conduct the investigation was \"thorough, transparent, and entirely consistent with the process set forth in the Bruin Guide.\" (Doc. No. 45 at 21.) As discussed herein, Doe testified during his deposition that the process that Zlock explained was consistent with the Sexual Misconduct Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 71-1 at 12.) Doe testified that the \"general framework of the investigation was pretty much how [he] expected it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Even when asked about the process that Zlock had used to find him responsible for the collateral Deceptive Behavior Policy violation, Doe responded, \"\n   <em>\n    [h]onestly, I don't dispute the process.\n   </em>\n   I disagree with their\n   <em>\n    findings.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   71-1 at 59 (emphasis added).) Belmont's Determination Letter, appeals determinations, declarations and deposition testimony all establish that the university followed the Sexual Misconduct Policy accountability process set forth in the Bruin Guide. Furthermore, Zlock's choice of sanctions was within a range of discretionary punishments allowed by the Sexual Misconduct Policy accountability process. As is particularly clear from Doe's deposition testimony, he merely believes that he did not\n   <em>\n    substantively merit\n   </em>\n   the sanctions for the collateral violations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Q. And is there a specific area in which they did not exercise the care you feel like they should have that forms the basis for your claim?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. Yes, sir, with the sanctions that they assigned me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q.

Of course, showing mere disagreement with Belmont's preponderance-of-the-evidence substantive conclusions is a far cry from raising a question of material fact regarding whether Belmont was negligent in its duty of care to implement the Sexual Misconduct Policy accountability process in a non-negligent manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, because they are wholly dependent upon the Bruin Guide, Doe's negligence and gross negligence claims are an impermissible second bite at the apple of contract claims dismissed from this action.

Doe alleged that Zlock \"lacked the proper training to carry out her responsibilities\" under relevant federal and state law and Belmont University's sexual misconduct policy and \"committed negligent, grossly negligent, and intentional tortious acts that caused injury to Plaintiff.\" (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 164-165.) This claim fails for two main reasons. First, as discussed above, Doe has failed to establish the basic elements of a negligence claim. Even when he frames the purported breach in terms of Zlock specifically, rather than Belmont as an institution, Doe still has neither (1) identified a source of duty that Zlock owed to Doe outside the contractual relationship established by the Bruin Guide and Sexual Misconduct Policy, nor (2) raised a question of fact about whether Zlock, acting on behalf of Belmont, breached a duty of care by applying the Sexual Misconduct Policy to him in a manner that posed an unreasonable risk of harm. Second, and equally important, Doe has not raised a question of material fact regarding the additional required element for this claim - that is, whether Belmont was aware that Zlock was unfit for her job. To the contrary, the record establishes that Zlock was an experienced, licensed attorney in good standing; a level four certified Title IX Coordinator, and an active member of the Association of Title IX Administrators. Doe has made no evidence-based challenge to Zlock's training in the administration and oversight of Title IX investigations. Setting insinuations about Zlock's motives aside, there is no record evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Zlock was unqualified for her\n   job or that Belmont had any knowledge of such unfitness before the Doe investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Accordingly, Belmont is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court has recognized that sexual misconduct investigations on campus raise issues that are important to the community as well as very personal to those whose lives are touched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Z.J. v.

Dec. 19, 2018). This was a difficult case at the university level. Neither party was satisfied with the outcome. Also, a student was found not responsible for sexual misconduct but responsible for collateral violations of other university policies. However, the Court is not to assume the role of an investigator or to substitute its judgment for that of the academic institution. The Court is only to determine if any of Doe's legal claims should survive summary judgment and be tried to a jury. For the reasons discussed herein, on the record before the Court, the Court concludes that Belmont is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of Doe's remaining claims. Belmont's Motion to Strike and Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. Nos. 44, 60) will be granted and this case will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   An appropriate order will enter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Due to confidentiality concerns and the sensitive issues involved in this case, pseudonyms are utilized to protect anonymity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Counsel for Belmont declares that he presented this information to Doe's counsel; stated that, \"[a]ccordingly, the current 2018 version [i.e., Exhibit A] could not have been something you or your client relied on in 2016\"; and requested that counsel withdraw her Declaration and Exhibit A in lieu of the filing of a motion to strike.

Second, even if the PDF version produced by Belmont early in this litigation was actually different from the version actually relied on by Doe and his counsel (which is not supported by the record), that Doe and his counsel claim to have not noticed this fact until briefing the summary judgment motion must inure to their own detriment, not to Belmont's.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The parties have put forth over 35 pages of facts and responses.

It then moves to a formal investigatory process by notification to the respondent of the accusation of sexual misconduct and provision of a copy of the complainant's written statement.

However, in support of this assertion, Doe cites only to \"Exhibit I\" to Document Number 51, which is a three-page excerpt of the deposition of Doe's father that is irrelevant to this issue. Obviously, this is insufficient. Briscoe's sworn Declaration establishes that she was not involved in Zlock's Title IX investigatory process. (Doc. No. 47 at \u00b6 21.) Furthermore, Briscoe discusses at multiple points in her deposition that she was \"unaware\" of the discipline Doe received for the violations considered by Zlock.

The parties do\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    dispute that Student T. was interviewed as part of the investigation and that his statement was provided to them for review. Doe simply disagrees with the weight and credibility that Belmont assigned to Student T.'s evidence, neither of which are material here. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc.

However, in his deposition, Doe could not remember whether it was done by him or his father and, during extensive questioning, he had little memory of the entire episode of challenging Student S.'s text messages, could not recall who challenged them, or even if it was done on his behalf.

Beyond this, in Doe opposition brief, counsel for Doe does not appear to seriously dispute that the attack on Student S.'s text messages was submitted on Doe's behalf during the investigation, nor is it contended that the representations in question were made without Doe or his counsel's knowledge or approval. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. Nos. 51; 59.)

As part of her appeal, Student S submitted new information alleging that Doe had violated the no-contact order between the parties by directing a family member of his to contact a co-worker of hers. (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 57.) Donovan ordered that a separate investigation be conducted of this alleged violation. (Doc. No. 48-7 at 2-3.) On January 6, Zlock advised Doe of this alleged violation by email, provided him the details of the investigation that would be conducted by Deputy Title IX Coordinator Dr. Donna Gwaltney, and explicitly informed Doe that she was recusing herself from the matter. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 58; 48-9.) Zlock did not participate in the investigation of the alleged no contact order violation and was not involved in the determination of responsibility or any sanctions issued. (Doc. Nos. 51 at \u00b6 58; 48.) Doe has curiously filed a Declaration stating that Zlock never informed him of her recusal. He has not, however, denied receiving the January 6 email in which Zlock stated exactly that. Regardless, because this issue was raised by Student S. after Zlock's Determination Letter of December 13, it could not have played a role in her assessment of sanctions against Doe. (Doc.

For example, a school administrator's express statement of a desire to retaliate against students due to their complaints of unequal treatment on the basis of sex could be direct evidence of retaliatory intent. Doe's evidence, however, clearly requires drawing inferences. It would require the jury to infer that Belmont intended to retaliate against him because he was a male who defended himself in a sexual misconduct investigation and that it acted upon that alleged intent by punishing Doe simply because he did so. This is particularly so where Belmont has offered multiple non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. The Court therefore proceeds under the\n    <em>\n     Mc-Donnell Douglas\n    </em>\n    framework governing indirect evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    When asked at his deposition if Zlock described the \"process that would be followed during the course of th[e] investigation,\" Doe responded, \"Yes.\" (Doc.

Doe further testified that, other than in one instance when he did not receive an extension of time to take an accounting test and another instance when the interview of Student T. was delayed but ultimately conducted and included as part of the investigation, there was no other process or procedure that he requested in the course of the investigation that he did not receive.

Doe was merely suspended from Belmont for one semester for collateral violations with certain limitations upon his return. But Doe's opposition brief paints a curiously different picture of the world than is reflected in his deposition testimony. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs. No. 50 at 21; 71-1.) In it, Doe asserts that he \"couldn't go to school, couldn't graduate, couldn't get into another school....\" (Doc. No. 51 at 21.) And yet Doe could have returned to Belmont after one semester. He could have matriculated at UT-Chattanooga after he was accepted. And, because he had approximately 60 credits, Doe could have graduated from either of those institutions before too long.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"43\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Doe's opposition brief states that, once he was charged with sexual misconduct, he \"saw a psychiatrist and took medication for the first time in his life.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .) This assertion has no citation, and it is absent from the parties' statements of facts. Furthermore, without revealing confidential information, this statement appears so at odds with Doe's deposition testimony that it is difficult for the Court to fathom how counsel included it in his brief without explanation. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 71-1 at 67-70.) Regardless, if this is a belated attempt to establish a dispute of fact regarding Doe's mental state, Doe obviously has not sufficiently cited to the summary judgment record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

(Doc. No. 50 at 21.) The Court will not entertain this new argument because Count VIII of the Complaint, which was very specific to Zlock, did not encompass the investigators and thus did not give Belmont notice to defend against such a claim.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Desparois v.

Regardless, there is no support for this assertion about Doe's investigators in the record, which establishes that Zlock trained and oversaw her personnel. The record further establishes that it was solely Zlock's responsibility to review the evidence. Zlock led and was actively involved in the investigation (e.g., by asking follow-up questions, ordering the text message analysis, etc.), and she alone reached the substantive decisions reflected in the Determination Letter, which were then upheld at two independent levels of appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
