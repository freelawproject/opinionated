The removing parties, eight of the nine Third-Party Defendants, oppose remand, arguing the action was properly removed under the doctrine of complete preemption (i.e., that Veritec's claims are completely preempted by the Patent and Copyright Acts). Alternatively, they contend their declaratory judgment counterclaims create a removable federal question, which makes removal of the entire action appropriate. These arguments present novel questions of law not previously answered by any court within the Eighth Circuit and implicate fundamental questions regarding the nature and scope of federal jurisdiction. Because the \"complete preemption\" doctrine expands federal court jurisdiction in derogation of the well-pleaded complaint rule, this court declines to apply it here. Moreover, although the declaratory judgment counterclaims must be litigated in federal court, their assertion does not support removal of the entire action. Accordingly, this Court recommends that the declaratory judgment be severed from this action and that the remainder of the action be remanded to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This action began in state court as a two-count complaint by David and Denise Badhwa against Veritec, Inc., alleging breach of a promissory note and unjust enrichment. Notice of Removal Ex. A (Amended Complaint), Docket No. 1-1. Along with an answer and affirmative defenses, Veritec brought thirteen claims against the Badhwas and the nine parties it added through a third-party complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A (Veritec, Inc.'s Verified Answer, Countercl., and Third-Party Compl. 5-38).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Veritec alleges that Badhwa, who is president of JAB Companies, entered into a licensing agreement with Veritec to develop and distribute new products in foreign markets. This arrangement included a confidentiality agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Countercl. and Third-Party Compl. 12-13). At roughly the same time, Veritec was negotiating with Steven Renner, Joseph Morris, and their associated entities regarding business opportunities related to the products Badhwa was helping develop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (19-20). When these discussions broke down, Badhwa allegedly circumvented his agreement with Veritec and began using information he learned while working with Veritec to develop competing products for Renner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Veritec brought counterclaims and third-party claims against the Badhwas and JAB Companies for breach of the\n   confidentiality agreement, breach of fiduciary duties, usurpation of a business opportunity, misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion, and unjust enrichment. Veritec also brought third-party claims against Renner, Morris, and their business entities for tortious interference with contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, aiding and abetting the Badhwas' actions, and unjust enrichment. In pleading its counterclaims and third-party claims, Veritec referred to several of its patents and copyrights and alleged on \"information and belief, discovery may reveal that one of more Counter-Defendants or Third-Party Defendants are infringing upon Veritec's patent rights [or its] copyright in its source code.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (11-12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to the third-party complaint, the Renner- and Morris-affiliated Third-Party Defendants filed nine declaratory judgment counterclaims against Veritec, seeking a declaration of non-infringement of Veritec's patents and copyrights. Shortly after filing their answer and counterclaims, these Third-Party Defendants removed the case to federal court. This Court ordered briefing on the issue of its jurisdiction over the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Meanwhile, Veritec filed an amended counterclaim and third-party complaint, removing any direct reference to its copyrights and patents, but maintaining the original thirteen claims alleged in the original pleading it filed in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Veritec moved to remand the matter. The Court referred the motion to the undersigned for a report and recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The removing parties offer two theories justifying this Court's exercise of jurisdiction over the removed action, neither of which has been addressed in this Circuit. First, they argue that at least one of the claims in Veritec's third-party complaint is \"completely preempted\" by the Copyright or Patent Act, so as to render the entire action removable. Second, the removing parties contend that, because their declaratory judgment counterclaim to Veritec's third-party complaint arises under federal law, the entire case may properly be removed to federal court. Neither argument is ultimately persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Generally, defendants to a civil action in state court may remove it to federal court if the action could have originally been brought there.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In its August 6, 2018 Order, this Court expressed skepticism about its ability to exercise jurisdiction over a case removed through a third-party complaint, even if a federal question was clearly pleaded. Based upon this Circuit's interpretation of the federal-question removal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , such removal would not be allowed because it is \"too much akin to the tail wagging the dog.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Further analysis has not changed the Court's view regarding \u00a7 1441.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But recent statutory changes allow for removal even when based upon a third-party complaint (or a counterclaim thereto) if that pleading arises under federal patent and copyright law. In 2011, Congress expanded the scope of removal in actions \"in which any party asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, or copyrights.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201454\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

This would logically include third-party claims and counterclaims to those claims. Similarly, the provision allows a party to remove an action based upon its own patent or copyright claims. Although no court in this Circuit has yet interpreted this unique removal provision, at least one other district has held that a third-party claim may be removed under \u00a7 1454.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TransCardiac Therapeutics, Inc. v.

Ga. 2014) (retaining jurisdiction over third-party declaratory judgment claim to settle inventorship, but remanding all other claims and counterclaims). Thus, in this case the mechanism for removal (a third-party complaint) does not itself render the removal improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The question becomes whether any of the claims relied upon by the removing parties actually \"arise under\" federal patent or copyright law. The removing parties argue that (1) four of Veritec's claims in its third-party complaint arise under patent or copyright law, making removal based on the third-party complaint proper under the complete preemption doctrine, and (2) their declaratory judgment counterclaims to the third-party complaint directly arise under patent and copyright law, so as to support removal of the entire action in any event. The Court examines each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Veritec's Third-Party Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The removing parties first argue that at least one of the state law claims against them in Veritec's third-party complaint actually arises under patent or copyright law and the complete preemption doctrine allows removal of such a claim. No precedent binding on this Court has accepted this argument and this Court does not do so here. The complete preemption doctrine creates an \"exception\" to the well-pleaded complaint rule, but courts have struggled to apply it coherently and should be circumspect about extending its application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Application of The Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Removal based upon federal-question jurisdiction is generally governed by the well-pleaded complaint rule, which examines the facial allegations of the complaint to determine whether it \"affirmatively allege[s] a federal claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    539 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). In the context of patent and copyright claims, \u00a7 1454 seemingly abrogates the \"complaint\" portion of the well-pleaded complaint rule. But, to the extent the rule embodies principles of federalism and makes the \"claimant\" (if not the plaintiff) \"master of the claim,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    482 U.S. at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the \"well-pleaded\" requirement remains. Thus, where as here, removal is ostensibly based upon a third-party complaint under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201454\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court will apply the well-pleaded complaint rule to the third-party complaint to determine whether it pleads claims arising under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The removing parties concede that no federal claim appears on the face of Veritec's third-party complaint. Instead, they stake a position novel in this Circuit: that the doctrine of complete preemption applies to the Patent and Copyright Acts. Complete preemption is an \"independent corollary to the well-pleaded complaint rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201454\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201454\">\n    at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).

Mindful of the values of federalism and comity, and without binding precedent to the contrary, this Court declines to expand its jurisdiction in the manner urged by the removing parties.

In a later opinion also involving the LMRA, the Court provided a name for the doctrine, stating that, \"\n   <em>\n    Avco\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that if a federal cause of action completely preempts a state cause of action any complaint that comes within the scope of the federal cause of action necessarily 'arises under' federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Franchise Tax Bd. of State of Cal. v.

But, again, the Court provided no guidance as to when a claim would be subject to \"complete preemption\" such that it was properly removed to federal court and when the claim would merely be subject to the well-recognized defense of preemption such that the state court action would be dismissed but not removable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Since deciding\n   <em>\n    Avco\n   </em>\n   in 1968, the Supreme Court has applied the complete preemption doctrine in only two other federal statutory contexts.

The Fourth Circuit acknowledged in a footnote that, at the time the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act were passed, the derivative jurisdiction rule prevented removal of claims, even those within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n   <em>\n    Rosciszewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509500\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/225/\">\n    1 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   232 n.6. It seems a bizarre result to conclude, as that court did, that Congress intended these state law claims be removable because they arose under the Copyright Act, when no such removal was possible at the time Congress enacted the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Three other circuits, all since\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , have joined the Fourth Circuit and held that federal copyright law completely preempts certain state law claims. The Fifth and Sixth Circuits adopted the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit without much discussion, notably failing to address\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   's effect on the complete preemption doctrine analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GlobeRanger Corp. v.

The Second Circuit at least recognized the shift in precedent. It noted that, before\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , it \"would have hesitated to extend the complete preemption doctrine into the copyright field,\" but concluded that\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   means the Supreme Court now intends \"to extend the complete preemption doctrine to any federal statute that both preempts state law and substitutes a federal remedy for that law, thereby creating an exclusive cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Briarpatch Ltd., L.P. v.

It is not an absurd conclusion. But therein lies the very problem identified by Justice Scalia in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   -that, ultimately, acceptance of the complete preemption doctrine requires the abrogation of the well-pleaded complaint rule. And yet, not even the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   majority purported to abrogate the well-pleaded complaint rule. The Second Circuit's decision is simply not reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D. This Court's Analysis of Complete Preemption and Copyright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Unpersuaded by the courts that have done so, this Court declines to extend the complete preemption doctrine to either federal copyright or patent law. Justice Scalia's\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   dissent and Eighth Circuit precedent offer powerful reasons to take a circumspect approach to the doctrine. Viewed through this lens, the Copyright and Patent Acts do not possess the \"extraordinary\" preemptive effect required to make a claim pleaded exclusively in state law terms removable to federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Fundamentally, federal courts possess limited jurisdiction and are discouraged from expanding those limits set by the Constitution and Congress.\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p256\">\n    568 U.S. at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p256\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the complete preemption doctrine creates an exception-which the Supreme Court has called a corollary-to the well-pleaded complaint rule, courts must still consider these limitations as they apply that exception.

As the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   dissent and other commentators have noted, the most recent articulation of the doctrine provided in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   finds little support in the cases it cites.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    539 U.S. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Had it thought that today's decision was the law, the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   Court ... need not have pored over the legislative history of \u00a7 502(a) to show that Congress expected ERISA to be treated like the LMRA.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tarkington,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 242-44 (contrasting the congressional intent analysis in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   with that in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ). The upshot of this lack of clarity is, again, that lower courts should proceed cautiously in expanding the doctrine to new substantive fields.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With this caution in mind, the Copyright and Patent Acts lack the extraordinary characteristics necessary to completely preempt a cause of action that a party has chosen to plead solely as a state law claim. In this Circuit, \"removal under the complete preemption doctrine is proper only in circumstances where a federal statute completely displaces state law and it is clear Congress meant the federal statute to be the exclusive cause of action for the type of claim asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    MFA Petroleum Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710333\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/243/#p248\">\n    701 F.3d at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted). It is unclear that the Copyright and Patent Acts completely displace state law claims that relate in any way to patents or copyright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To be sure, Congress has been uncharacteristically clear that it wants copyright and patent claims litigated exclusively in federal court, as expressed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201338\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). But \u00a7 1338(a), standing alone, does not allow a federal court to hear a case removed on a facially valid state law claim. It does not create a federal remedy or even demonstrate Congress's intent to make such actions removable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    539 U.S. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p6\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, \u00a7 1338(a) simply denies the state courts concurrent jurisdiction over copyright and patent claims. Nothing more, nothing less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because \u00a7 1338 alone is not enough to make a state law claim removable, there must be an additional provision in the patent and copyright statutes justifying complete preemption. As to the Patent Act, the removing parties offer nothing. This is not surprising, as it appears that no federal court has found the Patent Act to completely preempt any state law claim that might relate to a patent. One can easily envision a state law cause of action that, based on its facts, \"relates to\" a patent but does not raise a question of federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to the Copyright Act, the removing parties appear to hang their hat on the same provision as those circuits that have found complete preemption applicable in this area:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant parts of the statute state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (a) ...

Thus, \u00a7 301(a) is not nearly as panoptic as those statutes which the Supreme Court has previously found completely preemptive.

The Copyright Act does not fit into that mold. The Act does not preempt, even defensively, a claim simply because copyrighted material is at issue; the claim is only preempted if it is within that narrow category of exclusive rights guaranteed to the copyright holder. Courts determining whether the Act preempts a state law claim must do so on the particular facts pleaded.

The unjust enrichment claim is generally pleaded, incorporating by reference all prior paragraphs and applying to\n   all Defendants; it is clear from the face of the Complaint that Veritec could possibly pursue the claim on multiple theories. True, Veritec's original Third-Party Complaint references patents and copyrights; but it also references, among other things, tortious interference with contracts, breach of fiduciary duties, and misappropriation of trade secrets.

By passing the provisions now codified in \u00a7 1454, Congress ensured that a patent or copyright claim appearing elsewhere than in the plaintiff's complaint was removable to federal court without the need for the state court to dismiss. It does not follow, however, that Congress sought to allow parties to opportunistically use such claims to overcome the otherwise still applicable edict that the plaintiff is master of the complaint.

The removing parties properly removed their own declaratory judgment counterclaims to federal court, but this Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the other claims, which predominate over the federal claims. Accordingly, the Court shall retain jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment counterclaims, but remands all other claims to Hennepin County District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the Court hereby RECOMMENDS THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   1. Defendant and Third-Party Plaintiff Veritec, Inc.'s Motion to Remand [Docket No. 11] be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2. The Court retain jurisdiction over those counterclaims to Veritec, Inc.'s Third-Party Complaint that seek declaratory relief, and that all other claims be remanded to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dated: November 21, 2018\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The Notice of Removal includes several separately paginated documents, making citation to the individual document the most practicable method.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    However, whether the entire action remains in federal court is another matter as the statute also permits this Court to remand any or all claims within its supplemental jurisdiction.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201454\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    To add further complication, some of the cases cited by the removing parties are, in fact, not preemption cases at all, but instead involve the \"distinct but related pocket\" of jurisdictional analysis that allows removal where a state law claim, although clearly not federal in nature, would require \"the resolution of a 'substantial question of federal law.' \" Gil Seinfeld,\n    <em>\n     The Puzzle of Complete Preemption\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20537\">\n     155 U.
