(Dkt. 38.) For the reasons addressed below, Defendant's motion is granted and the amended complaint is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case involves funding reductions to Minnesota's \"waiver services\" payment rates. Waiver services are services for which the federal government agrees, in limited circumstances, to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements that ordinarily would govern Medicaid assistance funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20430.25\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441.300. The state agency that administers a state's Medicaid program may apply to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for authorization to establish home and community-based waiver services, which are designed to enhance the ability of persons with disabilities to live in the community rather than in an institutional setting. Waiver services are administered by states but jointly funded by state and federal governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In Minnesota, the Department of Human Services (DHS) is the state agency responsible for licensing, certifying, and enrolling providers of waiver services. DHS also computes and approves waiver service payment rates according to Minnesota law. The Minnesota Disability Waiver Rate System (DWRS) provides a mathematical framework for establishing provider payment rates for approved waiver services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256B.4914. Enacted by the Minnesota Legislature, DWRS went into effect on January 1, 2014. Pursuant to DWRS, waiver service payment rates adjust automatically every five years to account for inflation. The first automatic inflationary adjustment occurred on July 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to the DWRS automatic inflationary adjustments, the Minnesota Legislature separately enacted three session laws that increased waiver service payment rates, with effective dates in 2014 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Minn. Laws, Ch. 312, Art. 27, \u00a7 75; 2013 Minn. Laws, Ch. 108, Art. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 60. These session laws, which cumulatively increased waiver service payment rates by 7%, affected all payment rates for Minnesota waiver service recipients without regard for the type of waiver services received or whether the payment rates had been set by DWRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the 2018 legislative session, the Minnesota Legislature passed an omnibus bill that, as relevant here, would have repealed the cumulative 7% waiver service payment rate increase and replaced it with different appropriations. However, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton vetoed that\n   omnibus bill in May 2018. Consequently, the three session laws that provide for the 7% waiver service payment rate increases remain in effect. Shortly thereafter the Commissioner of DHS, Defendant Emily Johnson Piper (Commissioner), announced that DHS intends to eliminate the 7% waiver service payment rate increase. The elimination of this rate increase will occur in multiple stages. The first funding reduction occurred on July 1, 2018, and the final funding reduction is scheduled to occur on December 31, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs ARRM and Minnesota Organization for Habilitation and Rehabilitation (MOHR) (collectively, \"Organizational Plaintiffs\") are nonprofit associations incorporated under Minnesota law. ARRM advances Minnesota's home and community-based service programs that support people living with disabilities, and its members include more than 200 service providers, businesses, and stakeholders, including nonprofit and for-profit entities that are certified to provide such services. MOHR is an association with more than 100 members that provide services to persons with disabilities. Plaintiffs Karla Dee Marder, Robert Clapper, Kathryn Smith, and Cara Pedrelli, through their respective guardians (collectively, \"Individual Plaintiffs\"), receive waiver services subject to DWRS. Plaintiffs commenced this action to enjoin the Commissioner from implementing the anticipated 7% funding reduction to Minnesota's waiver service payment rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which this Court denied in a June 28, 2018 Order. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 13, 2018. Count I alleges that the Commissioner's 7% funding reduction violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Count II alleges that the Commissioner's 7% funding reduction violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Count III alleges that the Commissioner's 7% funding reduction violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title 42, United States Code, Sections 12101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   And Count IV alleges that the Commissioner's 7% funding reduction violates the Rehabilitation Act, Title 29, United States Code, Sections 793\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Commissioner moves to dismiss, arguing that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims and that the amended complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Commissioner moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint in part pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), arguing that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Individual Plaintiffs' claims because the Individual Plaintiffs lack standing. The commissioner also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under Rule 12(b)(1), a defendant may challenge a plaintiff's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction either on its face or on the factual truthfulness of its averments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Moreover, these injuries are highly speculative given that one or more events could occur in the next nine months that might prevent these alleged injuries from ever arising-including, but not limited to, administrative, legislative, or judicial action.

In its June 28 Order, this Court reasoned that, as in\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrelli allege possible future injuries that depend on a speculative chain of possibilities that may not occur. Nothing in the amended complaint warrants altering that conclusion now.

The Organizational Plaintiffs allege that their members are subject to licensing and enrollment requirements, but they do not allege that their members' licenses have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise threatened. The Organizational Plaintiffs also allege that their members used the 7% funding increase to fund \"initiatives\" that are required by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, thereby suggesting that the Commissioner's 7% funding reduction prevents them from complying with the requirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. But the amended complaint does not specify what these \"initiatives\" are, does not allege that any such \"initiatives\" have been discontinued, and does not allege that any of the Organizational Plaintiffs' members have been disciplined or otherwise suffered adverse consequences based on any noncompliance with the requirements of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. As such, the amended complaint alleges no facts that would establish a concrete, particularized, or imminent harm to the Organizational Plaintiffs' members arising from a violation of either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the Organizational Plaintiffs lack standing as to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims asserted in the amended complaint.

Therefore, the Organizational Plaintiffs contend, the Commissioner's 7% funding reduction violates their right to procedural due process. The Commissioner counters that Plaintiffs' mere expectation of receiving a particular reimbursement rate in the future does not create a protected property interest and that, even if a protected property interest in such a prospective benefit exists, the Organizational Plaintiffs are afforded adequate process under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Procedural due process claims are reviewed in two steps.\n   <em>\n    Senty-Haugen v.
