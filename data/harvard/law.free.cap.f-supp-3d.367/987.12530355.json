The Court, being duly advised of the premises, denies said motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Mike Campbell brings a 42 U.S.C.\u00a7 1983 claim against Defendant, Missouri state representative Cheri Toalson Reisch, alleging that Reish violated his First Amendment rights by blocking him from commenting on her Twitter account. Campbell seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the allegations of Campbell's first amended complaint (Doc. # 22),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reisch is a State Representative for the 44th District of the Missouri House of Representatives. Reisch uses a social media platform Twitter. Reisch has operated a Twitter account under the handle\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"@CheriMO44\" since September 2015 (\"Account\"). Her Twitter profile states: \"Christian, MO State Rep 44th District, Mother, Grandmother.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Twitter is a social media platform owned and operated by Twitter, Inc., with more than 300 million active users worldwide. Twitter enables users to publish short messages to the general public called \"tweets,\" to republish or respond to others' tweets, and to interact with other users. Twitter users may \"follow\" other Twitter users. A followed user's tweets automatically appear in the following user's Twitter feed - a continually updating scroll of new tweets from other users. A user may comment on other users' tweets, or \"retweet\" their tweets to her own followers. Twitter also enables its users to block particular users from following their tweets. A blocked user who attempts to follow the blocking user will see a message informing the blocked user about the blocking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Campbell, a resident of Centralia, Missouri, is registered to vote in Missouri's 44\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   district, for which Reisch sits. Plaintiff is active on social media platforms, including Twitter, which he uses to follow and comment on posts by various state officials, including Reisch. Campbell alleges that Reisch uses her Account to address\n   her constituents, tout her accomplishments as a state representative, and promote her political agenda. Some examples of such tweets alleged in the complaint include: (i) a May 18, 2018 retweet of a message from House Speaker Todd Richardson with the comment, \"Thank you Mr. Speaker, you are a true gentleman. We worked hard and got the job done\"; (ii) a May 23, 2018 tweet, \"Great to have Governor @EricGreitens &amp; Hallsville Mayor at the NRA Bianchi Cup today\"; (iii) a June 13, 2018 tweet, \"Accomplished much in my 1st 2 years, ready for the next 2.\" Reisch also uses the account to tweet about various subjects of personal interest to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 22, 2018, Reisch tweeted about her appearance at a public event, at which her political opponent in the November 6, 2018 general election, Maren Jones, also appeared. Resich tweeted \"Sad my opponent put her hands behind her back during the Pledge.\" On June 23, 2018, Representative Kip Kendrick criticized Reisch's tweet by commenting, \"Maren's father was a Lieutenant in the Army. Two of her brothers served in the military. I don't question [Maren's] patriotism. That's a low blow and unacceptable from a member of the Boone County delegation.\" Campbell retweeted Kendrick's criticism in Reisch's Account. After this retweet, Reisch permanently blocked Campbell from following or commenting on her Account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Reisch also allegedly blocked dozens of other Twitter users from seeing or commenting on her tweets, including many of her own constituents in the 44th House District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Campbell claims that such blocking is an impermissible viewpoint-based restriction that violates his free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In the instant motion, Reisch moves the Court to dismiss Campbell's complaint for insufficient pleading under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Reisch contends, however, that dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is appropriate because (i) the public forum analysis does not apply to Reisch's Account, because Twitter, is owned by a private company; and (ii) Campbell failed to sufficiently allege that any part of Reisch's Account is a designated public forum since her only interest in the Account is a license to use that Twitter can revoke at any time and for any reason; (iii) Campbell has not been excluded from the interactive space within Reisch's Account, because he can still respond to other users' comments within the Account. Campbell responds that the public forum doctrine is applicable to a private space, like a website, based on government control, and that by using her Account to address and seek comment from her constituents on matters of public concern, Reisch created a designated public forum. Campbell further asserts that whether he was actually excluded from the interactive space is irrelevant for purposes of a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

Reisch argues that (i) she does not operate her account on behalf of the State and (ii) blocking a Twitter account is not an exercise of state power. Campbell asks the Court to rely on the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , where the court addressed the issue of state action together with the public forum analysis, concluding that \"[b]ecause facilities or locations deemed to be public forums are usually operated by governments, determining that a particular facility or location is a public forum usually suffices to render the challenged action taken there to be state action subject to First Amendment limitations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Section 1983's \"under color of state law\" requirement has consistently been treated as equivalent to the Fourteenth Amendment's \"state action\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
