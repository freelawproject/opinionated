(\"Highland\" or \"Defendant\") to dismiss Plaintiff GW Holdings Group, LLC's (\"Plaintiff\" or \"GW\") complaint. For the reasons below, Defendant's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court takes the following facts and allegations from the complaint and, for the purposes of this motion, deems them to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff GW is a New York limited liability company with a place of business in Brooklyn, New York and members residing in New York and California. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) On information and belief, Defendant Highland is a Nevada corporation with principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following \"arm's-length negotiations,\" Plaintiff and Defendant executed two securities purchase agreements-on May 17, 2016 and March 15, 2018-that provided for the Plaintiff's purchase of two Convertible Redeemable Promissory Notes (the \"First Note\" and \"Second Note\" respectively, collectively the \"Notes\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 21-22.) Both Notes (1) required Defendant to reserve a certain amount of shares of its\n   common stock for Plaintiff's conversion, (2) gave Plaintiff \"the right to periodically request that the number of Reserved Shares be increased [so as to equal at least] 400% of the number of shares of\" Defendant's common stock issuable upon conversion of that Note, and (3) required Defendant to maintain with a transfer agent four times the amount of shares required if the Notes were to be fully converted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or around March 21, 2018, Plaintiff \"issued a notice of conversion, seeking to convert a portion of the First Note into shares of stock.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Defendant honored the notice but used a portion of the stock reserve set up for the Second Note to comply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or around April 27, 2018, Plaintiff issued an additional notice of conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Although Highland's CEO Everett Dickson (\"Dickson\") initially indicated that Highland would not honor the notice, Highland eventually permitted the conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or around May 10, 2018, however, Dickson advised Plaintiff that he would \"block\" future conversions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) The next day, Highland's attorney sent a letter to the transfer agent instructing it not to honor conversion notices and asserting that past conversions were improper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or around May 14, 2018, Plaintiff requested that Defendant increase the number of shares in reserve in accordance with both Notes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Defendant refused in violation of both Notes and the securities purchase agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 11, May 22, and May 29, 2018, Plaintiff submitted notices of conversion which Defendant refused to honor in violation of the terms of the Notes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-39, 50.) Apparently around this time Defendant also became delinquent in various filings which also materially breached the terms of both Notes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it is impossible for it to accurately calculate its losses from Highland's refusal to honor their conversion notices as Highland's stock price traded at various values throughout the periods when Plaintiff sought conversion, and it is impossible to discern with any accuracy precisely when and how many converted shares Plaintiff would have sold had Highland honored the conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 6, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint for specific performance, breach of contract, permanent injunction, and recovery of costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-87.) The complaint alleges that the Court has diversity jurisdiction over these state law claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) because there is complete diversity of citizenship between the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Although Plaintiff acknowledged that its losses are \"impossible\" to calculate, it estimates its breach of contract damages to be \"in excess of $225,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 11, 2018, Defendant brought this motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's 12(b)(1) Motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When faced with a motion to dismiss pursuant to both Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), a court should decide the \"jurisdictional question [under Rule 12(b)(1) ] first because a disposition of a 12(b)(6) motion is a decision on the merits, and\n   therefore, an exercise of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Waldman v.

Dec. 10, 2008) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of proving that the amount in controversy meets the $75,000 jurisdictional threshold.

In so arguing, Defendant relies on the inconsistency of Plaintiff's assertion that calculating its losses are impossible with their allegation-made \"baldly and without connection to any discernable factual predicate\"-that its damages on the breach of contract claim are in excess of $225,000. (Supp. at 2; Repl. at 3-4.) Plaintiff responds that the \"facts alleged in the complaint articulate [Plaintiff's] expectation that the conversion of the notes into the shares of stock (had its notices of conversion been honored) would have yielded [ ] monetary proceeds in excess of\" $75,000. (Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 8, ECF No. 21 (filed July 23, 2018).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the complaint only states an amount of damages in connection with the breach of contract claim. Under New York law, which governs Plaintiff's claim, damages in a breach of contract case \"are intended to return the parties to the point at which the breach arose and to place the nonbreaching party in as good a position as it would have been had the contract been performed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Bi-Economy Mkt., Inc. v.

Plaintiff's states that, to be made whole, it is entitled to damages equivalent to \"the difference between the share price on the day the conversion notices were sent and the day that [P]laintiff is ultimately able to convert.\" (Opp. at 10 n.1.) This amount is apparently \"in excess of $225,000.\" That estimate, however, is conclusory as there are no factual allegations in the complaint to substantiate that estimate or explain how Plaintiff reached it. Without such a showing, the Court is unable to assess whether there is a \"reasonable probability\" that these damages necessarily exceed the $75,000 jurisdictional threshold.
