Rooke, David Reeder, and Gary Stromquist (the \"Individual Defendants,\" and collectively with Lexmark, the \"Defendants\") move pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") in this putative securities fraud class action. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations in the Complaint are presumed true on this motion. The putative class includes all persons and entities (\"Plaintiffs\") who acquired Lexmark's publicly traded stock between August 1, 2014 and July 20, 2015 (the \"Class Period\"). Lexmark is a global manufacturer of printers and related supplies. (Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 63 (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6 34.) The Individual Defendants were Lexmark senior executives during the Class Period. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made materially false or misleading statements and omissions in SEC filings, press releases, earnings calls, and investor conferences between August 1, 2014 and May 28, 2015 in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Plaintiffs also bring a Section 20(a) claim against the Individual Defendants for control person liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Lexmark's Laser Printer Supplies Business and \"Channel Inventory\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the years leading up to the Class Period, Lexmark shifted its emphasis from inkjet printers to higher-end laser printers and printing software. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 46.) To fund its nascent software development, Lexmark relied heavily on its printer supplies business, which was the Company's \"primary profit engine.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6,\n   44-45.) Sales to Lexmark's Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") segments were particularly important, generating between 35 and 37% of the Company's total revenue in 2014-2015. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lexmark sold laser printer supplies to its channel of distributors and resellers (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"selling in\"), who would then sell the supplies to end-user customers (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"selling through\"). (Compl. \u00b6 8.) However, Lexmark recorded sales as revenue when it shipped supplies to distributors and resellers and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   when those supplies were sold to end users. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 52.) These supplies were referred to as \"channel inventory,\" which was measured in the number of weeks it would take for the distributors and resellers to sell the supplies to end users. (Compl. \u00b6 8.) Because channel inventory was no longer on Lexmark's shelves, the Company used models to estimate channel inventory levels. (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Lexmark did not publicly report its estimated channel inventory levels during the Class Period. (Compl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Lexmark's Alleged \"Channel Stuffing\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in a process known colloquially as \"channel stuffing.\" Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that in 2014 and early 2015, Lexmark flooded the EMEA channel with printer supplies. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 52.) Because Lexmark's accounting practices recognized revenue when Lexmark \"sold\" those supplies into the channel to distributors, and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   when distributors resold them out of the channel to end users, the effect of aggressive channel sales was to inflate present revenues at the expense of future revenues. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) Inevitably, distributors reached a saturation point and needed to \"sell through\" the inventory glut before they could accept additional printer supplies from Lexmark. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) And while that offloading occurred, Lexmark's ability to \"sell into\" the inventory channel and generate new revenue was impaired. (Compl. \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, excess channel inventory was exacerbated by two circumstances. First, beginning in mid-2014 and into 2015, the euro declined relative to the U.S. dollar. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 51.) To reduce the risk of arbitrage, Lexmark raised printer supplies prices worldwide-including in EMEA-incrementally in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 (\"3Q14,\" \"4Q14,\" and \"1Q15\"). (Compl. \u00b6 51.) In turn, this price harmonization incentivized distributors and resellers to stock up on printer supplies inventory to lock in lower prices. (Compl. \u00b6 52.) Second, the declining euro coincided with a tapering end-user demand for laser printer toner, one of Lexmark's most profitable products. (Compl. \u00b6 58.) Lower end-user demand made it more difficult for Lexmark's distributors and resellers to offload Lexmark's already bloated channel inventory. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 21, 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lexmark normally endeavored to keep its channel inventory levels between 6 and 10 weeks. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 65.) Plaintiffs claim that Individual Defendants attended monthly calls during which they received updates on Lexmark's estimated printer supplies channel inventory levels (\"CEO Calls\"). (Compl. \u00b6 53.) Moreover, internal slide decks detailing historical, current, and future forecasts of Lexmark's EMEA printer supplies channel inventory by weeks and dollar amount were distributed and discussed during the CEO Calls. (Compl. \u00b6 54.) Plaintiffs allege that these CEO Call presentations depict a sequential increase in EMEA printer supplies channel inventory levels throughout the Class Period above the acceptable threshold of\n   10 weeks. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.) Specifically, EMEA channel inventory levels were: (1) 6.5 weeks at the end of 2012; (2) 8.4 weeks at the end of 1Q14; (3) 10 weeks at the end of 2Q14; (4)\n   <em>\n    10.1\n   </em>\n   weeks at the end of 3Q14; (5)\n   <em>\n    12.7\n   </em>\n   weeks at the end of 4Q14; and (6)\n   <em>\n    12.8\n   </em>\n   weeks at the end of 1Q15. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-56 (emphases added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Lexmark's Alleged Misrepresentations and Omissions and Plaintiffs' Losses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Channel inventory was a subject of concern for investors because of its possibility for abuse and Lexmark's general silence on the topic. (Compl. \u00b6 9.) According to Plaintiffs, between August 1, 2014 and May 28, 2015, Defendants made a series of materially misleading statements and omissions in SEC filings, press releases, earnings calls, and investor conferences about Lexmark's channel inventory levels and their impact on Lexmark's financial health. These misstatements and omissions, which span 24 pages of the Complaint, can generally be categorized as follows: (1) misstatements and omissions regarding changes in Lexmark's channel inventory levels; (2) misstatements and omissions regarding the underlying driver of Lexmark's printer supplies revenue; and (3) misstatements and omissions regarding the scope and impact of Lexmark's price harmonization efforts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74-117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that these misstatements and omissions artificially inflated Lexmark's stock price to $ 51.17 on August 14, 2014. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 159.) On July 21, 2015, Lexmark revealed in an earnings call that its dismal 2Q15 performance was attributable to a decline in printer supplies revenue stemming from the need to reduce elevated channel inventory, especially in EMEA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 118-125.) Following these corrective disclosures, Lexmark's stock price plummeted 20% from $ 47.32 per share on July 20, 2015 to $ 37.75 per share on July 21. (Compl. \u00b6 161.) Following further post-Class Period disclosures acknowledging decreasing demand for Lexmark's printer supplies and elevated channel inventory, Lexmark was sold to a group of Chinese investors in November 2016, at which time its stock ceased trading on the NYSE.

Plaintiffs do not object to the Court's consideration of any of those materials. But irrespective of Plaintiffs' consent, this Court may not properly consider materials outside the Complaint without treating the motion as one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

As this Court declines to convert Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one for summary judgment, further discussion is warranted as to which documents this Court considers in determining whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Exhibits A-F are SEC filings and can be considered on this motion. Exhibits G, H, I, K, S, T, U, V, and W are transcripts of earnings calls or investor conferences that are explicitly quoted in the Complaint, and Plaintiffs do not dispute their authenticity. Accordingly, the Court may also consider these documents when analyzing the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pehlivanian v. China Gerui Advanced Materials Grp., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289746\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/628/#p643\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (incorporating by reference and considering transcripts of earnings and results conference calls where plaintiff heavily cited and quoted them throughout the complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Exhibits J and L warrant a more extended discussion. Those exhibits are internal slide decks that accompanied the CEO Calls for January 2015 and July 2015. Plaintiffs argue that the slide decks support their argument that Defendants acted with scienter because the exhibits demonstrate that Defendants had access to data showing that\n   <em>\n    EMEA\n   </em>\n   channel inventory levels were swollen. Defendants cite these exhibits to bolster their own arguments and contend that they undercut the alleged falsity of their statements regarding channel inventory because the slide decks demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    worldwide\n   </em>\n   channel inventory levels were under Lexmark's 10-week threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But before the Court can reach these arguments, it must address whether these two exhibits were incorporated by reference or relied on in drafting the Complaint. The Complaint references the slide decks that accompanied the CEO Calls in the aggregate as well as revenue and channel inventory figures in those slide decks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-57.)

For the sake of economy, this Court groups the alleged false or misleading statements into three general categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants misrepresented Lexmark's printer supplies channel inventory levels by claiming that (1) channel inventory levels were \"flat,\" \"neutral,\" or that they only increased \"a bit\"; and (2) the estimated change in printer supplies channel inventory was expected to have a \"minimal impact\" on revenue growth rates. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 94, 100.) Plaintiffs allege that these statements were misleading or presented an incomplete picture because Defendants failed to disclose that (1) Lexmark's EMEA channel inventory remained at elevated levels; (2) Lexmark's printer supplies revenue growth was impacted by the elevated channel inventory; and (3) Lexmark's distributors and resellers stocked up on printer supplies inventory ahead of price increases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants contend that their statements regarding Lexmark's channel inventory were accurate because Defendants only spoke to\n   <em>\n    worldwide\n   </em>\n   channel inventory. Defendants also argue that their statements were literally true because they addressed channel inventory growth's contribution to revenue\n   <em>\n    growth rates\n   </em>\n   year-to-year, rather than pure revenue, and that inventory bloat alone would not actually affect the revenue\n   <em>\n    growth rate\n   </em>\n   . In doing so, Defendants rely extensively on Exhibits J and L, which as explained earlier, this Court will not consider. And a determination of how channel inventory precisely affects revenue growth is a factual inquiry inappropriate at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But more fundamentally, even if literally true, Defendants' statements may have been misleading by what they failed to mention-the true nature of Lexmark's EMEA channel inventory levels and that revenue reports reflected excessive \"sales\" into channel inventory. And the central allegations in the Complaint-specifically, the importance of EMEA to Lexmark's revenue, analysts' and investors' concerns about channel inventory levels, the degree to which those alleged levels exceeded Lexmark's target threshold, and investors' shock when they learned about the channel inventory discrepancies-amply suggest that investors would have wanted to know that Lexmark's EMEA channel inventory had swollen to unusual levels during the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Revlon, Inc. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20293820\">\n    2001 WL 293820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2001) (\"[T]he Court cannot say that Revlon's customers' allegedly ballooning inventories ... are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the issue of materiality.\" (quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs aver that Defendants misrepresented the impetus behind Lexmark's printer supplies revenue growth during the Class Period by attributing the growth to \"robust,\" or \"good,\" or \"strong\" end-user demand and describing end-user demand as the \"primary driver\" of year-to-year growth. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 81, 105.) Plaintiffs contend that these statements were false because end-user demand for laser printer toner was actually decreasing. Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that the statements were misleading because Defendants did not disclose the outsize impact of increased channel inventory levels on revenue growth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As an initial matter, in claiming that end-user demand was decreasing, Plaintiffs rely only on the allegation that Lexmark's competitors-HP and Xerox-were experiencing waning end-user demand. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 153.) This alone is insufficient to suggest that Defendants' statements were false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinberg v. Ericsson LM Tel.

From the outset, Defendants' blanket characterization of the statements as mere opinions strains credulity. \"[S]tatements of opinion include subjective statements that reflect judgments as to values that [are] not objectively determinable.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Aratana Therapeutics Inc.

Some of the alleged misstatements purport to state historical facts. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 59 (\"Strong end-user demand was the primary driver of year-to-year growth, but we estimate that the laser supplies channel inventory increased slightly.\"), \u00b6 98 (\"Laser supplies revenue increased 5% YTY primarily due to strong end user demand ....\").) While channel inventory projections were rooted in estimates and inherently less determinable, there was very little equivocation in Defendants' statements on the reasons for increased\n   <em>\n    revenue\n   </em>\n   that would suggest they were merely subjective judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   But even if these disclosures were statements of opinion, they may still be actionable. Under\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff must identify \"particular (and material) facts going to the basis for the issuer's opinion-facts about the inquiry the issuer did or did not conduct or the knowledge it did or did not have-whose omission makes the opinion statement at issue misleading to a reasonable person reading the statement fairly and in context.\"\n   <em>\n    Omnicare, Inc. v.

However, defense counsel in class action securities litigation might think twice before introducing documents on a motion to dismiss that would not otherwise be available to plaintiffs, given the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\") automatic discovery stay. As demonstrated by counsel's arguments in this case, such documents can spawn potentially competing inferences that may tend to bolster plaintiffs' claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
