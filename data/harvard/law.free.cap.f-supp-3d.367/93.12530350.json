The Distribution Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bais Yaakov is a religious corporation and a high school. (Decl. of David Sussman (\"Sussman Decl.\") \u00b6 1 (Dkt. No. 65).) ETS is a non-profit corporation known for its role in administering the SAT, PSAT, and AP exams. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 1.) ETS owns the rights to various educational products and services, including Criterion, which is a web-based application that evaluates a student's writing skills and provides diagnostic feedback and a holistic score. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2008, ETS entered into an exclusive distribution agreement (\"Distribution Agreement\") with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (\"HMH\"), pursuant to which HMH obtained the exclusive right to distribute, market, and advertise Criterion in the K-12 school market in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) ETS and HMH signed the Distribution Agreement on June 25, 2008, and that initial contract spanned the time period of June 25, 2008 to December 31, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The Distribution Agreement was extended through December 31, 2012 by amendment dated December 30, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) This Distribution Agreement was operative on November 15, 2012 when the fax at issue in this litigation (the \"HMH Fax\" or \"Fax\") was sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, ETS agreed not to sell Criterion in the K-12 school market in the United States-only HMH could do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) HMH agreed to \"comply with any and all applicable laws, regulations and other rules in the performance of its obligations under this agreement, including regulations relating to the marketing of the service.\" This included the TCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) ETS did not itself advertise or market its Criterion Service to the K-12 market in the United States. Instead, ETS relied solely on HMH to do so. (Pl.'s 56.1 Counter \u00b6 4.) The Distribution Agreement granted HMH the exclusive right to market Criterion. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 12.) HMH was also solely responsible for signing up new customers for ETS's Criterion Service, and for sending to ETS completed and signed subscriber agreements, which enabled ETS to activate new customers' accounts. (Pl.'s 56.1 Counter \u00b6 7.) The Distribution Agreement did not address HMH undertaking any specific forms of marketing, and it made no mention of marketing by facsimile (or \"fax\"). (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 13.) The Distribution Agreement provided that HMH would \"use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the use and sale of Criterion,\" (Decl. of Andrew S. Kleinfeld, Esq. (\"Kleinfeld Decl.\") Ex. E, at \u00a7 5.1 (Distribution Agreement between ETS and HMH (\"Distribution Agreement\") ) (Dkt. No. 250-5) ), and \"establish the marketing strategy ... [and] develop and distribute marketing and promotional materials,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5.1(i)-(ii) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Distribution Agreement provided that HMH would \"only make such representations about [Criterion] as have been expressly approved, in writing and in advance, by ETS, or which are contained in other materials provided by ETS,\" (Distribution Agreement \u00a7 5.1(viii) ), and \"provide ETS with all new messaging to ensure it does not make product claims not supported by ETS research,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.1(ix) ). ETS in turn agreed to \"us[e] reasonable efforts to review all new messaging submitted by [HMH].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1(vii).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Distribution Agreement\n   also provided that ETS had to approve of HMH's use of ETS logos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.1.2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Distribution Agreement provided that \"[t]he relationship between ETS and Distributor shall be that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties, and, notwithstanding anything else herein, neither party shall have the right to incur ... any obligation or liability on behalf of the other party.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15.4).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    2. The HMH Fax Campaign\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In or about November 2012, HMH decided to market the Criterion product by facsimile through Riverside Publishing Inc. (\"Riverside Publishing\"), a division of HMH. (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. G, at 33-36, 102-104 (Deposition Testimony of Idy Spezzano (\"Spezzano Dep.\") ) ); Decl. of Aytan Y. Bellin, Esq. (\"Bellin Decl.\") Ex. A, at 39 (Deposition Testimony of Susan Yetman (\"Yetman Dep.\") (Dkt. No. 265-1).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   HMH conceived of, designed, and physically drafted the HMH Fax. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 7, 2012, ETS learned that HMH intended to market Criterion by fax, when Laurel Kaczor (\"Kaczor\"), of HMH, emailed Susan Yetman (\"Yetman\"), a Criterion account manager at ETS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) In her November 7, 2012 email, Kaczor asked Yetman whether she had a few minutes to review the Criterion Fax, explaining that \"Riverside publishing is planning on conducting a fax campaign for 10 states within the next day or so.\" (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. M, (Nov. 7 to Nov. 9, 2012 Email Exchange between Kaczor and Yetman (\"Nov. 7-9 Kaczor-Yetman Emails\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 7, 2012, Yetman forwarded Kaczor's email to Bob Haller (\"Haller\"), a content specialist at ETS, and asked him to review the attached fax and let her\n   know whether there were any \"show stoppers.\" (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. O (Nov. 7, 2012 Kaczor Email to Haller (\"Nov. 7 Kaczor-Haller Email\").) ) Yetman noted that the fax \"[l]ook[ed] ok to [her]\" and that she was not sure \"what kind of return [HMH could] get on a fax campaign, but that's an HMH decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also noted that \"there should be a footer with the ETS standard trademark language.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 9, 2012, Yetman asked Kaczor whether she had had heard from Haller. When Kaczor replied that she had not, Yetman indicated she would follow up with Haller. (Nov. 7-9 Kaczor-Yetman Emails.) On November 12, 2012, Yetman followed up with Haller, who replied, \"[l]ooks perfect. Nice way of putting the relationship to CCSS without claiming more than we actually do.\" (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. P (Nov. 12, 2012 Yetman Email to Haller (\"Nov. 12 Yetman-Haller Email\").) On November 12, 2012, Yetman wrote to Kaczor that Haller had approved the fax, and conveyed Haller's comment to Kaczor. (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. N (Nov. 7 to Nov. 12, 2012 Email Exchange between Kaczor and Yetman (\"Nov. 7-12 Kaczor-Yetman Emails\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ETS made no other comment, internally or externally, on the opt-out language of the HMH Fax. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 34.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   There were a total of five emails between ETS and HMH, specifically between Yetman and Kaczor, regarding the HMH Fax, and no other written or oral communications between these entities regarding the HMH Fax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) ETS's only internal communications concerning the HMH Fax consisted of five emails between two ETS employees, specifically Yetman and Haller, about the description of Criterion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Yetman testified that HMH \"would not have been able to send the document in the form that it was in when it was reviewed if it was not correct as to its representation of Criterion,\" and that if Haller had not approved it, HMH would have had to revise it. (Yetman Dep. 49.) Idy Spezzano (\"Spezzano\"), an HMH employee, supervised the creation of the HMH Fax, and wrote and edited the advertisement with other HMH employees, including Kaczor. (Spezzano Dep. 33-36.) Spezzano offered conflicting testimony regarding her understanding of whether HMH needed ETS's approval. She testified that even if ETS had told HMH that they did not want it to do the fax campaign, \"[HMH] would have done it anyway.\" (Spezzano Dep. 367-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When asked if HMH would have proceeded with the fax campaign even if ETS said \"we absolutely forbid it,\" Spezzano replied, \"[i]t's in the contract that HMH was responsible for marketing. ETS had no role in that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 368.) Spezzano conceded, however, that if ETS had not approved of the language of the Criterion fax, and the use of their logo, HMH could not have been \"able to market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 369.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In preparing its fax campaign for its sending of the HMH Fax, HMH executed a data license agreement with Market Data Retrieval (\"MDR\") pursuant to which HMH obtained a list of recipient names and associated fax numbers. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 23.) ETS did not pay any money to MDR in connection with HMH's data license agreement with MDR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) ETS was not involved with HMH's relationship with MDR in connection with the HMH Fax or the HMH fax campaign, nor did ETS have any knowledge of this relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   HMH contracted with WestFax to send the HMH Fax to the intended recipients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) ETS did not participate in the HMH-WestFax engagement or pay any money to WestFax in connection with that engagement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) ETS had no interaction with WestFax regarding the HMH Fax or the HMH fax campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Kaczor, who had previously provided Spezzano a list of states to which Kaczor recommended the Criterion Fax be sent, reported ETS's response to HMH's Spezzano by e-mail. (Pl.'s Counter \u00b6 22.) Spezzano had Debbie Pangilinan, another HMH employee, retrieve the fax numbers of the K-12 schools in those 10 states from HMH's \"Sales Force\" database, which contained that information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) The final fax list was reduced to the fax numbers of the K-12 schools from seven of those 10 states, and contained more than 22,000 entries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Melissa Pearson, an HMH employee, uploaded the Criterion Fax and the Criterion Fax list to the website of WestFax with instructions to transmit the Criterion Fax on November 15, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 15, 2012, WestFax successfully transmitted the Criterion Fax to 17,710 fax numbers on the fax list. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) WestFax provided HMH a specific list of the fax numbers to which WestFax did not attempt to transmit or did not successfully transmit the Criterion fax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Other than Yetman and Haller, no one at ETS was aware of the HMH fax campaign until ETS was named a defendant in this lawsuit in August 2015. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 39.) Prior to this litigation, no one from ETS's marketing department was aware of or involved in the HMH fax campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Prior to this litigation, no one at ETS was aware of how many entities received the HMH Fax, the names of the recipients of the HMH Fax, or where they resided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) HMH never informed ETS of the results of the HMH fax campaign or whether any of the fax recipients ever contacted HMH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) In fact, HMH never informed ETS that the HMH Fax was sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3. Language of the HMH Fax\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The text of the HMH fax reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   How do you know if the school programs you spend money on really work? Would you be interested in a writing program that could prove you've made a difference in your district? The Criterion Online Writing Evaluation service for grades 4-12 can provide you proof of your district's progress. This web-based, comprehensive instructional tool helps students plan, write, and revise essays.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Pl.'s 56.1 Counter \u00b6 10; SAC Ex. A (\"HMH Fax\").) The HMH Fax described\n   various attributes of the service and stated that the service was \"successfully used in more than 1,500 districts nationwide, with over 1 million subscriptions sold.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Fax referred recipients to a website for a demonstration and offered personalized online demonstrations. At the bottom of the page, it contained a notice (the \"Opt-Out Notice\") that provided in full: \"If you do not wish to receive faxes from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in the future, and/or if you would prefer to receive communication via email, please contact your representative. Upon your request, we will remove you from our fax transmissions within 30 days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ETS logo appears at the top of the Criterion Fax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The HMH Fax directed recipients to the Riverside Publishing website. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 44; HMH Fax.) The HMH Fax identified Kaczor as the person to contact for more information regarding Criterion, and provided a phone number and fax number for Kaczor. (HMH Fax.) The HMH Fax did not include contact information for ETS. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   HMH received communications from recipients of the HMH Fax requesting to opt out from receiving future faxes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) ETS received no communications from HMH Fax recipients, nor was ETS even aware that HMH had received any opt-out requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff recognized that HMH was the sender of the HMH Fax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) In his Declaration, Rabbi David Sussman (\"Sussman\"), the Executive Director of Bais Yaakov, stated that \"[o]n or about November 27, 2012, Plaintiff received an unsolicited fax advertisement on its fax machine ... sent by Defendants [HMH and Laurel Kaczor].\" (Sussman Decl. \u00b6 3.) Sussman testified that he initially believed HMH was the sender of the fax because the language of the fax read, \" 'If you do not wish to receive faxes from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in the future,' which implies that HMH sent the fax, not ETS.\" (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. S, at 93 (Deposition of David Sussman (\"Sussman Dep.\") ) Sussman further testified that ETS was added as Defendant in this case because discovery revealed that HMH had sent the fax advertisements on ETS's behalf and that ETS was working in conjunction with HMH. (Bellin Decl. Ex. E, at 55-56 (Deposition of David Sussman (\"Sussman Dep.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    4. Plaintiff's Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Sussman testified that he was at the Bais Yaakov offices when the fax came through. He was the first and only person to notice it. He read the fax at that time but did not give it to anyone else to read\n   or tell anyone about it at the time. (Sussman Dep. 64-65.) Sussman testified that the fax machine on which the HMH fax was received was the only fax machine at Bais Yaakov. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sussman took the HMH Fax off of the fax machine and put it in a drawer that is used to store faxes before they are sent to Bais Yaakov's TCPA counsel. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 57.) Sussman believed it was an unsolicited fax and he was annoyed by it. (Sussman Dep. 65-66.) Sussman testified that the fax did not disrupt the teaching at the school or the work of anyone else in the office when it was received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102.) He testified that the loss of paper and toner involved in printing the fax was a \"concrete loss\" but that \"[he] wouldn't be sitting here [in his deposition] if that was the basis of-[his] loss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Sussman testified that he knew that there were statutory damages available under the TCPA and that apart from those any loss that Plaintiff incurred was \"not worth mentioning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.) The only category of damages Plaintiff identified in response to Defendant's interrogatories, are statutory damages. (Kleinfeld Decl. Ex. T, at 3-4 (Pl.'s Reply to Def.'s Interrog.).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    5. Pre-Existing Relationship Between Plaintiff and Defendant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ETS has had a business relationship with Plaintiff dating from at least 1977, when Plaintiff sent ETS contact information so that ETS could update its mailing list \"for the purpose of sending out testing program information which [ETS] believe[d] [would] be of interest to school personnel.\" (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 62.) ETS's business relationship with Plaintiff was related to the school's administration of the SAT exam and other tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the context of this established business relationship, Plaintiff voluntarily provided its fax number to ETS on March 17, 2005 as part of a form that Esther Pilchik (\"Pilchik\"), the school's secular principal responsible for arranging the SAT and other tests, faxed to ETS to update its contact information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff admitted that by filling out the March 2005 form in which it provided ETS its fax number, Plaintiff provided ETS with permission to communicate with it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Pilchik has the authority to give Plaintiff's fax number to ETS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Sussman testified that if one of Plaintiff's two principals gave out the school's fax number, that constituted permission or an invitation to communicate by fax with Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   There is no evidence that the permission Plaintiff provided to ETS to communicate by fax was ever withdrawn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) ETS kept Plaintiff's fax number in its customer file, and ETS exchanged faxes with Plaintiff as a part of that business relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) However, Plaintiff never gave prior express permission or invitation to ETS, HMH, or anyone else to send Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    fax advertisements.\n   </em>\n   (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 62, 65-68 (citing Sussman Dep. 152).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff made payments to ETS in connection with the purchase and sale of standardized testing services, and these payments began at least as early as November 13, 1999. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 70.) Plaintiff made a payment of $ 494 to ETS on December 28, 2012 relating to exam administration, approximately six weeks after the HMH Fax was sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    6. Plaintiff's Knowledge Regarding the Opt-Out Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff has initiated fourteen putative class action lawsuits under the TCPA since 2011. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 73.) Sussman testified that Plaintiff has received more than $ 150,000 from TCPA lawsuits brought on its behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) Plaintiff has never attempted to opt out of receiving future faxes from HMH, ETS, or any other entity since first filing a TCPA lawsuit, including following its receipt of the HMH Fax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) No one at Plaintiff read the Opt-Out Notice on the HMH Fax to determine if it was possible to opt-out of receiving future faxes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Opt-Out Notice on the HMH Fax violated the TCPA and regulations thereunder in six ways. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges the Opt-Out Notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. fails to provide a facsimile number to which the recipient may transmit an opt-out request;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   B. fails to provide a domestic contact telephone number to which the recipient may transmit an opt-out request;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   C. fails to provide a cost-free mechanism to which the recipient may transmit an opt out request;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   D. fails to state that a recipient's request to opt out of future fax advertising will be effective only if the request identifies the telephone number(s) of the recipient's telephone facsimile machine(s) to which the request relates;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   E. fails to state that the sender's failure to comply with an opt-out request within 30 days is unlawful; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   F. fails to state that a recipient's opt-out request will be effective so long as that person does not, subsequent to making such request, provide express invitation or permission to the sender, in writing or otherwise, to send such advertisements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 77; SAC \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff has initiated lawsuits prior to receiving the HMH Fax alleging each of these six violations of the TCPA's opt-out requirements. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Parties dispute whether Defendant provided a domestic contact telephone number to which the recipient may transmit an opt-out request. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 85; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 85.) The HMH Fax Opt-Out Notice read as follows: \"If you do not wish to receive faxes from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in the future, and/or if you would prefer to receive communication via email, please contact your representative. Upon your request, we will remove you from our fax transmissions within 30 days.\" (HMH Fax.) Plaintiff correctly points out that the Opt-Out Notice itself specifically does not include a telephone numbers or communication mode through which to contact the representative. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 85.) The text of the fax itself, however, includes a \"1-800\" fax number to which to send the fax form back to, as well as Kaczor's \"1-877\" telephone number and email address. (HMH Fax.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Parties also dispute whether Defendant provided a cost-free mechanism by which a recipient may transmit an opt-out request. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 88; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff again points out that the Opt-Out Notice itself did not include a telephone number or communication mode through which to contact the representative. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 88.) Defendant points out that the Fax included a toll-free telephone and fax number to which an opt-out could be transmitted. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Parties do not dispute whether the Opt-Out Notice \"[D] state[d] that a recipient's request to opt out of future fax advertising will be effective only if the request identifies the telephone number(s) of the recipient's telephone facsimile machine(s) to which the request relates; [E] fail[ed] to state that the sender's failure to comply with an opt-out request within 30 days is unlawful; and [F] fail[ed] to state that a recipient's opt-out request will be effective so long as that person does not, subsequent to making such request, provide express invitation or permission to the sender, in writing or otherwise, to send such advertisements.\" (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 77.) Having reviewed the Fax and the Opt-Out Notice, the Court notes that the Opt-Out Notice did not in fact include these aforementioned instructions and warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The procedural history of this case is extensive. The original Complaint was filed on July 2, 2013, naming Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishers, Inc. (\"HMH Publishers\"), an entity separate from HMH, and Kaczor as Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. No. 1).) On July 11, 2013, Plaintiff filed a motion to certify the class and stay the decision on the motion until discovery was completed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 5-9.) Those motions were terminated by the Court for failure to follow the Court's individual practices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 10.) At a subsequent conference, the motions were reinstated, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. (minute entry for Sept. 13, 2013) ), but briefing was stayed pending developments in TCPA caselaw in the Second Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On August 13, 2014, Plaintiff sought leave to file a motion to amend the Complaint to add ETS as a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 44.) On September 5, 2014, Defendants HMH Publishers and Kaczor wrote a letter to the Court seeking leave to file a motion to dismiss the case and to compel arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court held a pre-motion conference on October 2, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. (minute entry for Oct. 2, 2014).) On November 2, 2014, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, with the consent of HMH Publishers and Kaczor, to add HMH as a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 55).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On November 3, 2014, HMH Publishers, HMH, and Kaczor filed a motion to compel arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 56.) The same day, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend its Amended Complaint to add ETS as a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 59.) Oral argument on all pending motions was held on July 14, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. (minute entry for July 14, 2015).) Thereafter, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion to amend and granted Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On August 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed the currently operative Second Amended Complaint, adding ETS as a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC.) That same day Plaintiff filed another motion for class certification, seeking certification of a subclass of individuals to whom ETS sent or caused to be sent, on or about November 15, 2012, at least one solicited or unsolicited facsimile advertisement substantially identical to the one sent to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99.) On November 13, 2015, the Parties executed a stipulation, endorsed by the Court, staying the case until the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601271\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/663/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 106.) Two days later, ETS filed a letter motion requesting leave to file a Motion to allow it to deposit an amount with the Court in full satisfaction of Plaintiff's individual claim, have the Court enter judgment against ETS, and dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 110.) After a conference was held on March 8, 2016, ETS filed its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on March 18, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On May 8, 2017, the Court denied Defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion &amp; Order (May 8, 2017) (\"May 8, 2017 Opinion\") (Dkt. No. 233).) On May 22, 2017, ETS filed an Answer to the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 234.) On June 26, 2017, the Court informed the Parties that it would hold the motion for class certification as pending while a writ of certiorari was sought by Plaintiff in a case it was litigating in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Bais Yaakov of Spring Valley v.

No. 237.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On July 11, 2017, the Court denied without prejudice Plaintiff's motion to certify a subclass, terminated the stay in the case, and directed to parties to submit a proposed case management schedule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 240.) The Court based its decision to deny certification on the ruling of the D.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 240.) The Court reasoned that without the FCC mandate, there was no basis upon which to certify a subclass that included individuals who received only solicited facsimiles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On July 19, 2017, the Court issued a Motion Scheduling Order for Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and held that no further discovery would take place at that time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 243.) ) On August 17, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's denial of its the motion for class certification. (Dkt.

Application\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   There are several factors that tend to show that HMH did not send the Fax on ETS's behalf. ETS did not participate in generating the idea for the HMH Fax, determine the recipients and reach of the HMH fax campaign, draft the HMH Fax, engage or pay MDR and WestFax, physically send the HMH Fax, or direct any other person or entity to send the fax. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-30.) Indeed, the Distribution Agreement provided that HMH would \"establish the marketing strategy ... [and] develop and distribute marketing and promotional materials.\" (Distribution Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 5.1(i)-(ii).) Furthermore, it is undisputed that ETS had no knowledge as to where the HMH Fax was to be sent, or even that it was actually sent out. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43.) ETS did not provide HMH with the names of any potential recipients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) ETS received no after-the-fact reports on the HMH Fax, nor did ETS have any contact with recipients seeking to opt out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 53.) One HMH employee even testified that HMH would have sent the HMH Fax even if ETS had forbidden it from doing so. (Spezzano Dep. 367-368; Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   There are, however, also several factors that tend to show that HMH did send the Fax on behalf of ETS. First, ETS expected HMH to market its Criterion Service. The Distribution Agreement provided that HMH would \"use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the use and sale of Criterion.\" (Distribution Agreement \u00a7 5.1.) HMH was solely responsible for signing up\n   new customers for ETS's Criterion Service, and for sending to ETS completed and signed subscriber agreements, which enabled ETS to activate new customers' accounts. (Pl.'s 56.1 Counter \u00b6 7.) ETS did not do its own marketing, but instead used distributors to market and sell its product, so that ETS \"ma[d]e its money\" through royalties. HMH was the distributor responsible for marketing the Criterion product. (Treves Dep. 25-26.) ETS expected HMH to do \"everything they can to effectively grow the business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) Second, the Distribution Agreement provided that ETS had to approve of HMH's use of ETS logos. (Distribution Agreement \u00a7 3.1.2.) With respect to the HMH Fax, ETS employees knew HMH was planning on launching the fax campaign to recipients in 10 states and reviewed and approved the fax and the use of ETS's logo. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34; Nov. 7-9 Kaczor-Yetman Emails; Nov. 7 Kaczor-Haller Email; Nov. 12 Yetman-Haller Email.) On this point, Yetman testified that HMH \"would not have been able to send the document in the form that it was in when it was reviewed if it was not correct as to its representation of Criterion,\" and that if Haller had not approved it, HMH would have had to revise it. (Yetman Dep. 49.) Finally, the HMH Fax, on its face, promoted ETS's Criterion Online Writing Evaluation. (HMH Fax.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Given ample evidence to support both sides' positions, the Court concludes that the \"the question of on whose behalf the fax advertisement was sent is a question to be decided by a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Palm Beach Golf Center-Boca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075465\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1245/\">\n    781 F.3d at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit reached a similar conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Palm Beach Golf Center-Boca\n   </em>\n   , where the evidence supporting the claim that the fax was sent on behalf of the defendant included the facts that the defendant hired a marketing manager to market its dental practice and gave him free rein to do so, that the defendant's marketing manager contracted with a fax transmitter to initiate a fax advertisement campaign on behalf of the dental practice, that the fax transmitter received payment from defendant and subsequently transmitted an unsolicited fax advertisement to the plaintiff, occupying its fax machine for one minute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075465\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1245/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There was, however, also evidence that the defendant did not approve the final draft of the advertisement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075465\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1245/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eleventh Circuit therefore concluded that the jury should resolve the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075465\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1245/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, the Court is not able to conclude that no reasonable jury could find that the HMH Fax was sent on behalf of ETS. Therefore, the Court denies Defendant's Motion for Summary\n   Judgment with respect to Plaintiff's TCPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    D.

Notably, Plaintiff does not present a counterargument in any of its opposition filings as to why its New York State claim should survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   GBL \u00a7 396-aa provides that it is \"unlawful ... to initiate the unsolicited transmission of telefacsimile messages promoting goods or services for purchase by the recipient of such messages,\" but the section \"shall not apply to telefacsimile messages sent to a recipient with whom the initiator has a prior contractual or business relationship.\" GBL \u00a7 396-aa(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Parties agree that ETS had a business relationship with Plaintiff dating from at least 1977, when Plaintiff sent ETS contact information so that ETS could update its mailing list \"for the purpose of sending out testing program information which [ETS] believe[s] will be of interest to school personnel.\" (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 62.) ETS's business relationship with Plaintiff was related to the school's administration of the SAT exam and other tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiff made payments to ETS in connection with the purchase and sale of standardized testing services, and these payments began at least as early as November 13, 1999. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) And, Plaintiff made a payment of $ 494 to ETS on December 28, 2012 relating to exam administration, approximately six weeks after the HMH Fax was sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff and Defendant had a \"prior contractual or business relationship,\" and that this relationship, which is not contested by the Parties, serves as a complete defense to Plaintiff's GBL \u00a7 396-aa claim. \"Unlike the TCPA, GBL \u00a7 396-aa only requires 'a prior contractual or business relationship' to avoid liability under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Graduation Source, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201271693\">\n    2016 WL 1271693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.2 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb v.

However, these were not the only approval rights ETS retained. As Defendant itself points out, ETS also retained approval rights over ETS's representations and statements about Criterion.

The Court here describes the provisions of the Distribution Agreement as factual background and\n    <em>\n     does not\n    </em>\n    , in this section, draw any legal conclusions about the nature of the relationship between HMH and ETS based on this description alone.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Defendant inaccurately cites to Spezzano's deposition testimony to state that Riverside Publishing was a subsidiary of HMH, when she actually testified that she believed it was a division of HMH.

Defendant also inaccurately represented that \"HMH did not ask ETS to review the opt-out language on the HMH Fax.\" (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 35.) Nothing in the email exchange between Kaczor and Yetman indicates ETS's review was limited only to the use of the logo and the description of the product, and not the opt-out language.

Plaintiff disputes this characterization, pointing out that ETS knew HMH was going to send out a fax advertisement promoting the Criterion System to schools in 10 states, and ETS reviewed and approved the Criterion Fax. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 22.) Semantics aside, what is clear from the email exchanges between Yetman, Kaczor, and Haller, and Kaczor and Spezzano's testimony, is that ETS reviewed and approved the contents of the HMH fax, although it did not provide any substantive feedback or require that any changes be made to the fax.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Defendant correctly points out that the HMH Fax does not state that it is from ETS, (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 50), and that\n    <em>\n     the text\n    </em>\n    of the HMH Fax does not make any reference to ETS, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51).

In particular, Defendant argues that the Opt-Out Notice here is more akin to the two notices the Second Circuit concluded did not constitute concrete injury, because here too \"(1) [Plaintiff] never tried to exercise its right under the opt-out notice, (2) the alleged defects did not alter [Plaintiff's] behavior in any way ( [because] it never even read the opt-out clause and knew how to opt out anyway), and (3) there is no evidence [Defendant] failed to act as a result of the alleged notice deficiencies [as it never] denied anyone the right to opt out.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Plaintiff argues that the Opt-Out Notice here is like the two deficient notices in\n    <em>\n     Strubel\n    </em>\n    that did constitute concrete injury, because Defendant did not include the specific requirements of a successful opt-out notice pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n     47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)(v) in its Opt-Out Notice, and therefore there was a real risk that a recipient of the fax would fail to comply with those specific requirements, for example by not calling the specific telephone number designated for making opt-out requests.
