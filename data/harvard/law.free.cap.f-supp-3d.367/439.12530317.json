Higgs (\"plaintiff\"), on behalf of the estate of Alonza Higgs, filed a complaint in Bertie County Superior Court against Brian Center Health &amp; Retirement/Windsor, Inc. (\"Brian Center\") and twenty-one other entities (collectively \"defendants\"), alleging negligence, medical malpractice, wrongful death, breach of contract, breach of third party beneficiary contract, and negligent misrepresentation [D.E. 1-1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 24, 2018, the defendants jointly removed the action to this court [D.E. 1]. On October 26, 2018, plaintiff moved to remand the action to state court [D.E. 49] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 50]. On November 16, 2018, defendants SSC Windsor Brian Operating Company LLC (\"SSC Windsor\") and SavaSeniorCare Administrative Services LLC (\"SSC Admin\") responded in opposition [D.E. 59].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 27 and 28, 2018, sixteen defendants moved to dismiss the complaint\n   [D.E. 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42], and filed memoranda in support [D.E. 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41]. On October 26, 2018, plaintiff responded in opposition [D.E. 51]. On November 16, 2018, several defendants replied [D.E. 60-62].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 31, 2018, SSC Windsor and SSC Admin answered plaintiff's complaint [D.E. 45, 46]. On November 12, 2018, plaintiff moved to strike both answers pursuant to Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [D.E. 55] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 56]. On December 3, 2018, SSC Windsor and SSC Admin responded in opposition [D.E. 69]. As explained below, the court denies plaintiff's motion to remand, grants the motions to dismiss, and denies the remaining motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 14, 2015, Alonza Higgs (\"Higgs\") moved into Brian Center Health &amp; Rehabilitation/Windsor in Windsor, North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [D.E. 1-1] \u00b6 73. At the time, Higgs was 73 years old and had been hospitalized from July 10, 2015, until July 14, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 79. While in the hospital, Higgs had received treatment for numerous ailments, including a urinary tract infection, renal failure, hypertension, and generalized weakness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. Higgs, however, did not have any pressure injuries at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   87-90. When the staff admitted Higgs to the nursing home, the staff anticipated that he would be discharged after completing short-term rehabilitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84, 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When he entered the nursing home, Higgs's general physical condition was poor. On July 15, 2015, Regina Bond (\"Bond\"), an occupational therapist, noted that Higgs had \"muscle weakness, strength impairments, fine motor control deficits, decreased coordination, and limb pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. He was unable to sit or stand and was \"totally dependent\" on others for necessary activities, including bathing, using the toilet, and dressing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-150. Bond also noted that Higgs required \"maximum assistance for bed mobility\" and was at risk of developing pressure injuries and sores.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 156-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the nursing home staff failed to provide competent care to Higgs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-117. Although the staff wrote an interim plan of care when the staff admitted Higgs, the plan did not indicate that Higgs was at risk for developing pressure injuries and did not include any instruction to reposition Higgs frequently to decrease pressure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119-23. As a result, plaintiff alleges that the nursing home staff failed to implement a care plan to prevent Higgs from developing pressure injuries, like repositioning Higgs regularly or placing Higgs on a custom mattress that would decrease the risk of such injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-33, 157-58. Additionally, plaintiff alleges that the nursing home staff failed to manage Higgs's nutrition properly to minimize the risk of pressure injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134-35, 163-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 22, 2015, the nursing home staff observed \"two large blisterous type pressure ulcers\" on Higgs's buttocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 174-75. Although one of \"[d]efendants' licensed practical nurses\" provided limited initial treatment, the nursing home staff failed to timely notify Higgs's doctors or his family of the ulcers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 177-69, 181. Plaintiff also alleges that defendants failed to implement additional measures, such as nutritional changes or a speciality mattress, to help heal Higgs's wounds and prevent them from worsening.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 183-86. On July 25, 2015, the nursing home staff prepared and implemented a plan to address Higgs's pressure injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 190-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite this plan, Higgs's condition worsened over the following weeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 199-262. On August 16, 2015, Higgs was \"not acting like himself\" and at some point became unresponsive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 263, 266. On August 17, 2015, the nursing home transferred Higgs to Vidant Bertie Hospital (\"Vidant\") in Windsor, North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268. When Higgs arrived, plaintiff alleges that hospital staff noted a foul odor coming from Higgs's pressure wounds, and Higgs suffered extreme sensitivity to movement and pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 272-73. Higgs was \"in critical condition,\" and the hospital admitted Higgs to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 284. The hospital staff determined that Higgs had a \"Stage IV decubitus ulcer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 285, 294. Higgs also displayed signs of either septic shock or bacterial sepsis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 288-93, 295-97. Doctors operated on Higgs's ulcer that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 306. On September 3, 2015, Vidant transferred Higgs to LifeCare Hospital of North Carolina (\"LifeCare\") for \"wound management.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 311-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While at LifeCare, Higgs's condition continued to deteriorate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 316-22. On October 7, 2015, Higgs went into cardiac arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 323. After being resuscitated, Higgs was transferred from LifeCare to Vidant, and Higgs was hospitalized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 324-25. More pressure ulcers developed on different parts of Higgs's body.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 327-31. On October 20, 2015, Higgs was discharged from Vidant and transferred to LifeCare for continued wound care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 332-33. \"After completing care at LifeCare,\" Higgs was transferred to PruittHealth in Farmville, North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 334. On April 8, 2017, Higgs died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 335. Plaintiff alleges that the original pressure injuries proximately caused Higgs's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 336.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 12, 2018, plaintiff filed a complaint based on the conduct that allegedly caused Higgs's pressure wounds [D.E. 1-1]. In the complaint, plaintiff alleges eight claims: (1) wrongful death based on negligence, (2) wrongful death based on medical malpractice, (3) negligence, (4) medical malpractice, (5) punitive damages, (6) breach of contract, (7) breach of third-party beneficiary contract, and (8) negligent misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 337-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants are business entities that, at some point, had a relationship with Brian Center Health &amp; Rehabilitation/Windsor where Higgs stayed in July 2015. SSC Windsor operates Brian Center Health &amp; Rehabilitation/Windsor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sims Aff. [D.E. 1-4] \u00b6 2. Plaintiff also sued the business entities that own SSC Windsor, including North Carolina Holdco II, LLC (\"NC Holdco II\"), the sole member of SSC Windsor; SSC Equity Holdings MT LLC (\"SSC Equity\"), the sole member of NC Holdco II; Master Tenant Parent Holdco II, LLC (\"Master Tenant\"), the sole member of SSC Equity; SavaSeniorCare, LLC (\"Sava\"), the sole member of Master Tenant; Proto Equity Holdings, LLC (\"Proto Equity\"), the sole member of Sava; and Terpax, Inc.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(1). Each \"denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The answers deny many of the allegations of the complaint and include an alternative general denial of the allegation at the end of each paragraph to ensure that the effect of the answer would be a denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [D.E. 45] \u00b6\u00b6 301-98; [D.E. 46] \u00b6\u00b6 301-98. Thus, SSC Windsor and SSC Admin have, for the most part, simply denied the complaint's allegations. Despite plaintiff's argument to the contrary, denials in an answer do not prejudice a plaintiff. Rather, such denials simply require a plaintiff to conduct discovery and attempt to prove his claims. SSC Windsor and SSC Admin did not violate Rule 8(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Farrell v.

Thus, the court denies plaintiff's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, the court DENIES plaintiff's motion to remand [D.E. 49] and plaintiff's motion to strike [D.E. 55]. The court GRANTS the motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction [D.E. 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40]. The court DISMISSES defendants Master Tenant, SSC LP Holdings, Inc., Terpax, SVCARE Holdings LLC, SSC Submaster Holdings II LLC, SSC Submaster Holdings LLC, SSC Special Holdings LLC, SSC Equity, NC Holdco II, NC Holdco, Special Holdings Parent Holdco, LLC, Sava, and Proto Equity. The court GRANTS the motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted [D.E. 30, 42], and the court DISMISSES the complaint without prejudice against defendants Brian Center, Living Centers, and SMV Windsor. The court DENIES AS MOOT the motions for extension of time [D.E. 53, 79], motion to dismiss [D.E. 72], and motions to strike [D.E. 67, 70].

The court rejects this argument. First, plaintiff misreads Rule 56(c)(4) to include affidavits and materials submitted in support of a notice of removal.
