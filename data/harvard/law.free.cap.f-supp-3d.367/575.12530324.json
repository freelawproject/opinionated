ADT seeks summary judgment of invalidity as to all of the claims asserted against it, arguing that the asserted claims of the '553 patent are invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for failure to recite patentable subject matter.

The case was initially consolidated with similar actions against two other defendants. Those cases have been settled and dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Asserted Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The '553 patent is entitled \"Method of Monitoring a Protected Space.\" Independent claim 1 of that patent is a method claim. Independent claim 19 is an apparatus claim that generally corresponds to claim 1 but is largely drafted in means-plus-function format. Independent claim 35 is an apparatus claim that generally corresponds to claim 1 and is not drafted in means-plus-function format.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claim 1 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1.

'553 patent, col. 1, ll. 11-19. The invention provides for appropriate sensors to be situated in the protected spaces, for the sensors to detect an event needing to be reported, and for the signals from the sensors to be coded into a packet message to be sent to a remote database via the Internet. The data from the sensors is then stored in a secure area and subarea of the database corresponding to the protected space and the type of signal event, under a password assigned to a manager, who can use the password to access the data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 1, ll. 55-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The amended complaint describes the patent claims in a similar manner, stating that the claimed methods and apparatuses of the '553 patent\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   detect signal events occurring at a protected space, code the signal events into a packetized message, and transfer these coded packet messages to a database. The coded packet messages are stored in reserved areas and subareas of the database in accordance with the type of signal event and the respective protected space. Additionally, the coded message packets are accessible via the internet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dkt. No. 16, at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After SMS filed this action, ADT filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for unpatentability under section 101. Dkt. No. 12. Three weeks later, SMS filed an amended complaint, Dkt. No. 16, and ADT filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, Dkt. No. 18. The Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on October 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following the oral argument, the Court determined that the issues raised in the motion to dismiss filed by ATD would be best handled through a motion for summary judgment targeted at the section 101 issue. Dkt. No. 57. Accordingly, the Court set a schedule providing for the parties to make their summary judgment submissions following the exchange of preliminary claim constructions. Proceeding in that manner gave the parties an opportunity to offer evidence and argument as to whether there were any disputed issues of material fact presented by the section 101 issue. The parties subsequently exchanged proposed claim constructions, Dkt. No. 61, and ADT filed its motion for summary judgment on section 101. Dkt. No. 62. SMS filed its response, Dkt. No. 66; ADT filed a reply, Dkt. No. 67; and SMS filed a surreply, Dkt. No. 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In their papers, the parties identified the claims that are at issue. In its amended complaint, SMS alleged that it was asserting \"at least\" claims 1 and 35. In its\n   infringement contentions, however, SMS asserted 18 more claims. Those newly asserted claims included independent claim 19 as well as 17 claims that depend from one of independent claims 1, 19, or 35. Dkt. No. 50-1. Although SMS stated that it has reserved its right to amend its infringement contentions, the Court will address only the 20 claims that SMS is currently asserting. Because the three independent claims are quite similar for purposes of this motion, the Court will analyze ADT's motion with respect to those claims together, and will deal separately with the dependent claims in part 3, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Claim Construction and Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The proposed claim constructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Prior to oral argument on the motion to dismiss, the Court directed the parties to advise the Court of any potential claim construction issue that could affect the Court's analysis of the section 101 issue, and any factual showing that the plaintiff might make, or any facts that the plaintiff might reasonably expect to encounter through discovery, that could affect this issue. During oral argument of the motion, the Court inquired of the parties at some length regarding these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Following that hearing, and before ADT filed its summary judgment motion, the parties submitted their proposed claim constructions, offering different constructions for five claim terms: \"secure storage area(s)\"; \"subarea(s)\"; \"reserved\"; \"corresponds to the protected space and type of signal event\"; and \"determining a type of signal event of the packet message.\" Dkt. No. 61. The parties' proposed constructions were not significantly different from one another. For most of the terms, ADT proposed that no construction was necessary or proposed an alternative construction. For the most part, SMS's proposed constructions were natural interpretations of the claim terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties' proposed constructions were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   1. \"secure storage areas.\" SMS's proposal: \"space(s) physically and/or logically segregated and secured through differentiated password authorization.\" ADT's proposal: \"an area within the database secured by an associated password.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2. \"subareas.\" SMS's proposal: \"unique, nonoverlapping area(s) allocated by the system within a secure storage area.\" ADT's proposal: \"No construction necessary. Alternatively: an area within a larger area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   3. \"reserved.\" SMS's proposal: \"allocated by the system prior to the transfer of coded packet data (claims 19 &amp; 35: coded packet message).\" ADT's proposal: \"No construction necessary. Alternatively: to set or have set aside or apart.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   4. \"corresponds to the protected space and type of signal event.\" SMS's proposal: \"the secure storage area(s) and subarea(s) are determined by the system at least in part based on two dependencies: the pertinent protected space and a signal type.\" ADT's proposal: \"No construction necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   5. \"determining a type of signal event of the packet message.\" SMS's proposal: \"analyzing the packet to determine one or more of a plurality of signal types associated with the packet message.\" ADT's proposal: \"No construction necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court has considered the effect of the competing claim construction proposals on the motion for summary judgment and has concluded that, in light of the similarity of the proposals, the issues presented\n   on summary judgment would not be affected by the Court's adoption of one party's proposal over the other with respect to any of the five terms. Put another way, accepting SMS's proposed claim constructions for each of the five disputed terms would not affect the Court's analysis of the summary judgment motion. Indeed, neither party has pointed to any reason to believe that the question of patent eligibility would turn on the Court's decision as to any of the claim construction issues. Moreover, SMS has not suggested any reason to believe that discovery would lead to information useful to SMS on the section 101 issue. That is unsurprising, as ADT is unlikely to have information in its sole possession that would be enlightening as to the viability of SMS's patent. Accordingly, the Court believes it is appropriate to decide the section 101 issue now and spare the parties the burden that would be incurred in delaying disposition of the issue until after claim construction and discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The summary judgment motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On the merits of the summary judgment motion, ADT argues that the asserted claims of the '553 patent\"are directed to the abstract idea of collecting, organizing, storing, and disseminating sensor data\" and as such are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. Dkt. No. 62, at 7. The steps set out in the independent claims, ADT contends, amount to the following: \"data is collected from a sensor, transmitted to [a] remote database, stored in a remote database based on the type of data collected, and disseminated to individuals with permission (a password) to access the data.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The process of collecting, organizing, classifying, storing, and presenting information, according to ADT, has many pre-computer analogues and has been characterized by the Federal Circuit in numerous cases as a patent-ineligible abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ADT further argues that, as the specification of the '553 patent acknowledges, both the protected spaces, such as computer rooms, and the components of the claimed apparatus, such as the sensors, the coding processor, the database, and the dissemination server, are all conventional. In particular, ADT points to the database of the preferred embodiment, which, the specification states \"could be Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or mySQL.\" '553 patent, col. 2, ll. 27-28. Citing two prior art references that are in evidence, ADT notes that SQL is an industry-standard language that was specifically designed to work with relational databases and that by 1999 relational databases were so popular that they had become an industry standard database form. Dkt. No. 62, at 4 (citing Dkt. Nos. 62-3, 62-4). ADT explains that relational databases consist of a number of tables in which data resides, with the rows in the tables representing entries in the table and the columns in the tables each being reserved for a particular \"data type\" associated with that column.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to ADT's evidence, it was well known at that time that access to particular tables could be restricted using password and user authentication techniques and that access to relational databases could be provided over the Internet through the use of a web browser.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on that analysis of the '553 patent, ADT concludes that the asserted claims are not patent-eligible because they are \"focused on the combination of those abstract-idea processes\" of collecting data from sensors, classifying the data based on the type of information, and presenting the data without any \"inventive technology for performing those functions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Cir. 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   SMS responds by pointing to the memory structure of the claimed database to\n   support its contention that the asserted claims are not directed to abstract ideas and that they include inventive concepts. Dkt. No. 66, at 9. In particular, SMS argues that the claims are patent-eligible because the invention reserves an area of the claimed database for each monitored space and reserves a subarea within each area for each type of data involved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 17. Referring to the specification, SMS notes that the invention employs \"a coding step or code processor component that codes a detected signal event into a packet with the required information that can be used by the database to store the information in the appropriate area and subarea of the database.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (citing '553 patent, col. 4, ll. 16-41). In addition, SMS argues, the secure database structure \"is paired with the password-specific access to areas and subareas of the database that allow internet access to the information in the database.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In opposing summary judgment, SMS relies heavily on the prosecution history of the '553 patent. In particular, SMS cites the decision of the patent examiner, who explained that he had allowed the application over a close prior art reference on the ground that the prior art reference did not teach or suggest \"storing a coded message packet in a secure storage area and a sub-area or the plurality of secure storage areas of the data base that corresponds to the protected space and type of signal event of the protected space under a password assigned to a manager of the protected space.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (citing Dkt.

First, the court must determine \"whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts,\" such as an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, if the claims are directed to an abstract idea, the court must decide whether there is an \"inventive concept\" in the claims at issue. The Supreme Court has characterized an \"inventive concept\" as \"an element or combination of elements that is 'sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself' \"; the presence of an \"inventive concept,\" the Court has explained, is enough to \" 'transform the nature of the claim' into a patent-eligible application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayo Collaborative Servs. v.

The second step, if reached, requires the court to \"look[ ] more precisely at what the claim elements add-specifically, whether, in the Supreme Court's terms, they identify an 'inventive concept' in the application of the ineligible matter to which (by assumption at step two) the claim is directed.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Several of those cases warrant close consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The first,\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , is a case very similar in several respects to this one. As in this case, the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   were directed to a monitoring system. In particular, the claims recited the steps of detecting events (such as power losses) on an interconnected power grid; analyzing the events; combining that data with data from other sources; storing and then displaying the results; and deriving a composite indicator of reliability for the grid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court began by explaining that the act of collecting information is \"within the realm of abstract ideas.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1353-54 (citing cases). The court noted that \"merely presenting the results of abstract processes of collecting and analyzing information, without more (such as identifying a particular tool for presentation), is abstract as an ancillary part of such collection and analysis.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1354 (citing\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction &amp; Transmission LLC v.

Cir. 2014) ). The claims in the case before it, the court explained, involved \"a process of gathering and analyzing information of a specified content, then displaying the results, and not any particular assertedly inventive technology for performing those functions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason, the court held, the claims were directed to an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This case likewise entails the process of gathering information (by \"detecting a signal event\" in the \"plurality of protected spaces\"), analyzing that information (by \"coding the signal event into a packet message\" and \"determining a type of signal event of the packet message\"), storing the information (\"in a secure area and subarea of the plurality of secure storage areas of the database\"), and displaying the results to a user (by \"providing access to information of the coded message packet through an Internet connection between the manager and the database based upon the password assigned to the manager\"). As in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , those limitations are set forth in functional terms and thus are not tied to any specific and novel type of technology for performing those functions. The '553 patent specification makes clear that the patent contemplates the use of standard methods of collecting and analyzing data; there is nothing in the patent to suggest that it is directed to a novel means for performing the recited functions. In describing the devices used to perform those functions, the specification directs the use of off-the-shelf sensor technology, data collection units (CPUs), software, and hardware. '553 patent, col. 2, ll. 4-19 (referring to the use of \"any appropriate processor,\" \"any appropriate sensor technology,\" \"appropriate hardware,\" and \"an appropriate [communications] protocol,\" each of which is accompanied by a reference to commercially available components that can be used for those purposes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As for the limitation that specifies a database containing a plurality of secure storage areas, it is clear that the database is simply the location where the information is stored after being analyzed (i.e., after being separated into the secure storage areas, each of which \"is reserved for a respective protected space of the plurality of protected spaces,\" '553 patent, claims 1, 19, and 35). Information that is organized and stored in a computer is conventionally stored in a database. Using a database to store information in discrete categories is itself an abstract idea. Here, too, the specification does not suggest any specific structure or design for the database that is\n   required to perform the recited functions, but simply states that the database \"may rely upon custom software developed using [a commercial product],\" and may \"collect information from a number of CPUs in a number of protected spaces and store the information in a database, which could be Microsoft SQL server, Oracle, or MySQL.\" '553 patent, col. 2, ll. 20-27. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the '553 patent does not claim \"any particular assertedly inventive technology for performing [the recited functions],\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including the functions performed by the database. The database is simply the location where the data is (1) segregated in discrete areas and subareas according to the particular protected area and signal type and (2) secured by making the data accessible only by password.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Moreover, the court in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   recognized the important distinction between a claim that is focused on the \"asserted advances in uses to which existing computer capabilities could be put,\" as opposed to \"a specific improvement-a particular database technique-in how computers could carry out one of their basic functions of storage and retrieval of data.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the invention in this case is not directed to an improvement in the functioning of a computer. Instead, the invention consists of the use of a generic computer in aid of processes that constitute abstract ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To the extent that SMS argues that the database recited in the asserted claims of the '553 patent was an improvement in database structure, the evidence offered by ADT with its summary judgment motion, unrebutted by SMS, establishes the contrary. ADT's evidence regarding relational databases in general, and SQL-based databases in particular, showed that such databases, which were conventional at the time of the patent application, contain tables consisting of separate columns for separate types of data and rows for separate entries within each type.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 62, at 4 (citing Dkt. Nos. 62-3, at 7, 13-15, 23, 40; 62-4, at 24-26, 41, 54-57, 365-67). That architecture is entirely consistent with storing data relating to particular protected spaces in separate areas and data relating to different types of signals in different subareas within those areas, as is indicated by the references to SQL-based relational databases in the specification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '553 patent, col. 2, ll. 23-28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Another case that is similar to this one is\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech LLC v.

The patents at issue in that case were directed to a \"self-evolving generic index\" for organizing information stored in a database.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n    at 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The patents claimed indexing software that, according to the specifications, organized \"information about various items using classifications, parameters, and values,\" and enabled users to add new parameters for describing items.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the court noted, one of the representative claims recited a method of \"indexing and retrieving data being posted by a plurality of users to a wide area network,\" which comprised providing users with a mechanism for posting data as parametized items and with various types of previous usage information that could assist them\n   in choosing parameters and values.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n    at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Another representative claim recited a method of indexing an item on a database comprising item classifications, parameters, and values, guiding the user in selecting a specific classification for the item, storing the item in the database, and guiding the user in selecting parameters and values by reference to historical usage information for values used by other users. As such, the court held, the asserted claims were directed to the abstract idea of employing historical usage information in determining how to classify data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n    at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    BSG\n   </em>\n   rejected the plaintiff's argument that the claims were not directed to an abstract idea because they required a specific database structure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n    at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the presentation of summary comparison usage information to users improves the quality of the information added to the database, an improvement to the information stored by a database is not equivalent to an improvement in the database's functionality.

In the\n   <em>\n    Erie Indemnity\n   </em>\n   case, the court held that \"creating an index and using that index to search for and retrieve data\" is an abstract idea, as in other cases involving \"similar abstract concepts\n   that merely collect, classify, or otherwise filter data.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277922\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/1315/\">\n    850 F.3d at 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although SMS argues that the \"compartmentalized\" structure described in the '553 patent -assigning a separate area to each protected space and a separate subarea to each type of signal-enhances the security of the information, the idea of classifying and organizing the data in that manner is just as abstract as the similar ideas of classifying and organizing data in\n   <em>\n    Erie Indemnity\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    TLI Communications\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Yet another case with facts similar to this one is\n   <em>\n    CyberFone Systems, LLC v.

In that case, the claim at issue recited a method that comprised obtaining data entered on a telephone, separating it into component parts, and sending those parts to different destinations based on the information in the transmitted data. The court held the claim patent-ineligible. As the court explained, \"[U]sing categories to organize, store, and transmit information is well-established. Here, the well-known concept of categorical data storage,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the idea of collecting information in classified form, then separating and transmitting that information according to its classification, is an abstract idea that is not patent-eligible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048201\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/558/988/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048201\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/558/988/\">\n    at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the contrary, the segregated storage feature of the database in this case is no more specific or \"technological\" than the characteristics of the databases claimed in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BSG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Erie Indemnity\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    CyberFone\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the Court concludes that independent claims 1, 19, and 35 of the '553 patent are directed to an abstract idea, as that term has been applied by the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit in assessing patent-eligibility under section 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Inventive Concept\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Turning to the second step of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   framework, SMS argues that even if its claims are directed to abstract ideas, they contain an \"inventive concept\" that renders them patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The \"inventive concept\" step requires the court to determine whether the claims recite an element or a combination of elements sufficient to ensure that the patent is directed to significantly more than the abstract idea itself. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the court at the second step of the eligibility inquiry looks to see whether there are any \"additional features\" that constitute an inventive\n   concept that would render the claims eligible for patenting even if they were determined to be directed to an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20208\">\n    573 U.S. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie Indemnity\n   </em>\n   , 850 F.3d at 1328. SMS contends that the claims at issue in this case contain such additional features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On this issue as well, the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   is instructive. After finding that the claims were directed to an abstract idea, the court stated that upon scrutinizing the claim elements \"more microscopically,\" it found \"nothing sufficient to remove the claims from the class of subject matter ineligible for patenting.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court pointed out that \"merely selecting information, by content or source, for collection, analysis, and display does nothing significant to differentiate a process from ordinary mental processes, whose implicit exclusion from \u00a7 101 undergirds the information-based category of abstract ideas.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In language that is equally applicable here, the\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   court added that the claims before it.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   do not require an arguably inventive set of components or methods, such as measurement devices or techniques, that would generate new data.

But in this case the claims' invocation of computers, networks, and displays does not transform the claimed subject matter into patent-eligible applications. The claims at issue do not require any nonconventional computer, network, or display components, or even a \"non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces,\" but merely call for performance of the claimed information collection, analysis, and display functions \"on a set of generic computer components\" and display devices....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Nothing in the claims, understood in light of the specification, requires anything other than off-the-shelf conventional computer, network, and display technology for gathering, sending, and presenting the desired information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    BASCOM Glob.

They merely provide for the selection and manipulation of information in a particular way. And, as in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the claims do not require any non-conventional computer, network, or even a non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces. Rather, the claims merely call for performance of the claimed information collection, analysis, and display functions on a set of generic computer components and display devices performing conventional tasks for which they were designed. Thus, like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the asserted claims in this case do not recite an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   SMS argues that the \"inventive concept\" in this case \"is found in the Asserted Claims' new and unique way of improving building monitoring systems and methods, particularly via their reliance on the claimed database.\" Dkt. No. 66, at 16. That is, SMS argues that the inventive concept resides in the invention itself, as a whole. But the Federal Circuit has explicitly rejected that approach. In\n   <em>\n    BSG\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that \"[i]t has been clear since\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   that a claimed invention's use of the ineligible concept to which it is\n   directed cannot supply the inventive concept that renders the invention 'significantly more' than that ineligible concept.\"\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/\">\n    899 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20208\">\n    573 U.S. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie Indemnity\n   </em>\n   , 850 F.3d at 1328 (\"In applying step two of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis, we must 'determine whether the claims do significantly more than simply describe [the] abstract method' and thus transform the abstract idea into patentable subject matter.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   715 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   SMS separately argues that the claimed database memory structure \"is not the same as a generic database or the generic relational databases discussed in ADT's two SQL sources.\" Dkt. No. 66, at 9. For support, SMS points to the prosecution history of the '553 patent, where the patent examiner allowed the application to issue after the applicants amended the claims to add \"the particular database structure present in the Asserted Claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   That argument amounts to saying that the invention, even if directed to an abstract idea, is nonetheless novel and therefore should be patent-eligible.

As noted above, ADT's uncontradicted evidence showed that relational databases such as the SQL-based database, which were well-known and conventional at the time of the '553 application, segregated data according to data types and entries within each data type.

'553 patent, col. 2, ll. 10-12; col. 4, ll., 29-31. The specification further explains that the \"source indicator\" merely \"identifies the CPU,\" a conventional\n   function of a generic processor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202742379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 4, ll. 20-21. The menu of display options is described in the specification as a display of the \"selection of information collected regarding the [protected] space,\" that is made available \"to facilitate the presentation of information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202742379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 2, line 62, to col. 3, line 3. Nothing in the specification or the claims suggests that the display of available information, which is depicted in Fig. 4 of the patent, constitutes an \"inventive concept.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The same is true of the dependent claims that recite the limitation of graphing the signal event for the manager. The specification describes the graphing option as a function performed by the CPU upon election of that option by the manager.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202742379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   col. 4, ll. 59-64 &amp; Fig. 7. Graphing is a well-understood and conventional function, both for humans and computers, and nothing in the specification suggests that there is anything inventive about the way that the graphing function is performed in the methods or apparatuses recited in the dependent claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Similarly, having the controller of the database provide the password to the manager of the protected space adds nothing material to the analysis of patent eligibility. The limitation regarding defining the message as environmental data simply constitutes a choice of nomenclature or, at most, the selection of a subset of all possible conditions to measure. The limitation regarding the detection of the passage of time entails merely the addition of a conventional computer clock to the system, and the limitation regarding sending an email when the signal exceeds a threshold value is likewise just a conventional variation on the detecting of a \"signal event\" in claims 1 and 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Finally, the limitation that recites measuring a parameter within the protected space is simply a way of characterizing the \"signal event\" referenced in claims 1 and 19, reflecting that the signal events can measure a wide variety of conditions within the protected space, including environmental factors (such as temperature and humidity), or electrical power conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202742379\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 3, ll. 12-16, 46-51; col. 4, ll. 47-55 &amp; Fig. 6. And the limitation that recites comparing the magnitude of the signal event with a threshold value and sending an email message to the manager when the magnitude exceeds the threshold value reflects the routine practice of monitoring a measured condition to determine if it has exceeded a previously set threshold value. Thus, the Court concludes that there is nothing in the dependent claims that would render them patent-eligible independent of the limitations in the corresponding independent claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Based on the analysis set forth above, the Court GRANTS the defendant's motion for summary judgment of patent ineligibility as to claims 1-5, 7-9, 17-23, 25-27, and 35-36 of the '553 patent, the only claims asserted in this case. Accordingly, the Court will direct the entry of final judgment in favor of defendant ADT. In light of this order, the Court will DENY AS MOOT the Defendant ADT LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), Dkt.
