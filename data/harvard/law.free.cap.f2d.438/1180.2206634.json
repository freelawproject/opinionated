Citizens Cas. Co. of N. Y., 431 F.2d 409, Part I (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1238-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1238-20\">John Leon Biggs appealed from an order granting his petition to proceed in forma pauperis, D.C., 318 F.Supp. 212, and denying all further motions for relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (1959). In this Court appellant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-21\">(1) The acts allegedly committed did not constitute the offense charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-22\">(2) Appellant was denied his Sixth Amendment rights to a public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-23\">(3) Appellant\u2019s plea of guilty was involuntary because he was not mentally competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-24\">(4) The District Court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine appellant\u2019s mental competency, in failing to provide appellant a free copy of the trial transcript, and in not appointing counsel for this appellate proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-25\">(5) The District Court abused its discretion in ordering the forfeiture of petitioner\u2019s bond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-26\">We find each of the contentions made here to be without merit. As to those contentions not expressly dealt with in the published opinion of the District Court, Biggs v. United States, 318 F.Supp. 212 (N.D.Fla.1970), no error of law appears and the Court has determined that an opinion would have no precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-27\">Affirmed. See Local Rule 21.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1238-28\"> See N.L.R.B. v.
