After an exhaustive study of the record, we hold that the evidentiary ruling, even if erroneous, was harmless within the meaning of Rule 52(a), FRCrimP. Taken, as a whole, the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, which are now challenged, fairly stated the applicable law and, in any event, were not objected to at the trial. In the absence of plain error, which does not here exist, the instructions cannot be attacked on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
