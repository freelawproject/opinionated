A careful consideration of the record shows that there was ample evidence to support the findings of fact by the trial court both with respect to the damages awarded in favor of the Norfolk Dredging Company and the judgment entered in favor of J. H. Coppedge as reimbursement for the bill for repairs paid by him on behalf of the dredge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-25\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
