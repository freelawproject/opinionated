Cf. May v. State of Georgia, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">After this Court had granted a certificate of probable cause and leave to appeal in forma pauperis, counsel for the appel-lee advised that the appellant has been granted parole on his federal sentence, and is free on bail pending grand jury action on the larceny charge. Considering further that the appellant has failed to take any action to prosecute this appeal, we are of the opinion that it should be dismissed. Kimbrough v. Beto, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-19\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Kimbrough v. Beto, Director, 5th Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
