We believe these proceedings are characterized by questions and answers that demonstrate free and voluntary waiver of counsel and a free and voluntary plea of guilty to the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-19\">Further, the District Judge had a right to conclude from reading this transcript that petitioner\u2019s assertion that he was drunk was patently false.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-20\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
