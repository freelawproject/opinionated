He alleges that his conviction resulted from illegal evidence obtained through electronic eavesdropping by federal agents. The eavesdropping was of a telephone conversation between Bush and a government informant, for which the informant had given consent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-24\">Bush relies primarily upon Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). Such reliance is misplaced for <em>Katz </em>is not to be applied retroactively. Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); Lopez v. United States, 409 F.2d 1351 (9th Cir. 1969). We recognize that the law pertaining to electronic eavesdropping may undergo some change as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s pending decision in United States v. White, 405 F.2d 838 (9th Cir.), cert. granted, 394 U.S. 957, 89 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>1305, 22 L.Ed.2d 559 (1969), <em>restored for reargument, </em>396 U.S. 1035, 90 S.Ct. 677, 24 L.Ed.2d 679 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But as the law now stands, Bush\u2019s conviction and sentence are valid. Should the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>White </em>operate in Bush\u2019s favor, he could, of course, institute a new proceeding under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-15\">. <em>White </em>was reargued before the Supreme Court on October 20, 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
