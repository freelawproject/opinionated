App. \u00a7 462. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Garvin\u2019s local board gave him a student classification and deferment from the time of his registration in March, 1965, until he was reclassified I-A in August, 1966. The board\u2019s August action was based on information from him that he had completed but a half-year program in a university during that one year period. The board, in November, 1966, reclassified him I-S(C), a terminal student deferment, upon hearing from Garvin\u2019s university that he was still a full-time student. On subsequent information from the university about Garvin\u2019s unsatisfactory class placement and class hour schedule, he was reclassified I-A in December, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">The board, on February 9, 1968, sent Garvin an order to report for induction on March 7, 1968. This order was postponed. He was again ordered on July 11, 1968 to report for induction August 1, 1968. On July 18 he requested an SSS Form 150 which he completed and returned to the board on July 29. On August 1 he refused to submit to induction. His indictment, trial and conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">The board considered Garvin\u2019s Form 150 on July 31, 1968. The minutes of the board meeting state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-10\">Registrant is under orders to report for induction. * * * Registrant had completed Form 150, but since he did not request Class 1-0 until after he received his Order to Report for Induction the local board felt that there was not sufficient evidence to warrent [sic] granting class I-O.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">NO ACTION TAKEN AT THIS TIME.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-12\">On August 5 the board notified Garvin by mail that the evidence submitted in the Form 150 had been received and that the evidence did not warrant reopening and considering anew the I-A classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-15\">Garvin contends, among other things, that the board\u2019s Order to Report for Induction is invalid because the board denied him due process in failing to reopen his I-A classification. We need consider no other contention made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-16\">The minutes of the board meeting are somewhat ambiguous, indicating that the board\u2019s decision may have been based on the idea \u2014 expressed in this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Schoebel, 201 F.2d 31 (7th Cir. 1953)\u2014 that Garvin\u2019s application did not show, as required by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2(b), a \u201cchange in * * * status resulting from circumstances over which [Garvin] had no control.\u201d However, the government does not question that a post-induction order crystallization of conscience can be a circumstance beyond Garvin\u2019s control. See United States v. Nordlof, 440 F.2d 840 (7th Cir., Jan. 5, 1971 ).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government seeks to sustain the conviction on the ground that Garvin\u2019s application failed to establish prima facie a right to reopening. And the board\u2019s letter to Garvin dated August 5 indicates that this may have been the ground of the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-17\">The question for us is therefore whether Garvin\u2019s Form 150 established a prima facie case requiring reopening of his I-A classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-18\"> The board properly considered Garvin\u2019s application since his application presented new evidence. United States v. Shermeister, 425 F.2d 1362 (7th Cir. 1970). If it should have reopened the classification, instead of denying reopening as it did, the failure to do so is fatal to his conviction. United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246, 248 (7th Cir. 1967). The board was required to reopen the classification if the application taken as true presented a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>showing which was not conclusively-overcome by material in the board\u2019s file. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">The government urges several reasons why a prima facie case was not presented by the application: there is no statement as to when Garvin first developed his objection; the application does not show prima facie that Garvin\u2019s objection is based on religious training and belief or its legal equivalent; and Garvin does not state that he is morally opposed to all wars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">L3] A reading of Garvin\u2019s statement discloses that there is no basis for these \u201creasons.\u201d He states essentially that an \u201cact of war is, by reason of my religious training and belief, against my conscience;\u201d that he cannot condone \u201cthis war, killing or military conscription * * * which are antithetical to reason and compassion;\u201d that he \u201cmust reject the reasoning behind killing in certain instances and war * * * [as] immoral;\u201d and that if \u201cI take [another\u2019s] life * * * I am violating my principles.\u201d With respect to the question \u201cDo you believe in a Supreme Being?\u201d Garvin answered that his \u201cpresent views toward a supreme being are agnostic\u201d but that \u201creason and compassion are manifestations of a supreme being or collective human intelligence. * * *\u00bb These claims taken as true make out a prima facie claim for reopening. Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970); United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965); United States v. Stolberg, 346 F.2d 363 (7th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">It is true that Garvin\u2019s application goes on to state that \u201cI especially must reject the rational [sic] behind our war in Vietnam\u201d and that \u201cthis war is insane.\u201d These statements, however, do not contradict his statements that he is opposed to war in general, assuming that to be the legal test. The government would have us read his statement \u201cI must reject the reasoning behind killing in certain instances and war\u201d as a rejection of killing only in certain circumstances and to specific wars only. But Garvin\u2019s statement, read in context, is that he is opposed to the governmental policy that killing in certain circumstances is justified. The government does not argue that there is information in Garvin\u2019s file which \u201cconclusively re-fut\u00e9is]\u201d his prima facie case, and accordingly. a reopening was required. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">There is no basis in fact for concluding that Garvin\u2019s beliefs matured prior to the mailing of his induction order. Form 150 discloses that \u201cthe first time I have ever given expression to my views was * * * on July 2, 1968.\u201d This is five months after Garvin\u2019s postponed Order to Report for Induction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\"> The government further says that Garvin\u2019s application states no source of his claim other than \u201creading, family and religious influence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>think this is a sufficient statement of source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">We hold therefore that the board \u201cabused its discretion\u201d in refusing to reopen Garvin\u2019s file, depriving him of his right to appeal, and that the Order to Report for Induction is therefore invalid. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 418, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970). The conviction is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The court expresses its appreciation to Attorney Edward W. Harris, III, of the Indiana Bar, for his dedicated service as court-appointed counsel for defendant Garvin.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1114-13\">. In <em>Norilof </em>we overruled the holding in <em>Sohoebel </em>that \u201cpromptings of conscience\u201d cannot result in a change of status from a circumstance beyond control of a registrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">. Although a second Order to Report was mailed after July 2, 1968, the record indicates that this order was merely a renewal of his postponed February 9, 1968 Order to Report for Induction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">. The government says that the board\u2019s task upon, receipt of the SSS Form 150 was to determine whether Garvin\u2019s objection was based on religious grounds, and in that determination to decide whether his beliefs are sincerely or \u201ctruly held.\u201d In its view, the board was empowered to consider the sincerity element in deciding whether to reopened the I-A classification, and the board\u2019s decision \u201con this point\u201d cannot be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"AOx\">We think the government misconceives the administrative process and the right of appeal. The first step in the process is to consider an application for C-0 classification with respect to whether it, taken as true, presents a prima facie ease in the light of \u201cother information\u201d in the file. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970). If a prima facie case is shown and not overcome conclusively by other information, the board \u201cmust reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417-418, 90 S.Ct. 1766. The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>then decides the sincerity question after reopening and makes a <em>de novo </em>classification which carries a right of administrative appeal. United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246 (7th Cir. 1967). There is no appeal to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
