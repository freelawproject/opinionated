Lawrence, guilty of armed robbery in violation of 14 V.I.C. Secs. 11 and 1861.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-18\">On this appeal Lawrence challenges as prejudicial error several of the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence and his discussion of that evidence in the course of his charge to the jury. He also contends that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that an acquittal should be directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-20\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the challenges to the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings and charge are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-21\">We are further of the opinion that there is no merit to the contention that they jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The evidence adduced at the trial was more than adequate to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-22\">For the reasons stated the judgment of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
