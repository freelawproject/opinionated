(Arbie), which engages in the production of animal feed in Mar-shalltown, Iowa. The union, which claimed to represent a majority of the employees as of January 17, 1969, filed unfair labor practice charges against the employer. The Board determined that Arbie had violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by interrogating its employees concerning their union activity and in threatening some employees with economic reprisals should the union win recognition. In addition, the Board found Arbie in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act because of its discharge of two employees. The Board directed that Arbie cease and desist from these unfair labor practices, that it reinstate the men wrongfully discharged and that it bargain with the union. The employer petitions to set aside the Board\u2019s order which is reported at 182 N.L.R.B. No. 24, 74 L.R.R.M. 1062 (1970). The Board cross-applies for enforcement. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">We grant enforcement in part. We decline to sustain the Board\u2019s bargaining order. Since the Board\u2019s findings of independent unfair labor practices underlie the issuance of said order, we first must review briefly the evidence cited to support these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The union organization drive was initiated in early November, 1968, by Gerald Breuklander, an Arbie truck driver, who was later discharged. Charles Wogan, a plant employee also later discharged by Arbie, joined Breuklander\u2019s efforts and signed a union authorization card at the beginning of the campaign. Although other employees hesitated to join the union at first, a number joined the union campaign during or immediately following the union meetings held in December, 1968, and January, 1969. Bruek-lander successfully solicited union authorization cards from several employees at places away from the union hall. By mid-January, the union possessed fourteen cards and claimed to represent the majority of the employees appropriate to a bargaining unit. Arbie, however, rejected the union\u2019s demand for recognition and told the union representative to present the demand to the National Labor Relations Board. Thereafter, the union petitioned for an election, but just prior to the hearing on the petition, filed the instant unfair labor practice charges. On the basis of this filing, the contemplated representation hearing was indefinitely postponed. We turn to a discussion of the separate charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">I. THE \u00a7 8(a) (1) CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">Shortly after the initial union meeting, supervisor Penrod asked Wogan if he was a union member. A few days later, foreman Moore asked Wogan what had transpired at the union meeting. During this conversation, and on subsequent occasions, Moore told employees that the union would not do the men any good, that it would cause employees a loss of money through loss of overtime work, Christmas bonuses and profit sharing, and that those employees campaigning for the union could be discharged. Supervisor Penrod told another employee that if the union gained recognition, Arbie would reduce overtime work for the present employees by adding a third shift. The witness to this latter conversation could not recall the exact date, but he thought the conversation occurred \u201caround\u201d mid-January. The Board deemed these conversations to be coercive and violative of \u00a7 8(a) (1). It rejected a number of other \u00a7 8(a) (1) charges alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">Arbie argues that the evidence demonstrates that the conversations consisted of casual, isolated remarks which lacked any coercive effect. It further contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>that the employees initiated all conversations with foreman Moore, a former union member, to solicit his personal opinion concerning the benefits of unionism. The record contains substantial evidence, however, to justify a finding of coercion from the repeated and pointed nature of the interrogations; that the remarks were not isolated and inconsequential. N. L. R. B. v. Talbot-General Wire Products, Inc., 418 F.2d 824 (8th Cir. 1969), is easily distinguishable, as in that case the remarks were made in a \u201ccasual\u201d conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Our review of questions of fact such as these is limited to whether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s determinations. The Board may draw reasonable and fair inferences from the evidence it finds to be creditable. Petitioner has shown no grounds on which we could properly reject the Board\u2019s findings and interpretations of the facts relative to these \u00a7 8 (a) (1) charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">II. THE \u00a7 8(a) (3) CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">On December 5, 1968, Arbie discharged Charles Wogan, an employee of sixteen-months duration, for alleged insubordination. The company contends that it based the discharge on four incidents involving Wogan. The first was the taking of a company truck without permission for personal use. Second, when Wogan was asked to pay for use of the employer\u2019s truck, he complained to fellow workers that the company overcharged him. While in the company offices, he said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t take the damn thing again anyway.\u201d Third, Wogan improperly operated a mixing machine and burned out its motor. Finally, on the day of his discharge, Wogan protested to the company comptroller that he had been paid $1.00 less than his fellow employees for the previous pay period. The company official rejected his claims. As Wogan left the company offices, he said to a group of fellow employees then waiting in the reception area, \u201cI think it is a bunch of crap.\u201d He made this remark in the presence of the female office secretary. Almost immediately thereafter, the manager called Wogan into his office and discharged him because of his \u201clanguage\u201d and his \u201cpoor attitude\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The Board viewed the employer\u2019s reasons given for the discharge as pretextual and, in doing so, noted that the alleged misdeeds committed prior to December 5, 1968, produced no hint of disciplinary action by the employer. The Board characterized the incident on the day of Wogan\u2019s discharge as being relatively innocuous. From all of the evidence, we think the Board might infer that an intent to discourage union activity, at least in part, motivated this particular discharge. See Betts Baking Co. v. N. L. R. B., 380 F.2d 199 (10th Cir. 1967). Thus, the General Counsel proved Wogan\u2019s discharge constituted a somewhat typical \u00a7 8(a) (3) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">The other discharged employee, Gerald Breuklander, had worked for Arbie for more than two years. The company dismissed him for drinking beer while operating a company truck on a feed delivery. A well-established company rule prohibited driving while drinking any intoxicant. Upon being informed of this incident the day after it occurred, the plant manager promptly fired Breuklander. When first confronted by his employer, Breuklander denied the charge. During the interrogation concerning this incident, Breuklander asked for a transfer to a non-driving job in the plant. After considering the matter for a few minutes, the manager declined, even though he later admitted that it was a poor time to let anyone go and that Breuklander had been a good employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">The Board sustained a \u00a7 8(a) (3) violation based on Breuklander\u2019s discharge. We disagree. Safety rule \u201cviolations present matters which employers may reasonably consider\u201d in determining the appropriateness of a discharge, even if an adherent of the union is involved. Illinois Ruan Transport Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 404 F.2d 274, 279 (8th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>1968). Nor does union affiliation prevent a discharge for cause. N. L. R. B. v. Arkansas Grain Corporation, 392 F.2d 161 (8th Cir. 1968). Breuklander committed a grave dereliction of duty. By driving while drinking, he violated an elemental safety rule which exposed his employer to almost certain liability should an accident occur. We find no substantial evidence indicating that the company condoned such grossly improper conduct by any of its employees at any time. Neither do we find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s view that Arbie\u2019s failure to give Breuklander a different job indicated that the drinking incident constituted a pretextual reason offered by the company for firing Breuk-lander. Accordingly, we reject the \u00a7 8 (a) (3) violation found on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">III. THE \u00a7 8(a) (5) BARGAINING ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\"> We must examine the Board\u2019s bargaining order by applying the standards for the less extraordinary unfair labor practice case, as set forth in N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). In <em>Gissel, </em>the Court noted that conduct in the \u201cexceptional\u201d cases, those where the employer\u2019s conduct can be characterized as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d, will justify the issuance of a bargaining order without need of inquiry into whether the union ever represented a majority of the employees. The issuance of such an order is justified in those situations as \u201cthe only available, effective remedy for substantial unfair labor practices.\u201d 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. The Supreme Court, in <em>Gissel, </em>also authorized the issuance of a bargaining order by the Board where the employer\u2019s independent unfair labor practices, although not subject to characterization as outrageous or extraordinary, \u201chave the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes.\u201d 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. Conversely, minor unfair labor practices, producing \u201cminimal impact on the election machinery, will not sustain a bargaining order.\u201d 395 U.S. at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. This court recently construed these facets of <em>Gissel, </em>concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-8\"><em>Gissel </em>does not mean that the Board may require a bargaining order in every unfair practice case or that a court of appeals may not review an order where abuse of discretion is alleged. Where there exists little or no opportunity for the unfair practice charge to have a pervasive adverse influence upon the employees\u2019 sentiment in an election the Board should still revert to the traditional means of democratic ballot. [N. L. R. B. v. Regal Aluminum, Inc., 436 F.2d 525, 529 (8th Cir., 1971)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">We find adequate evidence to support the Board\u2019s view that the union represented a majority of the appropriate bargaining unit here as of the time the union demanded recognition. The Board\u2019s conclusion on this point satisfies a preliminary element for the issuance of a bargaining order, proof that the union at one point represented a majority of the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">In this case, not marked by any outrageous employer conduct, we must determine whether, under the <em>Gissel </em>rules, Arbie\u2019s conduct exerted \u201cminimal impact on the election machinery\u201d, which would obviate the need for a bargaining order, or tended to \u201cundermine majority strength and impede the election processes\u201d, a circumstance entitling us to uphold the Board\u2019s issuance of the bargaining order. To draw the line between these two propositions is extremely difficult particularly upon appellate review conducted in the sterile atmosphere of a printed record. The <em>Gissel </em>decision offers the following guideline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-11\">It is for the Board and not the courts, however, to make that determination, based on its expert estimate as to the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity. In fashioning its remedies under the broad provisions of \u00a7 10(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), the Board draws on a fund of knowledge and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>pertise all its own, and its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts. [395 U.S. at 612, n. 32, 89 S.Ct. at 1939]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">The Court in <em>Gissel, </em>instructed that the Board issue a bargaining order if it finds \u201cthat the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order * * 395 U.S. at 614-615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. We have applied this admonition in N. L. R. B. v. Hart Beverage Co., 414 F.2d 618, 621 (8th Cir. 1969). The Board\u2019s determinations in this area are, however, subject to judicial review and modification in appropriate cases. N. L. R. B. v. General Stencils, Inc., 438 F.2d 894, 76 L.R.R.M. 2288 (2d Cir. 1971); L. C. Cassidy &amp; Son, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 415 F.2d 1358, 1365 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Significantly, the record in this case discloses that the employer\u2019s conduct constituting \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations occurred prior to Wogan\u2019s discharge on December 5, 1968, except perhaps for supervisor Penrod\u2019s second conversation to which we have already made reference. Parenthetically, we note Breuklander\u2019s valid discharge occurred in late January, 1969, subsequent to the union\u2019s obtaining authorization cards from a majority of the employees. The union obtained eleven of its fourteen signed authorization cards after, not before, December 5. This evidence thus affirmatively indicates that the unfair practices did not tend to undermine a union majority; in fact, the unfair practices preceded the union\u2019s most successful card signing period. Cf. Fremont Newspapers, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 436 F.2d 665 (8th Cir. 1970); N. L. R. B. v. Crystal Tire Company, 410 F.2d 916 (8th Cir. 1969). Although <em>Crystal Tire </em>was decided before <em>Gissel, </em>that decision conforms with the teachings of <em>Gissel. </em>In declining to enforce the Board\u2019s bargaining order in <em>Crystal Tire, </em>we emphasized that the unfair labor practices did not in fact undermine the employees\u2019 adherence to their union, but the employer\u2019s unfair labor practice tactics \u201cactually stiffened employee resistance to the short-lived anti-union campaign.\u201d 410 F.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">In <em>Fremont Newspapers, </em>we again refused to enforce a bargaining order. There, the union and the employer had unsuccessfully negotiated for a union contract for a period of approximately ten months. The union contended that unfair labor practices committed by the employer encouraged employees to file a decertification petition to repudiate their union. The Board justified the bargaining order as an appropriate remedy to overcome the effects of conversations between a supervisor and two employees, each on a separate occasion. Judge Hunter, speaking for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARGB\">Only one of those conversations occurred prior to the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain and the filing of the informal decertification petition by the employees. The representations of [employer] were never repeated to other employees * * *. Following the conversations, both employees remained strong Union adherents and took no part in the later filing of the formal decertification petition. <em>[Fremont Newspapers, Inc., supra, </em>436 F.2d at 673.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-10\">Therefore in the light of the objective evidence of the record, it is not reasonably possible to find that the independent unfair labor practices here had any effect upon the Union majority or the potential decertification proceedings. [Id. at 673.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">In cases subsequent to <em>Gissel, </em>we have frequently approved bargaining orders where, unlike the present case, the record affirmatively disclosed the employer\u2019s independent unfair labor practices actually eroded a union majority. N. L. R. B. v. Arrow Specialties, Inc., 437 F.2d 522 (8th Cir. 1971); Howard Mfg. Co., Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 436 F.2d 581 (8th Cir. 1971); Regal Aluminum, Inc., <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>436 F.2d 525; Ace-Alkire Freight Lines, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 431 F.2d 280, 284 (8th Cir. 1970); Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 426 F.2d 763 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 879, 91 S.Ct. 120, 27 L.Ed.2d 116 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">In other cases, although the record showed no affirmative unhinging of support for the union by employees of the affected company, we enforced bargaining orders resting solely upon one or more \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations, and, in so doing, permitted the Board to infer that the particular unfair labor practices tended to \u201cundermine the majority strength and impede the election process.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Noll Motors, Inc., 433 F.2d 853 (8th Cir. 1970). See N. L. R. B. v. Gerbes Super Markets, Inc. (\u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) violations), 436 F.2d 19 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Upon analysis, it appears that we have applied these guidelines of evaluation of evidence in our <em>post-Gissel </em>cases in determining whether or not to enforce the Board\u2019s bargaining order as a remedy for independent unfair labor practices:</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">(1) Where the underlying facts affirmatively show that the unfair labor practices have in fact undermined a union majority, typically evidenced by the union losing an election or the employees seeking to withdraw from the union following the occurrence of the conduct in question, we grant enforcement;</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">(2) Where the record is silent concerning the actual impact of the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices, we defer to the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion and grant enforcement; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">(3) Where the evidence establishes that the unfair labor practices produced little or no impact upon the employees\u2019 allegiance to the union, we deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">The present case falls within the above third category of post-Gissei cases, since the evidence affirmatively showed that the company\u2019s unfair labor practices did not pollute the election atmosphere. See N. L. R. B. v. American Cable Systems, Inc., 427 F.2d 446, 448 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 957, 91. S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed.2d 266 (1970). Here, the organization drive proceeded at an accelerated pace following the employer\u2019s commission of prohibited practices. In summary, we think the Board abused its prerogatives in this case by issuing a bargaining order and aborting an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Subject to modification as required by this opinion, we grant enforcement of the Board\u2019s order herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">.
