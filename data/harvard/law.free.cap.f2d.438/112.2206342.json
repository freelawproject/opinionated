We have concluded that the Board\u2019s Petition should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Including Christensen, five employees <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cast votes in the election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without counting Christensen\u2019s ballot, the vote was 2-2. The ballot of Christensen, who voted for the Union, was challenged by Pacific, on the grounds that his employment had been terminated before the election. The Board, however, determined that Christensen was a regular part-time employee, sufficiently concerned with the terms and conditions of employment in the unit to warrant his participation in the selection of a bargaining representative. While there is some discrepancy as to the exact number of hours worked by Christensen and his prospects of future part-time employment by the company, there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">Pacific contends that Christensen\u2019s employment was terminated at a meeting of company management, the day prior to the election. While such a meeting may have occurred, it is undisputed that Christensen was not in any manner advised of this alleged decision, until two days after the election. The Board takes the position that in order for an employer\u2019s termination of an employment relationship to be effective, it must be communicated to the employee by some affirmative action on the part of the employer. <em>See </em>Westchester Plastics of Ohio, Inc. v. NLRB, 401 F.2d 903, 908 (6th Cir. 1968); Miami Rivet Co., 147 NLRB 470, 483-84 (1964); Otarion Listener Corp., 124 NLRB 880, 881 (1959). In the context of the present proceeding, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">In its brief, Pacific argues that, at the very least, an evidentiary hearing should have been held to resolve factual questions concerning Christensen\u2019s part-time status and his purported preelection discharge. During the oral argument in our court, however, the Respondent\u2019s attorney forthrightly conceded that were we to adopt the position, as we do, that prior notice to Christensen was a prerequisite to his disqualification, the requested hearing would have served no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">The challenged order will be Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">.
