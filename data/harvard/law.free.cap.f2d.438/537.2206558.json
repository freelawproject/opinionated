Our court affirmed this conviction by order in Spann v. United States, No. 18,817, decided February 7, 1969. Subsequently, appellant filed a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964). This motion was denied by the same District Judge without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-22\">Inspection of the petition and the brief filed therewith convinces this court that the allegations in petitioner\u2019s sworn aver-ments were either presented to this court and denied in the previous appeal, or are stated in such conclusory language as to lack the specificity of allegation which would demand an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>Scott v. United States, 349 F.2d 641 (6th Cir. 1965). Appellant, for example, alleges ineffectiveness of counsel but in nowise indicates how or wherein his chosen counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-23\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
