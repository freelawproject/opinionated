Finding that this appeal clearly falls within the ambit of our Local Rule 21<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-25\">The appellant seeks reversal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to go to the jury, that at least a new trial should have been granted, that a remittitur should. have been entered, and that there was no evidentiary basis for the verdict as to maintenance and cure. These are typically factual issues concerning which an opinion would have no precedential value, Local Rule 21, supra. See, also Boeing Company v. Ship-man, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-26\">The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-21\">. LOCAL RULE 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-22\">When the Court determines that any one or more of the following circumstances exists and is dispositive of a matter submitted to the Court for decision : (1) that a judgment of the District Court is based on findings of fact which are not clearly erroneous; (2) that the evidence in support of a jury verdict is not insufficient; (3) that the order of an administrative agency is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; (4) that no error of law appears; and the Court also determines that an opinion would have no precedential value, the judgment or order may be affirmed or enforced without opinion.
