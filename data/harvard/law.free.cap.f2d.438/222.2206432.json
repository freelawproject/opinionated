The district court held that the action was timely commenced. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The facts present an extraordinary compounding of mishaps. In 1951 plaintiff Toal underwent spinal surgery to remedy injuries incurred during his military service. Ten years later, while plaintiff was on vacation in Austria, his spinal condition worsened and a second operation was recommended. Plaintiff returned to the United States and was admitted to the Veterans Administration Hospital at West Haven, Connecticut early in May, 1962. On May 23, 1962, Dr. John Elliott and a radiologist performed a myelogram on the plaintiff. This diagnostic procedure involved the introduction of an iodized radiopaque contrast medium, called pantopaque, into plaintiff\u2019s spine by means of a lumbar puncture. As the dye circulated through the spinal fluid, X-rays scanned the spinal column. When the filming was completed, the table upon which the patient lay was tilted to permit the pan-topaque to collect in the lumbar sac, from which, in the course of customary practice, the dye was then aspirated through a needle. In plaintiff\u2019s case, however, the pantopaque was not removed from the plaintiff\u2019s spine. Dr. Elliott attempted to withdraw the panto-paque but failed, and no further efforts were made to extract it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">The plaintiff was aware of this at the time and testified that on the day before his discharge he asked Dr. Elliott whether the retained pantopaque might prove harmful. Dr. Elliott assured the plaintiff that pantopaque retention would not injure him, that \u201cwe normally leave it [the pantopaque] in; it\u2019s standard procedure in * * * a lot of hospitals,\u201d that the dye would in time be absorbed and that the plaintiff \u201chad nothing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Four days after the plaintiff\u2019s discharge on May 31, 1962, he was in an automobile accident, as a result of which he suffered head, neck and back injuries and was hospit\u00e1lized at another Veterans Administration hospital. Upon his discharge two months later the plaintiff consulted his private physician, Dr. Smith. Because Dr. Elliott had not not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ed the pantopaque retention in plaintiff\u2019s West Haven discharge report until sometime after Dr. Smith\u2019s examination, the doctor was not apprised of that crucial fact from his examination of the plaintiff\u2019s medical history and therefore assumed that plaintiff\u2019s persistent ill-health resulted from the injuries which he had incurred in the automobile accident. Dr. Smith\u2019s medications did nothing to alleviate the plaintiff\u2019s pain. Toal returned to Austria in February, 1963 where he consulted the same doctors who had recommended the second spinal operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">On March 29, 1963 plaintiff wrote to the Veterans Administration in an effort to secure larger disability payments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He explained that at the time of the accident he was still suffering from the myelogram taken at the Veterans Administration Hospital at West Haven only 12 days before, which had resulted in more spinal irritation, pain and disability than had an earlier myelogram,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the aggravating injuries from the automobile accident made his disability complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">During the ensuing year the plaintiff suffered headaches which grew progressively more excruciatingly painful and were accompanied by dizziness and nausea. In early 1964 an Austrian neurologist, Dr. Strasser, X-rayed the plaintiff\u2019s skull and on March 7, 1964 he advised the plaintiff that pantopaque globules encysted on brain tissues were the primary cause of his illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Government contends that the plaintiff\u2019s suit, instituted July 27, 1965, was not timely commenced because the plaintiff\u2019s letter of March 29, 1963 demonstrated his awareness of the panto-paque retention and of a spinal irritation which he attributed to the presence of pantopaque. The district court disagreed, finding that the plaintiff did not know and could not have known before March, 1964 the causative relationship between the pantopaque retention and the eventual inflammation of brain tissues which the court found to be a substantial factor in producing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Plaintiff\u2019s letter of March 29, 1963 mentioned the pantopaque retention and spinal irritation in connection with the time of the accident which was four days after his discharge from the West Haven V. A. Hospital when he could fairly assume that the pantopaque had not, in accordance with Dr. Elliott\u2019s prognosis, as yet been absorbed. Toal referred to it as a source of discomfort to him at the time but he said nothing to indicate that he was aware he had suffered injury from a wrongful act on the part of the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The two-year period within which a tort claim action may be brought against the Government is computed from the time the \u201cclaim accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). By employing this phrase, Congress adopted a concept, developed in the substantive law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> embodying those occurrences which permit maintenance of a claim. See Developments in the Law \u2014 Statutes of Limitations, 63 Harv.L.Rev. 1177, 1200 (1950). Although many jurisdictions provide that the limitation period, within which a plaintiff with a negligence claim may bring his action, commences to run with the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the claim, the federal courts have held that in medical malpractice actions against the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ment the limitation period does not begin to run until \u201cthe claimant [has] discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the acts constituting the alleged malpractice.\u201d Quinton v. United States, 304 F.2d 234, 240 (5 Cir. 1962); see Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 169, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282 (1949); Kossick v. United States, 330 F.2d 933, 935 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 837, 85 S.Ct. 73, 13 L.Ed.2d 44 (1964); Brown v. United States, 353 F.2d 578 (9 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Under the peculiar circumstances of the present case we do not find clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s decision that the plaintiff could not reasonably have been expected to associate the known retention of pantopaque with the symptoms caused by the gradual encys-tation of pantopaque on the tissues of his brain, because, although Toal knew that the pantopaque had not been removed, he had been assured by Dr. Elliott that pantopaque retention was not only not. an exceptional occurrence but was a customary procedure, that it was not injurious and that he needn\u2019t worry about it. Giving full faith to his doctor\u2019s confident prognosis, Toal thought it was the unfortunate occurrence of the injuries from the automobile accident so soon after the myelogram at the West Haven V. A. Hospital that prolonged his acute discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">But for Dr. Elliott\u2019s assurances to the plaintiff and his failure to record the pantopaque retention until it was too late, plaintiff\u2019s private physician would have been apprised of this condition<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and would have been less likely to have been misled into concluding that the collision-incurred injuries were the cause of plaintiff\u2019s suffering. Finally, the letter of March 29, 1963 does not reveal, as the Government contends, the plaintiff\u2019s awareness that he was suffering the injurious consequences of maltreatment. Rather it sets out his belief that the presence of pantopaque within the spinal column, the strain of the myelogram procedure and the pre-existing spinal injury made him more vulnerable to suffering from the injuries he received in the automobile collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Under the particular circumstances of this case the plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to have distinguished the deleterious effects of the maltreatment from his original service connected disability or from the expectable consequences of proper treatment until the extremely severe symptoms compelled him to seek relief from Dr. Strasser in March of 1964. This is not to say that one who knows he has suffered damage from medical malpractice may postpone bringing an action until the full extent of that damage is ascertained, cf. Ashley v. United States, 413 F.2d 490 (9 Cir. 1969); but in this case Dr. Elliott\u2019s assurance that the pantopaque would do him no injury and that it would gradually be absorbed into his system, and Dr. Elliott\u2019s delay in filing a notation in the record that the pantopaque had not been removed, so that Toal\u2019s private physician, Dr. Smith, knew nothing about it, prevented Toal from learning that any act of malpractice had occurred. Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 79 S.Ct. 760, 3 L.Ed.2d 770 (1959). The situation was further complicated by injuries from the automobile accident a few days later. Under the circumstances we do not think the trial court clearly erred in finding that until March 1964 plaintiff neither knew of his wrong or failed to exercise reasonable diligence to discover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">. After undergoing surgery in 1951, the plaintiff received a 60% disability compensation award from the Veterans Administration. The trial court found the plaintiff was totally disabled after his 1961 relapse but the Veterans Administration did not increase his disability allowance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-13\">.
