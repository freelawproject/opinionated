According to Benn\u2019s motion, the complaint would name, as defendant, \u201cBorden\u2019s Starlac Dry Milk Product, et al.\u201d Benn seeks damages from the defendant by reason of illness assertedly suffered by him as a result of drinking defendant\u2019s \u201cStar-lac\u201d milk obtained from the prison canteen. Benn alleges that harmful bacteria had been found in this milk product.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">An order refusing to grant the privilege of proceeding in forma pauperis in a civil action must be affirmed unless it appears that the discretion vested in the district court by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) has been abused. Williams v. Field, 394 F.2d 329, 332 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">It appears from Benn\u2019s motion papers that he has not, and cannot, allege facts stating a claim for damages under any head of federal jurisdiction. Accordingly the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
