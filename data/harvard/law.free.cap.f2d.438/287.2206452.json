On February 16, 1970, he was arraigned in United States district court and entered a plea of not guilty. On March 10, 1970, he withdrew his plea and entered a plea of guilty as charged. He was sentenced on March 30, 1970, for a term of 30 months in the custody of the Attorney General of the United States. On April 9, 1970, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A hearing was held and defendant\u2019s motion was subsequently overruled. This appeal followed. Defendant asserts on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty by reason of the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We hold there was not compliance with Rule 11 and reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On March 10, 1970, the defendant appeared with counsel before the district court. It was then announced by counsel that the defendant wanted to change his plea from not guilty to guilty as charged. The court asked the defendant his age and education. The defendant stated he was 40 years old and had about a tenth grade education. The substance of the indictment was read to the defendant. The court advised the defendant the maximum penalties which could be imposed; he ascertained. from the defendant that no one had made any promise or threat to him in order to induce his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Defendant contends that the district judge did not determine that there was a factual basis for the plea and whether the defendant properly understood the nature and consequences of his plea. The defendant argues that the district judge only said that he assumed that counsel had explained the indictment to the defendant and that \u201cyou have been over it and you understand what you are charged with.\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Both parties agree the instant proceeding is controlled by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 wh\u2019ch reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">\u201cA defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of the courc, <em>nolo contendere. </em>The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-11\"> In McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 470, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), the Supreme Court observed: \u201cThere is no adequate substitute for demonstrating <em>in the record at the time the plea is entered </em>the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge against him.\u201d Ascertaining that the lawyer has gone over the indictment with the defendant is not in itself sufficient. The trial court must inquire directly of the defendant as to his \u201cunderstanding.\u201d One of the purposes of Rule 11 as reflected by <em>McCarthy </em>is to allow inquiry into the \u201crelation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed * * to \u2018protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\u2019 \u201d McCarthy v. United States, supra at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171. See also United States v. Sanders, 435 F.2d 1282 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>(10 Cir. 1970); United States v. Tucker, 425 F.2d 624 (4 Cir. 1970). Cf. Kress v. United States, 411 F.2d 16 (8 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Supreme Court additionally commented :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cTo the extent that the district judge thus exposes the defendant\u2019s state of mind on the record through personal interrogation, he not only facilitates his own determination of a guilty plea\u2019s voluntariness, but he also facilitates that determination in any subsequent post-conviction proceeding based upon a claim that the plea was involuntary. <em>Both of these goals are undermined in proportion to the degree the district fudge resorts to \u2018assumptions\u2019 not based upon recorded responses to his inquiries.\u201d </em>394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The present record is further deficient in that there exists nothing to demonstrate that the trial judge had satisfied himself that the plea of guilty had a basis in fact. This determination can be -made other than through the defendant\u2019s own statements. As pointed out in <em>McCarthy, </em>the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules has suggested three methods of determining that a factual basis exists for a guilty plea: (1) inquiring of the defendant, (2) inquiring of the prosecutor, and (3) examining the presentence report. 394 U.S. at 463 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1166. The government\u2019s argument that this was fulfilled by the prosecutor reading from the indictment in the presence of the defendant falls far short of demonstrating any factual basis for the defendant\u2019s plea. In oral argument the government refers us to the recent case of North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed. 2d 162 (1970), where a plea bargain was upheld and the plea of guilty was ruled valid notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s refusal to factually admit the offense charged. The <em>Alford </em>decision was not intended to amend Rule 11 or erode the strict requirements of <em>McCarthy. </em>North Carolina v. Alford must be read in its narrow factual context. The record demonstrated there that, notwithstanding Alford\u2019s refusal to factually admit guilt, at the guilty plea proceeding the state called several witnesses who pointed a strong finger of guilt to him. There existed a clear showing as to factual basis of Alford\u2019s guilt for the court to weigh at the time of his plea. We are convinced the ominous consequences of self-conviction resulting from a guilty plea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> must still be guarded by thorough judicial inquiry<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as required by Rule 11. It did not happen here.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">The government finally argues that there was no showing of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d in refusing to allow the withdrawal of the plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d). The quick answer to this argument is found in <em>McCarthy </em>where the Supreme Court said: \u201c[A] defendant is entitled to plead anew if a United States district court accepts his guilty plea without fully adhering to the procedure provided for in Rule 11.\u201d 394 U.S. at 463-464, 89 S.Ct. at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">\n<em>Appendix</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">Although there exists no set standard or requirements as to conducting a guilty plea proceeding, a recommended procedure is found in the <em>Bench Book for United States District Judges. </em>This book was prepared in October 1969 under the auspices of the Federal Judicial Center after compilation by the staff of the Institute of Judicial Administration under the supervision of a committee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>United States district judges. It reads in pertinent part at 1.05.2-1.05.3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201c5. If defendant\u2019s plea is guilty or nolo contendere: [FRCrP 11; McCarthy v.

As recently emphasized by Judge Pickett in United States v. Sanders, 435 F.2d 1282 (10 Cir. 1970), the- Supreme Court in <em>McCarthy </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201cIt is, therefore, not too much to require that, before sentencing defendants to years of imprisonment, the district judge take the few minutes necessary to inform them of their rights and determine whether they understand the action they are taking.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-18\">. See appendix, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b348-34\">VAN OOSTERHOUT, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b348-35\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, the record of Cody\u2019s three appearances before the District Court prior to acceptance of his guilty plea reflects that an adequate basis exists for a determination by the court that Cody understood the nature and consequences of his guilty plea, and that a factual basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>acceptance of the plea is established. The elements of the crime charged are simple and easily understood. Defendant was represented by competent counsel. There has been substantial compliance with Rule 11.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d), a defendant has no right to withdraw his plea of guilty after sentence unless he can show a manifest injustice would result if such were not permitted. Sher-burne v. United States, 8 Cir., 433 F.2d 1350, 1353; Meyer v. United States, 8 Cir., 424 F.2d 1181, 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Cody has not asserted that he is not guilty of the crime charged nor has he shown any substantial basis for a determination that the acceptance of his plea was not voluntary nor that the acceptance resulted in manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit Cody to withdraw his guilty plea after sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-17\">. I do not disagree with the majority view that expanded questioning under Rule 11 would tend to discourage or at least enable more expeditious disposition of post-conviction attacks upon the validity of a guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
