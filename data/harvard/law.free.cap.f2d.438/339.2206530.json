The letter of October 29 was the last in a long series of letters from Cahn to the Board, requesting a II-A occupational deferment for his assistant, Ga-lasso. It stated that upon instructions from the New York State Judicial Conference and the Appellate Division, the D.A.\u2019s office was embarking upon a crash program to reduce the backlog of criminal cases awaiting indictment and trial and that Galasso was needed in that effort. Upon receipt of this letter, a clerical employee of the Board contacted the Board members by telephone and through that means the Board reached a decision to take no action to postpone or to defer Galasso\u2019s induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Galasso contends that this telephonic communication violated the Board\u2019s own Regulation, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.56, which states that a \u201cmajority of the members * * * present at a meeting * * * at which a quorum is present shall decide any question or classification.\u201d Galasso argues that this Regulation required an in-person meeting to decide the \u201cquestion\u201d presented by Cahn\u2019s letter of October 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Galasso\u2019s contention has no merit. The members of the Board were already fully familiar with Galasso\u2019s case, having ruled on several previous occasions on requests from Cahn for an occupational deferment for Galasso. The letter of October 29 was merely another such letter and added no new material information. The Board should be able to decide such additional matters without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>coming together or writing a statement of its reasons. Hence it was not improper for the Board to act by telephone on the application for further postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
