We do it on the basis of the district court\u2019s decision, Todd v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 324 F.Supp. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">Todd was the junior member of a flight crew and he has been discharged because he \u201cinfluenced and encouraged the first pilot and other crew members to fly Flight No. 27 of January 1, 1964, at a time when he had good reason to believe the first pilot should not take out the flight in the interest of public safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">Todd was the one who \u201cleaked\u201d word of the first pilot\u2019s condition on the critical day. Another system board disciplined Pilot Rail and co-pilot Lee, but did not order their discharge. That award was left undisturbed by Northwest Airlines, Inc., v. ALPA, Rall and Lee, 373 F.2d 136 (8th Cir.), cert. den. 389 U.S. 827, 88 S.Ct. 77, 19 L.Ed.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-21\">Much as we would like to see consistent results here, it is beyond our power to order them. We cannot say the trial court erred in approving the award of Todd\u2019s board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
