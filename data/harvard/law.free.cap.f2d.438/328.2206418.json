S.C.A. \u00a7 751(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-26\">Patterson was tried, convicted and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d). Several days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>after he was committed to the custody of the United States Marshal he escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In support of his claim of insanity, Patterson argues that at the time of the escape he lacked substantial mental capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Blake v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 908, 916. Relying entirely on his own testimony and the support of two of his prisonmates, Patterson maintains that he was \u201chighly nervous\u201d and in a \u201cstate of melancholia\u201d because of the lengthy sentence imposed upon him as a result of the bank robbery conviction. He adds that the \u201cinhuman\u201d treatment received in the City Jail also contributed to his depressed mental condition. Following the Government\u2019s rebuttal, also consisting of lay witness testimony, the trial judge determined to submit the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">To consider the merits of Patterson\u2019s insanity defense we would have to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. But review is precluded since Patterson failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence. <em>See </em>United States v. Pitts, 5 Cir. 1970, 428 F.2d 534, 535. Nor is this a case of plain error which would result in a clear miscarriage of justice. <em>See, e. g., </em>Mims v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 135, 147; Clark v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 445, 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Patterson next urges that the trial judge committed error in failing to find <em>sua sponte </em>that expert testimony of a psychiatrist was necessary to his defense and in failing to notify Patterson that such expert testimony would be provided at Government expense. The rights established by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3006A(e) are procedural, and the failure to make a timely motion or request waives the necessity for the court\u2019s consideration of an appointment of an expert witness. Marshall v. United States, 10 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1315, 1318; Ray v. United States, 8 Cir. 1966, 367 F.2d 258, 266 &amp; n. 12, 267, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 913, 87 S.Ct. 863, 17 L.Ed.2d 785; Watson v. Patterson, 10 Cir. 1966, 358 F.2d 297, 298, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 876, 87 S.Ct. 153, 17 L.Ed.2d 103. United States v. Tate, 6 Cir. 1969, 419 F.2d 131, upon which Patterson relies, is inapposite because the defendant there timely moved for, but was denied, appointment of a psychiatrist on uncontradicted allegations of possible symptoms of paranoia.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The other matters urged by Patterson have been considered and are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
