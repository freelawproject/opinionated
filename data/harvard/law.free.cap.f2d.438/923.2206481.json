He avers that his federal bail then was revoked and bail on the state charges was precluded by the lodging of a federal detainer against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Willis was sentenced on the state charges on December 10, 1968, to serve a sentence running concurrently with the federal sentence which he had received on November 29, 1968. He was transferred to the United States Penitentiary to commence service of his federal (and concurrent state) sentence on December 31, 1968. Willis claims that he is entitled to credit on his federal sentence for the 61 days from October 31 to December 31,1968.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Clearly Willis is not entitled to credit for the period of December 10 to December 30 or 31, 1968. During that time he was actually serving his state sentence for offenses unrelated to the federal charges. Sanders v. McGuire, 5 Cir. 1968, 405 F.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">The state court purported to give Willis credit for his presentence custody from October 31 to December 10, 1968. This did not help Willis, however, because his federal sentence is due to expire more than a year after his state terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">In previous proceedings, the District Court denied relief to Willis because the sentences being concurrent, the state already had given credit for the presen-tence jail time. The instant petition was denied as being a successive application for similar relief. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">This case is governed by our decision in Davis v. Attorney General, 5 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 238. There we held that if Davis \u201cwas denied release on bail because the federal detainer was lodged against him, then that was time \u2018spent in custody in connection with the [federal] offense,\u2019 [18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3568] since the detainer was issued upon authority of the appellant\u2019s federal conviction and sentence.\u201d 425 F.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Accordingly the judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part; and the case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Willis\u2019 contention that he should be accorded credit on his federal sentence for his presentence custody of October 31 to December 10,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-9\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Kimbrough v. Beto, Director, 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">. On authority of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3568 as amended in 1966; <em>see </em>United States v. Morgan, 5 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 1388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-18\">. The appellant\u2019s official \u201ccommitment and diagnostic summary\u201d sheet prepared by the Bureau of Prisons shows that he is credited with service of his federal sentence from December 30, 1968, but that he has been accorded no credit thereon for any presentence time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
