We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-20\">The appeal evolved from an action brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri by the executors of an estate for recovery of federal income taxes paid by the estate. The material facts were stipulated to and are set in the decision of the District Court which granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs. Commerce Trust Company v. United States, 309 F.Supp. 1317 (W.D.Mo. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-21\">This precise issue was originally decided contrary to the government\u2019s position in Estate of Viola E. Bray, 46 T.C. 577 (1966), aff\u2019d mem., 396 F.2d 452 (6th Cir. 1968) (relying on the opinion of the Tax Court). Most recently, the issue has created a flury of judicial activity. The resulting decisions have unanimously followed <em>Bray </em>in rejecting the government\u2019s position. Smith v. United States, 319 F.Supp. 174 (E.D. Mo., Oct. 28, 1970); Clapp v. United States, No. 70-524-HP, 70-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 12,720 (C.D.Cal., Aug. 24, 1970), appeal authorized, 9th Cir., 717 CCH-Standard Federal Tax Reports 70,704; Wilson v.

We think it correctly found the government\u2019s arguments wanting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">For the reasons stated in the opinion of the lower court and in the opinion of the Tax Court in Estate of Viola E. Bray, <em>supra, </em>the judgment of the District Coui't is</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-14\">.
