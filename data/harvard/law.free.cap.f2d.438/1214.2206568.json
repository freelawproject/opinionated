He was sentenced to serve a term of ten years imprisonment on each count, said sentences to run concurrently.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 5, 1970, appellant\u2019s term of sentence, less the time deducted for good conduct, expired and except as provided in 18 U.S.C., Section 4164, appellant was released. Section 4164 states \u201cA prisoner having served his term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, be deemed as if released on parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less one hundred and eighty days.\u201d Appellant argues that his said release was absolute without restriction. This is admittedly the sole issue before us. In appellant\u2019s situation he was released under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4163 at the expiration of his term of sentence less the time deducted for good conduct. That resulted in appellant\u2019s concurrent sentences being reduced to approximately six years. The release under 4163 is expressly conditioned as the section states \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided. * * * \u201d In \u00a7 4164 as above noted it is carefully and clearly set out that \u201cA prisoner having served his term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, be deemed as if released on parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less one hundred and eighty days.\u201d All reported decisions are in accord with the above plainly right and just construction of the applicable statutes, sections 4163 and 4164.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">In McMillan v. Parker, Warden et al., 254 F.Supp. 365, 366 (D.C.M.D.Pa.1966), Judge Follmer held that \u201cUpon release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4163, a prisoner is \u2018deemed as if released on parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he is-sentenced less one hundred and eighty days.\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164.\u201d We affirmed that decision, 378 F.2d 444, (3 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">The identical problem was also before the Tenth Circuit in Robinson v. Willingham, 369 F.2d 688, 689 (1966). The court held that \u00a7 4163 must be construed in conjunction with the statute following it, Section 4164. So construed, \u201ca prisoner released as a mandatory releasee is subject to the same conditions of release as a parolee under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">See also Sprouse v. Settle, 274 F.2d 681, 683 (8 Cir. 1960); Miller v. Taylor, 313 F.2d 21, 22 (10 Cir. 1962), cert. denied 374 U.S. 837, 83 S.Ct. 1887, 10 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-13\">We agree with the finding of Judge Whipple in the District Court that the complaint herein is wholly without merit and we affirm its dismissal \u201cfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">. The tea-year concurrent sentences on each of the two counts are to be treated as one sentence. See Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
