The transactions were many, and the court made a serious attempt at attribution. Taxpayer\u2019s records were poor. Concededly, if the court had accepted his oral testimony, it would have allowed substantially more deductions. Instead, it found those established only by taxpayer\u2019s summary statements on the witness stand to be insufficiently supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-19\">Taxpayer in part argues that his oral testimony should have been accepted because uncontradicted. He further says that in the unverified area the court, pursuant to the rule in Cohan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 1930, 39 F.2d 540, should have made a \u201creasonable approximation\u201d of his deductible expenses. We do not take the <em>Cohan </em>case as going that far. The Tax Court, did make some allowances. In the absence of records it did not have to go as deeply into the matter as taxpayer wanted. Zooloomian v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 1337, aff\u2019g per curiam 28 CCH Tax Ct. Memo 572; Donovan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 64; Williams v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 559, 560-561. Nor do we propose to retry the case ourselves, or to adopt taxpayer\u2019s final suggestion, remand, because he believes he can present a better case next time. A party is not entitled to relief in this court from the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact unless he can show that they are clearly erroneous on the record that was before it.
