The alleged illegal conduct of the appellee-defendant officers and directors of the named corporations related to the purchase by the defendants of the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s stock in the defendant corporations by impermissible means. Such conduct, if it occurred as alleged, is not a violation of the federal statute unless the defendants \u201cdirectly or indirectly * * * us[ed] * * * any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails * * * in connection with the purchase * * * of any security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">It is not contended that the mails were used. There was no interstate negotiation or purchase of the plaintiff\u2019s stock. We conclude that there was also no use of an \u201cinstrumentality of interstate commerce\u201d within the contemplation of the statute by reason of two local telephone calls to the companies\u2019 counsel who was also an assistant secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">All of the facts are undisputed in affidavits or depositions. There was, therefore, no issue to be tried touching on the federal question. The court, therefore, was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">However, the complaint may have asserted a valid cause of action under state law. The defendants made no effort to support their motion for summary judgment by affidavits negating the allegations of wrong doing. Lest the entry of summary judgment for the defendants be considered as a judgment on the merits of any possible state claim, therefore, we remand the case to the trial court to modify its judgment in such manner as will prevent any prejudice to such right as the plaintiff may have in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">Judgment affirmed in part. Reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
