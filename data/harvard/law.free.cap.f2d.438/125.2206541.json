BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b183-24\">The Florida question in this diversity case is whether the applicable statute of limitations in a products liability case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the three-year statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for contract cases or is the four-year period for those cases not otherwise \u201cspecifically provided for\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The District Judge apparently reasoned that Florida concepts of strict liability in consumer cases are related to warranties \u2014 normally a branch of contracts \u2014 and held for the three-year period (note 1, <em>supra) </em>as is required in a \u201ccontract case.\u201d We reverse because we are Sne-bound by a Florida case that now carries the full voice of the Florida Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The facts can be severely capsulated. In November 1965 Appellant purchased a new Lincoln-Continental automobile from Wade Motors, Inc., a Ford Motor Company dealer in Westfield, New Jersey. Appellant proceeded to drive from New Jersey to Kentucky to Bradenton, Florida. Both before and during the trip Appellant complained that an odor, which laboratory tests later showed to be gasoline, was coming into the passenger compartment of the car causing Appellant and her child sickness and nausea. In February 1966 she discontinued use of the car and shortly thereafter returned the vehicle to a dealer. This suit was not filed until January 1969 more than three but less than four years after Appellant had first experienced the odor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">In Barfield v. United States Rubber Company, Fla.Dist.Ct. of App.1970, 234 So.2d 374, an intermediate appellate Court of Florida held that a cause of action by the ultimate consumer against a manufacturer with whom the consumer has no privity was not the kind of obligation toward which the \u201ccontract\u201d statute (note 1, <em>supra) </em>was directed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In September 1970 the Supreme Court of Florida denied certiorari in <em>Barfield. </em>239 So.2d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">Unlike a denial of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, such a denial by the Supreme Court of Florida is the equivalent of that Court\u2019s affirming the merits of the decision below. See United States v. Seckinger, 5 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 146, 150, note 10, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 1970, 397 U.S. 203, 90 S.Ct. 880, 25 L.Ed.2d 224; Miami Parts and Spring, Inc. v. Champion Spark Plug Co., 5 Cir., 1966, 364 F.2d 957, 965-67, and the Florida cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">That is the answer for us as it must be for the District Court, whose divination of Florida law turned out to be wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\">. Fla.Stat. Section 95.11(5) (e), 1967, F.S.A. reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cActions other than those for recovery of real property can only be commenced as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">* Sjt * ijt 5k</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201c(5) <em>Within three </em>years.\u2014 * * * (e) And an action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing, including an action for goods, wares and merchandise sold and delivered, and on store accounts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-12\">. Fla.Stat. Section 95.11(4), 1967, F.S.A. reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">\u201c(4) <em>Within four yews. </em>\u2014 Any action for relief not specifically provided for in this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-14\">. Because of our disposition we need not pass upon Appellant\u2019s alternative contention that even if the three-year statute of limitations is found to be applicable, then the suit is still not barred because she did not have knowledge of the defect until a time less than three years from the date of the filing of the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-22\">. The District Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201cthere is no direct controlling precedent.\u201d 234 So.2d at 376. Appellee challenges this by saying that Creviston v. General Motors Corp., Fla.1969, 225 So.2d 331, a warranty suit by a consumer against a non-seller-manufacturer, intimates that the three-year statute is the one to use in such an instance. But <em>Creviston </em>is concerned not with what limitation to use but only with when the limitation begins to run. <em>Creviston </em>adopted the three year statute only as an <em>arguendo </em>assumption for purposes of deciding if the statute had started to run on the date of the sale or on the date when the defect reasonably should have been discovered. 225 So.2d at 332, n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
