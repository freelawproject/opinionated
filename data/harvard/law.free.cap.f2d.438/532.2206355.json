See Rule 8(d), Revised Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (1970). Additionally, the appellee has filed a motion to affirm with supporting suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Pursuant to Rule 43(c), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, R. J. Gaffney, Warden, the successor to Warden Sherman H. Crouse, has been substituted as the proper appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We have now carefully reviewed the files and record in this case and are thoroughly convinced that the judgment of the district court is correct. Concluding that there is no need for further argument on the unsubstantial questions presented, the motion to affirm is granted for the reasons stated by the district court in 322 F.Supp. 1328 (D.C.Kan. 1970). See No. 260-70, Gafford v. Warden, United States Penitentiary, etc., et al., 434 F.2d 318 (10th Cir., November 16, 1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
