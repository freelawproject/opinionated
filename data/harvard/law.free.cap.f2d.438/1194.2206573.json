This finding, which is amply supported by the record, led the district court to enjoin as a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment the conduct of religious exercises pursuant to the school board motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-19\">A state-initiated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> program of religious observance in the public schools constitutes a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment. School District of Abington Twp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963). Neither the fact that participation by students in the program is \u201cvoluntary,\u201d nor the fact that the program may be denominationally neutral, is of constitutional moment when the establishment clause is involved. Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 430, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962). Nor can this program be considered \u201cstudy of the Bible or of religion, * * presented objectively as part of a secular program of education,\u201d which <em>Schema </em>suggests might be conducted consistently with the prohibitions of the first amendment. 374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>On the contrary, since a program of Bible reading alone is unconstitutional under <em>Schempp, </em>it must follow that the religious program in this case, which involved Bible reading and prayer as well, must also be unconstitutional. <em>See </em>Chamberlin v. Dade County, Board of Public Instruction, 377 U.S. 402, 84 S.Ct. 1272, 12 L.Ed.2d 407 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Accordingly, the December 18, 1969, order of the district court declaring this practice unconstitutional and enjoining its continuance will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">. Action of school authorities in their official capacities is clearly state action within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment. Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). State action that initiates a pattern of conduct is the equivalent for fourteenth amendment purposes of state action that mandates a pattern of conduct. <em>See </em>Developments in the Law\u2014Academic Freedom, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 1045, 1056-58 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
