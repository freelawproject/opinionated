Finding no constitutional violation of appellants\u2019 rights in the action taken by the Board, we deny the requested injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">By Board resolution and letter of 12 October 1970 to counsel for appellants the Board denied the application of the appellants to rent the Armory, stating as reasons therefor: <em>First, </em>the Armory by statute is operated primarily to provide facilities for the National Guard;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>\u201cthat recent experience indicates that any convergence of numbers of people in the Nation\u2019s Capital for the purpose of fostering and/or furthering various causes is, unfortunately, attended with the possibility for the need of the National Guard\u2019s support of local authorities in the event of emergency\u201d ; and, <em>Third, </em>that \u201cthe renting of the Armory for the requested purpose could interfere with the Guard\u2019s ability to respond in accordance with its statutory duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">In the District Court hearing, evidence of the \u201crecent experience\u201d of the Board and the Guard was introduced by way of an affidavit from the Commanding General of the Guard, who is also a member of the Board. There was a substantial showing that the use by any outside organization of any portion of the Armory at the time the Guard is called upon to act in maintaining public order would interfere with the functioning of the Guard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It appears obvious that if the mobilization, operation, logistical support, and command direction of the D.C. Guard have been hampered by the use of the Armory at the same time by such organizations as the International Horse Show and the Rod and Custom (Auto) Show, then such Guard use would be even more hampered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>presence in the Armory of a group of 8,500 or more convention delegates, which group itself would be the center of attraction, the vortex of any civil disturbance which might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">This is not to say that the Revolutionary Committee for A People\u2019s Constitution delegates themselves would initiate any civil disturbance. Indeed, the very holding of a convention to draft a revised constitution is in itself an implicit acceptance of the rule of law and renunciation of extra-legal methods. But, as the District Court put it, \u201cThe argument is if the Black Panthers are here, there will be trouble in Washington; not that they won\u2019t be peaceful, but somebody else may not.\u201d Quite honestly on oral argument, counsel for appellants recognized that the authorities responsible for public order would mobilize the Guard as a precautionary measure when the Black Panthers and their allied organizations come to town to hold their constitutional convention, and that this would not be an unreasonable precaution, since the Black Panthers are a \u201ccontroversial\u201d organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Counsel for appellants also candidly agreed that the Armory building was in itself a unique building, in that it was the place at which the Guard stored its weapons and equipment, mobilized, and was organized and deployed for its mission. .It is of course much more than the initial departure point for the Guard. It is the logistical support center, the command post, the nucleus of the Guard\u2019s activities when on active duty. Unrestricted access and communications, and a safe base from which the Guard can operate, are essential to the efficient performance of the Guard\u2019s mission in preventing or quelling civil disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">These factors being anticipated, <em>i, e., </em>the mobilization of the Guard and its direction from the Armory, the Revolutionary Committee\u2019s convention inevitably being at the vortex of any civil disturbance which might arise, appellants\u2019 argument that they are being deprived of their constitutional right to free speech and assembly and to equal protection of the laws can be evaluated in its proper light. Appellants say the only building in the District of Columbia which will suffice for their constitutional convention is the National Guard Armory. It so happens that by Act of Congress this is the building in the District of Columbia which is the mobilization point, headquarters, logistical support, and command center for the District of Columbia National Guard. And it so happens that Congress has said, not surprisingly, that the use of the Armory by the National Guard is its primary purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, at 47-48, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d 149, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">The State, no less than private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated. For this reason there is no merit to the petitioners\u2019 argument that they had a constitutional right to stay on the property, . over the jail custodian\u2019s objections, because this \u201carea chosen for the peaceful civil rights demonstration was not only \u2018reasonable\u2019 but also particularly appropriate * * Such an argument has as its major unarticulated premise the assumption that people who want to propagandize protests or views have a constitutional right to do so whenever and however and wherever they please. That concept of constitutional law was vigorously and forthrightly rejected in two of the cases petitioners rely on. Cox v. Louisiana, <em>supra, </em>[379 U.S. 536] at 554-555, 563-564 [85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471], We reject it again. The United States Constitution does not forbid a State to control the use of its property for its own lawful non-discriminatory purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Here, as in <em>Adderley, supra, </em>at 47, 87 S. Ct. at 247, the record does not support a conclusion that the use of the building was being denied because the Armory Board sought to stifle the objective of the meeting, but rather the Board was carrying out its statutory duty to see that the Armory be available for use for its primary purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We do not think the Armory Board\u2019s action discriminatory. It is true that the Board has rented the Armory to other large groups, but not to a group which everyone agrees is highly likely to become the focal point of disturbance and reasonably to require the mobilization of the Guard. It is also true that part of the Armory has been rented to other groups at a time when the Guard was mobilized, but the experience of the Guard shows that this was a mistake, that it hampered the Guard\u2019s operations, and there is no obligation on the Armory Board to repeat past mistakes, particularly when the repetition might be dangerous for the community. We find the Board\u2019s action to be a reasonable exercise of its discretion in conformance with the standards prescribed by the statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Out of the 68.25 square miles of the District of Columbia the appellants have picked the most sensitive 140,000 square feet, <em>i. e., </em>the nerve center of the National Guard\u2019s operations, in which to hold their convention. That convention and those drawn to it admittedly would reasonably cause the mobilization and operation of the Guard for its duration, and would be the focal point of any civil disturbance. It is no denial of free speech and assembly and no denial of equal protection of the laws to hold that appellants must look elsewhere for their convention site.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. 2 D.C.Code \u00a7 1701. <em>\u201cDeclaration of Policy. </em>It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress that the District of Columbia National Guard Armory shall be maintained and operated primarily to provide facilities for the quartering and training of the Militia of the District of Columbia, and, <em>secondarily </em>to provide suitable facilities for major athletic events, conventions, concerts, and such other activities as may be in the interest of the District of Columbia, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">This Act is subordinate to the general federal statute declaring the traditional military policy of the United States to be that the Army National Guard is \u201can integral part of the first line defense of the United States\u201d and that it must be \u201cmaintained and <em>assured at all times.\u201d </em>32 U.S.C. \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Other statutes of the District of Columbia further define the duties of the National Guard with respect to its Armament, Equipment and Supplies, D.C.Code \u00a7 39-501 et seq. These provide that their arms and equipment, insofar as practicable, are the same as furnished to the Regular Army, and that the Guard should be provided, <em>inter alia, </em>with such ordnance and other military stores as may be necessary for the proper performance of its statutory duties. \u00a7 39-501. An armory is required to be furnished, as \u201callowed and directed by the Commanding General\u201d and such facilities \u201cas may be necessary for the care, preservation, and safekeeping of the arms, equipment * * * and other militia property in their possession.\u201d \u00a7 39-514.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-16\">.
