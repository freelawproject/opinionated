Of approximately 106 eligible voters, 52 voted for and 43 voted against the Union. Shortly thereafter the Company filed timely objections to the Union\u2019s conduct which it claimed affected the outcome of the election. In summary, the Company asserted:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">1. The Union through its agents committed acts of coercion and made threats against Offenhauser Company employees for the purpose of influencing votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">2. The Union grossly misrepresented the Company\u2019s recent profits and ability to provide higher wages and benefits for its employees for the purpose of influencing votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">3. The Union slandered and falsely discredited Wall Street Journal reports regarding union activities which were posted by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">4. At its last meeting prior to the election, the Union through its agents stated that a perfectly legitimate message contained in a Company paper was illegal and that if the Company won the election the Union would have the election reversed based on the language contained in said letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">5. The Union, falsely and for the wrongful purpose of influencing votes, made a statement in its final letter to the employees that \u201call of the employees in your shop\u201d can attend a special meeting and vote on whether or not a strike vote will be called and that two-thirds of such employees would determine whether a strike would be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">6. The Union appointed an observer in the election and allowed him to vote (unknown to the Company) although he had quit and taken full-time employment at another company.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">7. The Union influenced votes by promising and giving payment for Union Support in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-18\">On October 30, 1968, the Regional Director ordered that a hearing be held on the objections before a hearing officer, and on November 14, 1968, a hearing was held. On December 16, 1968, the hearing officer issued his report recommending that all of the Company\u2019s objections be overruled. The Board subsequently adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations, and on March 3, 1969, entered the appropriate certificate of representation. On June 13, 1969, the unfair labor practice charge was filed, and the General Counsel moved for summary judgment on October 10, 1969. After the filing of opposing briefs the Board entered its summary order on December 16, 1969, finding the Company guilty of an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-19\"> Without discussing each of the Company\u2019s objections, we find substantial support in the record for the Board\u2019s finding that the Company has not shown sufficient evidence to require the setting aside of the election. Since we find that the Board properly certified the Union, and since the Company\u2019s sole reason for refusal to bargain was that the Board\u2019s certification of the Union is invalid, it follows that refusal to bargain was a violation of Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-20\">The Company also claims that the Board improperly invoked summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>judgment procedures in finding an unfair labor practice and erred in refusing to allow the Company a hearing for the presentation of alleged newly-discovered evidence. Review of the \u201cnewly-discovered evidence\u201d demonstrates that it constituted no more than an effort to reargue those matters raised in the Company\u2019s objection No. 5 above. Furthermore, where the refusal to bargain is based on the alleged invalidity of the representation certificate, a single trial of the issue of representation is likewise dispositive of the charge of an unfair labor practice for refusal to bargain.
