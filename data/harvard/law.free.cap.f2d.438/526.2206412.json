On October 6, 1969, appellant was additionally indicted for committing perjury before a federal grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1621. The indictments were subsequently consolidated, and appellant was tried before a jury. Upon a verdict of guilty on all charges, appellant was sentenced to a total term of ten years, from which conviction she now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-23\">Appellant lodges a broadside attack against the fairness of her trial. Specifically, appellant argues that there was error in (1) the admission of certain hearsay statements by Government witnesses, (2) the admission of the details of a perjury indictment pending against one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, (3) the admission of a summary of evidence by the Government\u2019s expert accounting witness, (4) the statements of the prosecutor in his summation to the jury, and (5) the admission of the testimony of the Government\u2019s handwriting expert, whose opinion, appellant alleges, was based on \u201cknown handwriting exemplars\u201d for which a proper qualifying predicate had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-24\">We have carefully examined each of appellant\u2019s allegations of error and find them all without merit. The judgment of conviction is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b584-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
