Lampman v. United States District Court, 418 F.2d 215 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 919, 90 S.Ct. 926, 25 L.Ed.2d 100 (1970). That the federal grand jury had authority to issue the subpoena, Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966); Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960), and had power to enforce a compliance with the requirements of the subpoena by an appropriate order, is well settled. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940). The contention that the claim of privilege enjoys a special status in considering a petition for an extraordinary writ has been expressly rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>by the United States Supreme Court in Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967). By undertaking to decide the issue of whether the material subpoenaed by the grand jury was privileged, the district court was acting within its jurisdiction and was not engaged in a \u201cusurpation of power\u201d, as that phrase is used in <em>Will.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Continental Oil Co. v. United States, 330 F.2d 347 (9th Cir. 1964), upon which petitioner relies, cannot be reconciled with Will v. United States, <em>supra,, </em>the case which controls our decision. The panel in Lampman v. United States District Court, <em>supra, </em>418 F.2d p. 217, another case upon which petitioner relies, found it unnecessary to inquire into the impact of <em>Will </em>on <em>Continental.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
