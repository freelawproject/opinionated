O\u2019Neill, petitioner-appellant, currently confined in the Federal Correctional Institution at Sandstone, Minnesota, commenced this proceeding for relief under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. In a carefully considered opinion published as O\u2019Neill v. United States, D.C.Minn., 1970, 315 F.Supp. 1352, Chief Judge Devitt found that the records and files in this case were sufficient from which to determine that the petition for relief was without merit and accordingly an evidentiary hearing was not necessary. We agree. This case is in all things affirmed on the basis of Judge Devitt\u2019s opinion as published.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
