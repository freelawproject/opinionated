While Santiny was attempting to free a mooring line of the LENA C his legs became caught in the line hurtling him overboard. Interrogatories were submitted to the jury as to whether the employer was negligent and whether the vessel was unseaworthy. The jury\u2019s verdict was negative in response to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-24\">Santiny importunes us to construe the summary disposition of Mascuilli v. United States, 1967, 387 U.S. 237, 87 S.Ct. 1705, 18 L.Ed.2d 743, as holding that operational negligence occurring simultaneously with an injury renders a vessel unseaworthy. We need not further explicate this court\u2019s unabashed rejection of appellant\u2019s reading of <em>Mascuilli, </em>Reed v. M/V Foylebank, 5 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 838; Duncan v. Transeastern Shipping Corp., 5 Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 1023; Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service of Texas, Inc., 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 1011, since the Supreme Court has recently and unequivocally adopted a like position. Usner v. Luckenbach, 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562 (January 25, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-25\">Appellant further argues that even if the court\u2019s charge concerning unseaworthiness was correct, the case should still be remanded for a new trial because the charge concerning negligence was defective. We have carefully read the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>court\u2019s charge and find its words to the jury regarding the issue of negligence as distinguished from unseaworthiness both luminous and correct. The decision of the court below is</p>\n<p id=\"ArK\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
