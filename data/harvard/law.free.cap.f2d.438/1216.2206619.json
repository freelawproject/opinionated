Strieker was not \u201caway from home\u201d within the meaning of Section 162(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162(a) (2). The Tax Court conducted a hearing and thereafter, in an opinion reported at 54 T.C. 355, sustained the deficiency as assessed by the Commissioner. Appellants assert that the Commissioner and the Tax Court erred in its determination that Mr. Strieker was not \u201caway from home\u201d for the first six months of the year in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-20\">Upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, the record in the case and the decision of the Tax Court, we conclude that the findings of fact of the Tax Court are sustained by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous and that the controlling law was correctly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-21\">It is therefore ordered that the decision of the Tax Court be, and it hereby is, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
