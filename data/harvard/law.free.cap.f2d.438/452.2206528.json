M\u00e1rchese received concurrent sentences of five years on the conspiracy and ten on the substantive count; Cuomo received consecutive sentences of five years on the conspiracy and three on the substantive count.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">The Government\u2019s principal witness was Irwin Ploss, a certified public accountant. In October 1969, Cuomo, whom Ploss had known for over a year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>asked whether Ploss knew of any procedures for protecting the \u201canonymity\u201d of the owner in the negotiation or pledge of two or three million dollars of Treasury bills. Ploss told him \u201cthere were places where that was a perfectly normal and legitimate thing and that could be done probably in Europe.\u201d During the first week of November, Cuomo turned up at Ploss\u2019 apartment with a photocopy of a $1,000,000 Treasury bill and asked if Ploss would be interested in negotiating it in a manner that would protect the desired anonymity. Ploss responded he would first have to take it to a bank to verify that it was not on a list of lost or stolen securities and not counterfeit. On November 10 Cuomo returned, learned that the result of the inquiry had been favorable, and asked whether Ploss \u201cwas ready to go to Europe, whatever was necessary, to go to convert the note, negotiate it or use it as collateral.\u201d Ploss was quite ready \u2014 for a fee of half the difference between $500,000 and the net proceeds after expenses. About a week later, Cuomo delivered the Treasury bill, which in fact had been stolen from the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company prior to October 21, to Ploss who mailed it to a post-office box in Zurich, Switzerland, and flew there that same night. After the bill\u2019s arrival, Ploss took it to Luxembourg where he attempted, without success, to negotiate it at a bank. After returning to Zurich, he was arrested by the Swiss police while boarding a return transatlantic flight with the Treasury bill in his possession and was deported, after a few weeks\u2019 detention in the course of which he was relieved of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Shortly after his return to New York, Ploss received a telephone call from M\u00e1rchese, to whom he had been introduced in 1968 at the same time he had met Cuomo. M\u00e1rchese wanted to come to Ploss\u2019 apartment, then or later, but Ploss put him off. When M\u00e1rchese said he \u201cwas worried about the money\u201d and Ploss declined to discuss the matter, M\u00e1rchese said, \u201cWell, then, call Sal.\u201d Ploss explained at trial that he understood this to mean Salvatore Cuomo. Although Cuomo was represented at trial by separate counsel, no objection to the remark was made on Cuomo\u2019s behalf, nor was there any request for a limiting instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 6, 1970, Ploss met M\u00e1rchese in front of the former\u2019s apartment building. M\u00e1rchese said that his life was in danger, that he had been asked to pay $250,000, and that he wanted Ploss to give back the money. Remarking that M\u00e1rchese must be \u201ccrazy,\u201d Ploss asked whether his interrogator hadn\u2019t heard that he had been arrested and that the note was a stolen one. When M\u00e1rchese expressed scepti-cism about the arrest, Ploss produced letters and a telegram he had sent his family from Switzerland. There was evidence about other peculiar dealings and the possible involvement of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>rather shadowy figures who were named as co-conspirators in the bill of particulars although not in the indictment, but what we have summarized is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"> The principal claim on appeal is insufficiency of the evidence. It is urged with respect to M\u00e1rchese that the criminal transportation was completed long before the date of the first piece of evidence connecting him with the conspiracy. But the telephone call to and the street conversation with Ploss afforded ample basis for the jury\u2019s drawing the inference that M\u00e1rchese had been in the conspiracy with Cuomo from the beginning \u2014 indeed that it was he who had obtained the Treasury bill from the thieves and was being prodded by them for payment. That being so, Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646-648, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), allowed the jury to convict him for the substantive offense as well. Cuomo\u2019s claim of insufficiency of evidence on the substantive charge borders on the frivolous. So far as concerns the conspiracy count, whatever the case concerning sufficiency of the evidence might have been if objection had been made to the admission, as against Cuomo, of Marchese\u2019s telephone remark, see fn. 1, as to which we express no opinion, none was made either at trial or even on appeal, and we are surely not disposed to invoke the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, F.R.Cr.P. 52(b), in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Much is sought to be made of the fact that, immediately before counsel began their summations, the judge informed the jury that sometimes lawyers tried to tell the jury what the law was, that this was the function of the court, that the jury was bound to accept the judge\u2019s instructions on the law, and that our legal system provides a method of correcting any errors in such instructions that the judge might make. We perceive no error in this statement. Although the jury has \u201cpower to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law and facts,\u201d Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U.S. 135, 138, 41 S.Ct. 53, 65 L.Ed. 185 (1920), it is surely not wrong for the court to urge them not to do so. If a judge thinks he can reduce the chance that the jury will usurp the court\u2019s function by telling them of the means available for correction of error in the instructions, that is a permissible choice. We do not find at all persuasive the suggestion that Judge Motley\u2019s statement as to the reviewability of her instructions could have led the jurors to take their task of fact determination lightly, particularly in light of her instruction that \u201c[t]he most important part of this case is the part which you now as jurors are about to play because it is for you and you alone to decide whether these defendants are guilty or not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Two further points are mentioned. The first is the judge\u2019s having allowed the Government to excise the first two pages of a five page statement given by Ploss to the Swiss authorities on his arrest. While this material would doubtless have added spice to the cross-examination, there is not the slightest chance that it could have affected the result. The second is a claimed inadequacy in the instructions as to <em>mens rea </em>and conspiracy. Since the court made clear to the jury that they could not convict without finding the defendants\u2019 actions to have been knowing and wilful and that conspiracy required a finding that there was an agreement between the two defendants to engage in such actions, the instructions were entirely adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-4\">. In making this comment, we are not to be understood as implying that Cuomo would necessarily have been entitled to favorable action. The argument that he was would be founded on the fact that while the statement could well be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus within that hearsay exception, up to this point there had been no sufficient evidence \u2014 indeed none except the knowledge displayed in the same conversation \u2014that M\u00e1rchese had conspired with Cuomo. Admissibility of the statement against Cuomo would thus have had to rest on the view that the rdmark \u201cWell, then, call Sal,\u201d was a \u201cverbal act,\u201d admissible as circumstantial .rather than testimonial evidence and thus not within the hearsay rule at all. <em>Yet </em>the jury was doubtless expected to take the remark as a declaration by M\u00e1rchese that he and Cuomo were working together, and this, along with the statement by M\u00e1rchese discussed below, was essential to the conspiracy conviction, since the conspiracy count was submitted on the basis that the jury, in order to convict, must find an agreement between M\u00e1rchese and Cuomo, the only persons named as conspirators in the indictment. For a discussion of the problem that can be created by pressing the \u201ccircumstantial evidence'\u201d principle too hard, see United States v. Bennett, 409 F.2d 888, 895 n. 6 (2 Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., Haywood v. United States and Jessup v. United States, 396 U.S. 852, 90 S.Ct. 113, 117, 24 L.Ed.2d 101 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
