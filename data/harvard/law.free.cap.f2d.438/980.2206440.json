This same check had been endorsed by Elnora Narwood a few days earlier in the presence of a local merchant who cashed the check for her. The merchant also endorsed the check, but his endorsement was scratched out after the check was stolen from him as he was on his way to deposit it in a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">The appellant argues that at the time she cashed the check in question she was not guilty of passing an instrument which was a debt of the United States since the payee had theretofore negotiated the check and received cash for it; or, even if the check still evidenced a debt of the United States, she could not be guilty of personation since the payee was not a holder of the instrument at the time appellant cashed the check. However, we hold that, by falsely representing herself to be the person entitled to payment under the instrument, appellant was guilty within the congressional intendment of the provisions of 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">Accordingly, we find oral argument unnecessary and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
