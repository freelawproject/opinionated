These lubricants contain approximately 80-85% mineral oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Appellant advances several contentions here, all of which were raised before the board and, in our opinion, correctly decided by the board. We find it necessary to discuss only one of these contentions, i. e., that the goods involved are of such different character and move in such different channels of trade that confusion is unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">Appellant points out that appellee has used its marks only on steering-gear lubricants, which it sold in fluid form in quart, gallon and five-gallon cans, and in grease form in 10, 25 and 120-pound cans and in drums up to 450 pounds. Appellant\u2019s oil, sold in 3-ounce, 1-pint and 1-quart containers, has more general uses. The record reveals that appellant\u2019s BEAR oil is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-19\">recommended for use in the home, office, factory and institutions, for sharpening operations including all BEAR Brand Stones, MULTI-OIL-STONES and MICROTOME Sharpeners. Also preferred for lubricating hinged or moving parts of hand tools, locks, casters, power tools, mechanical and electrical appliances, sewing machines, sport gear and toys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-20\">The \u2022 description of goods in appellant\u2019s applications is equally broad: \u201cMineral oil, namely, a general-purpose lubricating and sharpening oil.\u201d In view of such a broad description of goods and uses, we cannot attach much significance to the fact that the parties\u2019 goods have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>thus far moved in different channels of trade. In an age of rapidly advancing technology, it would not be unlikely for a new use to develop for appellant\u2019s oil, in automobiles, for example. Even today a given automobile requires many widely different lubricants to keep it in good working order. Certainly any use of appellant\u2019s marks on lubricants destined for automotive use would be likely, in view of appellee\u2019s marks, to cause confusion as to source. Further, there is the possibility that either party might change the exact composition of its lubricant and hence be brought into competition with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">While it is true, as argued by appellant, that mere possibility of confusion will not under the law prevent registration, our consideration of all the circumstances of this case leads us to the conclusion that the board did not err in finding that confusion would be likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-21\">.
