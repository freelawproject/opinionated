The taxes were paid as a result of the Commissioner\u2019s disallowance of deductions for unreim-bursed expenses for meals and lodging, allegedly incurred \u201cwhile away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>home in the pursuit of a trade or business,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a) (2), in 1962 and 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Plaintiff, Robert Rosenspan, was a jewelry salesman who worked on a commission basis, paying his own traveling expenses without reimbursement. In 1962 he was employed by one and in 1964 by two New York City jewelry manufacturers. For some 300 days a year he traveled by automobile through an extensive sales territory in the Middle West, where he would stay at hotels and motels and eat at restaurants. Five or six times a year he would return to New York and spend several days at his employers\u2019 offices. There he would perform a variety of services essential to his work \u2014 cleaning up his sample case, checking orders, discussing customers\u2019 credit problems, recommending changes in stock, attending annual staff meetings, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Rosenspan had grown in Brooklyn and during his marriage had maintained a family home there. After his wife\u2019s death in 1948, he abandoned this. From that time through the tax years in question he used his brother\u2019s Brooklyn home as a personal residential address, keeping some clothing and other belongings there, and registering, voting, and filing his income tax returns from that address. The stipulation of facts states that, on his trips to New York City, \u201cout of a desire not to abuse his welcome at his brother\u2019s home, he stayed more often\u201d at an inn near the John F. Kennedy Airport. It recites also that \u201che generally spent his annual vacations in Brooklyn, where his children resided, and made an effort to return to Brooklyn whenever possible,\u201d but affords no further indication where he stayed on such visits. In 1961 he changed the registration of his automobile from New York to Ohio, giving as his address the address of a cousin in Cincinnati, where he also received mail, in order to obtain cheaper automobile insurance. Rosenspan does not contend that he had a permanent abode or residence in Brooklyn or anywhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The basis for the Commissioner\u2019s dis-allowance of a deduction for Rosen-span\u2019s meals and lodging while in his sales territory was that he had no \u201chome\u201d to be \u201caway from\u201d while traveling. Not denying that this would be true if the language of \u00a7 162(a) (2) were given its ordinary meaning, Rosenspan claimed that for tax purposes his home was his \u201cbusiness headquarters,\u201d to wit, New York City where his employers maintained their offices, and relied upon the Commissioner\u2019s long advocacy of this concept of a \u201ctax home,\u201d see, e. g., G.C.M. 23672, 1943 Cum.Bull. 66-67. The Commissioner responded that although in most circumstances \u201chome\u201d means \u201cbusiness headquarters,\u201d it should be given its natural meaning of a permanent abode or residence for purposes of the problem here presented. Rosenspan says the Commissioner is thus trying to have it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">The provision of the Internal Revenue Code applicable for 1962 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-10\">\u201c \u00a7 162. <em>Trade or business expenses.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-11\">(a) In general. \u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-13\">(2) traveling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqIA\">* * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">For 1964 the statute remained the same except for the interpolation in the parenthesis after \u201clodging\u201d of the words \u201cother than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances\u201d\u2014 a change not relevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">What is now \u00a7 162(a) (2) was brought into the tax structure by \u00a7 214 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 239. Prior to that date, \u00a7 214 had permitted the deduction of \u201cordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred * * * in carrying on any trade or business,\u201d Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1066 (1918), with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>out further specification. In a regulation, the Treasury interpreted the statute to allow deduction of \u201ctraveling expenses, including railroad fares, and meals and lodging <em>in an amount in excess of any expenditures ordinarily required for such purposes when at home,\u201d </em>T.D. 3101, amending Article 292 of Regulations 45, 3 Cum.Bull. 191 (1920) (emphasis supplied). A formula was provided for determining what expenditures were thus \u201cordinarily required\u201d; the taxpayer was to compute such items as rent, grocery bills, light, etc. and servant hire for the periods when he was away from home, and divide this by the number of members of his family. Mim. 2688, 4 Cum.Bull. 209-11 (1921). The puzzlement of the man without a home was dealt with in a cryptic pronouncement, O.D. 905, 4 Cum.Bull. 212 (1921):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-4\">Living expenses paid by a single taxpayer who has no home and is continuously employed on the road may not be deducted in computing net income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The 1921 amendment, inserting what is now \u00a7 162(a) (2)\u2019s allowance of a deduction for the entire amount of qualified meals and lodging, stemmed from a request of the Treasury based on the difficulty of administering the \u201cexcess\u201d provision of its regulation. See United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 301, 88 S.Ct. . 445, 19 L.Ed.2d 537 n. 6 (1967). While the taxpayer cites statements of legislators in the 1921 Congress that the amendment would provide \u201ca measure of justice\u201d to commercial travelers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is nothing to indicate that the members making or hearing these remarks were thinking of the unusual situation of the traveler without a home. There is likewise nothing to indicate that the Treasury sought, or that Congress meant to require, any change in the ruling that disallowed deductions for living expenses in such a case. The objective was to eliminate the need for computing the expenses \u201cordinarily required\u201d at home by a taxpayer who had one, and the words used were appropriate to that end. If we were to make the unlikely assumption that the problem of the homeless commercial traveler ever entered the legislators\u2019 minds, the language they adopted was singularly inept to resolve it in the way for which plaintiff contends. Thus, if the literal words of the statute were decisive, the Government would clearly prevail on the simple ground that a taxpayer cannot be \u201caway from home\u201d unless he has a home from which to be away, cf. Haddleton, Traveling Expenses \u201cAway from Home,\u201d 17 Tax L. Rev. 261, 263, 286 (1962); 49 Va.L.Rev. 125, 126-28 (1963). Although that is our ultimate conclusion, the Supreme Court has wisely admonished that \u201cMore than a dictionary is thus required to understand the provision here involved, and no appeal to the \u2018plain language\u2019 of the section can obviate the need for further statutory construction,\u201d United States v. Correll, <em>supra, </em>389 U.S. at 304 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 448. We turn, therefore, in the first instance to the Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">The initial Supreme Court decision bearing on our problem is C. I. R. v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1946). Flowers, a lawyer, had a \u201chome\u201d in the conventional sense in Jackson, Mississippi, but his principal post of business was at the main office of his employer, the Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad in Mobile, Alabama. Flowers sought to deduct the cost of transportation for his trips to Mobile and the meal and lodging expenses which he incurred in that city. In upholding the Commissioner\u2019s disallowance of these deductions, the Court said that \u201cthree conditions must thus be satisfied before a traveling expense deduction may be made\u201d under what was substantially the present statute, 326 U.S. at 470, 66 S.Ct. at 252. These were:</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">(1) The expense must be a reasonable and necessary traveling expense, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>that term is generally understood. This includes such items as transportation fares and food and lodging expenses incurred while traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">(2) The expense must be incurred \u201cwhile away from home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">(3) The expense must be incurred in pursuit of business. This means that there must be a direct connection between the expenditure and the carrying on of the trade or business of the taxpayer or of his employer. Moreover, such an expenditure must be necessary or appropriate to the development and pursuit of the business or trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">It noted that \u201cThe meaning of the word \u2018home\u2019 * * * with reference to a taxpayer residing in one city and working in another has engendered much difficulty and litigation,\u201d with the Tax Court and the administrative officials having \u201cconsistently defined it as the equivalent of the taxpayer\u2019s place of business\u201d and two courts of appeals having rejected that view and \u201cconfined the term to the taxpayer\u2019s actual residence,\u201d 326 U.S. at 471-472, 66 S.Ct. at 253. The Court found it \u201cunnecessary here to enter into or to decide this conflict,\u201d 326 U.S. at 472, 66 S.Ct. at 253. This was because the Tax Court had properly concluded \u201cthat the necessary relationship between the expenditures and the railroad\u2019s business was lacking.\u201d The railroad\u2019s interest was in having Mr. Flowers at its headquarters in Mobile; it \u201cgained nothing\u201d from his decision to continue living in Jackson, 326 U.S. at 472-474, 66 S.Ct. at 253-254; hence, the third condition the <em>Flowers </em>Court had enunciated as a prerequisite to deductibility was absent. Mr. Justice Rutledge dissented. He did not believe that when Congress used the word \u201chome,\u201d it meant \u201cbusiness headquarters,\u201d and thought the case presented no other question, 326 U.S. at 474, 66 S.Ct. 250. The most that Rosenspan can extract from <em>Flowers </em>is that it did not decide <em>against </em>his contention that the employer\u2019s business headquarters is the employee\u2019s tax home.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">The Court\u2019s next venture into this area was in Peurifoy v. C. I. R., 358 U.S. 59, 79 S.Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed.2d 30 (1958). That case dealt with three construction workers employed at a site in Kinston, North Carolina, for periods of 20%, 12%, and 8% months respectively, who maintained permanent residences elsewhere in the state. The Tax Court had allowed them deductions for board and lodging during the employment at Kin-ston and expenses in regaining their residences when they left, apparently of their own volition and before completion of the project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Fourth Circuit had reversed, C. I. R. v. Peurifoy, 254 F.2d 483 (1957). After having granted cer-tiorari \u201cto consider certain questions as to the application of \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 raised by the course of decisions in the lower courts since our decision in Commissioner v. Flowers [326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203],\u201d 358 U.S. at 59-60, 79 S.Ct. at 105, the Court announced in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion that it had \u201cfound it inappropriate to consider such questions.\u201d It read <em>Flowers </em>as establishing that \u201ca taxpayer is entitled to deduct unreimbursed travel expenses * * * only when they are required by \u2018the exigencies of business,\u2019 \u201d a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d which the majority seemed to feel would mandate disallowance of the deductions under consideration. However, the Court went on to acknowledge an exception to this rule engrafted by the Tax Court, which would have allowed the claimed deductions if the taxpayer\u2019s employment were shown to be \u201ctemporary\u201d rather than \u201cindefinite\u201d or \u201cindeterminate.\u201d Nevertheless, even within this framework, the majority thought that the Court of Appeals had been justified in holding the Tax Court\u2019s finding of temporary employment to be clearly erroneous. Mr. Justice Douglas joined by Justices Black and Whittaker, dissented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Adopting Mr. Justice Rutledge\u2019s position in <em>Flowers, </em>they disagreed \u201cwith the Commissioner\u2019s contention that \u2018home\u2019 is synonymous with the situs of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d While adhering to \u201cthe exigencies of business\u201d test announced in <em>Flowers, </em>they thought this requirement was satisfied by the fact that, in view of the impracticability of construction workers\u2019 moving their homes from job to job, \u201cthe expenses incurred were necessary, not to the business of the contractor for whom the taxpayers worked, but for the taxpayers themselves in order to carry on their chosen trade,\u201d 358 U.S. at 62-63, 79 S.Ct. at 107 n. 6. While the three dissenting Justices thus rejected the Commissioner\u2019s identification of \u201chome\u201d with \u201cthe situs of the employer\u2019s business,\u201d the majority did not adopt it and, so far as our problem is concerned, that matter remained in the state of indecision where <em>Flowers </em>had left it.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">We come finally to C. I. R. v. Stidger, 386 U.S. 287, 87 S.Ct. 1065, 18 L.Ed.2d 53 (1967), where the Court sustained the disallowance of the expense for meals incurred by a Marine Corps captain who had been assigned to a base in Japan, while his wife and children \u2014 prohibited from accompanying him to that post\u2014 remained near his previous duty station in California. After noting that in this case there could be no question of the \u201cdirect connection between the expenditure and the carrying on of the trade or business of the taxpayer or of his employer,\u201d 386 U.S. at 289-90, 87 S.Ct. at 1067, the Court reviewed the continuing disagreement among the circuits over the Commissioner\u2019s view \u201cthat \u2018home\u2019 meant the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of business or employment whether or not it coincided with his place of residence,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and took note of a ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals that members of Congress could not deduct living expenses incurred in Washington, D. C.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of Congress\u2019 response by enacting a special provision making the legislator\u2019s place of residence within the district that he represents his home but limiting the amount of deductible living expenses to $3,000, 66 Stat. 467 (1952), now codified in I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a). However, the Court again found it unnecessary either to approve or to disapprove the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u201chome,\u201d since it found that \u201cin the context of the military taxpayer, the Commissioner\u2019s position has a firmer foundation,\u201d 386 U.S. at 292, 87 S.Ct. at 1069. This built \u201con the terminology employed by the military services to categorize various assignments and tours of duty, and also on the language and policy of the statutory provisions prescribing travel and transportation allowances for military personnel,\u201d <em>id. </em>The Court particularly stressed \u201cthe fact that Congress traditionally has provided a special system of tax-free allowances for military personnel,\u201d 386 U.S. at 294, 87 S.Ct. at 1070. Mr. Justice Douglas, who had written the dissent in <em>Peurifoy, </em>again joined by Justice Black and now by Justice Fortas, dissented. He thought it was \u201cclear that home means residence, with the qualification that a taxpayer should establish his residence as near to his place of employment as is reasonable,\u201d 386 U.S. at 297, 87 S.Ct. at p. 1071.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact that Congress provides special allowances for military personnel did not, in Justice Douglas\u2019 view, call for what he deemed an unnatural reading of \u00a7 162(a) (2) even in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Proper analysis of the problem has been beclouded, and the Government\u2019s position in this case has been made more difficult than it need be, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the Commissioner\u2019s insistence \u201chome\u201d means \u201cbusiness headquarters, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s having thrice declined to endorse this, and its rejection by several courts of appeals, see Flowers v. C. I. R., 148 F.2d 163 (5 Cir. 1945), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1946); United States v. LeBlanc, 278 F.2d 571 (5 Cir. 1960); Burns v. Gray, 287 F.2d 698 (6 Cir. 1961); James v. United States, 308 F.2d 204 (9 Cir. 1962). But cf. C. I. R. v. Mooneyhan, 404 F.2d 522 (6 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 1001, 89 S.Ct. 1593, 22 L.Ed.2d 778 (1969); Wills v. C. I. R., 411 F.2d 537, 540 (9 Cir. 1969). When Congress uses such a non-technical word in a tax statute, presumably it wants administrators and courts to read it in the way that ordinary people would understand, and not \u201cto draw on some unexpressed spirit outside the bounds of the normal meaning of words,\u201d Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Prods., Inc., 322 U.S. 607, 617, 64 5. Ct. 1215, 1221, 88 L.Ed. 1488 (1944). The construction which the Commissioner has long advocated not only violates this principle but is unnecessary for the protection of the revenue that he seeks. That purpose is served, without any such distortion of language, by the third condition laid down in <em>Flowers, supra, </em>326 U.S. at 470, 66 S.Ct. at 252, namely, \u201cthat there must be a direct connection between the expenditure and the carrying on of the trade or business of the taxpayer or of his employer\u201d and that \u201csuch that <em>it </em>an expenditure must be necessary or appropriate to the development and pursuit of the business or trade.\u201d These requirements were enough to rule out a deduction for Flowers\u2019 lodging and meals while in Mobile even if he was \u201caway from home\u201d while there. The deduction would not have been available to his fellow workers living in that city who obtained similar amenities in their homes or even in the very restaurants that Flowers patronized, and Flowers was no more compelled by business to be away from his home while in Mobile than were other employees of the railroad who lived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Since the Commissioner\u2019s definition of \u201chome\u201d as \u201cbusiness headquarters\u201d will produce the same result as the third <em>Flowers </em>condition in the overwhelming bulk of cases arising under \u00a7 162(a) (2), courts have often fallen into the habit of referring to it as a ground or an alternate ground of decision, as this court did in O\u2019Toole v. C. I. R., 243 F.2d 302 (1957), see fn. 3. But examination of the string of cases cited by plaintiff as endorsing the \u201cbusiness headquarters\u201d test has revealed almost none, aside from the unique situations involving military personnel considered above, which cannot be explained on the basis that the taxpayer had no permanent residence, or was not away from it, or maintained it in a locale apart from where he regularly worked as a matter of personal choice rather than business necessity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This principle likewise affords a satisfactory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>rationale for the \u201ctemporary\u201d employment cases, see 49 Va.L.Rev., <em>supra, </em>at 162-63. When an assignment is truly temporary, it would be unreasonable to expect the taxpayer to move his home, and the expenses are thus compelled by the \u201cexigencies of business\u201d; when the assignment is \u201cindefinite\u201d or \u201cindeterminate,\u201d the situation is different and, if the taxpayer decides to leave his home where it was, disallowance is appropriate, not because he has acquired a \u201ctax home\u201d in some lodging house or hotel at the worksite but because his failure to move his home was for his personal convenience and not compelled by business necessity. Under the facts here presented, we need not decide whether in the case of a taxpayer who is not self-employed, the \u201cexigencies of business\u201d which compel the traveling expenses away from home refer solely to the business of his employer or to the business of the taxpayer as well. We note only that the latter contention is surely not foreclosed by decisions to date. See Peurifoy v. C.I.R., <em>supra, </em>358 U.S., at 62-63, 79 S.Ct. at 107, n. 6 (Douglas, J., dissenting) ; Rev.Rul. 60-189, 1960-1 Cum.Bull. 60; see generally 49 Va.L.Rev., <em>supra, </em>at 136-45; and Trent v. C. I. R., 291 F.2d 669, and cases cited, especially at 674 (2 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Shifting the thrust of analysis from the search for a fictional \u201ctax home\u201d to a questioning of the business necessity for incurring the expense away from the taxpayer\u2019s permanent residence thus does not upset the basic structure of the decisions which have dealt with this problem. Compare 49 Va.L.Rev., <em>supra, </em>at 162-63, with Haddleton, <em>supra, </em>at 286. It merely adopts an approach that better effectuates the congressional intent in establishing the deduction and thus provides a sounder conceptual framework for analysis while following the ordinary meaning of language. Cf. 19 U.Chi.L.Rev. 534, 545 (1952); 49 Va.L.Rev., <em>supra, </em>at 163. We see no basis whatever for believing that when the 1921 Congress eliminated the requirement for determining the excess of the costs of meals and lodging while on the road over what they would have been at home, it meant to disallow a deduction to someone who had the expense of maintaining a home from which business took him away but possessed no business headquarters. By the same token we find it impossible to read the words \u201caway from home\u201d out of the statute, as Rosenspan, in effect, would have us do and allow a deduction to a taxpayer who had no \u201chome\u201d in the ordinary sense. The limitation reflects congressional recognition of the rational distinction between the taxpayer with a permanent residence \u2014 whose travel costs represent a duplication of expense or at least an incidence of expense which the existence of his permanent residence demonstrates he would not incur absent business compulsion \u2014 and the taxpayer without such a residence. Cf. James v. United States, <em>supra, </em>308 F.2d at 207. We fail to see how Rosenspan\u2019s occasional trips to New York City, assuming for the sake of argument that his \u201cbusiness headquarters\u201d was in New York rather than in his sales territory, differentiate him economically from the homeless traveling salesman without even the modicum of a business headquarters Rosenspan is claimed to have possessed. Yet we approved disallowance of the deduction in such a case many years ago, Duncan v. C. I. R., 17 B.T.A. 1088 (1929), aff\u2019d per curiam, 47 F.2d 1082 (2 Cir. 1931), as the Ninth Circuit has done more recently, James v. United States, <em>supra, </em>308 F.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">It is enough to decide this case that \u201chome\u201d means \u201chome\u201d and Rosenspan had none. He satisfied the first and third conditions of <em>Flowers, supra, </em>326 U.S. at 470, 66 S.Ct. 250, but not, on our reading of the statute, the second. The judgment dismissing the complaint must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">. Representative Hawley, a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, 61 Cong.

Although the opinion lists this circuit as having subscribed to the Commissioner\u2019s definition of \u201chome,\u201d citing O\u2019Toole v. C. I. R., 243 F.2d 302 (2 Cir. 1957), and a sentence in our <em>per curiam </em>opinion does read that way, the facts of <em>O\u2019Toole </em>presented a typical <em>Flowers </em>situation and the <em>ratio decidendi </em>was the same as in that case, namely, that \u201cThe job, not the taxpayer\u2019s pattern of living, must require the traveling expenses,\u201d 243 F.2d at 303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b968-11\">. Lindsay v. C. I. R., 34 B.T.A. 840 (1936). This had long been the Commissioner\u2019s position. O.D. 864, 4 Cum.Bull. 211 (1921).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b968-12\">.

Whether the \u201cpersonal choice\u201d principle has not sometimes been pressed too far is another matter. The case of a Congressman, see fn. 4, may have been one such instance. It is also hard to be completely satisfied with the distinction between Barnhill v. C. I. R., 148 F.2d 913 (4 Cir. 1945), disallowing meals and lodging deductions while in the state capital to justices of the Supreme Court of North Carolina who spent approximately 7 months a year there, but maintained their residences elsewhere, in deference to a custom, that at the time of selection, the justices should be fairly distributed throughout the state, and a decision allowing such a deduction in the case of a justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana who spent 9 months at the Court\u2019s headquarters in New Orleans but who, in contrast to the unwritten North Carolina practice, was required by the state constitution to maintain his residence in his own parish, United States v. LeBlanc, 278 F.2d 571 (5 Cir. 1960). England v. United States, 345 F.2d 414 (7 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 986, 88 S.Ct. 537, 15 L.Ed.2d 475 (1966), is another case in which the \u201cpersonal choice\u201d principle scarcely provides a satisfactory basis of decision if it suffices that the expenses be necessary to the taxpayer-employee\u2019s \u201ctrade or business\u201d as distinguished from his employer\u2019s.
