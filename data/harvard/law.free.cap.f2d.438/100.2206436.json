As both parties in their petitions for reconsideration have pointed out to us, we inadvertently overlooked the civil nature of the contempt proceedings and imposed criminal contempt sanctions. Accordingly, we vacate our order of June 17,1970, and refer the case back to the Special Master, pursuant to Rule 53(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., for a hearing as to Respondent\u2019s financial condition and the consequent seriousness of the burden of any fines upon Respondent. United States v. Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">On the basis of the evidence submitted at this hearing the Special Master shall make recommendations as to the appropriate compliance fines which should be imposed. In addition, the parties shall submit evidence with reference to Petitioner\u2019s costs and expenses, including reporter\u2019s fees, and the salaries and expenses of its personnel, in investigating, preparing and presenting the matters involved in all the proceedings to date (including the hearing ordered herein) and the Special Master shall make findings as to the amount adequate to compensate Petitioner for such costs and expenses.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
