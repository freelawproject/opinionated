The District Court found that the seized firearms were not registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841, ,as amended in 1968, and it further found that the intervenor\u2019s admitted possession of the seized firearms in June, 1969 was proof of the unlawful act of possessing a firearm which is not registered to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>possessor in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), as amended in 1968. Based on such findings, the District Court held that the intervenor-posses-sor\u2019s failure to register the seized weapons during the amnesty period made his continued possession unlawful; and therefore, the firearms seized by the United States are lawfully forfeited to the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The civil forfeiture proceedings in the District Court were tried upon the following stipulated facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">STIPULATION OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">(Filed January 13, 1970)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">That the machineguns in question were acquired by the intervening petitioner while a paratrooper in combat during World War II; that these weapons were shipped by petitioner as authorized by the U. S. Military authorities to petitioner\u2019s parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. Colson McKeehan, at 919 Temple Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, during the spring of 1945 along with other war souvenirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">That the instant machineguns are \u201cfirearms\u201d as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5845 (a) (6) as further defined in 26 U.S.C. 5845(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">That following World War II and while a student in college during 1946 or 1947, petitioner gave possession of these machineguns to a longtime childhood friend, Henry W. Mcllwaine, Jr., then residing with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. H. Whiting Mcllwaine, at 4110 Towanda Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee; that said friend by hobby collected guns; that the understanding between petitioner and his friend was that, should petitioner ever have a gun room in years to come, he could reacquire possession of these three machineguns for such purpose; that said guns remained stored in the home of the parents of petitioner\u2019s friend up until early spring of 1969, the father of petitioner\u2019s friend having died on December 8, 1968, and the family homestead was being vacated during March, 1969; petitioner\u2019s friend, Henry W. Mcllwaine, Jr., and petitioner both had finished college and long since left the residences of their respective parents and, for [fol. 2] practical purposes, had forgotten about the three machineguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">During the moratorium for registering machineguns between November 2 and December 1, 1968, said machineguns were still stored in the residence of H. Whiting Mcllwaine, Sr., at 4110 Towan-da Trail, S. W., Knoxville, Tennessee. Whatever publicity was utilized by the U. S. Government authorities to publicize the moratorium did not serve to bring the machineguns to mind for either petitioner or his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">That petitioner, his friend, and his friend\u2019s father all qualify as law abiding citizens; that these guns could have been legally registered during the amnesty period of November 2, 1968, through December 1, 1968, and that said possession would have been for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">On or about June 16, 1969, petitioner voluntarily made known, delivered and surrendered said machineguns to the U. S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division office in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">That the three machineguns have a fair market value exceeding that given by authorized representatives of the United States Government at the time seizure was declared during August, 1969. That petitioner satisfied the necessary steps to have this matter transferred to this honorable court for judicial review of his rights pertaining to these guns. That shortly following commencement of this forfeiture action by the United States Government, petitioner was indicted, arrested, released under $1,000 bond, arraigned, plead \u201cnot guilty\u201d and scheduled for trial on November 18, 1969. By agreement, the forfeiture matter was to be determined simultaneously with the criminal charge. On November 17, 1969, on its own motion, the United States dismissed with full prejudice its criminal indictment. On November 18, 1969, petitioner appeared with his corroborating witness, Henry W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Mcllwaine, Jr., and, by agreement, this Court [fol. 3] took the matter under advisement on a stipulation of facts, allowing petitioner and the Government time to file briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">On appeal, it is contended that statutory forfeiture proceedings are quasi-criminal actions against the owner of the forfeited items and should not be applied to owners who had no actual notice of the thirty-day amnesty period created by Congress under the 1968 Act Amendments, Pub.L. 90-618 \u00a7 207(b)-(d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and who otherwise have not engaged in criminally culpable nor wilfully negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">It is well established in American jurisprudence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, that absent a contrary legislative expression<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> personal property may be seized and statutorily forfeited without payment of any compensation even though its owner may not have engaged in any conduct which may be characterized criminal or wilfully negligent. Various Items of Personal Property v. United States, 282 U.S. 577, 581, 51 S.Ct. 282, 75 L.Ed. 558 (1931); United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, 272 U.S. 321, 47 S.Ct. 154, 71 L.Ed. 279 (1926); Goldsmith Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 505, 41 S.Ct. 189, 65 L.Ed. 376 (1921); Dobbin\u2019s Distillery v. United States, 96 U.S. 395, 24 L.Ed. 637 (1877); Henderson\u2019s Distilled Spirits, 14 Wallace (81 U.S.) 44, 20 L.Ed. 815 (1871); Palmyra, 12 Wheat. (25 U.S.) 1, 6 L.Ed. 531 (1827).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">This case, however, contains four interesting features which distinguish it from the above-cited precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">First, Appellant merely possessed the seized firearms without any actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>knowledge <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Congress has placed upon all passive possessors of certain firearms a duty to come forward and register their firearms. Pub.L. 90-618 \u00a7 207 (b); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 179.120, 179.190-91 and 179.200-201. And further not only was Appellant without actual notice that he was required to register his firearms for such a passive purpose as possessing personal souvenirs; but also he was not engaging with the firearms in any activity which normally would have placed him on notice as to the statutory registration requirement. Historically, we can find no other case involving the civil forfeiture of chattels in which the allegedly inequitably treated owner had not engaged in some affirmative commercial enterprise, financing, transfer or sale which would have placed him in a position where he either knew or should have known of the existence of the revenue laws regulating his activity. Various Items of Personal Property v. United States, <em>supra </em>(corporate owner of a distillery, warehouse and denaturing plant engaged in production of alcohol); United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, <em>supra </em>(\u201cinnocent\u201d corporate owner who was financing sale of automobile on conditional sales contract); Goldsmith Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, <em>supra </em>(\u201cinnocent\u201d corporate owner who sold automobile on credit and retained title for unpaid purchase money); Dobbin\u2019s Distillery v. United States, <em>supra </em>(owner of a distillery and related property who without personal knowledge of lessee\u2019s misconduct leased his property and suffered it to be occupied and used by lessee); Henderson\u2019s Distilled Spirits, <em>supra </em>(purchaser of distilled spirits at bonded warehouse assumes risk the distilled spirits he purchases and carries away may have been made or used in violation of the Internal Revenue laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Second, Appellant possessed firearms which were lawfully imported under the auspices of the United States Military authorities <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and which Congress has not declared to be contraband <em>per se </em>(e. g. counterfeit coins or securities of the United States) or inherently dangerous to society such that their use was limited to law enforcement officials or for purposes of scientific inquiry (e. g. marijuana, heroin or opium). Quite the contrary, possession of firearms is generally lawful except when such guns are intended to be used or have been used in violation of the National Firearms Act, its Amendments or the regulations issued pursuant thereto. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7302; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 781(b) (2) (1964). Also, the collection of most firearms as \u201cwar souvenirs\u201d or \u201ccurios\u201d is recognized by Congress to be a lawful activity. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(a) (4) (A), 925(d) (2), as amended in 1968; 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 178.11 (c), 178.26. And further the continued possession of the very firearms in question is recognized by Congress to be a lawful activity as long as they are duly registered. Pub.L. 90-618 \u00a7 217 (1968); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 179.120.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">In the instant case, the stipulated facts do not support a conclusion that the Appellant used or intended to use the seized firearms in violation of the law. The' parties have stipulated that the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>lant was a \u201claw abiding citizen\u201d who placed his firearms in a gun collection and possessed them \u2014 actually or constructively \u2014 with the continuing lawful purpose of maintaining valuable \u201csouvenirs\u201d or \u201ccurios\u201d from his wartime experiences. While such stipulations do not, of course, free the Appellant from his registration obligation prior to the National Firearms Act Amendments of 1968, they do strongly suggest that Appellant did not have the requisite <em>mens rea </em>to support a conviction of violating the National Firearms Act by his possession of the seized firearms from 1945 to 1968. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841 (1964). <em>See </em>Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722,19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968) (whereby the Appellant, in any case, may have been able to shield himself from criminal sanctions by invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege). After the enactment of the National Firearms Act Amendment of 1968, the voluntary actions of the Appellant in attempting to register his firearms and the stipulated dismissal of any criminal charges against Appellant is strong evidence that the seized firearms were not involved in a violation of the National Firearms Act which would have subjected them to seizure and forfeiture. Further, this case does not even present the usual allegations in most forfeiture actions under the Internal Revenue laws that excise and penal taxes are due and payable from such prior activity as the manufacture, importation or sale of the confiscated goods. Finally, on the facts in this case, we cannot say that the seized firearms may properly be classified as \u201ccontraband articles\u201d and retained upon that theory. United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 53-54, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951); United States v. One 1965 Buick, 392 F.2d 672 (6th Cir. 1968). See United States v. Black, 431 F.2d 524, 530 (6th Cir. 1970) (dictum: sawed off shotgun received by accused as a result of <em>nontax paid transfer </em>after effective date of National Firearms Act Amendment of 1968 is defined as contraband) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Third, Appellant\u2019s firearms are not in-strumentalities of crime whose seizure and forfeiture is justified by a Con-gressionally declared purpose to make more costly or to limit the access to the means of criminal activity. <em>See e. g., </em>Congressional history of 1950 Amendments to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 781, 782 (1964) in which definition of contraband article as it relates to narcotic drugs, was expanded so that the vehicles, vessels and aircraft \u2014 the \u201cmajor capital investment to criminals\u201d and \u201coperating tools of dope peddlers\u201d \u2014 may be seized and forfeited. 1950 U.S.Code Cong.Service 2953. <em>See also, </em>United States v. Jeffers, <em>supra, </em>342 U.S. at 53-54, 72 S.Ct. 93, United States v. Brig Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210, 11 L.Ed. 239 (owner of a vessel who may not have engaged in any personal misconduct may be deprived of his vessel if it is used in piratical aggression where \u201cthe necessity of the case requiring it as the only adequate means of suppressing the offense or wrong, or of insuring an indemnity to the injured party,\u201d Dobbin\u2019s Distillery v. United States, 96 U.S. at 400).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Fourth, the instant forfeiture cannot be justified on administrative grounds, such as: the recouping of the costs of investigating and enforcing the law, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 401, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938), or collecting an unpaid registration or transfer tax due, United States v. One 1965 Buick, 392 F.2d 672 (6th Cir. 1968). This lack of administrative justification results from the fact that Appellant is not alleged to have engaged in any activity with an intent to defraud the United States of any revenues or to have failed to pay the revenue taxes due, if any, on the manufacture, importation, sale or transfer of the seized firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In summary, the instant forfeiture action depriving Appellant of his personalty without any compensation is distinguishable from prior precedents on, at least four grounds: (1) the inadequacy of notice to the Appellant considering the passive nature of his pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>session, (2) the lawfulness of purpose of Appellant\u2019s interest in possessing the firearms, (3) the lack of any declared legislative policy that forfeiture under the circumstances of this case will aid in enforcing the criminal laws or make the instrumentalities of crime more difficult or costly to obtain and (4) the lack of any sound administrative or revenue purpose to justify the instant forfeiture. Based on these facts, we find the imposition of forfeiture on the Appellant is penal and causes an unconstitutional deprivation of personal property \u201cwithout just compensation.\u201d Fifth Amendment, United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We appreciate, of course, that the instant action is a civil action <em>in rem, </em>against the seized firearms and not a criminal action <em>in personam </em>against the possessor of the firearms. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7323(a). And further, we are aware that chattels are not entitled to constitutional due process. This action, however, is not a typical <em>in rem </em>forfeiture action. The lack of any valid legislative, administrative or revenue purpose for pursuing the item <em>in rem, </em>rather than the person of the possessor, gives us a basis for conceiving of this action for certain constitutional purposes as an action <em>in personam. </em>In so doing, we are not creating a \u201clegal fiction\u201d, but destroying one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are characterizing the facts underlying this action as to their substance. We are following the mandate of the United States Supreme Court when it has repeatedly held that under certain circumstances a possessor of chattels is entitled to the protection of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments when civil forfeiture actions take on a quasi-criminal or penal cast. One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965); United States v. Boyd, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1885).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Lastly, we believe that the dismissal of the criminal charges against Appellant raises a substantial question as to whether the United States is collaterally estop-ped from securing a forfeiture of Appellant\u2019s personalty for its alleged use in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), as amended in 1968.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that this question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>was not argued before this Court on appeal, we shall refrain from considering it at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\">. The regulations promulgated pursuant to Pub.L. 90-618 \u00a7 207(b), permit the Director of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service, Treasury Department, to \u201cestablish periods of amnesty, not to exceed ninety (90) days in the case of any single period with such immunity from liability as the Director determines will contribute to the purposes of this part.\u201d 26 CFR 179.120 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">.

Lands were forfeited at attainder but transfer of title related back to the time of the offense thereby defeating intermediate purchasers. Chattels and goods were forfeited at the time of conviction and there was no relation back to the time of the offense. Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, ed. Thomas M. Cooley, 4th Ed. James DeWitt Andrews (Chicago, 1899), b.ii at 267, 421; b.iv at 381, 387.

For example, in order to work a forfeiture under certain statutes relating to the preservation of game, the owner of the seized goods must be criminally convicted of violating certain provisions of the Conservation Code, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 171 (1964). Also <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 782 (1964) which protects certain innocent owners from statutory forfeitures of their motor vehicles. A similar section, \u00a7 204(b), of the Liquor Law Repeal and Enforcement Act of 1935 provides for judicially supervised remission of forfeitures where the claimant acted in good faith and there is no showing of wilful negligence. Also as noted above, Congress created a discretionary administrative power to remit forfeitures, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7327, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618 (1964). The exercise of the administrator\u2019s discretion, however, is not subject to judicial review. United States v.

One Dodge Sedan, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b804-5\">WEICK, Circuit Judge (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The stipulation of facts states:</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">\u201cOn November 17, 1969, on its motion, the United States dismissed with full prejudice its criminal indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"azv-dedup-0\">In my opinion the dismissal with full prejudice is equivalent to an acquittal of the charge of possession of the unregistered firearms. The Government can no longer prosecute McKeehan for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">On February 4, 1970, the District Court, in its memorandum, entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">\u201cIt is, therefore, ordered that the accused weapons be, and the same hereby are, guilty and forfeited to the United States of America.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">The weapons were not contraband. They were war trophies brought into this country by a soldier, with the permission of the Government. The weapons committed no offense. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) makes it an offense for \u201cany person * * * (d) to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Registration and Transfer Record * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Section 5871 provides a penalty for any person \u201cwho violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter * *</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">Section 5872 provides that \u201cany firearm involved in any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture * *</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">In view of the dismissal of the indictment with full prejudice, which indictment charged violation of Section 5861 (d), it cannot be said that the firearms were involved in a violation of this chapter. Because of such dismissal, the Government ought to be estopped, not only from instituting another criminal charge against McKeehan, but also from forfeiting his property for the same alleged offense. The judgment of dismissal should be conclusive. By forfeiting McKeehan\u2019s property, the Government is still attempting to punish him for possession of the firearms although it has foreclosed itself from prosecuting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-17\">Coffey v. United States, 116 U.S. 436, 6 S.Ct. 437 (1886) sustains the defense of estoppel. There a defendant had been acquitted on criminal charges involving violations of the Internal Revenue laws. Subsequently the Government brought a forfeiture proceeding against the defendant\u2019s property, based on the same violations of the Internal Revenue laws. The Court denied forfeiture. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-18\">\u201cThere could be no new trial of the criminal prosecution after the acquittal in it; and a subsequent trial of the civil suit amounts to substantially the same thing, with a difference only in the consequences following a judgment adverse to the claimant.\u201d 116 U.S. at 443, 6 S.Ct. at 440-441.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-19\">The forfeiture of McKeehan\u2019s property clearly constitutes punishment of him for violation of the statute; but the Government has precluded itself from inflicting such punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-20\"><em>Coffey </em>has been cited as\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-21\">\u201c * * * authority for the proposition that if the present defendants had been proceeded against criminally on account of the same acts and facts that must be shown in order to sustain this action under the statute of 1890, and had been acquitted, the verdict and judgment of acquittal would have bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>red a subsequent civil proceeding, based on the same acts and facts, and instituted to enforce a forfeiture * * United States v. Zucker, 161 U.S. 475, 478-479, 16 S.Ct. 641, 642 (1896).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The Coffey doctrine, however, has been distinguished and limited. Starting with Stone v. United States, 167 U.S. 178, 186-187, 17 S.Ct. 778, 42 L.Ed. 127 (1897), the Court limited <em>Coffey\u2019s </em>application to instances where the second suit, civil in nature, imposed a penalty or penal sanction on the same individual who was previously acquitted of the criminal charge. See, Murphy v. United States, 272 U.S. 630, 632, 47 S.Ct. 218 (1926) where <em>Coffey </em>was held inapplicable because the subsequent civil suit\u2019s purpose was prevention, not punishment. In Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 397, 58 S.Ct. 630, 632 (1938) the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">\u201cThat acquittal on a criminal charge is not a bar to a civil action by the Government, <em>remedial in its nature, </em>arising out of the same facts on which the criminal proceeding was based has long been settled.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">In Johnson v. Wall, 329 F.2d 149, 151 (4th Cir. 1964), the Court stated that the <em>Coffey </em>doctrine\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">\u201c * * * is limited to those situations where the Government seeks to impose a punishment which, though civil in form, is penal in nature and is based upon the same facts as the criminal proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Although Coffey has been much maligned, United States v. Burch, 294 F.2d 1, 4-5 (5th Cir. 1961), the case still has vitality within its subsequent restrictions, and we have no authority to overrule it. United States v. One 1956 Ford Fairlane Tudor Sedan, 272 F.2d 704 (10th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">It would seem that the instant case falls directly within what is left of the <em>Coffey </em>doctrine. There has been a final determination of the criminal charges against McKeehan, in that he cannot be prosecuted again on the charge arising out of these same facts, and this determination is equivalent to finding him not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">The subsequent civil proceeding, in the nature of forfeiture, can be characterized only as an action seeking to impose punishment, or a penal sanction, against Mc-Keehan. The forfeiture proceeding is not remedial in any sense, but is quasi-criminal in nature. One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">Failure of appellant to argue an applicable question of law on appeal does not preclude our consideration of it, where it is fairly presented by the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
