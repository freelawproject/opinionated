We have carefully considered the briefs and the record. There is no merit to any of the appellant\u2019s contentions. We note especially that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant and seize the coffee when the harbor police officer, Captain Allemand, observed the coffee in the rear of the parked truck which had been driven by the defendant. We hold also that the trial court committed no error (1) by allowing the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements to be admitted as evidence; (2) in his charge to the jury as to the inference to be drawn from the possession of recently stolen property; and (3) in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
