Defendant appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>only from the judgment of validity. We reverse because of the exclusion of relevant evidence concerning prior public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">\n<em>The Kardulas invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">A beautician needs rollers of many different sizes to set a coiffure. These rollers must be kept clean and easily accessible. Hair rollers tend to become entangled when placed in a pile; to untangle them requires considerable effort and time. This problem is compounded because beauticians usually have only one hand free. They need a means for keeping hair rollers of differing lengths and diameters in a small space within easy reach so that they are readily identifiable, can be picked up with one hand, and can be replaced without disturbing or displacing other rollers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">The invention claimed in the Kardulas patent relates to an improved holder for hair rollers which includes a base with at least two cylindrical carriers spaced apart, each carrier comprising at least three cylindrical surfaces. The junction of cylindrical surfaces with the base of an adjacent cylindrical surface provides at least two shoulder surfaces, each wide enough to support a hair roller. The holder allows one to visually and readily determine the location of a hair roller of a particular size. During use, the holder maintains the rollers in place, each carrier accommodating coaxially mounted rollers of different sizes. While one hand is preoccupied, a beautician can easily locate and identify hair rollers of varying dimensions and can pick up or replace any particular roller with one hand without displacing other rollers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">Since defendant\u2019s infringement is undisputed, the sole issue on appeal is the validity of the Kardulas patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">Kardulas applied for her patent on July 11, 1963, and it was issued on April 14, 1964. T. <em>R. Snow </em>applied <em>for </em>patent No. 3,221,891 (which completely discloses the Kardulas invention) on June 19, 1963, and it was issued on December 7, 1965. Obviously the Snow application was filed three weeks before the Kardu-las application was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">Defendant attacks the District Court\u2019s finding of the validity of the Kardulas patent on three grounds: First, plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence to carry her invention back beyond the date of her application, and the trial court was therefore required to consider that date, July 11, 1963, as the date of her invention. Consequently the prior application of T. R. Snow on June 19, 1963, was equivalent to a publication describing Kardulas\u2019 device before its invention. Second, there was a prior public use of the patented device by Snow. Third, the Kardulas patent is invalid for lack of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">\n<em>The Snow application and Kardulas\u2019 invention date</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">It is clear that plaintiff invented her device no later than the filing date of her application, since filing constitutes a constructive reduction to practice. James B. Clow &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., 5 Cir. 1963, 313 F.2d 46, 48 n. 1. But unless Kardulas proved an invention date antedating Snow\u2019s filing date, Snow\u2019s application would constitute a prior publication under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102(e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 fully anticipating plaintiff\u2019s invention. Sperry Rand Corp. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 3 Cir. 1962, 307 F.2d 344, 346; Van Der Horst Corp. v. Chromium Corp., 2 Cir. 1952, 197 F.2d 791, 794; <em>see </em>Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville, 1926, 270 U.S. 390, 401-402, 46 S.Ct. 324, 70 L.Ed. 651. Also, it would constitute prior art under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>Hazeltine Research, Inc. v. Brenner, 1965, 382 U.S. 252, 256, 86 S.Ct. 335, 14 L.Ed.2d 304. Thus, the Kardulas patent would be invalid because Kardulas would not be the first inventor. Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville, <em>supra </em>at 400-402, 46 S.Ct. 324; Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Sales Affiliates, Inc., 2 Cir. 1956, 233 F.2d 148, 158, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 879, 77 S.Ct. 101, 1 L.Ed.2d 80. Kardulas was shouldered with the burden of carrying her invention date back beyond Snow\u2019s application date. Rooted Hair, Inc. v. Ideal Toy Corp., 2 Cir. 1964, 329 F.2d 761, 767, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 831, 85 S.Ct. 63, 13 L.Ed.2d 40; Syracuse v. H. Daust Manufacturing Co., 8 Cir. 1960, 280 F.2d 377, 379; Pleatmaster, Inc. v. J. L. Golding Manufacturing Co., 7 Cir. 1957, 240 F.2d 894, 898; Oliver Machinery Co. v. Gellman, 6 Cir. 1939, 104 F.2d 11, 13, cert. denied, 308 U.S. 567, 60 S.Ct. 80, 84 L.Ed. 476. <em>See generally </em>1 A. Deller, Deller\u2019s Walker on Patents \u00a7\u00a7 46, 50 (2d ed. 1964) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The date of invention cannot be carried back to that of the earliest mental conception. There must be a disclosure sufficient to enable one with ordinary skill in the art to reduce the invention to practice. Casco Products Corp. v. Zaiger, D.Mass.1936, 15 F.Supp. 1014, 1016, aff\u2019d, 1 Cir. 1937, 93 F.2d 210. Kardulas testified that she conceived the invention in September 1960 and commissioned Tanguay, a furniture maker, to construct the parts comprising the carriers for the hair roller holder. Before December 1960, Kardulas had affixed these parts to the tray to form the carriers. Finally, between December 1 and December 15, 1960, she showed a model to her attorney, Nedvad, who corroborated her testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The model was properly identified and received in evidence without objection as the model shown to Nedvad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">While it is well settled that the uncorroborated and undocumented testimony of the patentee is insufficient to prove invention date, Rooted Hair, Inc. v. Ideal Toy Corp., <em>supra, </em>329 F.2d at 767; Pleatmaster, Inc. v. J. L. Golding Manufacturing Co., <em>supra, </em>240 F.2d at 898; Thomson Industries, Inc. v. Nippon Thompson Co., E.D.N.Y.1968, 298 F.Supp. 466, 472, we find that the testimony of Kardulas was in this instance sufficiently corroborated to prove invention date, and the model coupled with Nedvad\u2019s identification satisfied the documentation requirement. Furthermore, the model, crude as it may be, clearly provided a sufficient disclosure of the invention to enable one with ordinary skill in the art to reduce it to practice. In fact, the invention embodied in Kardulas\u2019 model was fully reduced to practice in December 1960. The only refinement remaining was to perfect the hair roller holder into a commercially marketable form, and this Kardulas was not required to do. Hildreth v. Mastoras, 1921, 257 U.S. 27, 34, 42 S.Ct. 20, 66 L.Ed. 112; Radio Corp. of America v. International Standard Electric Corp., 3 Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 726, 730; Boucher Inventions, Ltd. v. Sola Electric Co., 1942, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 131 F.2d 225, 226, cert. denied, 1943, 318 U.S. 770, 63 S.Ct. 762, 87 L.Ed. 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">We therefore agree with the trial court that Kardulas met her heavy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>burden of proving that she conceived her invention and reduced it to practice no later than December 1960, which was prior to Snow\u2019s invention date in March or April 1962. In these circumstances the Snow application was not a proper reference and does not constitute a bar to validity under section 102(e), nor does it constitute prior art under section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">\n<em>Section 282 notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The trial court excluded the depositions of Joyce Snow and Daniel Blatz, which were proffered by defendant to show a prior public use under 35 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 102(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s objection to the proffer was that defendant had failed to give the required thirty-day written notice under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 282.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Defendant argues that the requirements of section 282 were substantially complied with, or alternatively, that the trial judge abused his discretion in excluding the depositions since plaintiff\u2019s counsel could not possibly have been surprised or prejudiced by their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">Defendant, in a \u201cNotice of Special Matters of Defense,\u201d filed June 24, 1969, specified as one of its defenses the \u201cprior public use of one T. R. Snow in his business as a beauty shop operator at 125 South Seventh Street, Olean, New York, <em>and others </em>at his procurement, the names and addresses of whom are presently unknown to defendants <em>but will be disclosed by Snow during the taking of his disposition on June 2k, 1968\u201d </em>(emphasis added). During Snow\u2019s deposition taken on the stated date, he testified that he and Joyce Snow had commercially used the \u201cfinished product\u201d in their shop beginning July 2, 1962, and that a beautician salesman, Daniel Blatz, had witnessed the use in the beauty shop in July. The proffered depositions of Joyce Snow and Blatz corroborated T. R. Snow\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiff's counsel attended the taking of all depositions and cross-examined all of defendant\u2019s deponents. All depositions were on file with the District Court by December 23, 1968. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s counsel had written notice of the names and addresses of these witnesses and the purpose of their testimony long before the section 282 deadline.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, plaintiff had the actual testimony of each witness. The trial court\u2019s reliance on Thermo King Corp. v. White\u2019s Trucking Service, Inc., 5 Cir.1961, 292 F.2d 668, to sustain his ruling is misplaced. In <em>Thermo King </em>no written notice of any kind that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>fendant planned to use twenty-four patents to prove invalidity was given before trial. The proffered evidence in <em>Thermo King </em>was clearly inadmissible under section 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Plaintiff correctly maintains that section 282 coexists with the Federal Rules on discovery. <em>Thermo King, supra </em>at 674.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But this is not to say that to comply with the statute, defendant must give plaintiff a self-contained written notice captioned, \u201cNotice Under 35 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 282.\u201d Such a construction of the statute would defeat the purpose of section 282, which was to prevent unfair surprise at trial and to reduce expensive delays. <em>Thermo King, supra </em>at 674; C.S. Johnson Co. v. Stromberg, 9 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 793, 797; cert. denied, 355 U.S. 816, 78 S.Ct. 19, 2 L.Ed.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"agm-dedup-0\">We conclude that the excluded, but proffered, depositions were relevant and material evidence on the issue of a prior public use more than one year before Kardulas filed her patent application. 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102(b). Failure to admit the depositions of Joyce Snow and Daniel Blatz resulted in the clearly erroneous finding that Snow\u2019s testimony concerning prior public use was uncorroborated. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">The trial court also excluded the deposition of Stanley Rosenfeld<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for failure to give an adequate section 282 notice. Rosenfeld\u2019s testimony was offered to show the state of the art in the spring of 1963, just prior to plaintiff\u2019s filing date in July 1963. While the trial court erred in excluding Rosenfeld\u2019s deposition under section 282, the error was harmless since Rosenfeld\u2019s testimony could not shed any light on the state of the art at the time plaintiff invented her hair, roller holder in December 1960. Therefore Rosenfeld\u2019s testimony is irrelevant. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101-103.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">\n<em>Prior Public Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\"> Underlying the public bar provision in 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102(b) is the public policy to prevent an inventor from failing to disclose his invention to the public, while at the same time commercially exploiting it, thereby extending the effective duration of his patent monopoly. Koehring Co. v. National Automatic Tool Co., 7 Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 100, 103. The courts have generally construed the term \u201cpublic use\u201d broadly. The Sixth Circuit, for example, has said that, generally, any nonsecret use of a completed and operative invention in its \u201cnatural and intended way\u201d is a public use. FMC Corp. v. F. E. Myers &amp; Bro. Co., 6 Cir. 1967, 384 F.2d 4, 9, cert. denied, 390 U.S. 988, 88 S.Ct. 1183, 19 L.Ed.2d 1291.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The use may be public where it is exposed to persons other than the inventor, including customers and salesmen, who are under no obligation of secrecy, Watson v. Allen, 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 5, 254 F.2d 342, 345, and where no attempt is made to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>the device from the knowledge of the public. Thompson v. American Tobacco Co., 4 Cir. 1949, 174 F.2d 773, 777-778. Moreover, a single use of an invention for commercial purposes constitutes a public use. Electric Storage Battery Co. v. Shimadzu, 1939, 307 U.S. 5, 20, 59 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed. 1071; George R. Churchill Co. v. American Buff Co., 7 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 129, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">To establish public use under \u00a7 102(b), the defendant in an infringement suit has a heavy burden of proof, which must be clear and convincing, Inglett &amp; Co. v. Everglades Fertilizer Co., 5 Cir. 1958, 255 F.2d 342, 346; <em>see </em>Zachos v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 5 Cir. 1949, 177 F.2d 762, 763; a mere preponderance of the evidence is insufficient. Julian v. Drying Systems Co., 7 Cir. 1965, 346 F.2d 336, 338. Nevertheless, we think that the defendant\u2019s proffered but improperly rejected evidence of a prior public use of Snow\u2019s device, which fully incorporates the Kardulas invention, raised an issue which the District Court must resolve. Cataphote Corp. v. De Soto Chemical Coatings, Inc., 9 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 24, 26; cert. denied, 385 U.S. 832, 87 S.Ct. 71, 17 L.Ed.2d 67; General Electric Co. v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., 2 Cir. 1941, 118 F.2d 278, 279; <em>see </em>Smith &amp; Griggs Manufacturing Co. v. Sprague, 1887, 123 U.S. 249, 265-266, 8 S.Ct. 122, 31 L.Ed. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">\n<em>Validity under sections 101 and 103</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">After careful consideration of the record and the Patent Office file wrapper, we conclude that defendant has failed to prove the Kardulas device lacked invention. 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">We begin with the presumption that the Kardulas patent is valid, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 282; Hunt Tool Co. v. Lawrence, 5 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 347, 351, cert. denied, 354 U.S. 910, 77 S.Ct. 1926, 1 L.Ed.2d 1428, which can be overcome only if invalidity is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Fairchild v. Poe, 5 Cir. 1958, 259 F.2d 329, 331. Neither the references cited by the Examiner,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor the Jaquith, No. 829,475, or Randall, No. 2,470,749, patent<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> anticipates Kardulas\u2019 claimed invention. Nor has defendant persuaded us that the Kardulas invention would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art in December 1960, the date Kardulas first reduced the invention to practice. 35 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">Defendant put on no expert testimony. Before a court concludes that it has no need for expert testimony to examine the nature of the prior art or the level of skill in the relevant industry, it should be convinced that the claimed invention would have been obvious even to ordinary laymen of modest intelligence. See Monaplasties, Inc. v. Caldor, Inc., 2 Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 20, 21; Ronel Corp. v. Anchor Lock of Florida, Inc., 5 Cir. 1963, 325 F.2d 889, 890, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 924, 84 S.Ct. 1221, 12 L.Ed.2d 216. To substitute our own judgment concerning the obviousness of the device as of December 1960 \u201cis to substitute our ignorance for the acquaintance with the subject of those who were familiar with it\u201d at that time.

Mississippi Milk Producers Association, 5 Cir. 1966, 358 F.2d 853, 857, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 841, 87 S.Ct. 93, 17 L.Ed.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">Section 103 was a codification of the judicial patentability requirement originally expressed in Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 1851, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 248, 13 L.Ed. 683. Graham v. John Deere Co., 1966, 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, announced a functional test of obviousness which requires three factual determinations: (1) the scope and content of the prior art, (2) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue, and (3) the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. The trial judge was impressed by the commercial success of the plaintiffs invention. While this factor is of secondary importance with reference to obviousness, Graham v. John Deere Co., <em>swpra, </em>and can never validate a patent which lacks invention, Waldon v. Alexander Manufacturing Co., 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 91, 95, nevertheless, considering the prior art and applying the guidelines' of Graham v. John Deere Co., <em>supra, </em>we are convinced that the defendant failed to prove obviousness. Anderson\u2019s-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 1969, 396 U.S. 57, 90 S.Ct. 305, 24 L.Ed.2d 258; <em>see </em>Waldon, Inc. v.

Joyce Snow\u2019s deposition was taken June 24, 1988, upon notice served June 10, 1968; Daniel Blatz\u2019s deposition was taken December 12, 1968, upon notice served September 20, 1968, with an amended notice served October 4, 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1180-20\">. The pretrial stipulation, although finalized only eleven days before trial, stated that the depositions of Blatz, Rosenfeld, Joyce and T. R. Snow and W. K. Weldon could be used, reserving evidentiary objections as to admissibility. Plaintiff filed no objections at that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">. The discretionary provision of section 282, however, does apply to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to admit the Zaharis, No. 1,102,959; Rudd, No. 2,414,245; and Boss, 444,328, patents since no thirty-day written notice of any kind was given to plaintiff. Nor were these patents cited by the Patent Officer Examiner in the file of the Kardulas or Snow patents. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding these patents. <em>See </em>Edward Valves, Inc. v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 5 Cir. 1961, 286 F.2d 933, 949; Fairchild v. Poe, <em>infra, </em>259 F.2d 329, at 332-333.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">.

Defendant\u2019s argument that the court erred in excluding W. K. Weldon\u2019s deposition is without merit. Weldon\u2019s testimony was offered to impeach Kardulas\u2019 testimony that she \u201cstopped\u201d Weldon, who was not a party defendant, from manufacturing infringing roller holders. The question of Weldon\u2019s infringement was irrelevant to the litigation below since he was not a party to the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">.

The Jaquith and Randall patents were cited by the Examiner during the prosecution of the Snow application and were properly admitted into evidence.
