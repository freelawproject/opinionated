Knowles defended on the ground of FMC\u2019s contributory negligence and Knowles interposed a counterclaim for the value of its tools lost in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">From a general jury verdict for defendant in the main action, FMC appeals. From our review of the record we think there was a sufficient eviden-tiary basis for the district judge\u2019s delineation of the jury issues set forth in his charge, and that in delineating those issues, the district judge correctly described the legal rules to be applied in their resolution. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Our review of the case has been made more difficult by FMC\u2019s failure to file an appendix in compliance with Rule 30, F.R.App.Pro. Permission to dispense with an appendix was neither sought nor granted in accordance with Rule 30(f), <em>supra. </em>We, therefore, conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
