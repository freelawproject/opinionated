These deductions were disallowed by the Commissioner, whose determination was upheld by the Tax Court. The bases for the Tax Court\u2019s decision were the following findings: (a) since the taxpayer had no \u201chome\u201d other than Binghamton during 1965, the expenses were not incurred while the taxpayer was \u201caway from home\u201d; and (b) by 1965 at least, Bing-hamton had become his \u201ctax home\u201d since his job there had become indefinite rather than temporary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">After fully reviewing the record, we cannot say that the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings were \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d or that it erred in interpreting the applicable law. Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-14\">.
