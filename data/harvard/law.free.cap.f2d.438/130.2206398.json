United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967). The court ordered appellee discharged from custody unless the state gave him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">We are satisfied from a reading of the trial record that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 272, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">The witness\u2019 in-court identification was qualified and uncertain \u2014 she candidly agreed that she was \u201cnot really sure\u201d that appellee was the burglar. On the other hand, the other evidence of ap-pellee\u2019s guilt was all but conclusive: ap-pellee\u2019s fingerprint was found at the scene of the crime on a piece of glass from the window which the burglar broke to effect entry; and a prescription bottle issued to appellee and marked with his name was found with the loot which was abandoned miles away. It is our belief that there is no reasonable possibility that the identification testimony might have contributed to appel-lee\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
