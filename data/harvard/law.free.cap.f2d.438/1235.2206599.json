The only contention presented on appeal is that defendant\u2019s confession should have been excluded from evidence because it was involuntary and resulted from improper inducements of police officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-38\">The District Court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury and found that the confession was voluntarily made by defendant with a full understanding of his rights. Our review of the record completely supports the conclusion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-39\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
