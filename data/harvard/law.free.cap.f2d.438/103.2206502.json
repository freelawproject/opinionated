The complaint charges that the challenged expenditures were for personal benefit and not for proper union purposes. The relief sought is an accounting and reimbursement of the union treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-27\">The complaint also seeks the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees out of any fund which is recovered, as authorized by section 501(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(b). In denying this motion to intervene the district court determined that the local\u2019s interest will be adequately protected by the original parties to this action. Apparently, the union is particularly concerned to participate in any hearing that may occur, if this action is successful, to determine what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>fees shall be awarded plaintiffs\u2019 counsel out of the sum recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">As concerns the basic controversy over the liability of the defendants, nothing appears in the record that casts any doubt upon the propriety of the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in denying the union\u2019s motion to intervene. Section 501(b) explicitly provides that such a suit as this lies only after the union itself has refused to sue and the court \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d has permitted the complaining members to sue on behalf of the union. Neither does it appear at this time that the union\u2019s intervention would facilitate any future determination of the claim for attorney\u2019s fees. However, when and if the litigation reaches that stage, it will be within the discretion of the district court to reconsider, if the union so requests, whether the ends of justice will then be served by union intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
