The specification details specific methods whereby various finishes may be obtained, \u201ccategorized according to their appearance as being frosted, opaque or glazed.\u201d In general, the methods comprise the three steps of forming an aluminum oxide layer on a precleaned aluminum surface (anodizing), sealing that oxide layer with a selected sealant, and corroding the sealed surface under controlled conditions in order to produce a non-metallic appearing surface. The particular finish resulting \u2014 frosted, opaque, or glazed, porcelain-like \u2014 is a function of the particular sealant employed and, in the case of the \u201cfrosted\u201d finish, the addition of an etching step subsequent to the cleaning of the surface. Claim 12 is illustrative of the particular method claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-20\">12. The method of producing on a surface of aluminum a durable opaque finish comprising the steps of providing on the surface of the aluminum a porous oxide coating, then sealing said coating by treatment with a solution of an alkali silicate, and then treating the sealed surface with a corroding solution until the metallic appearance of the surface is supplanted by an opaque appearance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-21\">Claim 13 is similar with caustic alkali specified as the corroding solution, while claim 14 adds an additional resealing step.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-22\">THE SECTION 112 REJECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-23\">The issue we find determinative in this appeal is the correctness of the rejection of claims 12-14 as not satisfying the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112. The examiner stated that he regarded those claims as \u201cunduly broad and indefinite in failing to define the minimum time and temperature relationship of the corrosion treatment.\u201d He further thought that expressing the time period of the corrosion treatment in terms of obtaining the desired result of producing some \u201csubjective\u201d, \u201crelative and indefinite appearance\u201d, viz. an \u201copaque appearance\u201d, was particularly meaningless and indefinite, inasmuch as appellant, in his view, had not satisfactorily defined what constitutes a \u201cmetallic\u201d appearance or an \u201copaque\u201d appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-24\">The board sustained the rejection \u201cfor the reasons given by the examiner,\u201d adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-25\">We feel impelled also to comment that while the specification * * * lists as one essential step the formation of an aluminum oxide layer, no claim requires such a step. The oxide layer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>called for by the claims could be an oxide of any metal or non-metal e. g., lead, iron, phosphorus, etc., which further points up the essential correctness of the Examiner\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Turning first to the above-quoted criticism of the board concerning the failure of the claims to recite that a porous <em>aluminum </em>oxide is formed on the aluminum surface, we agree with appellant that express inclusion of \u201caluminum\u201d as a modifier of \u201coxide coating\u201d is not necessary in the present circumstances. The evidence of record, notably the Tosterud<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Edwards<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> patents cited in support of the prior art rejection, amply establishes that the term \u201coxide coating\u201d, as it is employed in the claim, connotes an aluminum oxide coating to those in this art.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The criticisms of the examiner, however, require further and deeper consideration. We have determined that while some of the points he raised are not sustainable, we are in agreement that the claims fail to define the subject matter sought to be patented with the particularity and distinctness required by the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">In direct response to the rejection as framed by the examiner, appellant argues in his brief before us that his specification makes it clear that a wide variety of corrodants may be utilized in the \u201ccorrosion treatment\u201d step of his process, and that the time and temperatures employed in that step may vary widely depending on the particular cor-rodant selected and its concentration. His position is that the broad claim language he has selected delineates clearly the full scope of his invention and is permitted by the third paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-14\">An element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a * * * step for performing a specified function without the recital of * * * material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding * * * material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-18\">It is true that claim language which expresses performing particular steps until a given result or state is reached, or a given condition obtained, <em>may </em>be proper under \u00a7 112, third paragraph. This is with the proviso, however, that the claim otherwise satisfies the requirements of the first and second paragraphs of \u00a7 112. See In re Lundberg, 244 F.2d 543, 44 CCPA 909 (1957); In re Arbeit, 206 F.2d 947, 41 CCPA 719 (1953). We might find appellant\u2019s arguments to be convincing if the sole issue were whether the instant claims were adequately supported under the requirements of the first paragraph. However, we cannot even reach that issue since we are not satisfied that these claims comply with the second paragraph of \u00a7 112. Specifically, we are not sure that interested parties would be able to determine with adequate precision just what is the \u201copaque appearance\u201d which indicates completion of the \u201ccorrosion treatment\u201d step.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-19\">Initially, one might well wonder, as did the examiner, what distinction there is between a \u201cmetallic appearance\u201d of a surface and an \u201copaque appearance\u201d of that surface, particularly since metallic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>surfaces themselves are \u201copaque\u201d at least in the usual sense of being nontransparent. In an affidavit filed below, the tenor of which is paraphrased in part in his brief here, appellant explains the intended significance of those terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-4\">It is not possible to properly cover the full scope of the invention if any time-temperature relationship of the corrosion treatment is defined in the claims, since these parameters vary widely depending upon the corrosion agent employed, its concentration, temperature, etc. On the other hand, those skilled in the art of finishing aluminum would readily recognize when the metallic appearance of the surface being treated with a corroding solution is supplanted by an opaque appearance. The significance of \u201copaque appearance\u201d being simply that the metallic appearing surface can no longer be seen which is readily evident by observation. A metallic appearance is readily recognized by those skilled in this art and is believed to be a clear term on its face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">When we turn to appellant\u2019s specification as permitted by the third paragraph of \u00a7 112, however, the matter does not appear so clear-cut or straight forward. The specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">* * * the three steps set forth hereinabove [\u201cforming\u201d an oxide layer, \u201csealing\u201d and \u201ccorroding\u201d] produce a finish which is best described as being non-metallic and opaque but having a certain degree of luster. On the other hand, the above steps when combined with an etching step have been found to produce what may be described as a non-metallic, frosted finish which lacks the luster of the opaque finish. Thirdly, a highly glazed or porcelain-like finish is also contemplated and it is to be understood that the production of this type of finish is dependent upon the particular sealant which is employed in the second step as will be described more fully hereinafter. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">After describing the particular oxide-forming techniques and explaining that various sealants may be employed, including alkali metal silicates as well as certain acetates, the specification goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-8\">* * * the anodized and sealed surface produced by the above indicated steps presents a metallic appearing surface which is either highly reflective or slightly frosted in appearance depending upon whether the pre-treatment included polishing or etching. However, during the corroding step, this finish is made opaque by the controlled corroding of the sealed coat. In the ease of an aluminum alloy containing magnesium such as alloy No. 5357, this corroding tends to whiten the surface so as to create an opaque or glazed surface depending upon the particular sealant which is used as will be defined hereinafter. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Appellant then describes the factors governing the choice of sealants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-10\">The second factor in determining the choice of seals and corrodents is governed by the particular type of finish which is desired. In this regard, it has already been pointed out that the types of finishes may be categorized according to their appearance as being frosted, opaque or glazed. In order to achieve the latter type, i. e. the glazed or porcelain-like finish, a silicate seal must be selected as the first sealant since the presence of silicon oxide is required for the formation of the glazed appearance. * * * In order to produce the frosted finish, the pre-treatment must include the etching step previously described although the type of seal which follows this step is not critical. Thus, the corrodent may be any of the previously mentioned corrodents provided that it is consistent with the selected type of seal having in mind the rules set forth as comprising the first factor of selection. Lastly, an opaque finish is achieved if the pre-treatment does not include an etching step and if the seal is other than a silicate seal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Thus, each of the above listed sealants may be considered as producing similar finishes insofar as the latter fall within the opaque classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">In Example 1, appellant employs sodium silicate as a sealant to produce what he variously describes as a \u201cwhitened surface\u201d or a \u201chighly glazed finish, <em>i. e., </em>the enamel-like or porcelain-like finish having a white coloring.\u201d In Example 2, appellant employs nickel acetate as a sealant to produce an \u201copaque finish\u201d not \u201cquite as glossy\u201d as the finish produced in Example 1, and appearing as a \u201cflat paint rather than an ' enamel or porcelain\u201d finish. In Example 3, a \u201cfrosted\u201d finish is produced which is \u201cneither porcelain-like or opaque as these terms have been defined herein-above,\u201d and which is \u201cnot glossy\u201d and does not have \u201cthe flatness of the opaque finish.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief here asserts that Examples 1 and 3 \u201csupport all of the claims on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">It is evident to us from the above summary of the description, definitions and examples appearing in appellant\u2019s specification, that the claims on appeal are inherently inconsistent. As used and defined in the specification, and unmodified by other terminology, an \u201copaque finish\u201d is a flat-appearing finish which is <em>not </em>obtained when an alkali metal silicate is used as a sealant. Indeed, the latter sealant is said to produce a glazed or porcelain-like finish<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> having a white coloring. The claims, on the other hand, specifically call for sealing the oxide surface with an alkali silicate in order to ultimately obtain an \u201copaque appearance.\u201d No claim may be read apart from and independent of the supporting disclosure on which it is based. We are thus required to read the claims in light of the disclosure and in that light the term \u201copaque finish\u201d as it appears in the preamble of each claim must take on the meaning ascribed to it in that disclosure. The result is an inexplicable inconsistency within each claim requiring that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112 on grounds of indefiniteness be sustained. We will not, therefore, discuss the other issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">.
