H. Adams, </em>filed March 3, 1932, construing Acts 1931, chapter 57. In that opinion the Court of Appeals limited the retroactive effect of the statute, to instances in which, at the time of its enactment, there were pending disputes or litigation' between the State and a county as to their respective liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">'Judgment was rendered against the county in the case cited. We denied <em>certiorari </em>and concurred in the result, because the landowner was insisting- on his right to hold the county, and we were then of opinion that the county\u2019s liability to the landowner was not affected by the Act of 1931, for the reasons stated in the opinion we have this day filed in <em>Baker, Commissioner, </em>v. <em>T. W. Rose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Shelby County </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>was filed prior to the decision of this Court in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Donegan, </em>164 Tenn., 625, 47 S. W. (2d), 1095. In that case we construed the Act of 1931 as broadly excluding county liability, in so far as the State is con-\u2022.erned, for all rights of way thereafter adopted, desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>nated or taken over \u201cwhether such projects have been completed or are now under construction, or whether such rights of way are now involved in litigation,\u201d etc. We said: \u201cThis broad language could hardly have been employed except with the intention that it express the general rule to be followed and applied with respect to rights of way already acquired but not paid for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The phrase in section 2 of the statute, \u201cor whether such rights of way are now involved in litigation . . . as between said.Department and the county or counties affected,\u201d etc., was construed by the Court of Appeals as limiting the scope of said section 2. We cannot agree to that construction. It ignores the introductory word \u201cor,\u201d and is antagonistic to the context, which plainly shows that the phrase quoted was employed, by way of emphasis, to indicate that the transfer of liability from county to state, accomplished by the general language preceding, should apply even to instances then involved in litigation or dispute between county and state, and that such pending litigation or disputes should not interfere with or prevent the State\u2019s assumption of liability. This was the view we held in writing the opinion in <em>B'dker </em>v. <em>Done gam, supra, </em>and we adhere to it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The assignment of error of the State will therefore be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Brown Heirs have also appealed in error, and contend, by assignment of error, that the circuit court erred in failing to hold that Cannon County, as well as the State, was liable to them for the damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">This assignment of error is sustained, on the authority of <em>Baker, Commissioner, </em>v. <em>T. W. Rose, </em>165 Tenn., 543 this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The judgment of the circuit court will he modified accordingly, and the judgment to he entered here will he rendered against the State and county jointly. Otherwise the judgment of the circuit court will he affirmed. Costs of the appeal will he included in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
