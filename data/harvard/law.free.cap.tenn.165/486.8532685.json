The employer, an insurance carrier, appealed and insists (1) that the alleged permanent disability is result of disease unrelated to injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and (2) that there was a settlement and satisfaction of the claim approved by the circuit judge in the manner provided by section 27 of the Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">This claim for compensation is presented by petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>filed January 7, 1931. In it the petitioner alleges injury February 24, 1930. It is said that he strained the ligaments in his side causing permanent injury for which a claim was made for compensation for a temporary disability based upon statements of his employer\u2019s physician and for which he received $125. In this connection we quote from the petition:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u201c'Said payment for temporary disability was made and agreed to upon an erroneous belief as to the petitioner\u2019s real physical condition. At the time of the above-mentioned payment petitioner undertook to return to his work but was never able to perform service because of his injury of February 24th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The prayer was for an award for total permanent disability to be credited with the sum paid in settlement of the temporary total disability. As to the first proposition relied on by the defendants:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The trial judge found that petitioner\u2019s disability resulted from injury, not -disease. That was an issue. The question is not open to review because there is some evidence to sustain the finding of the trial judge. However, we refer to some and quote some of the evidence because of its relation to the second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">It was stated in the petition that a claim was made for compensation for temporary disability based on statements of the employer\u2019s physician. Dr. Haskins, the company\u2019s physician, testified that petitioner came to him the first time on March 3, 1930, complaining of pain in his right side and chest, saying that he had hurt himself, and the doctor said, \u201cIt looked to me like a condition we call intercostal neuralgia, a nerve condition, the nerves that run around between the ribs from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>spine, there was no sign of injury, I conld not make ont an injury and it looked to me like this nerve condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">The petitioner, complaining\" of pain in his side, saw Dr. Currey July 14. We quote Dr. Currey:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u201cI never could make a true diagnosis, unless it was one of two things, ruptured ligaments or injury to the intercostal nerves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Dr. Hager, who examined petitioner four or five months after February 24, found him with a pain in his side. This doctor expressed the opinion that the pain was the result of a strained intercostal muscle.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Dr. McPheeters examined Haley in January, 1931, and testified that the disability was result of a cerebrospinal infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The petitioner &gt; testified that while at work lifting a heavy flask, a device used by moulders at their trade, a pain struck him in the side. He continued work that day hut was unable to resume it on the next day and called Dr. Nelson, who treated him until Dr. Haskins was called, then both treated him. After some time he returned to work but had to quit for a week. He returned again and worked until July.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The time-sheets kept by S. B. Northington were introduced and Northington testified that petitioner worked from March 23 to July 9. He also testified that petitioner\u2019s earnings for twelve months preceding February 25, 1930, amounted to $983.26 and from March 23 to July 9, 1930, $360.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Petitioner testified that he was not able to work after July 9 and Dr. Currey corroborated his statement saying, \u201cThere was a spasmodic condition in Haley\u2019s side caused by ruptured ligaments that affected the diaphragm or the intercostal nerves and knocked him out and he would keel over when attempting to lift or stoop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>For three weeks disability beginning February 25, petitioner made claim and received as compensation $21. In October a second claim for compensation was made and about wbicb we quote from petitioner\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">\u201cQ. Tour lawyer and the lawyer for the insurance company and you settled and put down a decree on the settlement and agreed you were able to go back to work? A. I agreed to go and do light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u201cQ. They paid you another $126? A. They paid me $126.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u201cQ. The papers were signed in this courtroom before His Honor Judge Miller? A. I signed the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u201cQ. His Honor Judge Miller questioned you then about the settlement and do you remember Judge Miller signed those papers? A. Tes sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u201cQ. And you agreed there you were able to go back to work and the disability was removed? A. The judge never did ask anything in regard to work. He asked if the settlement was satisfactory. I told him \u2018yes\u2019 which I thought I was able to go back to work. I was honest.\u201d The settlement referred to is in the record and reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u2018 \u2018 SETTLEMENT AND PETITION \u201cDisability Case</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u201cIn the matter of Compensation for Injury \u201cTo CHAS.

D. Miller*</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u201cJudge of Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"At44\">\u201cDated at Chattanooga, Tennessee, O\u2019ct. 2, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendants by answer set up for defenses (1) that by section 37 of the Compensation Act petitioner is precluded from reopening the settlement for the temporary total disability covering a period of less than six months\u2019 duration, and (2) that there, was a full settlement and satisfaction of petitioner\u2019s claim under section 27 of the Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Judge Miller, who approved the settlement October 2, disposed of the issues made by the defense of accord and satisfaction and <em>res adjudicaba </em>upon agreed facts. And the trial judge held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201c1. The plea of settlement, accord and satisfaction and <em>res adjudicaba </em>are not well taken because of the failure to file the settlement and order, approved by the court, as provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u201c2. The <em>nunc pro bunc </em>order filed on the 19th day of Jannary, 1931, dating the court\u2019s order and settlement as of and on the 2nd day \u00f3f October, 1930, is a mere nullity and without force or effect in law and same is ordered here and now vacated and set aside, and that the order set out in paragraph 1 of the agreed facts is a nullity and without force or effect in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u201c3. This cause be set for hearing on Saturday, April 25, 1931, upon its merits.,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The judge rested his decision on the opinion in <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Shale Brick Corporation, </em>156 Tenn., 373, in which the court held a settlement ineffective because not made in compliance with section 27 of the Compensation Act. The section reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u201cThat the interested parties shall have the right to settle all matters of compensation between themselves, but all settlements, before the same are binding on either party shall be approved by the judge of \u25a0 the Circuit Court of the county where the claim for compensation under this Act is entitled to be made. Upon such settlement being approved, judgment shall be rendered thereon by the court and duly entered by the clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">In <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Shale Brick Corporation </em>the court said: .</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u201cSection 27 of the Act contemplates a judicial proceeding, and where a claimant is not represented by counsel, the circuit judge should require his presence in open 'court, in order that he might interrogate him with respect to the settlement before giving his approval thereto, or should, at least, require notice to be served on the employee, stating the time and place when the employer would ask the court to make their agreement the judgment of the court. Were it otherwise this provision of the act would amount to no more than a useless formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u201cThis case illustrates the advisability of such a procedure. The same judge, who formally gave his approval to the agreement, by which settlement was made for $180, awarded compensation in excess of $4,000 when the claimant was personally interrogated and examined, by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Shale Brick Corporation </em>is distinguishable upon its facts. There the employer proposed to set up in bar of the claim for compensation a compromise agreement with his permanently injured employee which he had settled upon a consideration so inadequate as to induce the trial judge to declare it fraudulent in law. Moreover the employee had no benefit of counsel, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>not appear in court, and was not present in court, and was not present when the employer procured the individual, not the judicial, approval of the judge. Nothing was done to confer jurisdiction upon the court and give it authority to enter an order in the case. And so on appeal it was held the settlement was not judicially approved and not final because:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u201cThis provision refers to the person presiding over the circuit court in his judicial as distinguished from his individual capacity. His act in writing his approval upon the instrument involved had no judicial effect since the circuit judge speaks only through Ms minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In that case the court emphasized the fact that the judicial power can only be exercised by the court as distinguished from judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the case before us the employee was represented by counsel, appeared in court, was interrogated and the settlement approved by the judge after examination made in open court, and the costs were adjudged in the order approving the settlement, signed by the trial judge in open court. Nothing remained to be done but formally enter the settlement and order approving it upon the minutes. Had the entry been made then, its judicial force would have been conclusive. It is insisted for petitioner that its' subsequent <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry was unauthorized. As said in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>165 Tenn., 76, 52 S. W. (2d), 139:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cThere are two classes of cases in which <em>nunc pro time </em>judgments are granted: (1) Where the judgment has previously been actually rendered, as here; and (2) where there has been delay in rendition of a judgment when the case has been otherwise heard and disposed of \u25a0 \u2014 as after a verdict. In the first class the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>nunc pro tunc </em>order is confined to the thing previously done, the judgment actually rendered. In this class of cases, to which the one before us belongs, it would not he proper for the judgment to recite or contain other matter than that actually originally decided. Therefore, the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order may not he so re-formed or re-framed, as to include consideration of a motion for new trial, or the granting of an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry was strictly limited to the order of the court made by consent and approval of both parties on October 2. The subsequent entry of that order did no more than supply the omission to enter on the minutes an omission caused by the negligence or oversight or error of the employer\u2019s attorney. The object of entries <em>nunc pro tunc </em>is to supply such omissions. 18 Ency. PI. &amp; Pr., 458. Unddr the circumstances the petitioner\u2019s presence was not essential to the validity of the entry <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The action of the circuit judge approving the settlement had become final. No facts are presented suggestive of reason for declaring it void. The settlement and the judgment of approval were in writing, verified by the signature of the trial judge. The <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order was made by the judge who gave judicial approval of the settlement on October 2, 1930. In <em>Rush </em>v. <em>Rush, </em>97 Tenn., 282, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cAll Courts have the right, and it is their duty, to make their records speak the truth, and a Court, therefore, in a proper case, of its own motion, may order a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry to be made, and no sound reason can be suggested why they should not exercise this right and discharge' this duty, upon the suggestion of one whose rights are impaired by the failure of the record to state the truth. 1 Freeman on Judg., Sec. 64; <em>Balsh </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>v. <em>Shaw, </em>7 Cush., 282; <em>Crim </em>v. <em>Ressing, </em>89 Cal., 478. And the lapse of time between the announcement of judgment and the making of this motion is of no importance; that which is important is, that the proof he clear and convincing that the judgment which it is sought to have entered is the one pronounced in the cause., 1 Freeman on Judg., Sec. 61.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">Upon the facts disclosed, the trial judge properly ordered entry <em>mmc pro 'time </em>of the settlement voluntarily made by the parties and approved by the court. The record discloses nothing to affect the validity of the settlement and therefore the trial judge was without power to set aside the entry <em>mmc pro time </em>or to declare the settlement void.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><em>State </em>v. <em>True, </em>116 Tenn., 294, and similar authorities referred to by counsel for petitioner rest upon the proposition that judicial acts can only he shown by the minutes and that parol evidence to prove judicial action is not admissible. The rule and the reason for it are well expressed in <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>8 Humph., 363. It serves its purpose of preventing the subversion of justice by leaving judicial records open to attack by parol evidence. Just as the <em>mmc pro tunc </em>entry on the minutes of what the presiding judge knows was done but left unrecorded through inadvertence or error.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">It appears from petitioner\u2019s admissions made in his petition and in his testimony that he voluntarily and with the approval of the circuit judge, as provided by section 27 of the Compensation Act, settled and received compensation for temporary total disability covering a period not exceeding' six months. By section 37 of the Compensation Act, all of such settlements are declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>final and not open to readjustment. <em>McCaslin </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>157 Tenn., 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">For the reasons stated, the trial judge erred in setting aside the settlement and awarding additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Reversed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
