He insists that the lump personalty exemption of $750, fixed by Section 770, of the new Code, has application. The trial court held the exemption laws in effect at the time of the creation of the obligation applicable. The case was heard on a stipulation of facts showing that the horse levied on.was not exempt under the former statutes, and that the total value of the execution debtor\u2019s personal \u00abproperty was less than $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">There was no error in the judgment below. In principle the question was directly determined in <em>Hannum </em>v. <em>McInturf, </em>6 Bax., 225. In that case the exemption of a homestead-by the constitution and law of 1870 was involved. Reviewing authorities the Court said that, \u201cto deprive the creditor of the right to enforce collection of his debt by prohibiting him from reaching all of the property of his debtor from appropriation to the payment of his debts, by a law passed after the creation of the debt, Would certainly be within the inhibition of the constitution.\u201d Also, \u201cwe therefore conclude the sound rule to be that such property as was subject to execution at the time the debt was contracted must remain subject to execution, or sale by other process, until the debt is paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Moreover, by Section 5 of the new Code, it is expressly provided that \u201cNo action or proceeding commenced before this Code goes into operation, and no right accrued, is affected by its provisions,\u201d etc.; and by Section 26, \u201cAll the provisions of the following Chapters, Articles and Sections shall be in force on and after the first day of January, Nineteen Hundred and Thirty-two, A. D. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
