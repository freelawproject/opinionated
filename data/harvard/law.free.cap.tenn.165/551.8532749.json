The final judgment directed that the State should he held primarily liable, and the county of Wilson secondarily liable, to Carson for the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">This appeal is by Wilson County, insisting that no liability exists against it under the Act of 1931; and by the State, insisting that the judgment should be corrected so as to hold the county primarily liable, and the State secondarily liable to Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Carson is satisfied with the order of liability fixed in the judgment of the circuit court, and does not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The assignments of error of Wilson County are overruled, and the judgment affirmed against it, on the authority of the opinion this day filed in <em>R. H. Baker, Commissioner, etc., </em>v. <em>T. W. Rose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">In so far as the respective rights of the county and 'State are concerned, the liability of the State to compensate the landowner, under the Act of 1931, is the primary obligation. Except on that theory, we could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>not have affirmed the judgment against the State in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Donegan, </em>164 Tenn., 625, 47 S. W. (2d), 1095. As the statute is there construed, we think the State has no ground to object to the order of liability fixed in the judgment before us. And, as stated, the landowner,, judgment creditor, is not complaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
