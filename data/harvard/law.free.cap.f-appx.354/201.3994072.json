Perry seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) so that he may appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A COA is not necessary for this appeal; therefore we deny it as unnecessary. Perry\u2019s motion to consolidate this appeal with Appeal No. 09-20047 is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">In his Rule 11 motion, Perry asked the district court to sanction the Attorney General of the State of Texas, arguing that the motion for summary judgment the State filed in response to his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition had no basis in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">Perry filed his Rule 11 motion more than 11 years after the State filed its motion for summary judgment. This court may affirm the denial of relief on any ground apparent on the face of the record. <em>See Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Perry\u2019s untimely motion. <em>See Thomas v. Capital Security Services, Inc., </em>836 F.2d 866, 879 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Perry has filed numerous motions in the district court regarding its denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition. The district court has denied all of Perry\u2019s motions. This court has denied all of Perry\u2019s related requests. Perry is warned that future frivolous challenges regarding his conviction or the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition, regardless of how they are styled, could-result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">AFFIRMED. COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
