The district court sentenced Paiz to 96 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Paiz argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Paiz maintains that the district court did not sufficiently consider that he had lived in the United States most of his life, that his mother and other direct family members resided in the United States, that he was being sentenced for the present nonviolent offense rather than his prior violent offenses, that he had pleaded guilty to all of his prior offenses except for the carjacking offense, that he had limited ties to his country of origin, and that he spoke little English. Paiz also contends that the district court erroneously referred to his carjacking conviction as his first conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The district court considered and rejected Paiz\u2019s arguments for a below guidelines range sentence. With explicit reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in general and the factors of deterrence, encouraging respect for the law, and punishment specifically, the district court determined that a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range was appropriate. Paiz\u2019s contentions that the district court erroneously referred to his prior conviction for carjacking as his first conviction and that he speaks little English are not supported by the record. As Paiz was sentenced within the guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, and Paiz has not shown sufficient reason,for us to disturb that presumption. <em>See United States v.
