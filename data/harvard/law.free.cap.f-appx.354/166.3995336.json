The district court sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment after imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) for a prior drug trafficking offense, specifically, possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Antilion contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish his prior federal drug conviction. Because he did not raise this objection in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Antilion has failed to establish plain error because the evidence with which the Government supplemented the record on appeal demonstrates that in 2003 Antillon was convicted of possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment. A comparison of the statute and the Guideline at issue shows that a conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1) qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1); \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-27\"> Pursuant to 5m Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
