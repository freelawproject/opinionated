Hernandez argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-21\">When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court gives \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cert <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-24\">The Guidelines expressly permit the district court to consider a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for an increase in offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and for calculating criminal history. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). Further, this court has rejected the argument that a presumption of reasonableness should not be afforded a guideline range resulting from application of \u00a7 2L1.2 because such application amounts to impermissible double counting. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Hernandez has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively unreasonable. Although his offense was not necessarily a crime of violence, Hernandez has shown a disrespect for the law. Further, as noted by the district court, Hernandez had other options for dealing with the problem of his alleged enemies in Mexico rather than illegally returning to the United States. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b145-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
