Owens (\u201cOwens\u201d), formerly a temporary Army employee, filed this lawsuit in 2007 alleging that the Army discriminated against him in the hiring process to fill a permanent position in 2004. He claims that the Army falsified official documents to give a white employee of a government contractor an unfair advantage in the hiring process and retaliated against him for complaining about the cancellation of a previous job vacancy for which he had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">The district court dismissed Owens\u2019s claims, without prejudice, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that he had failed to exhaust the administrative complaint procedures required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (\u201cEEOC\u201d) implementing regulations. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. Part 1614.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">Owens has filed this appeal pro <em>se. </em>He raises four issues: (1) that his pursuit of administrative remedies was legally sufficient; (2) that the exhaustion requirement should be waived due to the Army\u2019s provision of false information in an attempt to mislead him; (3) that the exhaustion requirement should be waived because the EEOC failed to investigate a complaint Hardy filed in 2004; and (4) that the district court had jurisdiction over his claim because the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">Owens\u2019s brief before this court contains little more than a list these issues and a haphazard recitation of a few facts underlying his claim and the case\u2019s procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>History. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Army argues that Owens has failed to comply with Rule 28(a)(9)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which requires that the argument in an appellant\u2019s brief lay out \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u201c[A]rguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cAlthough we liberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (footnote omitted). Thus, this court has considered a <em>pro se </em>appellant\u2019s brief despite technical noncompliance with procedural rules. <em>See id. </em>(listing cases). It has also attempted to discern meaning from <em>pro se </em>briefs that are \u201cconvoluted at best.\u201d <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Here, however, the error is not technical or stylistic but fundamental: Owens\u2019s brief lacks any argument in support of the issues that it raises. Consequently, his issues are forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">For want of prosecution, Owens\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
