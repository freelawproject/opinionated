He alleged that the officials were violating his rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses by awarding him good time credit even though he was ineligible for release on mandatory supervision. He sought an injunction directing that he either be awarded \u201cmeaningful\u201d good time credits or that he be \u201ccompensated via monetary wages\u201d for the \u201cfictitious\u201d credits. He also requested that the defendants be enjoined from assigning him work duties or disciplining him until he is awarded meaningful good time credits. Kossie consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), who dismissed Kossie\u2019s amended complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">\u201cWe review a judgment rendered by a magistrate judge just as we do a judgment rendered by a district judge.\u201d <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767 (5th Cir.1997). The dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim is reviewed under the same de novo standard of review applicable to dismissals made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">Kossie\u2019s allegations that he suffered depression, anger, and headaches due to the continued awarding of \u201cfictitious\u201d good time credits fell short of the kind of physical injury required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e) for a prisoner to bring an action for money damages. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999). However, that the failure to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1997e(e) does not foreclose prisoner actions for injunctive or declaratory relief. <em>See id. </em>at 719 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">\u201cIn the prison context, a liberty interest is created in one of two ways: Either the Due Process Clause confers a liberty interest or such an interest is created by the state through a statute.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Joslin, </em>501 F.3d 415, 418-19 (5th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). Kossie does not argue that the awarding of good time credits to him implicated or impinged any liberty interest conferred by the Due Process Clause, but he contends that he had a constitutionally protected liberty interest to be \u201cfree from receiving goodtime / worktime credits\u201d by virtue of Texas Code of Criminal Procedure art. 42.12, \u00a7 3g (formerly Tex.Code.Crim. Proc. art. 42.18, \u00a7 8(c)). While the relevant Texas statutes prohibit Kossie from being released to community or mandatory supervision, they do not actually prohibit prison officials from awarding him good time credit. <em>See </em>Tex.Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.12; Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 508.149; <em>see also </em>Tex.Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.18 (repealed 1997). Thus, the statutes cited by Kossie belie his claim that prison officials are prohibited from awarding good time or work time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In addition, this court has held that a prisoner does not have a protected liberty interest in his custody classification, <em>Harper, </em>174 F.3d at 719, and that prison officials may require prisoners to work without pay. <em>Ali v. Johnson, </em>259 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2001). With no constitutionally protected interest at stake, Kossie cannot state a due process claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 223-24, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u201cA classification that categorizes inmates based on the type of criminal offenses for which they have been convicted does not implicate a suspect class,\u201d and such classifications are therefore reviewed under the \u201crational basis\u201d standard. <em>Wottlin v. Fleming, </em>136 F.3d 1032, 1036-37 (5th Cir.1998). As in <em>Wottlin, </em>where a categorical rule promulgated by the federal Bureau of Prisons was \u201crationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of preventing the early release of potentially violent inmates,\u201d Texas\u2019s denial of good time credits that have the effect of reducing a prisoner\u2019s period of incarceration to prisonei*s convicted of certain offenses such as aggravated robbery would pass muster under rational basis review. <em>See id. </em>at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Kossie complains that by asking during the Spears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing what injury he had suffered, the magistrate judge \u201cinadvertently\u201d misled him to believe that he had to identify a physical harm in order to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. As explained above, a physical injuiy is a threshold requirement for money damages pursuant to \u00a7 1997e(e), and the magistrate judge properly explored this question given that Kossie\u2019s complaint sought such damages. In addition, the magistrate judge considered whether Kossie\u2019s complaint stated a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of his rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, belying Kossie\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge mistakenly found that Kossie\u2019s failure to identify a physical harm was dispositive of his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Kossie\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of his complaint in the district court under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 386-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Kossie that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-13\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\">. <em>Spears v.
