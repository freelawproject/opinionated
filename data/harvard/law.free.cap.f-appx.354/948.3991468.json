The district court denied Phillips\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal based on its determination that Phillips\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. We are now presented with Phillips\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal, which is a challenge to the district court\u2019s good-faith determination. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">Phillips argues that his \u00a7 1983 suit raised claims that implicated his constitutional rights and that the district court erred by determining that these claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). According to Phillips, the district court should have held a <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing before dismissing his suit. He does not brief, and has thus waived, the issue whether the district court erred by certifying that his appeal would raise no nonfrivolous claims challenging its holding that his suit was duplicative. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">Because Phillips\u2019s disciplinary conviction is still extant, and because success on the instant suit would imply that this conviction was invalid, the district court did not err in determining that Phillips\u2019s suit is barred by <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Heck. See Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584; <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. There is no indication that the deficiencies in Phillips\u2019s complaint could have been remedied with a <em>Spears </em>hearing; Phillips thus has not shown that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint without first holding such a hearing. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 474 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">Phillips has not shown that he will present any nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His motion for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>proceed IFP is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Our dismissal of Phillips\u2019s appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights suit count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Phillips that if he accumulates a third strike pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g) he shall be barred from proceeding IFP while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
