Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-18\">Diaz-Saenz, who was convicted in November 2001 in state court for possession of marijuana and who has a prior state court drug conviction, contends that the BIA erred by treating his 2001 conviction as equivalent to an aggravated felony under the recidivist provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). The BIA correctly determined that Diaz-Saenz had committed an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b65-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
