The BIA concluded that there was no clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding against Zhang and that Zhang failed to meet his burden to establish eligibility for relief. In this petition, Zhang argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility decision was not supported by the evidence in the record and accordingly, his application for withholding of removal should have been granted. For the following reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review the order of the BIA, but we also consider the IJ\u2019s underlying decision if it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We review whether factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and we review questions of law de novo. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Because Zhang filed his asylum claim after May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act provides the relevant credibility determination standards. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii)-(iii); REAL ID Act \u00a7 101, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302-05 (May 11, 2005) (\u201c[A] trier of fact may base a credibility determination on ... the consistency between the applicant\u2019s ... written and oral statements ..., the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence ..., and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency ... goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim....\u201d); <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009) (applying the REAL ID Act standard). An adverse credibility determination is a finding of fact that we review under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cReversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005)). Here, Zhang bears the \u201cburden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Zhang fails to meet this standard. The IJ\u2019s findings regarding numerous discrepancies in Zhang\u2019s testimony are sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination: Zhang\u2019s testimony regarding the date of his marriage is inconsistent; his testimony regarding the length of his alleged hiding from Chinese \u201cfamily planning\u201d officials is inconsistent; his testimony regarding the alleged sterilization of his wife is inconsistent; and his testimony regarding the \u201cfamily planning\u201d f\u00edne imposed after the birth of his child is inconsistent. Further, Zhang\u2019s attempt to clarify this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>inconsistent testimony was unpersuasive because it did not explain the discrepancies in his testimony and, in and of itself, was contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Although Zhang alleges that the testimony is actually consistent and supports his overall application for withholding, the discrepancies found by the IJ and BIA remain. \u201c[I]t is the factfinder\u2019s duty to make determinations based on the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d and \u201c[w]e cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to ... factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam). As such, we determine that the evidence in the record does not compel us to reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Accordingly, Zhang failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that he is eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
