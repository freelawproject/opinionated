As this court lacks jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Navarro-Castro conceded removability and on May 28, 2008 submitted his application for cancellation of removal, claiming that his removal to Mexico would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his three United States citizen children. The Immigration Judge found that while a hardship existed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it did not rise to the level of \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review the Immigration Judge\u2019s discretionary decision that Navarro-Castro\u2019s children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For that reason, Navarro-Castro\u2019s petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aoy\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ATt\">. The Immigration Judge found that (1) the children would likely have to move to Mexico to stay with a parent as their mother was also in the country illegally; (2) none of the three daughters, aged 14, 11, and 8, could read or write Spanish, although they could speak it; (3) the prospect of moving to Mexico was causing them to suffer \u201cdepression''; and (4) one of the daughters had a weight problem. In addition, Navarro-Castro alleges that (1) he would be unable to find work in his home village in Mexico and that his family there relied on his income from the United States; (2) his family's home in Mexico lacks running water or indoor plumbing; (3) the daughter who is overweight has preindications of diabetes; (4) his eldest daughter would likely have to quit school to help the family financially if they move to Mexico; and (5) the educational opportunities in Mexico are extremely limited when compared to those available to his children in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AbV\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Seung v.
