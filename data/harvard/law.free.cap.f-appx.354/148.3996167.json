He appeals the denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the applicable offense level for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>crack cocaine offenses. Moreau contends that the district court (1) focused too intently on his crime of conviction and gave too much weight to his criminal history, (2) erred by considering his record of arrests that did not result in convictions, and (3) attributed too much significance to his prison disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Section 3582 permits the modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence when the guidelines range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Doublin, 572 </em>F.3d 235, 236 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1048-49 (5th Cir.2008). Amendment 706 modified the guidelines ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706; <em>United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). In general, the effect of Amendment 706 is to decrease by two levels the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1; <em>Doublin, 572 </em>F.3d at 236. The district court\u2019s decision on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The exercise of sentencing discretion in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings requires that the district court consider, inter alia, the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. <em>See Robinson, </em>542 F.3d at 1048; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. This includes the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Moreau\u2019s contention that his youthful criminal conduct was too remote to justify the denial of the requested reduction is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Moreau\u2019s contention that it was error to consider his arrest record also provides no ground for relief. Moreau did not raise this issue in the district court; thus, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). To show plain error, Moreau must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even if we assume that the consideration of prior arrests constitutes error that is clear or obvious, <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679, 681 (5th Cir.2007), Moreau is unable to show that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. Consideration of his arrest record had no effect on the guidelines recalculation. The record show's that the district court considered all the circumstances, properly weighed the pertinent factors, and declined to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because it decided that an 84-month sentence was appropriate. Moreau has not shown plain error, nor has he established entitlement to relief on this claim. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 437-38 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">Moreau\u2019s attempt to show that it was an abuse of discretion to consider his post-sentencing conduct fails as well. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). Moreau\u2019s numerous disciplinary infractions following his imprisonment evidence his lack of respect for authority and bolster the district court\u2019s concerns that Moreau will recidi-vate when released.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">The district court did not abuse its discretion or commit plain error in denying the reduction sought by Moreau. <em>See Doublin, 572 </em>F.3d at 237; <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
