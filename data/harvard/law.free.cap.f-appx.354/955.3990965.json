Delgado argues that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not give adequate reasons for rejecting his arguments in favor of a below-guideline sentence and because it relied too heavily on the trial testimony given by a defendant in a related case. Delgado contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-27\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>(2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Delgado\u2019s argument concerning procedural unreasonableness was not presented to the district court and thus is reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). First, Delgado has not met this standard with respect to his claim that the district court gave inadequate reasons. <em>See id. </em>at 364-65; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Second, Delgado\u2019s suggestion that \u201csentencing evidence,\u201d such as the trial testimony in a related case, must be subjected to \u201cthorough adversarial testing\u201d misconstrues the analysis in <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (explaining that \u201cthe sentencing court subjects the defendant\u2019s sentence to the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure\u201d). Delgado also has failed adequately to raise or develop in his appellate brief his argument that he was denied the right to confront and cross-examine the defendant in the related case, and, thus, the issue is waived. <em>See United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 611 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000). In any event, the issue is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Navarro, </em>169 F.3d 228, 236 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Tjhere is no Confrontation Clause right at sentencing.\u201d). Finally, Delgado has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
