The immigration judge (IJ) determined that Diera had not made the requisite showing that his United States citizen children would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D). A single member of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-21\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ decision without opinion, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831-32 (5th Cir.2003). To the extent that Diera challenges the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that he had not made the requisite showing under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D), this court is without jurisdiction to hear his petition. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (2006); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). To the extent that Diera argues that the denial of his cancellation violated his due process rights, that argument is meritless. <em>See Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800-01 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">Diera also challenges the BIA\u2019s application of its summary affirmance procedures to his case, arguing that the procedure violated his equal protection rights and that his appeal did not satisfy the requirements for employing that procedure enumerated in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), (e)(6). Diera\u2019s \u201cconstitutional\u201d argument was inadequately briefed and therefore is deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833. Moreover, this court has previously held the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures constitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 832-33. With respect to Diera\u2019s argument that his ease should not have been summarily affirmed because it did not meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), (e)(6), we decline review pursuant to <em>Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Accordingly,. the petition is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
