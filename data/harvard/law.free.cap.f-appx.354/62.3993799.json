Alexis argues that neither of his state misdemeanor possession of marijuana convictions was a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), and that his recidivism was not punishable under the CSA as an aggravated felony. He further argues that a federal recidivist conviction requires procedural requirements which were not followed in his case, including an opportunity to challenge the recidivist charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-24\">Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) generally bars judicial review of a removal order based on the alien\u2019s commission of an aggravated felony, this court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>review. <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 265 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>78 USLW 3058 (Jul. 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). Because Alexis argues that the BIA\u2019s decision was incorrect as a matter of law, this court has jurisdiction to review his claim. <em>See id. </em>Review is de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 263, this court rejected the very arguments raised by Alexis under materially indistinguishable facts. In a letter submitted pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), Alexis takes notice of the issuance of the mandate in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>and he acknowledges that it \u201ccontrols the present matter.\u201d Given the foregoing, Alexis\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
