De Leon-Castro, who was convicted twice in state court of possession of cocaine since his admission to the United States, contends that his second state conviction for possession of cocaine should not be treated as an aggravated felony because the Fifth Circuit decision allowing such treatment is no longer valid law and because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\u2019s notice requirements were not satisfied with respect to the second state possession conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The BIA correctly determined that De Leon-Castro had committed an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60), Therefore, De Leon-Castro was both removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and ineligible for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b. Moreover, the federal notice requirement of \u00a7 851 did not apply to the state court proceedings that resulted in De Leon-Castro\u2019s second possession conviction. <em>See United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 336 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">De Leon-Castro\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-10\">. Although De Leon-Castro was deported in 2008, this case is not moot because \"[a]n important collateral consequence of our decision ... is whether [DeLeon-Castro] will be permanently inadmissible to the United States under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)-(ii), which bars re-entry of aliens removed for conviction of an aggravated felony.\" <em>Alwan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 511 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
