He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and fails to adequately account for his circumstances and motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Ortega-Castanon has not shown that the 16-month sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. Because the sentence was within the properly calculated advisory guideline range of 10 to 16 months of imprisonment, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). The record demonstrates that the district court properly made an individualized assessment to determine whether a sentence within the guidelines range was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Ortega-Castanon has thus failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that this court applies to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">Ortega-Castanon raises two additional arguments, which he acknowledges are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, to preserve for further review. He argues that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, double-counts criminal history without the support of \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d We have consistently rejected Ortega-Castanon\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(August 27, 2009) (No. 08-50902); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-367 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Ortega-Castanon also argues that the Sentencing Guidelines produce unwarranted sentencing disparities between defendants who can participate in a fast-track program and defendants who cannot. We have held that \u201cany sentencing disparity resulting from fast track disposition is not unwarranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
