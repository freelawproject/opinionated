In his second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Woodson asserted the district court erred by partially denying his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In Woodson\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, he requested a lower sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses two levels. The district court partially granted Woodson\u2019s first motion and reduced his sentence to the lowest possible under the amended Guidelines range. The district court denied further relief, however, determining it lacked the authority to revisit other sentencing issues and could not reduce his sentence any further. Woodson\u2019s appeal from the first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order was dismissed. Wood-son now contends the district court erred in denying his second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion by refusing to correct pui-ported errors in his original resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>this second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was procedurally permitted, the district court committed no error in denying it. The district court previously afforded Woodson the maximum relief permitted under Amendment 706 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3). Proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201cdo not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant\u201d or a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). The district court could not revisit other purported sentencing errors, <em>see United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (stating \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resen-tencing issues\u201d), and <em>Booker </em>did not give the district court authority to resentence Woodson, <em>see United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not provide an independent basis for granting a sentence reduction in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). The district court did not err in denying Woodson\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
