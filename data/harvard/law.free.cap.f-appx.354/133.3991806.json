Hernandez-Muniz was sentenced to a concurrent term of 65 months in prison in connection with his guilty plea to illegal reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Because Hernandez-Muniz failed to raise his challenge to his sentence before the district court, our review is for plain error. To show plain error, Hernandez-Muniz must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, 538 </em>F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); <em>see Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The maximum term of imprisonment allowed for a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (v)(ii) is five years. The presentence report mistakenly stated that the statutory maximum was 10 years of imprisonment. As the Government concedes, Hernandez-Muniz\u2019s sentence of 65 months of imprisonment for transporting an alien exceeds the 60-month maximum and constitutes plain error that affects his substantial rights and affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Coil, </em>442 F.3d 912, 914 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we modify the term of imprisonment imposed for Hernandez-Muniz\u2019s conviction for violating \u00a7 lS24(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (v)(ii) to 60 months. <em>See United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir.2005). The modification does not affect the overall term of imprisonment because Hernandez-Muniz\u2019s concurrent sentence for his illegal reentry conviction exceeds the modified sentence for his violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (v)(ii). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">MODIFIED IN PART; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
