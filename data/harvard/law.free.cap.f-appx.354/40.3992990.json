Stanley, who has been convicted in state court of possession of controlled substances on more than one occasion since his admission to the United States, contends that his second state misdemeanor conviction should not be treated as an aggravated felony under federal law because the Fifth Circuit decision allowing such treatment is no longer valid law. He also argues that his second conviction was not punishable under the federal recidivist drug-possession statute because he was not given proper notice in the proceedings of the second conviction of any intent to use the previous conviction to increase his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The BIA correctly determined that Stanley had committed an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(2), 3559(a). Therefore, Stanley was ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. Moreover, the federal notice requirement of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 did not apply to the state court proceedings that resulted in Stanley\u2019s second narcotics conviction. <em>See United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">Stanley\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
