Specifically, the removal order was based on Serna-Guerra\u2019s 1986 conviction for the Texas offense of unlawful use of a vehicle (\u201cUUV\u201d), Tex. Pen.Code \u00a7 31.07(a). Because then-existing circuit precedent foreclosed Serna-Guerra\u2019s argument that his UUV conviction was not an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d we denied his petition for review. <em>See Serna-Guerra v. Mukasey, </em>285 Fed.Appx. 110 (5th Cir.2008). After Serna-Guerra petitioned for a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). <em>See Serna-Guema v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2764, 174 L.Ed.2d 268 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), \u201cthe generic crime of violence or aggravated felony must itself involve purposeful, violent and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Armendariz-Moreno, </em>571 F.3d 490, 491 (5th Cir.2009). We held in <em>Armendariz-Moreno </em>that \u201c[t]he risk of physical force may exist where the defendant commits the offense of unauthorized use of a vehicle, but the crime itself has no essential element of violent and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Texas UUV offense is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">We therefore GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the order of removal, and REMAND to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
