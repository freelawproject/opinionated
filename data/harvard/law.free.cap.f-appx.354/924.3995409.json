Our review of the briefs, pleadings, and administrative record satisfies us that this Petition for Review should be dismissed in part and denied in part. As noted in the Respondent\u2019s appellate brief, (1) Petitioner has failed to set forth with specificity any argument in support of the issues advanced for review; (2) we lack jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s decision of March 18, 2009; (3) our jurisdiction to review the October 28, 2008 decision of the BIA is severely limited by Petitioner\u2019s failure to demonstrate exceptional circumstances with specificity; and (4) any disposition by this court of the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s Motion To Reopen would be futile, mooting any such review. Accordingly, the Petition for Review filed with this court by Petitioner is</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
