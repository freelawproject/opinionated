Smith argues that the district court erred by imposing a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because a preponderance of the evidence did not establish that Smith possessed the firearm in connection with his possession of narcotics. Smith asserts that the 2006 amendments to \u00a7 2K2.1 and its application notes added a requirement that the firearm be in close proximity to the narcotics and possess a relationship with the narcotics felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">We have recently noted that the 2006 amendment to the guideline reinforces this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 357 &amp; n. 16 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2814, 174 L.Ed.2d 308 (2009). Under that precedent; Smith\u2019s firearms were readily available to protect the narcotics that Smith had hidden in a different air conditioning vent less than ten feet away, and had the potential to facilitate his drug-related activities. <em>See United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1200 (5th Cir.1994); \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(A)). In light of <em>Condren, </em>in which the firearm at issue was locked in a desk drawer, the fact that Smith would have to unlatch two thumb latches to reach the firearms in the vent did not make the firearms unavailable. <em>See Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1191 n. 1, 1199-1200. Moreover, it was within the district court\u2019s province to credit the testimony of the police officer that Smith had admitted having the guns to protect the narcotics. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). Similarly, it was within the province of the district court to find <em>not </em>credible Smith\u2019s testimony he did not admit to the officer that he had the guns to protect the drugs. Smith has failed to show that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Smith had the firearms to protect the narcotics was implausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1199. Thus, Smith failed to show that the district court clearly erred in imposing a four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Smith raises no challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
