He has also filed a motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-26\">The court need not address Phillip\u2019s argument concerning his 1983 firearms conviction because the IJ and BIA did not rely upon that conviction to determine ineligibility for cancellation of removal, but only for the initial decision that Phillip was removable as charged in the notice to appeal. The BIA correctly determined that Phillip\u2019s second controlled substance offense constituted an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for </em>cert. <em>filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). Phillip is, therefore, ineligible for cancellation of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>moval. <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 1229b(a). Phillip\u2019s argument that his second possession offense is not an aggravated felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\u2019s notice requirements were not satisfied is unavailing. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 266; <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 336 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008). Given that his petition for review lacks merit, his motion to supplement the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">PETITION DENIED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
