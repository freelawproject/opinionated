Relying on the Ninth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s doctrine of hazardous neutrality, Mendoza argues that he has presented evidence of past persecution and of a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a political opinion imputed to him by his alleged persecutors based on his refusal to join their ranks. Our review is of the BIA\u2019s and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, to the extent the latter influenced the BIA\u2019s ruling. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>593 (5th Cir.2007). We will uphold the BIA\u2019s asylum determination \u201cunless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Mendoza bears the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum by demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 444-45. Mendoza testified to being subject only to isolated incidents of verbal threats unaccompanied by physical violence. Such conduct we have held does not constitute persecution under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir.2004). Nevertheless, even if the complained-of incidents could arguably be considered evidence of persecution, Mendoza, cites no instances in which we have adopted the doctrine of hazardous neutrality. The facts of Mendoza\u2019s case do not warrant our consideration of the hazardous neutrality doctrine. Absent evidence that the conscription effort of his alleged persecutors was motivated by Mendoza\u2019s political opinion, actual or imputed, rather than a need for members, their attempt to force Mendoza to join them is insufficient to compel a finding of persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution on account of his political belief. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Finally, even if it is assumed that the 2005 shooting of Mendoza\u2019s family home in Guatemala constituted persecution, Mendoza, who was at the time residing in the United States, \u201ccannot rely solely on the persecution of [his] family members to qualify for asylum.\u201d <em>See Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 681 n. 15 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Mendoza\u2019s testimony regarding who was behind the shooting was mere speculation, and he provided no evidence that the incident was in any way motivated by his political beliefs or his refusal to join a political party. He has shown no evidence compelling a reversal of the BIA\u2019s asylum decision. <em>See Lopez-Gomez, </em>263 F.3d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
