Boyd challenges the decision of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles not to release him on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-22\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement [and courts have] ... no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). A notice of appeal must clearly evince a desire of appeal to be effective. <em>Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-23\">Boyd\u2019s notice of appeal/motion to modify and accompanying memorandum of law sought relief from the district court and did not clearly evince a desire to appeal. The notice of appeal/motion to modify was not effective to serve as a notice of appeal. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. Because Boyd did not file an effective notice of appeal, his appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>COA DENIED.
