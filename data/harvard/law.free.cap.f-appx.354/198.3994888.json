For the following reasons, we now deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Kap Lam Thang, a 21 year-old native and citizen of Burma, arrived in the United States in February of 2008. That same day, Thang requested political asylum and a United States immigration officer interviewed him, obtaining a recorded sworn statement. After a credible fear interview, Thang was placed in expedited removal proceedings. On April 14, 2008, Thang was served with a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with removability pursuant to section 212 (a) (7) (A) (i) (I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as an immigrant who, at the time of application for admission into the United States, was not in possession of a valid entry document.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">On April 28, 2008, Thang appeared before the IJ, admitting the allegations in the NTA. Thang conceded removability as charged, and submitted his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT, asserting that he had been subjected to past persecution by the Burmese government and that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution if he returned to Burma.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Before the IJ, Thang testified that in February 2007, the Burmese military arrived in his village to forcibly recruit him and other young men to serve as porters carrying the army\u2019s goods and supplies. When the soldiers were ambushed by rebels during the trip, Thang claimed that he escaped and returned to his village. Shortly thereafter, he was arrested and detained for desertion. Thang further alleged that during his week long detention, he was beaten and denied food. Although he was sentenced to hard labor, Thang testified that his parents paid a bribe to secure his release. Thang remained in his village until December of 2007. In December, Tang stated that he showed a videotape to fifteen people depicting a crackdown by the Burmese government of a protest by Buddhist monks. After word of the video spread, Thang testified that he was told he faced imminent arrest. In response to his impending arrest, Thang fled Burma for Thailand and eventually, came to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">The IJ denied Thang\u2019s applications and ordered him removed to Burma. Thang appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. He now petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of an application for withholding of removal and protection under CAT under the substantial evidence test. Under this standard of review, reversal is improper unless we decide \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994)) (emphasis in original). We only review orders issued by the Board. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>929 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1991). Ordinarily this court does not consider the rulings and findings of immigration judges unless they impact the Board\u2019s decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Id. </em>Since the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions, we review the IJ\u2019s findings here.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In this case, the IJ denied Thang\u2019s petition for asylum finding that his claims were not sufficiently credible. The Real ID Act of 2005 allows the trier of fact to make a credibility determination \u201cwithout regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b) (1) (B) (iii). Adverse credibility determinations must be supported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, 432 F.8d </em>339 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In her opinion, the IJ listed several specific material inconsistencies between Thang\u2019s testimony, his asylum application, and his asylum and credible fear interviews. For instance, Thang testified before the IJ that he alone \u2014 and not his family \u2014 endured hardships; however, in his asylum application he indicated that his family had their goods and belongings confiscated by the military and that they were punished by authorities. Also, although Thang\u2019s application indicated that his family had been harassed for worshiping as Christians, he did not claim any religious persecution. Further, Thang testified the he worked on his family\u2019s farm after graduating the tenth grade, but he told the asylum officer that he was a student.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On appeal, Thang disputes the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and maintains that the various inconsistencies addressed by the IJ were the result of Thang\u2019s inability to understand English. Yet Thang\u2019s argument is undercut by the basic English competency he evinced in his interview with the immigration officer. During his interview, Thang answered a series of questions, showing an understanding of English; he responded competently about questions regarding his parent\u2019s names, birth dates, and places of birth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, the IJ recognized that Thang passed a University Entrance Exam which included English as a subject. Record, p. 357. Accordingly, Thang\u2019s claim concerning the language barrier as a cause for the inconsistencies in his answers is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">Therefore, because of the strong deference we give to the IJ\u2019s credibility findings and since nothing in the record compels a contrary conclusion, we deny review of the order of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">.
