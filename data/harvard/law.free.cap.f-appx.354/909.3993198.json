Cruz, </em>22 F.3d 96, 96-97 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1994) (affirming conviction and sentence). Heli-Mejia has previously sought relief unsuccessfully under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-29\">Heli-Mejia filed a petition for a writ of audita querela in the district court challenging the legality of his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court construed the petition as an unauthorized successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because it lacked jurisdiction, the district court denied the motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-30\">Heli-Mejia contends in this appeal that he should be permitted to assert his <em>Booker </em>claim via a petition for a writ of audita <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>querela because <em>Booker </em>was decided after he was sentenced and is not retroactively applicable in the \u00a7 2255 context. Although the writ of audita querela \u201cpermits a defendant to obtain relief against a judgment because of some legal defense arising after the judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 355 (5th Cir.1993), a prisoner may not seek a writ of audita querela if he \u201cmay seek redress under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Massey v. United States, </em>581 F.3d 172, 174 &amp; n. 2 (3d Cir.2009). The fact that a movant cannot meet the require.ments for bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"AnP\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
