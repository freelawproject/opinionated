After a jury found Morrison guilty of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and three counts of possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine, he was sentenced to 300 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Eligibility for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment that lowers the applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). Because Morrison\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, he was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and a reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">In addition, our court has rejected the contention that a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is guided by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding\u201d), <em>petition far cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-665).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the appeal is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
