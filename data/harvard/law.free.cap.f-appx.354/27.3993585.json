She argues for the first time on appeal that the district court improperly enhanced her sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) by relying solely on the presentence report\u2019s characterization of her prior 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 conviction for importation of marijuana as a drug trafficking crime and its own recollection of that conviction. Because Porras did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement on this basis in the district court, her argument is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Porras, however, has not established reversible plain error because she has demonstrated no prejudice from the district court\u2019s alleged error; thus, she cannot show that her substantial rights have been affected. <em>See id. </em>at 520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-22\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Porras also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
