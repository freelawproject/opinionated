In dismissing, the district court held a rule of civil procedure cannot be used to challenge a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Our court need not reach whether Ford could use Rule 60(b) to challenge his criminal conviction because the district court should have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Ford claims <em>only </em>fraud in the underlying criminal proceeding. Because he seeks relief from his conviction and is not attacking the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings, his motion should have been construed as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion filed without this court\u2019s required permission. <em>Cf. Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32 &amp; nn. 4-5, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (holding Rule 60(b) motion that challenges merits of state court conviction should be construed as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 motion). The judgment is affirmed on this alternative basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">Ford has attempted repeatedly to reliti-gate his fraud claim and to evade the statutory requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He is warned: future repetitive filings, however styled, may subject him to sanctions, which may include monetary sanctions and restrictions on filing further pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
