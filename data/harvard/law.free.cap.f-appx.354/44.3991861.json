He previously sought and was denied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief. In 2008, Sorrell filed a motion to dismiss his bank robbery conviction, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him for the offense. The district court denied his motion on the merits. Sorrell appealed and sought leave from the district court to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district coui\u2019t denied IFP status after deteimining that Sorrell\u2019s appeal was frivolous and not taken in good faith within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">Sorrell has filed a motion for leave to proceed IFP with this court. He has also filed a motion for the appointixxent of counsel. Sorrell has failed to raise any nonfrivolous issues for appeal. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997) (civil case); <em>United States v. Boutwell, </em>896 F.2d 884, 889-90 (5th Cir.1990) (one-judge order) (criminal case). As Sorrell has failed to demonstrate that his appeal is in good faith, this court could dismiss the appeal oxx the merits. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Boutwell, </em>896 F.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-22\">However, this court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>See Crone v. Cockrell, </em>324 F.3d 833, 836 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Sorrell\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was actually a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court was without jurisdiction to consider absent this coux\u2019t\u2019s prior permission. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); <em>Crone, </em>324 F.3d at 836-38. Whei\u2019e a district court acts without jurisdiction and improperly analyzes a successive \u00a7 2255 motion that was filed without this court\u2019s permission, this court\u2019s jurisdiction extends not to the merits, but to correct the error of the district court in its considexation of the motion. <em>See Crone, </em>324 F.3d at 837-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-23\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district coui\u2019t is VACATED and this case is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Sorrell\u2019s motion to proceed IFP and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>his motion for the appointment of counsel are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">VACATED and REMANDED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b66-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set fordx in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
