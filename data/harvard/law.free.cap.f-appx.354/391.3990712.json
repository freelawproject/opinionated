On appeal, Schmidt argues that the district court erred by denying his petition pursuant to its finding that the Florida state courts denied him relief based on an adequate and independent state procedural ground. Specifically, Schmidt argues that the last state court to consider his claims, the Florida Supreme Court, applied newly announced procedural rules in denying him relief. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">In November 2007, Schmidt, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u00a7 2254, alleging that his federal rights had been violated with respect to prison disciplinary proceedings. In his petition, Schmidt explained that he had been issued a disciplinary report for his alleged violation of computer lab policies. He asserted that, after a disciplinary hearing, he was acquitted of committing the policy violation, but was later convicted of the alleged violation based on the same evidence at a second disciplinary hearing. Schmidt argued that his conviction obtained at the second disciplinary hearing violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause and his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Schmidt alleged that, as a result of this conviction, he lost 60 days of accrued \u201cgain time\u201d that otherwise would have operated to reduce the amount of time he would serve in prison, and was also denied the award of an additional 25 days of gain time. He requested relief in the form of restoration of the gain time he lost due to his conviction for violation of the prison computer lab policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The Florida Department of Corrections (\u201cDCC\u201d), represented by the Florida Attorney General, responded to Schmidt\u2019s petition, generally asserting that the district court should deny relief because the Florida state courts denied Schmidt\u2019s mandamus petition based on an adequate and independent state procedural ground. Both Schmidt and the DCC attached exhibits to their pleadings, which detailed the state court proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The exhibits submitted by Schmidt and the DCC demonstrated the following: After Schmidt\u2019s second disciplinary proceeding and resulting conviction, he filed grievances to the prison warden and the Secretary for the Florida Department of Corrections, which were denied. Schmidt subsequently filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the circuit court, alleging that: (1) the prison disciplinary committee lacked sufficient evidence to convict him of a policy violation; (2) he was subjected to \u201cmultiple\u201d and unauthorized punishments; and (3) he was the victim of discrimination or reverse discrimination because he was not returned to the computer class in which his alleged policy violation occurred. Schmidt requested that his gain time be restored and that he be returned to the computer course. The circuit court issued a case management <em>order </em>directing Schmidt to pay filing fees or submit an affidavit of indigency, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.085 (the \u201cPrisoner Indigency Statute\u201d). Schmidt filed a motion requesting that the circuit court find that his petition was not subject to filing-fee requirements. The court denied the motion, and ultimately dismissed Schmidt\u2019s mandamus petition because he failed to pay filing fees or an affidavit of indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Before the circuit court dismissed his petition, Schmidt filed a writ of prohibition in the First District Court of Appeal (\u201cDCA\u201d), requesting that the DCA prohibit the circuit court from dismissing his petition due to his failure to comply with the Prisoner Indigency Statute. He also filed a notice of appeal to the DCA from the circuit court\u2019s ultimate dismissal of his mandamus petition. The DCA entered an order stating that it would not allow Schmidt\u2019s action in the appellate court to proceed until he either: (1) submitted a copy of a circuit court order permitting him to proceed as an indigent; (2) paid filing tees to the DCA; or (3) filed an affidavit of indigency in the circuit court under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.085 or \u00a7 57.081, whichever was applicable. The DCA stated that, if Schmidt failed to comply with its order, it would dismiss his petition pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 35.22 and Fla.R.App.P. 9.410. Schmidt filed a motion requesting that the appellate court find that his proceeding was not subject to filing-fee re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>quirements. The DCA denied his motion without prejudice to his filing an affidavit of indigency in the circuit court. Schmidt did not comply with this order, and the DCA ultimately dismissed his appeal due to his failure to comply with the court\u2019s filing-fee requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Before the DCA dismissed Schmidt\u2019s appeal, Schmidt filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Florida Supreme Court, requesting that the court bar the DCA from dismissing his appeal. In October 2001, the Florida Supreme Court stayed Schmidt\u2019s mandamus proceeding pending a decision in another case to which Schmidt was a party, <em>Schmidt v. Crusoe, </em>878 So.2d 361 (Fla.2003) <em>(\u201cSchmidt I </em>\u201d). In 2003, the court decided Schmidt I, holding that a prisoner\u2019s mandamus petition that raised a challenge to his loss of gain time was not subject to the requirements of the Prisoner Indigency Statute, but was subject to the requirements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.081 (the \u201cGeneral Indigency Statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In 2006, the court rendered its decision in the present case, applying <em>Schmidt I </em>to hold that Schmidt\u2019s mandamus petition was subject to the General Indigency Statute, but not the Prisoner Indigency Statute. In addition, the court characterized Schmidt\u2019s mandamus petition as a \u201cmixed\u201d petition raising both a gain-time claim and a civil claim. Thus, the court reasoned that, although Schmidt\u2019s gain-time claim was subject only to the requirements of the General Indigency Statute, his petition as a whole was subject to the more rigorous requirements of the Prisoner Indigen-cy Statute. The court denied relief because Schmidt failed to comply with either statute, and did not grant him permission to refile his mandamus petition in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Based on these facts, the magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation in which he recommended that the district court deny relief because the DCA had dismissed Schmidt\u2019s appeal from the circuit court based on adequate and independent state grounds \u2014 Fla.R.App.P. 9.410 and Fla. Stat. \u00a7 35.22. Schmidt filed written objections to the report and recommendation, arguing, among other things, that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision did not rest on adequate and independent state procedural grounds because the court applied new procedural roles to his mandamus proceeding. The district court adopted the report and recommendation over Schmidt\u2019s objections and denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">After the court denied Schmidt\u2019s construed motion for a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d), Schmidt applied to this Court for a COA. We granted a COA as the following issue only: \u201cWhether the district court erred in determining that the state court\u2019s dismissal of Schmidt\u2019s petition on procedural grounds constituted an adequate and independent state rule, so as to preclude federal habeas review?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">The issue of whether a petitioner has proeedurally defaulted a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Judd v. Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). Regardless of whether a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition should be construed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2254, the procedural requirements applicable to \u00a7 2254 petitions, including exhaustion, apply. <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1052-53, 1058-62 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">In order to file a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, a state prisoner must first exhaust all available state court remedies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1); <em>See Duncan v. Henry, </em>513 U.S. 364, 364-65, 115 S.Ct. 887, 888, 130 L.Ed.2d 865 (1995). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>In order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement, the petitioner \u201cmust give the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d <em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 1732, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). An issue that was not presented to the state court and which can no longer be litigated under state procedural rules is considered to be procedurally defaulted. <em>Id. </em>at 839-40, 848, 119 S.Ct. at 1734; <em>Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1302-03 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Procedural default may occur where the state court correctly applies a procedural principle of state law and concludes that the petitioner\u2019s federal claims are barred. <em>Bailey, </em>172 F.3d at 1302-03. A federal court is not required to honor a state\u2019s procedural default ruling, however, unless that ruling rests on adequate state grounds that are independent of a federal question. <em>See Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 1043, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We employ a three-part test to determine whether a state\u2019s procedural ruling constitutes an adequate and independent state rule of decision. <em>Judd, </em>250 F.3d at 1313. \u201cFirst, the last state court to render judgment in the case must clearly and expressly state that it is relying on state procedural rules to resolve the federal claim without reaching the merits of that claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the state court\u2019s decision must rest entirely on state law grounds and not be intertwined with an application of federal law. <em>Id. </em>\u201cFinally, the state procedural rule must be adequate; <em>ie., </em>it must not be applied in an arbitrary or unprecedented fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the rule must be \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed.\u201d <em>Ford v. Georgia, </em>498 U.S. 411, 423-25, 111 S.Ct. 850, 857-58, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991). A state procedural rule is not \u201cfirmly established\u201d where the rule is novel or newly announced. <em>Id. </em>at 423-24, 111 S.Ct. at 857-58. In addition, in order to be considered adequate, the procedural rule cannot be manifestly unfair in its treatment of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim. <em>Judd, </em>250 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Under Florida law, a prisoner may bring a constitutional challenge to a prison disciplinary decision by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus in the state circuit court. <em>See Drayton v. Moore, </em>807 So.2d 819, 821 (2d Dist.Ct.App.2002). Pursuant to Florida\u2019s \u201cPrisoner Indigency Statute,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.085, a prisoner who wishes to litigate in state court and avoid the prepayment of filing fees is required, among other things, to file an affidavit of indigence. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.085(1), (2). This statute does not apply to criminal proceedings or collateral criminal proceedings. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.085(10). Under Florida\u2019s General Indigency Statute, any indigent litigant, except those subject to the Prisoner Indigency Statute, must obtain a certificate of indigence in order to be exempt from the prepayment of filing fees. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.081(1). Prior to 1996, Florida\u2019s General Indigency Statute applied to all indigent litigants, including prisoners. <em>Vickson v. Singletary, </em>734 So.2d 376, 377 n. 2 (Fla.1999). During 1996, however, the Florida legislature \u201camended section 57.081 to exclude prisoners and created section 57.085 to apply exclusively to prisoners.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Quigley v. Butterworth, </em>708 So.2d 270, 271 n. 1 (Fla.1998). As noted above, the Florida Supreme Court held in <em>Schmidt I </em>in 2003 that a mandamus petition challenging a prisoner\u2019s loss of gain-time was subject to the General Indigency Statute, but not the Prisoner Indigency Statute. <em>Schmidt, </em>878 So.2d at 367, n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Our review of Florida state law reveals that state courts applied the General Indi-gency Statute to prisoners\u2019 mandamus petitions raising gain-time claims only after <em>Schmidt I </em>was decided in 2003. <em>See, e.g., Cason v. Crosby, </em>892 So.2d 536, 536-37 (1st Dist.Ct.App.2005) (explaining that the Florida Supreme Court held, in <em>Schmidt I, </em>that a prisoner\u2019s mandamus petition challenging the loss of gain time was not subject to \u00a7 57.085, but was subject to \u00a7 57.081); <em>Hughes v. Weiss, </em>870 So.2d 87, 88 (2d Dist.Ct.App.2003) (same); <em>Drayton, </em>807 So.2d at 821 (noting that the circuit court dismissed the prisoner\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus, which raised a due process challenge to a prison disciplinary proceeding, pursuant to \u00a7 57.085); <em>Jackson v. Florida Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>790 So.2d 381, 382-83 (Fla.2000) (noting that the court had applied to \u00a7 57.085 to a prisoner\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus challenging an action taken by the Florida Department of Corrections).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In addition, the Florida Supreme Court appeared to announce its rule concerning the application of the Prisoner Indigency Statute to a \u201cmixed\u201d mandamus petition for the first time when considering the present case. <em>See Schmidt v. McDonough, </em>951 So.2d 797, 802-03 (Fla.2006) <em>(\u201cSchmidt II\u201d); see also Smith v. Florida Dept. of Corrections, </em>974 So.2d 1110, 1112 (Fla. App. 1 Dist.2007) (noting that, in <em>Schmidt II, </em>the Florida Supreme Court rejected the proposition that a \u201cmixed\u201d mandamus petition was not subject to the Prisoner Indigency Statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Here, the Florida Supreme Court, which was the last state court to consider Schmidt\u2019s claims, clearly and expressly stated that it dismissed his petition for a writ of mandamus based on two state procedural grounds: (1) under <em>Schmidt I, </em>Schmidt\u2019s gain time claim in the present case was subject to the General Indigency Statute, with which Schmidt failed to comply; and (2) Schmidt\u2019s petition was \u201cmixed\u201d because it presented both a gain-time and civil claim and, as a result, the petition as a whole was subject to the Prisoner Indigency Statute, with which Schmidt failed to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Because the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision rested on state procedural grounds that were not intertwined with federal law, the procedural grounds at issue in this case were independent. The Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision did not, however, rest on adequate state grounds. It is true that, at the time the Florida Supreme Court decided the present case, its decision in <em>Schmidt I </em>had been established and followed by state courts for three years. Schmidt, however, filed his petition for a writ of mandamus to the Florida Supreme Court in this case before the court decided <em>Schmidt I, </em>and the court stayed its decision in the present case until after it decided <em>Schmidt I. </em>Accordingly, in the present case, Schmidt was not provided with the opportunity to comply with <em>Schmidt I\u2019s </em>holding that a prisoner filing a mandamus petition challenging his loss of gain time must comply with the General Indigency Statute, particularly because the Florida Supreme Court did not provide him with the opportunity to refile his mandamus petition in the state circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">In addition, the Florida Supreme Court appeared to announce its rule concerning the application of the Prisoner Indigency Statute to a \u201cmixed\u201d mandamus petition for the first time when considering the present case. Accordingly, this procedural ground was also not adequate to bar federal review of Schmidt\u2019s claims because it constituted a novel application of the Prisoner Indigency Statute that was not well-established or regularly followed when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Florida Supreme Court considered this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Because the district court erred in determining that the last state court to consider Schmidt\u2019s claims denied relief based on an adequate state procedural ground, we vacate and remand this case so that the district court may consider the merits of Schmidt\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
