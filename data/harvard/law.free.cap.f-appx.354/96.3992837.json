It found him ineligible for cancellation of removal because his second 1998 Mississippi conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance was an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">Bharti\u2019s argument that <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 58-60, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), overruled <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005), is unavailing. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). Further, we have rejected Bharti\u2019s argument that a second or subsequent state offense cannot be a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 unless the prosecutor gives notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 of the intent to use a previous conviction to increase the sentence. <em>See United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 336 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008). Cara<em>churi-Rosendo </em>affirmed the continuing validity <em>of Cepeda-Rios. Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 266. Finally, in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>we rejected Bharti\u2019s argument that a second possession of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>fense that renders an alien an aggravated felon must have been prosecuted under a state recidivism law for it to be considered an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Under <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>Bharti is considered to have committed an aggravated felony for immigration purposes because, since his admission to the United States, he has been convicted on more than one occasion of possession of a controlled substance. <em>See id. </em>at 266; \u00a7 844(a). Bharti is therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 266-68; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
