It found him to be ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) because his 2006 New York conviction for possession of a controlled substance constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law. King contends that the BIA erred by treating his conviction as equivalent to the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>offense of \u201crecidivist possession.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We conclude that the BIA correctly determined that King\u2019s offense constituted an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">King also argues that the BIA erred in finding him removable based on his conviction of an aggravated felony. King was charged with being removable, conceded removability, and was found removable based on his conviction for a controlled substance violation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (B) (i). His removal was not based solely on his conviction of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
