Fuselier\u2019s IFP motion challenging the certification decision \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-19\">The district court is directed to dismiss a complaint filed by a prisoner if the complaint is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) &amp; 1915(e)(2)(B). Because the district court dismissed Fuselier\u2019s claims as both frivolous and for failure to state a claim, our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-20\">Fuselier argues that his incarceration in the Calcasieu Correctional Center violated his due process rights. Fuselier has no constitutional right to be placed in the penal facility of his choice. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 245, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (\u201cJust as an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a State, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular State.\u201d); <em>Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cA prisoner has no constitutionally protected interest in a particular facility.\u201d). Further, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b), the Bureau of Prisons was authorized to designate any available correctional facility to house Fuselier, whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise. Fuselier\u2019s allegation fails to raise a constitutional claim and does not suffice to show that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-21\">Fuselier\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. Fuselier is warned that the dismissal of his complaint counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g) and that the dismissal of his appeal counts as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>second strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Fuselier is also warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to bring a civil action or appeal a judgment IFP unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">DENY IFP MOTION; DISMISS APPEAL; ISSUE SANCTION WARNING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b71-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
