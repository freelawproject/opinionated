The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>district court denied Brooks\u2019 petition as time-barred under <em>Salinas v. Dretke, </em>354 F.3d 425 (5th Cir.2004). <em>Salinas, </em>however, has been abrogated by intervening Supreme Court precedent. <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009). In light of <em>Jimenez </em>we now REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">John Brooks was convicted by a jury of two counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death in 1991. <em>State v. Brooks, </em>648 So.2d 366, 367 (La.1995). In 1995 the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but reversed the imposition of the death penalty. Brooks was subsequently resentenced to life imprisonment on December 5th, 1997. Brooks had until December 12th, 1997, to appeal this sentence, but did not. On October 27, 1998, Brooks filed an out-of-time appeal challenging his conviction. The state court granted Brooks an out-of-time appeal. On April 10, 2002, the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed Brooks\u2019 life sentence. The time for appealing this judgment to the Louisiana Supreme Court expired on May 10, 2002. Brooks did not appeal this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">On September 19, 2002, Brooks filed a state habeas application, challenging his murder conviction. The state district court failed to rule on the habeas application, so Brooks filed a petition for a writ of mandamus from the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal. That court, treating the petition as a supervisory writ, denied Brooks\u2019 underlying claims. Brooks then filed a writ with the Louisiana Supreme Court, which was denied on February 3, 2006. Brooks filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition on March 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">The Magistrate Judge recommended that the petition be dismissed as untimely under <em>Salinas. </em>The Magistrate reasoned that Brooks\u2019 conviction became final, at the latest, on December 12th, 1997, when the time for appealing his December 5th, 1997 resentencing judgment expired. Thus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), absent tolling, Brooks had one year from December 12th, 1997, to file his \u00a7 2254 petition. Brooks filed his state post-conviction application on October 27, 1998, 318 days into this one-year period. The Magistrate Judge noted that Brooks had been granted an out-of-time direct appeal in connection with that application, but held that under <em>Salinas </em>the time limitation period for the filing of a \u00a7 2254 petition did not begin again with the grant of leave to file the out-of-time appeal. The Magistrate Judge found that the limitations period was therefore tolled only until May 10, 2002, when the 30-day period for appealing the denial of the merits of Brooks\u2019 out-of-time state appeal (entered on April 10, 2002) expired. According to these calculations, the one-year limitations period for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition expired on June 26, 2002, and Brooks\u2019 motion, filed bn March 30, 2006, was untimely. The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and dismissed Brooks\u2019 petition as time barred. Brooks timely appealed. This Court granted a Certificate of Appealability and ordered the parties to address the applicability of <em>Jimenez </em>to Brooks\u2019 petition. The Government failed to file a response to this request, apparently conceding that Brooks\u2019 application is indeed timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition on procedural grounds <em>de novo. Butler v. Cain, </em>533 F.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) restricts the time for filing a writ of habeas corpus to no longer than one year after \u201cthe date on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>which the judgment became final by conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Under <em>Jimenez, </em>when a petitioner is granted the right to file an out-of-time appeal, the limitations period for the filing of a \u00a7 2254 petition starts anew. 129 S.Ct. at 686. The date upon which a conviction becomes final for the calculation of the \u00a7 2254 time limitation in such a situation is the \u201cconclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686-87. In deciding <em>Jimenez, </em>the Supreme Court cited a Texas case for the proposition that \u201cthe order granting an out-of-time appeal restored the pendency of the direct appeal.\u201d 129 S.Ct. at 686. The grant of an out-of-time appeal in Louisiana is, similarly, a \u201creinstatement of [the] right to appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Counterman, </em>475 So.2d 336, 339 (La.1985). <em>See also Lee v. Cain, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 995, 173 L.Ed.2d 286 (2009) (vacating and remanding for consideration in light of <em>Jimenez </em>case in which district court had applied <em>Salinas </em>to \u00a7 2254 petition arising from case in which Louisiana court had granted out-of-time appeal on postconviction review).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Thus <em>Jimenez </em>applies to Brooks\u2019 petition. Brooks\u2019 conviction became \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)(A) on May 10, 2002, when the 30-day period for seeking certiorari review from the Louisiana Supreme Court on the denial of the merits of his out-of-time appeal expired. Brooks therefore had until May 12, 2003 to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition. On September 19, 2002, 131 days into this year-long period, Brooks filed his state habeas application, challenging his underlying conviction. This state habeas application tolled the limitations period until the denial of his supervisory writ by the Louisiana Fourth Circuit on March 11, 2005. Brooks filed a writ application with the Louisiana Supreme Court 11 days later, on March 23, 2005. Brooks was at that point 142 days into the one-year period. The limitations period was tolled again from March 23, 2005 until February 3, 2006, when the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the writ. At that point Brooks had 223 days left in his limitations period. He filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition 45 days later. The petition was thus timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">For the foregoing reasons we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
