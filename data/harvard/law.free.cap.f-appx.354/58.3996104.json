Alfred\u2019s IFP motion challenging the certification decision \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The district court is directed to dismiss a complaint filed by a prisoner if the complaint is frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) &amp; 1915(e)(2)(B). This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Alfred argues that the defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to provide him with a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) to treat his diagnosed severe sleep apnea. A plaintiff states a cause of action under the Eighth Amendment when he alleges that a defendant has, with deliberate indifference, exposed him to an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health. <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 35, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993); <em>Burle-son v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>393 F.3d 577, 589 (5th Cir.2004). To establish deliberate indifference a prisoner must show that the defendants \u201c(1) were aware of facts from which an inference of excessive risk to the prisoner\u2019s health or safety could be drawn and (2) that they actually drew an inference that such potential for harm existed.\u201d <em>Burleson, </em>393 F.3d at 589. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cDeliberate indifference encompasses only unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Stalder, </em>105 F.3d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cDisagreement with medical treatment does not state a claim for Eighth Amendment indifference to medical needs.\u201d <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The record shows that Alfred received adequate medical treatment for his sleep apnea during his stay at Forcht Wade Correctional Center. Further, an affidavit by Dr. Alphonzo Pacheco establishes that Alfred continued to receive medical attention for his sleep apnea following his transfer to Winn Correctional Center and that the sleep apnea never posed a serious risk to Allred\u2019s health. <em>See Burleson, </em>393 F.3d at 589. Alfred has been receiving CPAP treatments since May 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Alfred has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his Eighth Amendment claim as frivolous. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373. Further, contrary to Alfred\u2019s suggestion, he did not have a right to a default judgment simply because the defendants did not respond to his suit. <em>See Ganther v. Ingle, </em>75 F.3d 207, 212 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cA party is not entitled to a default judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>as a matter of right, even where the defendant is technically in default.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Alfred\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Alfred\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Alfred has at least one previous strike. <em>Alfred v. Lofton, </em>No. 1:08-CV-0554 (W.D.La. Sept. 9, 2008). Because Alfred has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Alfred\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
