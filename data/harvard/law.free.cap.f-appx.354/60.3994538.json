Six UNknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (allowing federal officials to be sued for claimed violations of constitutional rights). The district court dismissed the claims for lack of proper venue and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (governing proceedings <em>informa </em>pau.peris).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Jennings contends the Bureau of Prisons based his custodial classification at the United States Penitentiary in Pollock, Louisiana, on impermissible factors, including erroneous determinations of Jennings\u2019 history of violence and his lack of a GED. Jennings alleges he was found not guilty of the state assault charge upon which the court based its determination of his history of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The dismissal, under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), of a prisoner\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>-U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). Because there is no liberty interest in a prisoner\u2019s custodial classification, <em>Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992), Jennings\u2019 complaint fails to state a claim for relief. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">Jennings also filed <em>Bivens </em>claims against defendants in New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas; the district court dismissed these claims for lack of proper venue. Jennings does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing these claims. Accordingly, Jennings has abandoned any such challenge. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jennings\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Jennings: once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-18\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b83-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
