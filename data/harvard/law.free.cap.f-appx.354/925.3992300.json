He first argues that the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of methamphetamine attributable to him for sentencing purposes was clearly erroneous because it was not based on information having a sufficient indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and we review any factual determinations made in sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). There is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">In arriving at a drug quantity, the district court may rely upon information provided by codefendants and other witnesses, provided the information bears the minimum indicia of reliability. <em>United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 558 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the information relied upon by the district court at sentencing is materially untrue. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Faubion was held accountable for 15 ounces or 425.25 grams of methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This amount was based on the statements of Faubion\u2019s roommate, Chris Wilganoski. Wilganoski stated that he observed Joshua Lohmann at Faubion\u2019s residence on five separate occasions and that on each occasion Lohmann was in possession of at least three ounces of methamphetamine. Although Faubion presented testimony in an effort to rebut the statements of Wilganoski, the district court heard the testimony and determined that the testimony did not undermine the reliability of Wilganoski\u2019s statements or the drug quantity calculation. We will not disturb a district court\u2019s credibility determinations made at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996). The evidence relied on by the district court had a sufficient indicia of reliability, and the district court\u2019s factual finding regarding the amount of drugs attributable to Faubion is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764; <em>Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Faubion also contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a four-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2) for not participating in the drug offense beyond allowing the use of his home. The same de novo and clear error standards of review described above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>apply to this ground of error. <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764. Because Wilganoski\u2019s statements showed that Fau-bion did more than merely allow his residence to be used as a drug house, the district court did not clearly err in denying a reduction under \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2). <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), comment. (n.1). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-11\">. We do not consider whether the district court erred in including the 70.8 grams of methamphetamine that Faubion allegedly sold to Wilganoski. Even if the amount is not included in the drug quantity calculation, Faubion\u2019s base offense level remains 30. <em>See </em>Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(5) (providing for a base offense level of 30 where the defendant is responsible for at least 350 grams but less than 500 grams of methamphetamine).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
