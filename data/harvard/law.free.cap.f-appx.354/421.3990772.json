We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record excerpts and conclude that the district court did not err in compelling arbitration or in affirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Plaintiff did not substantiate her denial of the arbitration contract with evidence sufficient to made the denial colorable. <em>Chastain v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., </em>957 F.2d 851, 855 (11th Cir.1992). Nor did she demonstrate that the subsequent award falls into those narrow circumstances where we are authorized to set it aside. <em>See First Options of Chicago, Inc., v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). She has shown neither fraud, partiality, misconduct nor malfeasance on the part of the arbitrator. Nor has she demonstrated that the award was arbitrary, violative of public policy or entered in manifest disregard of the law. <em>See Scott v. Prudential Sec. Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1007, 1017 (11th Cir.1998). In the absence of such showings, we are without authority to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s Order affirming the arbitrator\u2019s award and judgment for defendants is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
