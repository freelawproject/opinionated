PRATT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The issue presented on this appeal, as in the companion case decided today, <em>Dietsch v. Schweiker, </em>700 F.2d 865 (2d Cir. 1983), is whether mailing a request for review of an administrative law judge\u2019s decision constitutes filing within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under the Social Security Act. Plaintiff\u2019s request for review, which was mailed on the last day of the 60-day period provided by the regulations, was dismissed as untimely by the Appeals Council. The district court held that under the regulations receipt of the application is required for timely filing and, since the Secretary\u2019s dismissal of the untimely request for review did not constitute a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We reverse and remand for the reasons given in <em>Dietsch v. Schweiker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Like that of Dietsch, Monferrato\u2019s request for review was dismissed by the Appeals Council because it was filed one day after the 60-day filing period had expired. Although Monferrato\u2019s claim was brought under Title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383c (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981), rather than Title II as was the case in <em>Dietsch, </em>the same analysis applies. The Secretary\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations and procedures, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (1976), and the judicial review provisions, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1976), are incorporated into Title XVI by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1383(c)(3) and (d), and the standards for judicial review under both titles are the same, <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 94-550, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-4, <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2347, 2349-50. In addition, the regulations at issue are virtually identical. <em>Compare </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.968(a) <em>with </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.-1468(a). Consequently, our decision in <em>Dietsch </em>compels the conclusion that if Monferrato\u2019s request for review was mailed within the 60-day period provided by the regulations, its dismissal by the Appeals Council was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\"><em>Dietsch </em>establishes that mailing constitutes filing under the regulations. Although we could not determine on the record there whether the mailing was timely, we can do so on the record in this case. The deadline for filing (mailing) was nominally August 23,1981, but this was extended by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.120(d) to August 24, because August 23 was a Sunday. Apparently, this circumstance was not brought to the attention of the Appeals Council. It is clear however that since Monferrato\u2019s request for review was mailed and postmarked on August 24, 1981, it was timely filed. Therefore, the case should be returned to the Appeals Council for further consideration pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.-1467, 416.1481.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the district court with a direction to remand to the agency for disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
