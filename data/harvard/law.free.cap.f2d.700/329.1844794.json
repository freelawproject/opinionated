Moore remained incarcerated for some 10 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">This case was tried before Judge Joiner prior to the decision in <em>Monell v. </em>Depart<em>ment of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and a stipulation was entered in this case between the parties dismissing the City and the Police Department. Basing his holding on the good faith of the officers in relying on Department regulations, Judge Joiner subsequently dismissed the case against the police officers concerned, citing <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The cause of action against the City of Detroit was, as noted above, dismissed before <em>Monell </em>had been decided by the Supreme Court and is not as a consequence at issue in this appeal in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">We affirm the memorandum opinion and order of Judge Joiner in dismissing the case against the police officers on the basis of their good faith reliance upon the Department\u2019s regulations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
