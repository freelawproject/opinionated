The district court granted Everett\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the ground that it was legally impossible for Everett to commit the crime. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>520 F.Supp. 46 (KD.Pa.1981). The United States appeals from the judgment of acquittal. We will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDING BELOW An undercover agent from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arranged to purchase metamphetamine and P-2-P from Mr. Ralph Horan. Both metamphetamine and P-2-P are non-narcotic controlled substances, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c) Sch. I, II (1976); P-2-P has no other use than in the manufacture of metamphetamine. On February 4, 1981, the government arrested Horan after he sold the agent metamphetamine but before the P-2-P deal could be consummated. Horan identified Everett as his source for the P-2-P and metamphetamine, said that the P-2-P was still in Everett\u2019s hands, and agreed to cooperate in closing the P-2-P deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">Horan then had several telephone conversations with Everett which were tape recorded by the DEA. In those conversations the two set up a meeting at which Horan would buy six pints of Everett\u2019s P-2-P at $1250 per pint. Horan also informed Everett that Horan\u2019s \u201cclient\u201d wanted to inspect a sample of the P-2-P before giving Everett the money. Everett agreed to provide a sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">At the appointed time Horan, unaccompanied, entered Everett\u2019s house while DEA agents posing as the \u201cclient\u201d remained outside in a car. Everett gave Horan one pint of the liquid as a sample. Horan took the pint to the waiting agents who performed a quick field test. The test indicated that the liquid was P-2-P. DEA agents then entered the house and placed Everett under arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once in custody Everett gave a statement to DEA agents. He identified the substance as P-2-P and said that he had gotten it from Mr. Joseph Jackson, who in turn had obtained it from someone known to Everett only as Frank. App. at 150a, 159a; Trial Transcript of May 22, 1981, at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">The grand jury returned an indictment charging Everett with distribution and possession of P-2-P in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequent tests by the DEA revealed, however, that despite strong physical resemblance to P-2-P the sample pint of liquid was not P-2-P or any other controlled substance. The government then obtained a superseding indictment of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>counts under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count I charged that Everett had conspired with Horan to distribute the metamphetamine sold to the DEA agent. Count II charged that Everett did knowingly and intentionally attempt to distribute P-2-P.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Everett pled not guilty to both counts. During trial the government introduced the tapes and the testimony of Horan and the agents. A chemist for the DEA testified that the sample pint of liquid was not P-2P. Everett did not testify or call any witnesses. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge emphasized that to convict on Count II it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Everett believed the pint of liquid to be P-2-P.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The jury acquitted Everett on Count I. It convicted him on Count II of attempting to distribute P-2-P. Everett then moved for judgment of acquittal on Count II. The trial judge held that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Everett believed the pint of liquid to be P-2-P. Nonetheless, the trial judge set aside the verdict of guilty on Count II and entered judgment of acquittal on the ground that there could be no attempt as the liquid distributed by Everett was not P-2-P or any other controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">The government now takes an appeal of right pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1976) from the entry of judgment of acquittal after a jury verdict of guilty. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Christensen, </em>673 F.2d 713, 717-19 (3d Cir.1982); <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 352-53, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1026-27, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975). We have jurisdiction under section 3731 to hear the appeal. <em>United States v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d 578, 580 n. 1 (3d Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">In his motion for judgment of acquittal, Everett claimed that the fact that the sample liquid was not P-2-P or any other controlled substance prevented his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976). He argued that based on our holding in <em>United States v. Berrigan, </em>482 F.2d 171 (3d Cir.1973), it was legally impossible for him to violate the statute. The district court held that it was required under <em>Berrigan </em>to reverse Everett\u2019s conviction. 520 F.Supp. at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">In <em>Berrigan </em>a federal prisoner tried to smuggle several letters out of his penitentiary using as a courier another prisoner on study-release. The warden learned of the prisoner\u2019s first letter; the courier carried all subsequent letters with the knowledge and consent of the warden. The prisoner was then convicted of attempting to send the letters from a federal penal institution without the knowledge and consent of the warden. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 (1976); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.1 (1981).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prisoner appealed his convictions for the passing of all letters but the first, arguing that the government had failed to prove all elements of the crime charged. 482 F.2d at 184. We reversed the convictions, holding that the government did not and could not prove absence of knowledge and consent of the warden \u201cbecause it was a legal impossibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\"><em>Berrigan </em>does not control the result in this case. Unlike <em>Berrigan, </em>this case involves a statute by which Congress intended to punish attempts even when completion of the attempted crime was impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">\n<em>Congressional Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">The problem confronting this court in <em>Berrigan </em>was that of statutory interpretation. We refused to uphold the prisoner\u2019s convictions on any basis other than the statute enacted by Congress. \u201cFederal criminal law is purely statutory, there is no federal common law of crimes.\u201d 482 F.2d at 185. We therefore turned to \u201cthe rudiments of the law of attempt\u201d for the basis of our decision. 482 F.2d at 187. We held that the prisoner\u2019s conduct did not amount to an attempt under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 (1976). We stated in conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-16\">Congress has not yet enacted a law that provides that intent plus act plus conduct constitutes the offense of attempt irrespective of legal impossibility. Until such time as such legislative changes in the law take place, this court will not fashion a new non-statutory law of criminal attempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 190.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">In this case we are confronted with the interpretation of another attempt provision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>section 406 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976). We cannot rest on <em>Berrigan\u2019s </em>interpretation of what Congress meant by the word \u201cattempts\u201d when it enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 (1976). Instead we must examine legislative intent anew. If Congress chose in enacting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976) to define \u201cattempt\u201d to punish efforts to violate section 841 regardless of impossibility, that intent governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">When Congress used the word \u201cattempt\u201d in section 846 it used a common law term. Impossibility, of course, is also a creation of the common law, originally expounded as part of the definition of \u201cattempt.\u201d Generally, where Congress uses a common law term in a federal criminal statute without otherwise defining it, Congress is presumed to adopt the meaning given that term at common law. <em>Morissette v. United </em>States, 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 249, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952); <em>United States v. Nedley, </em>255 F.2d 350, 357 (3d Cir.1958). Of course, Congress is not compelled to adopt common law concepts when it creates a statutory crime. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 406, 100 S.Ct. 624, 632, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). If Congress uses a .term in a criminal statute which has no widely accepted common law meaning at the time of enactment, the term should be given the meaning consistent with the purpose of the enactment and its legislative history. <em>United States v. Turley, </em>352 U.S. 407, 411-13, 77 S.Ct. 397, 399-400,1 L.Ed.2d 430 (1957). Even if the word had a generally accepted common law meaning, the courts will not impose that meaning if there are \u201cgrounds for inferring an affirmative instruction from Congress\u201d to define it otherwise. <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 273, 72 S.Ct. at 255. For example, the courts should not infer congressional adoption of a common law definition plagued by \u201chair-splitting distinctions.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>444 U.S. at 406-07, 100 S.Ct. at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">We are convinced that Congress intended to eliminate the defense of impossibility when it enacted section 846.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, when Congress enacted section 846 the doctrine of impossibility had become enmeshed in unworkable distinctions and was no longer widely accepted as part of the meaning of \u201cattempt\u201d at common law. Second, the legislative history and purpose of section 846 provide grounds for inferring an affirmative instruction from Congress to define \u201cattempt\u201d to exclude the defense of impossibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>When Congress enacted section 846 in 1970, the doctrine of impossibility had become mired in fine distinctions and had lost whatever acceptance at common law it may have possessed when the statute considered in <em>Berrigan </em>was first enacted in 1930. A few years before, the Supreme Court had questioned whether the doctrine of impossibility \u201cwith all its subtleties\u201d had any \u201ccontinuing validity\u201d in the law of criminal attempt. <em>Osborn v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 323, 333, 87 S.Ct. 429, 434, 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966). The doctrine had become \u201ca source of utter frustration,\u201d plunging the state courts into a \u201cmorass of confusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>13 U.S.C.M.A. 278, 286-87, 32 C.M.R. 278, 286-87 (1962). Attempts to apply the doctrine had resulted in \u201cconsiderable conflict of authority\u201d among common law courts. <em>Id.; accord United States v. Hair, </em>356 F.Supp. 339, 342 (D.D.C. 1973). A 1970 annotation of the common law found in the cases \u201ca definite trend toward restricting or eliminating the defense.\u201d Annot., 37 A.L.R.3d 375, 381 (1970). For example, one state court surveyed the \u201cconfused mass of law throughout the country\u201d and rejected the defense of impossibility, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-5\">Our examination of these authorities convinces us that the application of the defense of impossibility is so fraught with intricacies and artificial distinctions that the defense has little value as an analytical method for reaching substantial justice .... We think the effort to compartmentalize factual patterns into these categories of factual or legal impossibility is but an illusory test leading to contradictory, and sometimes absurd, results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Moretti, </em>52 N.J. 182, 189, 244 A.2d 499, 503, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 952, 89 S.Ct. 376, 21 L.Ed.2d 363 (1968); <em>accord Hair, </em>356 F.Supp. at 342; <em>Thomas, </em>13 U.S.C.M.A. at 286, 32 C.M.R. at 286. Another state court, bound by precedent to apply the doctrine, criticized the distinctions between types of impossibility as \u201cmore theoretical than practical\u201d and urged the state legislature to adopt a \u201cprogressive and more modern view.\u201d <em>People v. Rollino, </em>37 Misc.2d 14, 18-19, 22, 233 N.Y.S.2d 580, 584-86 (1962); <em>accord Booth v. State, </em>398 P.2d 863, 872 (Okl.Cr.App.1964). By 1970 the abolition of the defense of impossibility had become \u201cthe overwhelming modern position.\u201d I Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws 360 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">It was with this backdrop that the President in 1969 proposed the first provision to make criminal an attempt to commit an offense under the drug laws.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 504 of the President\u2019s proposal punished attempt in language identical to that of the present 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bills adopting the President\u2019s proposal and containing the provision were introduced in both the House and the Senate. H.R. 13472, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 504 (1969); H.R. 13743, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 504 (1969); S. 2637, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 504 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The Senate acted first. In the Senate-passed bill the attempt provision was amended to substitute the word \u201cendeavor\u201d for \u201cattempt.\u201d S. 3246, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 504 (1970). The Senate report left no doubt that the change was meant to abolish the defense of impossibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>The Committee has used the word \u201cendeavor\u201d in section 504 to avoid the maze of hypertechnical defenses which have arisen over the years with respect to criminal attempts, and to make clear that the section is interested [sic] to reach any effort or essay to accomplish the evil purposes that the Act is designed to prevent. <em>U.S. v. Russell, </em>255 U.S. 138, 143 [41 S.Ct. 260, 261, 65 L.Ed. 553]; <em>Osborn v. U.S., </em>385 U.S. 323, 332-333 [87 S.Ct. 429, 434-35, 17 L.Ed.2d 394].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">S.Rep. No. 91-613, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1969).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">In the House the Senate-passed bill eventually was renumbered H.R. 17463; its attempt provision still used the word \u201cendeavor.\u201d H.R. 17463, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 504 (1970). The House considered H.R. 17463 along with H.R. 13742, which used the word \u201cattempt.\u201d In commenting on the two bills, Administration witnesses used the words \u201cendeavor\u201d and \u201cattempt\u201d interchangeably.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No witness in the Ways and Means Committee Hearings recommended that the \u201cendeavor\u201d provision of H.R. 17463 be changed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A new bill was then introduced to add to the bill passed by the Senate a new title addressing the need for preventing drug addiction. H.R. 18583, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., tit. I (1970). Although nothing in the reasons advanced in favor of that new bill suggested that any change was intended in the attempt provision, the new bill used the word \u201cattempt\u201d rather than \u201cendeavor.\u201d H.R. 18583, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 506. House members were advised, however, that the new bill punished the same conduct as had section 504 of H.R. 17463:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag6\">ENDEAVOR AND CONSPIRACY\u2014 H.R. 17463 <em>and H.R. 18583 </em>both provide that any person who endeavors or conspires to commit any offense under the Act may be punished by imprisonment and/or fine, which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for committing the offense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">There was no further comment concerning the attempt provisions. After an unrelated amendment caused the attempt provision of H.R. 18583 to be renumbered as section 406, the bill passed the House and Senate. Section 406 was codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">The purpose of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act gives further indication of what Congress intended when it enacted section 846. In the gradual evolution of the prior federal drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>laws \u201cCongress [had] manifested an attitude not of lenity but of severity toward violation of the narcotics laws.\u201d <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 391, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958). \u201c[T]he history of narcotics legislation in this country \u2018reveals the determination of Congress to turn the screws of the criminal machinery \u2014 detection, prosecution and punishment \u2014 tighter and tighter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 343, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1144, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981) (quoting <em>Gore, </em>357 U.S. at 390, 78 S.Ct. at 1283). Faced with a drug abuse problem that had grown to \u201cepidemic proportions,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 6, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 4566, 4569, Congress turned the screws tighter still by enacting the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act to strengthen the drug laws. <em>Albernaz, </em>450 U.S. at 343, 101 S.Ct. at 1144; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 139, 96 S.Ct. 335, 343, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975); <em>United States v.

Congress embraced the philosophy that \u201cthe illegal traffic in drugs should be attacked with the full power of the Federal Government. The price for participation in this traffic should be prohibitive. It should be made too dangerous to be attractive.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 9, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4566, 4574r-75. To squelch the drug traffic Congress drew the statute to cover \u201cjust about everything.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 33656 (1970) (remarks of Rep. Randall). As we found in <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>593 F.2d 210 (3d Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 948, 99 S.Ct. 2172, 60 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1979), a reading of the Act and its legislative history</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am3\">makes it apparent that Congress, in legislating against drug use, intended to encompass every act and activity which could lead to proliferation of the drug traffic. Nothing in the statute indicates any congressional intent to limit the reach of this legislation, which is described in its title as \u201cComprehensive.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>gut law enforcement efforts to infiltrate drug supply chains. The government goes undercover not only as purchaser, as in the instant case, but as seller, e.g., <em>United States v. Korn, </em>557 F.2d 1089 (5th Cir. 1977), or as middleman, e.g., <em>United States v. Heng Awkak Roman, </em>356 F.Supp. 434 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>484 F.2d 1271 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 978, 94 S.Ct. 1565, 39 L.Ed.2d 874 (1974). The DEA has apparently adopted the laudable policy of not supplying real drugs in such investigative efforts. <em>United States v. Pietri, </em>683 F.2d 877, 879 (5th Cir. 1982). If such impossibility is a defense, the government will be forced to furnish real drugs or abandon hope of obtaining attempt convictions. Given the horrendous difficulties confronted by law enforcement authorities in dealing effectively with the burdgeoning drug traffic, it is difficult to assume that Congress intended to deprive them of \u201cflexibility adequate to counter effectively such criminal activity.\u201d <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 495 n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1653 n. 7, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 212-13; <em>see United States v. Bommarito, </em>524 F.2d 140,144 (2d Cir.1975) (section 846 is \u201call-inclusive\u201d). A spokesman for the bill emphasized that it provided \u201ca comprehensive range of offenses which will render unlawful all drug-related activities which will defeat the purposes of this bill.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 33314 (1970) (remarks of Rep. Bush).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">In light of the legislative history and purpose of section 846, we conclude that Congress did not intend to adopt the old common law definition of attempt. The Senate clearly intended that the doctrine of impossibility, whose viability at. common law was questionable at best, should not hamper federal efforts to enforce the drug laws. Members of the House were assured that the substitution of H.R. 18583 for the Senate bill worked no changes in the Senate\u2019s prohibition of any effort or essay to commit a drug-related offense. We cannot believe that when Congress created an attempt provision as part of an all-out effort to reach all acts and activities related to the drug traffic,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the House without comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>substituted the word \u201cattempt\u201d in order to give section 846 the narrowest possible meaning. <em>See United States v. Turley, </em>352 U.S. 407, 413-17, 77 S.Ct. 397, 400-02, 1 L.Ed.2d 430 (1957).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Impossibility is therefore no defense to the charge of attempted distribution of a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">\n<em>The Government\u2019s Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The distribution of a noncontrolled substance believed to be a controlled substance thus constitutes an attempt to distribute a controlled substance under section 846. In this case the government established that Everett believed that the substance he distributed was P-2-P. It also proved that Everett distributed the substance knowingly and intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Of course, the crime of attempt is not established by proving <em>\u201cmens rea simpliciter.\u201d Berrigan, </em>482 F.2d at 189 n. 39. The offense of attempt \u201cconsists primarily in the intention with which the preparations were made.\u201d <em>United States v. Quincy, </em>31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 445, 466, 8 L.Ed. 458 (1832); <em>see United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 405, 100 S.Ct. 624, 632, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). Intent, however, is not \u201cthe sole criterion to be considered in determining criminal responsibility,\u201d <em>Berrigan, </em>482 F.2d at 188, because of the difficulties of proof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APp\">While <em>mens rea </em>is certainly within one\u2019s control it is not subject to direct proof; it is proved by circumstantial evidence only.

To prevent mistaken convictions the government must introduce some measure of objective evidence corroborating the attempted distribution of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">The Fifth Circuit has suggested the proper standard of proof to be required of the government in this case. That circuit shared our concern that the crime of at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tempt not be used to \u201cpunish one\u2019s thoughts, desires, or motives, through indirect evidence, without reference to any objective fact.\u201d <em>United States v.

It has proven objective acts performed by Everett which are sufficient to mark his conduct as criminal without reliance on <em>mens rea. </em>The government established not only that Everett promised to sell a controlled substance and that he transferred the substance furtively, but also that immediately after arrest and proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings Everett confessed, identifying the substance he had distributed as P-2-P and revealing that he had gotten his P-2-P from Joseph Jackson who had obtained it from Frank. This statement unequivocably marked his conduct as an attempt to distribute P-2-P.

No brief has been filed on Everett\u2019s behalf. A review of the record reveals that pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 3(d) the clerk of the district court served notice of the filing of the government\u2019s timely notice of appeal upon Everett\u2019s retained trial counsel, Warren R. Hamilton, as counsel of record. Hamilton did not subsequently file a formal appearance as required by Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 9(2). He made a de facto appearance on the appellate scene, however, when he consented to the government\u2019s motion for permission to file its brief out of time. The government filed its brief on February 18, 1982. After no appellee\u2019s brief had been filed within thirty days as required by FedR.App.P. 31(a), the government moved to have the appeal heard on its brief only. On May 26, 1982, having received no reply to the government\u2019s request, we denied the motion. Instead we issued an order stating that unless Everett filed and served his brief within ten days we would schedule the case for disposition on the government\u2019s brief only. Pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 45(c), that order was sent only to Hamilton. We received no response prior to the submission of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">If an appellee after proper notice fails to file a brief, then we may decide the case on the brief of the appellant only.

A criminal defendant represented by counsel at trial receives constitutionally adequate notice when his trial counsel receives actual notice of the government\u2019s appeal. <em>See generally In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 273, 68 S.Ct. 499, 507, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948).

Everett may raise any such claim only in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2555 (1976) at which time the district court may develop an appropriate factual record. <em>United States v.

In reaching that conclusion, we were referring to proposals then before Congress to create a federal general attempt statute applicable to every federal offense, akin to the general conspiracy provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1976). 482 F.2d at 186, 189. The proposed attempt provision, \u00a7 1001, stated that impossibility would not be a defense. Final Report of the National Commission on Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws \u00a7 1001(1) (1971). Explaining the addition of the provision, the Commission stated that the question of whether impossibility was a defense to a charge of attempt under federal law had not been directly addressed in the federal courts, I Working Papers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>National Commission on Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws 360 (1970), and that \u00a7 1001 was the Commission\u2019s attempt to anticipate the question, <em>id, </em>and provide a uniform answer, Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code \u00a7 1001 comments (1970). <em>See Berrigan, </em>482 F.2d at 189 (proposed provision designed \u201cto fill an apparent void in existing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Congress has not enacted \u00a7 1001 or any other general attempt statute. Of course, the lack of such a general provision does not alter our responsibility to ascertain congressional intent where, as here, Congress has enacted a provision punishing attempts to commit a specific federal offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\">. We are thus in accord with the other federal courts which have considered whether Congress intended to allow the defense of impossibility when it used the word \u201cattempt\u201d in section 846. Those courts did not rely on the legislative history. When faced with defendants who had tried to distribute or possess a substance which the defendants believed to be controlled but which in fact was uncontrolled, those courts did conclude that impossibility is no defense under section 846. <em>United States v.

A district court in the First Circuit has held that a defendant\u2019s statement on arrest admitting trying to smuggle cocaine when in fact his substance was noncontrolled was an objective fact justifying conviction for attempted smuggling under the <em>Oviedo </em>standard. <em>Deangelis, </em>430 F.Supp. at 328, 331-322; <em>see United States v. Korn, </em>557 F.2d 1089 (5th Cir.1977) (payment of money is sufficient objective fact); Enker, <em>Impossibility in Criminal Attempts </em>\u2014 Legality <em>and the Legal Process, </em>53 Minn.L.Rev. 665, 692 (1969) (sale of look-alike drug is sufficient objective fact to convict for attempted distribution); <em>cf. United States v. Murray, </em>527 F.2d 401, 409 (5th Cir.1976) (finding evidence of conspiracy to distribute \u201ccontrolled\u201d substance insufficient under <em>Oviedo </em>when conspirator told undercover buyer that conspirator\u2019s supplier had \u201cburned\u201d them).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
