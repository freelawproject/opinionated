Johnson appeals from a judgment of the district court under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, granting him minimum statutory damages in the amount of $1000, plus his costs and attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal Johnson contends that the district court erred in concluding that \u201cactual damages\u201d under the Privacy Act is limited to out-of-pocket expenses, thereby denying him recovery for his proven and substantial physical and mental damage. This Court holds that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d under the Privacy Act does indeed include damages for physical and mental injury for which there is competent evidence in the record, as well as damages for out-of-pocket expenses. We therefore remand to the district court for a determination of the amount of recovery for Johnson\u2019s proven physical and mental injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-26\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-27\">Johnson, an attorney, was employed as a revenue officer by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from 1962 through 1977. After the Internal Security Division of the IRS received a memorandum from the Internal Audit Division stating that Johnson had received monies in interest from 1969 to 1972, the Internal Security Division opened an investigation of Johnson called a \u201cSpecial Inquiry Complaint\u201d on October 18, 1974. The inquiry\u2019s purpose was to determine whether Johnson\u2019s business transactions were proper in view of his employment. On October 24, 1975, this inquiry was converted into a \u201cConduct Investigation.\u201d During both the Special Inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Complaint and the Conduct Investigation, defendant IRS engaged in activities that resulted in numerous contacts with persons other than Johnson. It was not until March 18,1977 (after this suit was filed), when the IRS inspectors first interviewed Johnson himself, that the Internal Security Division collected any information directly from Johnson. Although the Internal Security Division ceased collecting information about Johnson after April 15, 1977, the investigation was not officially discontinued until March 8,1978. Prior to that latter date, on December 27, 1977, Johnson retired from the IRS on physical disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">On January 7,1977, Johnson brought suit under subsection (g)(1)(D)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Privacy Act, alleging that the IRS had intentionally violated section 552a(e)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act by failing to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from Johnson himself. On January 15, 1979, in an order ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found an intentional violation of section 552a(e)(2). On February 23-26, 1981, a nonjury trial was held on the issue of damages. The court found that the intentional failure of the IRS to comply with section (e)(2) of the Act had an adverse effect on Johnson, causing him to worry obsessively about the investigation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to incur a dramatic increase in the frequency of his attacks of reflux esophagitis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to suffer mental anxiety from depressive episodes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, however, found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>the physical injury (the increase in reflux attacks) and the mental anxiety did not result in an increase in Johnson\u2019s out-of-pocket medical expenses. Because the court concluded that \u201cactual damages\u201d recoverable under the Privacy Act is limited to out-of-pocket expenses, the court confined Johnson\u2019s recovery to the $1000 statutory minimum plus costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal Johnson argues that \u201cactual damages\u201d is not confined to out-of-pocket losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">II. <em>\u201cActual Damages\u201d Under the Privacy Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The Privacy Act allows recovery for \u201cactual damages\u201d sustained by an individual as a result of an agency\u2019s intentional or willful failure to comply with any provision of the Act which has an adverse effect<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the individual. Section 552a(g)(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-6\">In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">(A) actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-8\">(B) the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Johnson argues that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d allowed under the Act encompasses all the ordinary elements of compensatory damages, <em>e.g, </em>mental depression as well as physical injury, if these elements are supported by record evidence. The Government contends that \u201cactual damages\u201d refers only to out-of-pocket or pecuniary losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">A. <em>Plain Meaning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">This Court begins its inquiry with the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, the plain meaning of the language is ordinarily controlling. Johnson and the Government vehemently disagree as to the plain meaning of the term \u201cactual damages.\u201d Both parties cite numerous authorities supporting their respective usages of the term. <em>See, e.g, United States v. State Road Department of Florida, </em>189 F.2d 591, 596 (5th Cir.1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 903, 72 S.Ct. 291, 96 L.Ed. 676 (1952); <em>contra Morvant v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>429 F.2d 495, 496 (5th Cir.1970). After a review of the cited authorities, this Court concludes that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d has no plain meaning or consistent legal interpretation. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">B. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">Because the plain meaning of the term \u201cactual damages\u201d is uncertain, we seek illumination in the legislative history of the Act. In attempting to discern congressional intent from an examination of the legislative history of a statute, the Court looks to \u201cthe purpose the original enactment served, the discussion of statutory meaning in committee reports, the effect of amendments \u2014 whether accepted or rejected \u2014 and the remarks in debate preceding passage.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>611 F.2d 1074, 1080 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 889, 101 S.Ct. 246, 66 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-15\">1. <em>Purposes of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-16\">This Court has not heretofore sought to determine the meaning of \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy Act. In construing a statute, the court\u2019s \u201ctask is to interpret the words of [the statute] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>508 (1979). The purpose of the Privacy Act is set forth in its preamble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-5\">(b) The purpose of this Act [enacting this section and notes set out under this section] is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by law, to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-7\">(6) be subject to civil suit for <em>any damages </em>which occur as a result of willful or intentional action which violates any individual\u2019s rights under this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">\u00a7 2(b), Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a note, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2177, 2178 (emphasis added). Further enlightenment on the congressional purpose in enacting the Privacy Act is found in a report from the Committee on Government Operations which recommended passage of the Senate Bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">The purpose of S. 3418, as amended, is to promote governmental respect for the privacy of citizens by requiring all departments and agencies of the executive branch and their employees to observe certain constitutional rules in the computerization, collection, management, use, and disclosure of personal information about individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-11\">It is designed to prevent the kind of illegal, unwise, overbroad, [sic] investigation and record surveillance of law-abiding citizens produced in recent years from actions of some over-zealous investigators, and the curiosity of some government administrators, or the wrongful disclosure and use, in some cases, of personal files held by Federal agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-12\">It is to prevent the secret gathering of information on people or the creation of secret information systems or data banks on Americans by employees of the departments and agencies of the executive branch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-13\">It is designed to set in motion for long-overdue evaluation of the needs of the Federal Government to acquire and retain personal information on Americans, by requiring stricter review within agencies of criteria for collection and retention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-15\">It is also to promote observance of valued principles of fairness and individual privacy by those who develop, operate, and administer other major institutional and organizational data banks of government and society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">S.Rep. No. 1183, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 1-2, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 6916, 6917 (hereinafter USCAN), <em>and in </em>Legislative History of the Privacy Act of 1974, at 154-55 (1976) (hereinafter Source-book). The report states that \u201c[t]he premise underlying this legislation is that good government and efficient management require that basic principles of privacy, confidentiality and due process must apply to all personal information programs and practices of the Federal Government . ... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, USCAN at 6929, Source-book at 167. The report defines the concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-17\">\u201cPrivacy\u201d, then, is a shorthand term for the restraint on the power of government to investigate individuals, to collect information about their personal lives and activities in society or in ways which are banned by the Constitution, or for reasons which have little or nothing to do with the purpose of government or of the agency involved, as their powers are defined by the Constitution and specific statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, USCAN at 6932, Sourcebook at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">Senator Goldwater, a cosponsor of an amendment to S. 3418, explained what the concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d entails:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-20\">By privacy, I mean ... the right to be protected against disclosure of information given by an individual in circumstances of confidence, and against disclosure of irrelevant embarrassing facts relating to one\u2019s own private life, both rights having been included in the authoritative definition of privacy agreed upon by the International Commission of Jurists at its world conference of May, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>By privacy, I also mean what the U.S. Supreme Court has referred to as the embodiment of \u201cour respect for the inviolability of the human personality,\u201d and as a right which is \u201cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">120 Cong.Rec. 36,904 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>Sourcebook at 803. The purpose of the Privacy Act is succinctly summarized in a statement by Senator Erwin, a co-sponsor of S. 3418:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">The reforms wrought by S. 3418 have been a long time coming. This is true despite the fact that the principles it implements, of fair, honest, and responsible behavior by Government toward its citizens, are those recognized values of Western jurisprudence and democratic constitutional government. More important, they are the principles upon which our own Constitution rests. Their restatement as legislative guarantees are vital today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 36,891, Sourcebook at 769. In construing the statutory language, this Court must focus on \u201cthe purposes Congress sought to serve,\u201d since the interpretation this Court gives to the phrase \u201cactual damages\u201d must clearly conform to the purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Keeping in mind that the basic purpose of the Act is to protect an individual against an \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d the Court notes that in the Act\u2019s preamble, Congress stated that \u201cthe right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Section 2(a)(4), Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a note, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 USCAN 2177, 2178. The \u201czone of privacy\u201d safeguarded by the Constitution includes \u201cthe individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201d <em>Whalen v. Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 97 S.Ct. 869, 876, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Further corroboration of the fundamental importance accorded to the right of privacy by Congress is found in the words of Senator Nelson during debate over S. 3418:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-11\">[Uncontrolled Government snooping is a dangerous assault on our constitutional liberties. Those liberties are the cornerstone of our democratic system and any assault on them cannot be treated lightly. A society cannot remain free and tolerate a Government which can invade an individual\u2019s privacy at will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-12\">Government snooping is particularly dangerous because often it is executed without the knowledge or approval of those officials who are accountable to the public. This, in turn, increases the probability that Government invasions of individual privacy, as well as other fundamental constitutional liberties, will be accomplished by illicit means and for illegitimate purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">120 Cong.Rec. at 36,901, Sourcebook at 797. The Senator characterized the right to privacy as \u201cone of our most cherished liberties\u201d and as \u201cfundamental to the concept of democratic self-government where each individual\u2019s private thoughts and beliefs are beyond the reach of Government.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36,902, Sourcebook at 799. He declared that \u201c[a] right so vital to individual liberty and, indeed, to our constitutional system deserves rigorous protection by Congress .... \u201d <em>Id., </em>Sourcebook at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">It is instructive to review the conclusion at which the Tenth Circuit arrived after its examination of legislative history, especially the legislative history of the remedial provision of the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That court concluded that when Congress conferred standing to sue on an individual who has suffered an \u201cadverse effect,\u201d \u201cCongress was borrowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>from the common law tort of invasion of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Parks v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>618 F.2d 677, 682-83 (10th Cir.1980). That court stated that the invasion of a personal right is the essence of a common-law tort action for invasion of privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 683. The court held that mental distress or psychological harm, as a natural and probable consequence of an invasion of privacy, is a sufficient \u201cadverse effect\u201d to confer standing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">If Congress borrowed from the common law in designing the remedy provision, surely Congress was not unmindful of the common law when it selected the words \u201cactual damages\u201d for the accompanying damage provision. The Supreme Court has indicated that the primary damage in \u201cright to privacy\u201d cases is mental distress. <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 87 S.Ct. 534 n. 9, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967). Additionally, the Supreme Court has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN\">the rules governing compensation for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights should be tailored to the interests protected by the particular right in question \u2014 just as the common-law rules of damages themselves were defined by the interests protected in the various branches of tort law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\"><em>Carey v. Phiphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1050, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Logically, then, Congress, in choosing the term \u201cactual damages\u201d was tailoring the compensation to the nature of the privacy interest protected. Obviously, mental distress is the normal and typical damage resulting from an invasion of privacy, an invasion of \u201cour respect for the inviolability of the human personality.\u201d <em>See </em>Senator Goldwater, <em>supra </em>at 9. Interpreting \u201cactual damages\u201d to include only out-of-pocket losses would not only preclude recovery<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in large numbers of cases but also run counter to Congress\u2019 intent to \u201cpromote governmental respect for the privacy of citizens by requiring ... agencies and their employees to observe .. . constitutional rules.\u201d Furthermore, such a restrictive interpretation would inhibit rather than encourage the \u201cwidest possible citizen enforcement.\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1183 at 1 &amp; 83, USCAN at 6916 &amp; 6997, Sourcebook at 154 &amp; 236. In addition, confining \u201cactual damages\u201d to out-of-pocket losses would lessen government motivation to comply with the Act and thereby run counter to Congress\u2019 intent to \u201cpromote observance of valued principles of fairness and individual privacy by those who develop, operate, and administer ... government and society.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 2, USCAN at 6917, Sourcebook at 155. Such an interpretation would not, therefore, promote the implementation of \u201cfair, honest, and responsible behavior by Government toward its citizens,\u201d \u201cprinciples upon which our ... Constitution rests.\u201d <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. at 36,891, Sourcebook at 769. A federal act affording special protection to the right of privacy can hardly accomplish its purpose of protecting a personal and fundamental constitutional right if the primary damage resulting from an invasion of privacy is not recoverable under the major remedy of \u201cactual damages\u201d that has been provided by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">As previously noted, the Supreme Court has recognized that an award of compensatory damages for \u201cdistress\u201d (mental suffering or emotional anguish) is an appropriate remedy for deprivation of a constitutional right depending on the nature of the interests protected by the particular right. <em>Carey, </em>98 S.Ct. at 1052-53. Further guidance on compensation for constitutionally protected rights can be found from two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>circuits. The Eighth Circuit has stated that \u201c[although it is admittedly difficult to place a value upon the resulting emotional injury from the deprivation of a constitutional right, the common law has historically recognized a reasonable, and sometimes substantial, sum of damages for mental distress.\u201d <em>Williams v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>660 F.2d 1267, 1278 (8th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, the D.C. Circuit, finding recovery for established emotional distress and mental anguish appropriate for violation of fourth amendment rights,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-4\">This court has held that in cases involving constitutional rights, compensation \u201cshould not be approached in a niggardly spirit. It is in the public interest that there be a reasonably spacious approach to a fair compensatory award for denial or curtailment of the right * * * \u201d Specifying such damages will always be difficult, but they must be at least \u201can amount which will assure [the plaintiff] that [personal] rights are not lightly to be disregarded and that they can be truly vindicated in the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\"><em>Halperin v. Kissinger, </em>606 F.2d 1192, 1208 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>aff\u2019d by an equally divided Court in part, cert, dismissed in part, </em>452 U.S. 713, 101 S.Ct. 3132, 69 L.Ed.2d 367 (per curiam), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>453 U.S. 928, 102 S.Ct. 892, 69 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">2. <em>Amendments Rejected</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">While Congress expressed some concern over the scope of potential government liability for damages under the Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this concern was in no way intended to limit the recovery of damages for loss of reputation, embarrassment, and other forms of emotional distress. The House Bill, H.R. 16373, as reported from the Committee on Government Operations,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provided for actual damages <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> for a willful, arbitrary, or capricious violation by an agency. H.R.Rep. No. 16373,93d Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1974), <em>reprinted in, </em>Sourcebook at 288. In its consideration of H.R. 16373, the House rejected two amendments which are relevant to our inquiry: an amendment providing for punitive damages and a separate amendment making the Government liable for a negligent violation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The first of these, Representative Fascell\u2019s amendment, provided for punitive damages (in the case of a willful, arbitrary, or capricious violation). It was rejected largely because of congressional concern over the budgetary effect of punitive damages.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Representative Eckhardt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>stated that \u201cthe primary objection to the Fascell amendment was that the Government should not be subjected to punitive damages.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Similarly, the rejection of the amendment offered by Representative Moorhead (making the Government liable for a negligent violation) did not evidence any congressional concern whatsoever oyer the effect of making the Government liable for damages in excess of out-of-pocket damages. This amendment made the standard of liability that of an agency failure or refusal to comply with the Act. Much concern was expressed over the budgetary effect of liability on the Government for this lesser standard of conduct (mere negligence) or for a standard of absolute liability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nowhere does the legislative history intimate that there was any congressional concern whatsoever regarding making the Government liable for proven damages in excess of out-of-pocket losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-19\">3. <em>Debate Preceding Passage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-20\">Other remarks in the debate preceding passage of H.R. 16373 undergird an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>pretation of \u201cactual damages\u201d exceeding mere out-of-pocket expenses. Another representative was attempting to make the point that the Fascell amendment, by making actual damages available to an individual injured by an unintentional violation, corrected what in his opinion was a flaw in the bill. Representative McCloskey then made a significant statement concerning actual damages: \u201cI do not believe that the individual is denied actual damages if he can prove them. In cases of this kind, of course, it is quite often difficult to prove actual damages, but that is not necessarily a reason to establish the extraordinary remedy of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36,659-60, Source-book at 923. His statement evidences two points. First, actual damages must be <em>proven </em>damages \u2014 an individual is entitled to them only if he proves them. Second, if actual damages are hard to prove, they would appear not to be limited to out-of-pocket losses: these losses are \u201cquite easy\u201d rather than \u201cquite ... difficult\u201d to prove.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">A statement made by Representative McCloskey during debate over the Fascell amendment lends additional credence to an interpretation of \u201cactual damages\u201d which would allow recovery for proven elements which are difficult to quantify, such as mental distress. In speaking against a punitive damage provision because of the negative effect it would have on employees, Representative McCloskey referred to \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201cordinary damages\u201d: \u201cIf [the employee] withholds information, on the other hand, he is subject only to ordinary damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36,659, Sourcebook at 921. Certainly \u201cordinary damages\u201d are compensatory damages \u2014 not damages for out-of-pocket loss alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">A comment made during debate by Representative Moorhead himself concerning his amendment must also be considered. It provides additional support for interpreting \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201cproven damages.\u201d Prefacing his remarks with the statement that this amendment did not provide for punitive damages,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Representative Moor-head pointed out that the amendment placed the burden on the citizen who, in order to recover, would have to prove violation, causation, and damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-10\">The amendment does not contain a provision for punitive damages, which was objected to yesterday. There is nothing in this amendment, therefore, which subjects the Government to an undue burden. The burden is on the citizen. The citizen must prove that there was a violation of the provision of this act. He must then prove that the adverse determination which damaged him was caused by the above violation. He must finally prove the damages caused by the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 36,955, Sourcebook at 925. Clearly, Representative Moorhead\u2019s comment provides additional support for interpreting \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201cproven damages.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>4. <em>The Final Compromise</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALrq\">The Senate bill, S. 3418, as reported from the Committee on Government Operations, provided for actual damages for violation of any provision and punitive damages where appropriate. S. 3418, as passed by the Senate on November 21, 1974, (and referred to the House) provided for actual and general damages with a minimum recovery of $1000 for any violation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This was the first appearance of \u201cgeneral damages\u201d; it appeared simultaneously with the $1000 floor on recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The House bill, H.R. 16373, as reported from the Committee on Government Operations, provided for actual damages for willful, arbitrary, or capricious agency action. The Senate bill, S. 3418, as amended by the House, provided for actual damages for willful, arbitrary, or capricious agency action. The term \u201cgeneral damages\u201d dropped out of the Senate bill at this point. Senate bill, S. 3418, as passed with compromise amendments provided for \u201cactual damages\u201d for willful or intentional agency action and a floor recovery of $1000. Senator Erwin remarked that the compromise relating to damages<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was over the <em>standard of recov</em>ery:<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-12\">The standard for recovery of damages under the House bill would have rested on the determination by a court that the agency acted in a manner which was willful, arbitrary, or capricious. The- Senate bill would have permitted recovery against an agency on a finding that the agency was negligent in handling his records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-13\">These amendments represent a compromise between the two positions, permitting an individual to seek injunctive relief to correct or amend a record maintained by an agency. In a suit for damages, the amendment reflects a belief that a finding of willful, arbitrary, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>capricious action is too harsh a standard of proof for an individual to exercise the rights granted by this legislation. Thus the standard for recovery of damages was reduced to \u201cwillful or intentional\u201d action by an agency. On a continuum between negligence and the very high standard of willful, arbitrary, or capricious conduct, this standard is viewed as only somewhat greater than gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">120 Cong.Rec. at 40,406, Sourcebook at 862. The compromise relative to damages, then, was between a \u201cnegligence\u201d standard and a \u201cwillful, arbitrary, or capricious\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Regarding the deletion of \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d all the legislative history tells us is that (1) the House omitted the term \u201cgeneral damages\u201d when it amended S. 3418 and the term was never reinserted, and (2) Senator Erwin noted that one of the areas encompassed within the study authority of the Privacy Protection Study Commission was the question of whether the federal government should be liable for general damages occurring from a willful or intentional violation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The total lack of information concerning the deletion of the term \u201cgeneral damages\u201d prohibits this Court from concluding that \u201cactual damages\u201d refers to out-of-pocket loss only.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Indeed, a brief glance at <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>suggests at least two other equally plausible conclusions. According to Black\u2019s<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201ccompensatory or actual damages\u201d can be subdivided into general and special damages. If general damages is a mere category of \u201cactual damages,\u201d then there would be no need to separately specify them. A second and even more likely explanation for the disappearance of \u201cgeneral damages\u201d is that Congress was using the term to mean \u201cpresumed damages\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the term \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean \u201cactual injury\u201d in defamation cases.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Therefore, in deleting the. term \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d Congress was rejecting liability for presumed damages. Since <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974) was decided several months before Congress debated the Privacy Act legislation, it is not at all improbable that Congress was thinking in terms of \u201cdefamation language.\u201d The Court in <em>Gertz </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">The common law of defamation is an oddity of tort law, for it allows recovery of purportedly compensatory damages without evidence of actual loss. Under the traditional rules pertaining to actions for libel, the existence of injury is presumed from the fact of publication. Juries may award substantial sums as compensation for supposed damage to reputation without any proof that such harm actually occurred. The largely uncontrolled discretion of juries to award damages where there is no loss unnecessarily compounds the potential of any system of liability for defamatory falsehood to inhibit the vigorous exercise of First Amendment freedoms. Additionally, the doctrine of presumed damages invites juries to punish unpopular opinion rather than to compensate individuals for injury sustained by the publication of a false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>fact. More to the point, the States have no substantial interest in securing for plaintiffs such as this petitioner gratuitous awards of money damages far in excess of any actual injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">We would not, of course, invalidate state law simply because we doubt its wisdom, but here we are attempting to reconcile state law with a competing interest grounded in the constitutional command of the First Amendment. It is therefore appropriate to require that state remedies for defamatory falsehood reach no farther than is necessary to protect the legitimate interest involved. It is necessary to restrict defamation plaintiffs who do not prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth to compensation for actual injury. We need not define \u201cactual injury,\u201d as trial courts have wide experience in framing appropriate jury instructions in tort actions. Suffice it to say that actual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering. Of course, juries must be limited by appropriate instructions, and all awards must be supported by competent evidence concerning the injury, although there need be no evidence which assigns an actual dollar value to the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">94 S.Ct. at 3011-12 (emphasis added). If Congress was using \u201cactual damages\u201d as synonymous with \u201cactual injury,\u201d then the deletion of \u201cgeneral damages\u201d would have only indicated a congressional intent to require competent evidence in the record to support the injury. The various references in the legislative history to the fact that damages have to be proven lend support to the theory that Congress was using \u201cdefamation\u201d jargon.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">C. <em>The Interpretation of the Term \u201cActual Damages\u201d in Other Federal </em>Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Congress has seen fit to use the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in other federal statutes. Prior to the passage of the Privacy Act, the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(c), had been interpreted by the courts to include damages for emotional distress and humiliation as well as out-of-pocket loss. <em>Jeanty v. McKey &amp; Poague, Inc., </em>496 F.2d 1119 (7th Cir.1974); <em>Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., </em>491 F.2d 634 (7th Cir.1974); <em>Steele v. Title Realty Co., </em>478 F.2d 380 (10th Cir.1973); <em>Smith v. Sol D. Adler Realty Co., </em>436 F.2d 344 (7th Cir.1970).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is appropriate to charge Congress in the exercise of its legislative function with knowledge of these federal court precedents. <em>See Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677,99 S.Ct. 1946, 1958, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">Two other statutory civil liability sections which provide for \u201cactual damages\u201d are particularly significant: 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e. Both sections are part of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Both sections allow recovery for \u201cactual damages\u201d and both have been interpreted to allow recovery for emotional distress and humiliation.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Although this Court realizes it would not be fair to charge Congress with knowledge of the case law construing \u201cactual damages\u201d under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> this Court thinks that the interpretation of \u201cactual damages\u201d under this consumer protection legislation provides a persuasive analogy for the interpretation of that term under the Privacy Act. First, Congress was well aware of the existence of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and referred to it on at least two occasions during the debate preceding passage of the Privacy Act. An analogy was made to the Fair Credit Reporting Act concerning the costs of implementation of safeguards provided by the Privacy Act. S.Rep. No. 1183 at 84-85, USCAN at 6998-99, Sourcebook at 237-38. In addition, Representative Erlenborn, in connection with an amendment he offered to the Privacy Act, referred to how the Fair Credit Reporting Act provided protection for the confidentiality of sources. 120 Cong.Rec. at 36,646, Sourcebook at 889. Congress, therefore, had the Fair Credit Reporting Act in mind when it was debating the Privacy Act legislation. Secondly, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Privacy Act were congressional responses to the need for the individual privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. In the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Congress specifically found that there was \u201ca need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercised their grave responsibilities with ... a respect for the consumer\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a)(l)(4). Indeed, the courts have found that the purpose of the Fair Credit Reporting Act was to prevent unreasonable or careless invasion of consumer privacy. <em>See, e.g., In re TRW, Inc., </em>460 F.Supp. 1007 (D.Mich.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">Given that the purposes of the two acts are similar and given that the legislative history of the Privacy Act includes specific references to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, this Court thinks it appropriate to look to how the courts have interpreted the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The \u201cactual damages\u201d recoverable under section 1681n, imposing civil liability for willful noncompliance by any consumer reporting agency, have been uniformly interpreted to include mental anguish as an element of recovery. <em>See, e.g., Millstone v. O\u2019Hanlon Reports, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 829, 834-35 (8th Cir.1976), <em>aff\u2019g </em>383 F.Supp. 269, 276 (E.D.Mo.1974); <em>Bryant v. TRW, Inc., </em>487 F.Supp. 1234, 1240 (E.D.Mich.1980). In allowing recovery of actual damages for mental pain and anxiety, the Eighth Circuit refused to apply the rule in tort which precludes recovery for mental anguish alone:<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he rule is inapplicable because ... [plaintiff] has an independent cause of action under the Fair Credit Reporting Act quite apart from any recovery he might have sought in tort.\u201d <em>Millstone, </em>528 F.2d at 834r-35. The <em>Millstone </em>court affirmed the district court which had awarded plaintiff $2500 in actual damages for his mental anguish and symptoms of sleeplessness, nervousness, and frustration \u201cwhich were amply testified to,\u201d although he had suffered \u201cno lost wages nor incurred medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>expenses on account of the injuries.\u201d 383 F.Supp. at 276. Furthermore, the Court in <em>Bryant </em>held that proven embarrassment and humiliation were both proper elements of damages for jury consideration although there was not out-of-pocket expense. 487 F.Supp. at 1240.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">In addition, the \u201cactual damages\u201d recoverable under section 1691e, imposing liability on any creditor who fails to comply with any requirement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, have been interpreted to compensate for emotional harm. <em>Owens v. Magee Finance Service, Inc., </em>476 F.Supp. 758, 770 (E.D.La.1979) (allowing \u201cactual damages\u201d for mental anguish and humiliation); <em>Shuman v. Standard Oil Co., </em>453 F.Supp. 1150, 1153-54 (N.D.Cal.1978) (also allowing harm to one\u2019s \u201creputation for creditworthiness\u201d as an element of \u201cactual damages\u201d).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-20\">Although the court in <em>Shuman </em>allowed mental distress as a recoverable element of \u201cactual damages,\u201d the court held that such damages will not be presumed \u2014 plaintiff must prove them.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Significantly, the court stated that \u201cit would be inconsistent with the congressional purpose of eliminating invidious discrimination to ignore the emotional harm often flowing from it by limiting the aggrieved applicant to out-of-pocket losses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1154. Similarly, it would be totally inconsistent with the congressional purpose of protecting the right to privacy guaranteed by the Constitution if this Court ignored the primary damage resulting from a Privacy Act violation by limiting recovery to out-of-pocket losses. The statements of congressional purpose in the Act\u2019s legislative history belie the out-of-pocket interpretation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">An examination of the purposes of the Privacy Act, its legislative history, and other statutory uses of the term \u201cactual damages\u201d leads this Court to conclude that Johnson is entitled to compensation under the Act for his proven mental and physical injuries.

The court described plaintiffs preoccupation with the investigation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-12\">The plaintiff did not worry about the fact of the investigation as much as he worried about why he was being investigated and whether he had committed some unknown misdeed or crime. This uncertainty made it impossible for him to place the investigation in its proper psychological perspective. The plaintiff suffered from mental depression. He became irritable at work with his associates and with taxpayers. He became withdrawn, moody, and unsociable, whereas before he had been extroverted and outgoing. Plaintiff lost self-confidence. His sleep patterns changed from that of a sound six-hour sleep to a fitful two or three hours of sleep. He experienced a loss of appetite. His weight decreased from 167 pounds to 155 pounds. He noted a change in his energy level....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">. In his brief, counsel for Johnson describes the condition of reflux esophagitis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmO\">The condition of reflux esophagitis entails the involuntary regurgitation of stomach acid. During a reflux attack, Johnson first experiences a severe burning sensation in the upper part of his abdomen and chest. During regurgitation, Johnson\u2019s esophagus becomes red and inflamed. He experiences nausea, watering of the eyes, running nose, weakness, inability to catch his breath, and a headache develops. These physical phenomena may be mild or severe, depending on whether an attack is mild (IV2 hours) [sic] or severe (4-5 hours).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-16\">During a reflux attack, some of the involuntarily regurgitated stomach acid trickles into Johnson\u2019s windpipe and makes its way into his lungs where infection can result. Since Johnson\u2019s pulmonary condition makes him vulnerable to infection, he must take antibiotics (tetracycline) to combat infection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAM\">The court found that the increase in frequency of the attacks was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-17\">Prior to knowing about the investigation, the plaintiff had had a pattern of having minor attacks (of 10 to 20 minutes\u2019 duration) about every 10 days, and he had had a pattern of having a major attack (of up to 5 hours\u2019 duration) every 1 to IV2 months. After learning about the investigation, however, the pattern of his minor attacks increased to one every 3 or 4 days, and the pattern of his major attacks increased to one about every 10 days.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1021-18\">.

The Court recognizes this statement is ambiguous. On one hand, actual damages may be hard to prove because they encompass elements of mental suffering on which it is difficult to put a dollar value.

The House had expressed its objection to punitive damages the day before by rejecting Representative Fascell\u2019s amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">. A single comment made by Representative Eckhardt immediately following Representative Moorhead\u2019s statement might, at first glance, seem to provide support for an out-of-pocket definition of actual damages: \u201cThere is nothing in this that would provide for any damages beyond his actual out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d 120 Cong.Rec. at 36,956, Sourcebook at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\">The Court in <em>Houston v. United States Dept. of Treasury, </em>494 F.Supp. at 30 n. 13, seized on Representative Eckhardt\u2019s comment, which passed unchallenged, to support a congressional intent to limit \u201cactual damages\u201d to out-of-pocket expenses. Representative Eckhardt\u2019s statement must, however, be placed in the context of the debate. He was urging the passage of an amendment which allowed recovery on the basis of an agency\u2019s failure or refusal to comply with the Act without any showing of willful, arbitrary or capricious action as was required by the bill under consideration. The day before, Congress had rejected an amendment providing for punitive damages out of a concern that such damages would expose the Government to undue liability. Representative Eckhardt wanted to make clear that his amendment, although it did not require willful, arbitrary, or capricious action by the agency, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>not provide for punitive damages. He had postulated the case of a person who lost a job opportunity because his record inaccurately indicated that he had been discharged from a prior job. The inaccuracy in the record was due to a simple innocent mistake of a government agent rather than to any type of willful action. First, Representative Eckhardt\u2019s statement about \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d expenses was specifically directed to his particular example \u2014 the person who had lost a job because of the error. Little in this purely hypothetical example would have prompted a comment on damages for mental suffering. Secondly, it is clear from the way his statement was prefaced (\u201cthere is nothing in this____\u201d) that it was to remind Congress that his amendment did not provide for punitive damages which Congress had previously rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">This Court is convinced that Representative Eckhardt\u2019s statement, viewed in context, does not support an out-of-pocket definition of actual damages. In any event, it should be remembered that the amendment Representative Eckhardt was referring to was defeated. Furthermore, even if the comment were construed to support an out-of-pocket definition, other statements by other representatives counterbalance the comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">. The <em>Fitzpatrick </em>opinion reported that \u201c[ajfter much debate, the \u2018punitive damages\u2019 language was deleted in favor of a provision for \u2018actual and general damages.\u2019 \u201d 665 F.2d at 330 <em>(citing </em>Sourcebook at 371). The page cited contains only the civil remedy provision of S. 3418 as passed by the Senate. This Court has been unable to discover one word of debate over the removal of the punitive damage provision, the addition of \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d or the addition of the $1000 floor on recovery. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. at 36,885-36,917, \u201cSenate Considers S. 3418 as Reported by the Committee on Government Operations,\u201d Sourcebook at 763-838. The change in the civil remedy provision is reported only as a Committee amendment to S. 3418 which was drafted after the bill was reported on August 20, 1974, by the-Committee on Government Operations. <em>Id </em>at 36,-891, Sourcebook at 768.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">. Remarks made by the Senator that are not quoted indicate that there was also a compromise relative to injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">. The <em>Fitzpatrick </em>opinion viewed the compromise as a lowering of the standard for recovery (\u201cwillful, arbitrary, or capricious\u201d to \u201cwillful or intentional\u201d) in return for (\u201cin an obvious quid pro quo\u201d) the deletion of any recovery for general damages. This Court finds no support in the legislative history for this conclusion. On the contrary, Senator Erwin, in discussing the study authority of the Privacy Protection Study Commission, stated that the question of whether the federal government should be liable for general damages resulting from a willful or intentional violation was one of the issues not included in the compromise between the House and Senate bills. 120 Cong.Rec. at 40,405, Sourcebook at 859.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">.

This Court thinks it is a nonsequitur to conclude that \u201cactual damages\u201d must refer to out-of-pocket loss based on the fact that the Senate bill provided for recovery of both \u201cactual and general\u201d damages with \u201cgeneral damages\u201d later being deleted. <em>See Fitzpatrick, </em>665 F.2d at 330.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">.

The Court in <em>Houston, </em>494 F.Supp. at 30 n. 16, dismissed the analogy to the language in defamation cases out-of-hand, stating that \u201cThis definition of \u2018actual injury\u2019 in defamation cases under state law is not controlling in a statutory action for \u2018actual damages\u2019 under the Privacy Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">. The Privacy Protection Study Commission concluded that Congress intended the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy Act to be synonymous with \u201cspecial damages\u201d (tangible out-of-pocket losses) in defamation cases. This Court does not find the Commission\u2019s conclusion to be persuasive since the Commission\u2019s report indicated only that the basis of its conclusion was \u201c[t]he legislative history and language of the Act,\u201d without any further discussion whatsoever of either the legislative history or the language of the Act. Report of the Privacy Protection Study Commission, Appendix 4, \u201cThe Privacy Act of 1974: An Assessment\u201d at 105 (1977). Clearly, the language of the Act is ambiguous, and this Court\u2019s independent analysis of the legislative history of the Act leads to a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">It is interesting to note that the Commission\u2019s recommendation was that Congress amend the Privacy Act to include recovery for intangible injuries. <em>Id </em>at 106. \u201cIf the rights and interests established by the Privacy Act are worthy of protection, then recovery for intangible injuries such as pain and suffering, loss of reputation, or the chilling effect on constitutional rights, is a part of that protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">.

This Court notes that in the case at bar the district court specifically found that Johnson suffered physical consequences (the illness of mental depression and an increase in reflux esophagitis attacks) as a result of his emotional distress.

The Court in <em>Cherry v.

Evidently, the court was referring to the proper legal standard for proof of mental distress. The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s own testimony as sufficient to establish humiliation or mental distress.

This Court is not unaware that, subsequent to the enactment of the Act in issue here, the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in some pre-1974 statutes has been interpreted to mean \u201ceconomic\u201d loss.
