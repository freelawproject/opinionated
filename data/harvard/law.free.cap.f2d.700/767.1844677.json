Burke, appellee in appeal no. 82-1290 and appellant in nos. 82-1583 and 82-1584 [hereinafter plaintiff], against Elaine Guiney, Commissioner on Affairs of the Elderly of the City of Boston, and the City of Boston, appellants in no. 82-1290 and appellees in nos. 82-1583 and 82-1584 [hereinafter defendants]. Plaintiff alleged in that action that his discharge from the position of editor of \u201cBoston Seniority\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was in violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Prior to the scheduling of a trial date, the parties settled and filed with the district court an Agreement for Judgment. The Agreement for Judgment, approved by the court on June 24, 1981, provided for payment of $13,000 by the City of Boston to plaintiff. Paragraph three of the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff agrees to make no statements contrary to the provision of this agreement for judgment that the settlement of this action, reflected by this agreement for judgment, is neither evidence of nor an admission of liability by any of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">On August 1, 1981 a story about the settlement appeared in the Boston Globe. Claiming that statements attributed to plaintiff in the article violated paragraph three of the agreement, defendants moved on September 9, 1981 that the district court impose civil contempt sanctions on plaintiff. On March 12,1982 the district court denied the motion without discussion. Defendants appeal that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">While their motion for sanctions was pending, defendants refused to pay plaintiff the settlement amount. On December 10, 1981 plaintiff moved for approval of attachment of trustee process in an effort to collect the settlement amount plus interest from the date of judgment. After defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions was denied, defendant City of Boston expressed its willingness to pay the settlement amount but not post-judgment interest. After a hearing on June 18, 1982 the district court, on June 23, 1982, denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for attachment. At the conclusion of the June 18 hearing the parties agreed that plaintiff could accept payment of the principal amount of the settlement without waiving his claim for post-judgment interest. In an effort to pursue that claim, plaintiff appeals the denial of his motion for attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">Plaintiff also moved, on April 21, 1982, pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, for attorney\u2019s fees for the time spent in opposing the defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions. That motion was also argued at the June 18 hearing and denied without discussion on June 23. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">I. <em>The Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">Civil contempt is an appropriate remedy only \u201cwhen there is clear and convincing proof of a violation of a court decree.\u201d <em>Erhardt </em>v. <em>Prudential Group, Inc., </em>629 F.2d 843, 846 (2d Cir.1980). To be enforceable in contempt an injunctive decree must satisfy the specificity requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. See also Matter of Baum, </em>606 F.2d 592, 593 (5th Cir.1979); <em>H.K. Porter Co. v. National Friction Products Corp., </em>568 F.2d 24, 27 (7th Cir.1977) (court\u2019s order \u201cmust set forth in specific detail an unfequivocal command\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">Defendants argue that paragraph three of the parties\u2019 agreement for judgment, set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>out above, became when approved by the court an injunctive decree enforceable in contempt. Their only proof that plaintiff violated that decree is the August 1, 1981 Boston Globe article itself. Because the district court denied defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions without explanation, we do not know whether the court found that paragraph three of the Agreement for Judgment was not an injunctive decree enforceable in contempt, that defendants had not presented clear and convincing proof that plaintiff had violated the agreement, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Though some explanation of the court\u2019s reasoning would have been a most welcome aid to our review, we are not compelled to remand for a statement of reasons. \u201cA successful party in the District Court may sustain its judgment on any ground that finds support in the record.\u201d <em>Jaffke </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>352 U.S. 280, 281, 77 S.Ct. 307, 308,1 L.Ed.2d 314 (1957). Nor is this a case in which complex events make findings of fact prerequisite to our review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Agreement for Judgment and the allegedly offending newspaper interview comprise the essential factual record; they are before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Because we find that the Globe article did not provide clear and convincing proof that the agreement was breached, we need not decide whether the court\u2019s approval of that agreement made it enforceable in civil contempt. No statements directly attributed to plaintiff in the Globe article are clearly contrary to the agreement\u2019s provision that the settlement \u201cis neither evidence of nor an admission of liability by any of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">The article read in most pertinent part: \u201cIn [the agreement], the parties agreed the $13,000 settlement was \u2018neither an admission nor evidence of liability.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">Burke also agreed not to make any statements contrary to the stipulation in the agreement that it was a result of both parties \u2018desire to avoid further litigation and to compromise, adjust and settle\u2019 Burke\u2019s suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">In an interview from New York City, where he is an assistant editor at the National Law Journal, Burke said he thought the settlement vindicated his contention that his firing was illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">\u2018On the eve of the scheduling of a trial date in which the [White] administration would have had the opportunity to disprove my allegations, it chose instead to compensate me for what I have charged all along was an illegal attempt to convert the newspaper into a political organ for Mayor White,\u2019 he said.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">The statement directly attributed to plaintiff, while perhaps implying more, does not directly claim that the settlement was an admission of liability on defendants\u2019 part. The statement that \u201cthe settlement vindicated his contention that his firing was illegal\u201d, ambiguous in itself, appears to be the journalist\u2019s gloss on plaintiff\u2019s directly quoted .statement that follows immediately, rather than a separate statement by plaintiff himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">In addition to presenting clear and convincing evidence that a court order has been violated, a party seeking monetary damages in civil contempt, as defendants do here, must show that he has suffered damage as a result of the violation. <em>Parker v. United States, </em>153 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir.1946); <em>McGoff v. Rapone, </em>78 F.R.D. 8, 30 (E.D.Pa. 1978). Here, appellants argue, without elaboration, that they suffered injury to reputation as a result of the alleged violation of the settlement agreement. But the Globe article in which plaintiff\u2019s allegedly damaging statement appeared also noted that the \u201cparties agreed the $13,000 settlement was \u2018neither an admission nor evidence of liability.\u2019 \u201d In addition, the article quoted a spokesperson for the City as saying \u201cthe administration had decided \u2018it would be cheaper to settle out of court than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>to go through the expense of a court trial,\u2019 and calling [plaintiff\u2019s] suit \u2018a harassment suit.\u2019 \u201d In this context, even if we found that the statement attributed to plaintiff clearly violated the settlement agreement, we would have difficulty finding any damages to defendants resulting from the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Because we find that defendants have not carried their burden of demonstrating a breach of a court order with clear and convincing proof, we have no difficulty concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants\u2019 motion for civil contempt sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">II. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 to provide that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party\u201d in civil rights actions, including \u00a7 1983 actions, \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d Plaintiff moved pursuant to \u00a7 1988 for attorney\u2019s fees resulting from its successful defense against defendants\u2019 motion for civil contempt sanctions. The district court denied that motion after hearing but without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The district court \u201chas broad discretion to make the initial determination of whether to allow an award of fees\u201d, but that discretion is controlled by the standard \u201cthat a successful plaintiff \u2018should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sargeant </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>579 F.2d 645, 647 (1st Cir.1978) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968)). We have held that summary denial of entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees without hearing and \u201cwithout an adequate statement of reasons for the order does not meet minimum standards of procedural fairness and regularity. Nor does an order issued without a deliberate articulation of its rationale, including some appraisal of the factors underlying the court\u2019s decision, allow for a disciplined and informed review of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">There can be no question here that plaintiff, in realizing a favorable settlement, prevailed within the meaning of the statute on the underlying civil rights claim. <em>See Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.1978). But the settlement stipulated that it reflected \u201call claims for alleged damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs arising out of the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s claim here is not for attorney\u2019s fees in bringing about the settlement, but in successfully defending against defendants\u2019 motion for contempt sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Defendants argue that litigation over their motion for sanctions was unrelated to the merits of plaintiff\u2019s civil rights claims and that plaintiff\u2019s success in resisting that motion thus does not make plaintiff a prevailing party for purposes of the Act. It is well-established, however, that \u201c[f]ee awards are appropriate for time spent on efforts to secure compliance with court decrees, no less than for time spent securing those decrees.\u201d <em>Stenson v. Blum, 512 </em>F.Supp. 680, 684 (S.D.N.Y.1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>671 F.2d 493 (2d Gir.1981); see <em>also Baiark v. Curtin, </em>655 F.2d 798, 802-03 (7th Cir. 1981) (fee award for time spent on garnishment proceedings required to obtain satisfaction of an execution); <em>Miller v. Carson, </em>628 F.2d 346, 348 (5th Cir.1980) (fee award for time spent on post-judgment motions, including motion for contempt); <em>Northcross v. Board of Education of Memphis City Schools, </em>611 F.2d 624, 637 (6th Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>447 U.S. 911,100 S.Ct. 2999, 64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Here, defendants admit that they withheld payment of the settlement amount pending resolution of their motion for sanctions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">\u201c[T]he judgment was not promptly paid because of the plaintiff\u2019s behavior which cast a cloud over the judgment, thus requiring the defendants to seek a judicial determination of the parties\u2019 rights and a stay of the judgment until that determination was made ... [Defendants] also consistently maintained that the agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>to settlement amount would be promptly paid once the District Court determined the parties\u2019 rights and thereby lifted the cloud cast over the judgment by the plaintiff\u2019s statements. Finally, the defendants true to their representations, promptly tendered the agreed to settlement amount to the plaintiff after the District Court denied their motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">As acknowledged in this statement in defendants\u2019 appellate brief, defendants, in tandem with their motion for civil contempt sanctions, filed a motion for stay of execution of judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At argument on that motion below, defendants\u2019 counsel indicated that defendants sought, by way of the motion for stay of execution, \u201ca relief from [the] judgment, a temporary relief from judgment, until we got this whole matter as to whether the plaintiff was adhering [to] his responsibilities under the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHH\">Defendants, having made payment of the settlement amount contingent on the defeat of their motion for sanctions, cannot argue that plaintiff\u2019s defense against that motion was not in an effort to secure compliance with the underlying judgment. Plaintiff was faced with the choice of either not defending against the motions, thus risking further delay of the settlement payment and possibly endangering the judgment itself, or defending against the motion to remove the \u201ccloud\u201d from the judgment and secure the settlement payment. Nor would a finding that defendants\u2019 refusal to honor the judgment was based on a good faith belief that plaintiff had breached the agreement for judgment, rendering it void, preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees. \u201cGood faith by itself is not a special circumstance justifying a denial of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Teitelbaum v. Sorenson, </em>648 F.2d 1248, 1250 (9th Cir.1981); <em>see also Love v. Mayor, City of Cheyenne, Wyo., </em>620 F.2d 235, 236 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Lavine, </em>605 F.2d 638, 646 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>446 U.S. 913, 100 S.Ct. 1843, 64 L.Ed.2d 266 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Defendants also argue that plaintiff waived his right to attorney\u2019s fees when he agreed, in the Agreement for Judgment, that \u201cthe settlement reflected by this agreement for judgment reflects the settlement of all claims for alleged damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs arising out of the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d We think it is clear that the parties did not in this agreement contemplate waiver of attorney\u2019s fees arising from post-judgment legal action to enforce the settlement agreement. Indeed, though this provision applies equally by its terms to both parties, defendants in moving for civil contempt sanctions asked that the court award them attorney\u2019s fees incurred in bringing the motion. We find no waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">We thus conclude that plaintiff was a prevailing party eligible to receive attorney\u2019s fees under the Act for successfully defending against defendants\u2019 motions for civil contempt sanctions and for stay of execution of judgment. It was yet, however, within the district court\u2019s discretion to deny fees if there were \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d which \u201cwould render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966,19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5908, 5912 (adopting <em>Newman </em>standards for purposes of Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Act). But implicit within Congress\u2019s intent that plaintiffs \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee\u201d, <em>Id., </em>\u201cis a requirement that a court which denies an award of attorney\u2019s fees must issue findings of fact and conclusions of law identifying the \u2018special circumstances\u2019 and explaining why they render an award unjust.\u201d <em>Sethy v. Alameda County Water District, </em>602 F.2d 894, 897 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>444 U.S. 1046, 100 S.Ct. 734, 62 L.Ed.2d 731 (1980); <em>see also Kimbrough v. Arkansas Activities Ass\u2019n, </em>574 F.2d 423, 427 (8th Cir.1978) (determining eligibility under the Act but remanding for consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>eration of whether there were special circumstances rendering an award unjust). We therefore remand to the district court for an articulation of such special circumstances, if any. Among the special circumstances that may be considered are \u201cthe presence or absence of any bad faith or obdurate conduct on the part of either party, and any unjust hardship that a grant or denial of fee-shifting might impose.\u201d <em>Zarcone v. Perry, </em>581 F.2d 1039, 1044 (2d Cir. 1978). In the absence of special circumstances rendering an award unjust, the court should determine a reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">III. <em>Motion for Attachment of Trustee Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Plaintiff moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Mass.R.Civ.P. 4.2(a) for attachment of trustee process to secure satisfaction of its judgment with interest. The principal amount of the judgment having been paid, denial of the motion is appealed only with respect to post-judgment interest. Defendants argue that plaintiff\u2019s recourse was under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 alone and not under state attachment process. Even assuming state attachment process was proper, the district court was within its discretion in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion, in the absence of a showing that attachment was necessary to secure judgment. <em>See </em>Mass.R. Civ.P. 4.2(i) (court may issue orders \u201cfor cause shown\u201d ... \u201cas justice may require\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Defendants aver on appeal that there is no need for attachment procedures since defendant City of Boston is willing to pay post-judgment interest once entitlement is determined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201cThe denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion [for attachment of trustee process], moreover, does not prejudice his right to claim post-judgment interest because the defendant City of Boston has always maintained that it would pay this amount if the issue was properly raised and post-judgment [interest] legally due. Accordingly, if the plaintiff\u2019s legal position is upheld in this appeal, the plaintiff will receive the post-judgment legally due whether or not there had been an attachment on trustee process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">We think the issue of entitlement to post-judgment interest has been adequately raised. It was argued below and is argued again on appeal in the context of the motion for attachment of trustee process. We therefore treat that motion as implying a motion to compel payment of post-judgment interest and find such interest due.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">A party receiving a money judgment is normally entitled to interest dating from the entry of the judgment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. Defendants argue that plaintiff waived any entitlement to post-judgment interest when he agreed that \u201cthe settlement ... reflects the settlement for all claims for alleged damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs arising out of the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d They present no further evidence that the parties intended to waive post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Plaintiff contends that this provision of the settlement agreement contemplated only pre-judgment interest. That contention is supported by the further provision of the agreement that execution shall issue and by the subsequent issue of an execution commanding payment of the settlement amount with interest from the date of judgment. We hold that plaintiff is entitled to interest upon the settlement amount at the rate allowed by Massachusetts law, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, from the date of judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>June 24,1981, until the date of the payment of the principal amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court denying defendants\u2019 motion for civil contempt sanctions is affirmed; the judgment of the district court denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for attachment of trustee process is affirmed; the judgment of the district court denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; the district court is directed to enter judgment awarding to plaintiff post-judgment interest on the settlement amount.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-10\">.
