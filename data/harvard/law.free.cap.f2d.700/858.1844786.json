U.C.C. \u00a7 9-301(4) (McKinney Supp.1982). In this case, a judgment creditor from Virginia attempted to garnish an account held as collateral in Connecticut under a security agreement governed by New York law. The District Court (M. Joseph Blumenfeld, Judge) ruled, 538 F.Supp. 1049, that the garnishment was invalid under Connecticut law. We reverse because we conclude that Connecticut law is to be interpreted to permit the garnishment in order to effectuate the future advance clause of the Uniform Commercial Code. Whether the garnishor is now or will ever be entitled to collect its claim from the garnished account, however, must await further proceedings on remand and perhaps future events.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-19\">Best Banana Co. Inc. is a banana importer. To finance purchases from Ecuador, Best Banana entered into a General Loan and Security Agreement, including several supplementary riders, with appellee Aetna Business Credit, Inc. (\u201cAetna\u201d) on April 10, 1979. Under the Agreement, Aetna promised to lend money to Best Banana and to obtain letters of credit that would enable Best Banana to purchase produce from a Latin American supplier. To cover its obligations under the Agreement, Best Banana granted Aetna security interests in many of the company\u2019s assets, including then-owned and after-acquired inventory and accounts receivable and proceeds thereof. The Aet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>na-Best Banana Agreement called for Best Banana to forward all collections on its accounts receivable to an account maintained by Aetna. Under the Agreement, Aetna was authorized to use funds in this account to discharge specified obligations owed by Best Banana to Aetna. These obligations included principal and interest due on loans made under the Agreement, liabilities, losses, and expenses arising out of Aetna\u2019s application for letters of credit for Best Banana, and attorney\u2019s fees and expenses arising out of legal proceedings brought by or against Aetna because of its Agreement with Best Banana. Aetna\u2019s security interests were perfected in April 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">With its financing arranged, Best Banana began to import bananas. The company arranged for appellant Dick Warner Cargo Handling Corporation (\u201cWarner\u201d) to unload two boatloads of bananas at Portsmouth, Virginia, in June and July 1979. Warner unloaded the cargo, but Best Banana failed to pay $80,651.86 of the amount it owed Warner for the work. Warner then brought suit against Best Banana in a Virginia state court. In November 1979, Warner was awarded judgment against Best Banana for the entire claim. After obtaining its Virginia judgment, Warner came to Connecticut seeking to collect its money from funds held by Aetna for the account of Best Banana.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Connecticut law permits the assertion of quasi-in-rem jurisdiction by process of garnishment, which is also known in Connecticut as foreign attachment. <em>See </em>Conn.Gen. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-329 (West Supp.1981). Under Connecticut\u2019s procedure the creditor institutes an action against its debtor by garnishing the debtor\u2019s funds in the hands of a third party. If the debtor challenges the garnishment, the state court in the creditor-debtor action tests the garnishment only to the extent of determining whether there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the creditor\u2019s claim. <em>William M. Raveis &amp; Associates v. Kimball, </em>186 Conn. 329, 441 A.2d 200, 203 (1982); Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-278d(a) (West Supp.1981). If probable cause exists, the court then adjudicates the creditor\u2019s claim against the debtor and, if the creditor prevails, enters judgment for the creditor. The creditor then makes demand upon the garnishee for payment of the funds subject to the garnishment. If the garnishee refuses payment, the creditor may then proceed by a scire facias action, <em>see </em>Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-381 (West 1960), or a declaratory judgment action, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 235a, to secure an adjudication that the garnishee holds assets of the debtor that are subject to garnishment. <em>See Clime v. Gregor, </em>145 Conn. 74,138 A.2d 794 (1958). If the creditor secures judgment in the scire facias or declaratory judgment action, it is then entitled to have execution upon the garnishee, up to the amount of the garnished funds, to satisfy the judgment obtained against the debtor. <em>See generally </em>1 E. Stephenson, <em>Connecticut Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7\u00a7 56-74 (2d ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">On January 3, 1980, the Connecticut Superior Court granted Warner an ex parte, pre-judgment remedy that allowed Warner to garnish $90,000 of Best Banana assets in the possession of Aetna Business Credit. When Warner served process on Aetna on January 11, 1980, at which time Warner\u2019s garnishment took effect, there was $45,-789.11 in the account in which Aetna held the proceeds of Best Banana\u2019s accounts receivable. Up to that date, Aetna had received $399,366.02 into Best Banana\u2019s account and had used $353,576.91 of those receipts to discharge obligations incurred by Best Banana, as permitted by the Agreement. As of January 11,1980, Best Banana had no outstanding obligations to Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Shortly after process was served, Best Banana moved in the Connecticut Superior Court to dissolve the garnishment. That motion was denied after the state court found probable cause to sustain Warner\u2019s claim against Best Banana. The state court then ruled on June 25,1980, that in view of the Virginia judgment Warner was entitled to a Connecticut judgment for $80,651.86. After unsuccessfully demanding payment from Aetna, as garnishee, Warner brought this scire facias action against Aetna in the Connecticut Superior Court. Aetna re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>moved the action to the District Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted judgment in favor of Aetna. While the parties had assumed that the case would be decided under the \u201cfuture advance\u201d clause of the Uniform Commercial Code, N.Y.U. C.C. \u00a7 9-301(4) (McKinney Supp.1982), the District Court ruled that section 9-201 governed the case. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 9-201 (McKinney 1964). Section 9-201 provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this Act a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of collateral and against creditors.\u201d The District Court reasoned that the Agreement coupled with applicable Connecticut law protected Aetna against creditors like Warner. Under the Agreement, Aetna had the authority to hold the funds in Best Banana\u2019s account as security for liabilities incurred by Best Banana. Aetna was not obliged to return the funds until it was clear that no more obligations would arise under the Agreement. The District Court therefore concluded that Best Banana had only a contingent interest in its account with Aetna. Under Connecticut law, contingent interests cannot be garnished. <em>See Wilber v. New Haven Water Co., </em>37 Conn. Supp. 877, 880, 441 A.2d 863, 865 (1982); <em>accord Cibro Petroleum Products v. Fowler Co., </em>92 Misc.2d 450, 400 N.Y.S.2d 322 (Sup. Ct.1977). Believing that Warner\u2019s garnishment was invalid, the District Court ruled that Warner could not obtain payment from Aetna in a scire facias action. <em>See Burdett v. Roncari, </em>181 Conn. 125, 434 A.2d 941 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The District Court had ample basis for predicting that Best Banana would incur additional obligations to Aetna under the Agreement. In October 1980, the Ecuadorian firm that had supplied Best Banana brought suit against Aetna, along with Best Banana and a bank, on the ground that the letter of credit for which Aetna had applied on Best Banana\u2019s behalf had been dishonored. Under the Agreement, Best Banana was bound to reimburse Aetna for attorneys\u2019 fees expended in the defense of the Ecuadorian suit. Moreover, should Aetna ultimately be found liable to the Ecuadorian firm under the letter of credit, Best Banana would have to compensate Aetna for that liability. Under the Agreement, Aetna could use the funds in Best Banana\u2019s account to cover either or both of these obligations. The District Court concluded that this contractual arrangement left Best Banana with only a contingent interest in the account. However, by focusing on the contingency of Best Banana\u2019s claim, the District Court resolved the dispute between Warner and Aetna without reckoning with Uniform Commercial Code section 9-301(4), a provision added to the Code to determine the priority of future advances made by secured parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">The problem raised by this appeal is reconciling section 9-301(4) of the Uniform Commercial Code with the District Court\u2019s admittedly plausible reading of Connecticut garnishment law. Section 9-301(4) provides, in relevant part, \u201cA person who becomes a lien creditor while a security interest is perfected takes subject to the security interest only to the extent that it secures advances made ... pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Elsewhere, the Code states, \u201cAn advance is made \u2018pursuant to commitment\u2019 if the secured party has bound himself to make it, whether or not a subsequent event of default or other event not within his control has relieved or may relieve him from his obligation.\u201d N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 9-105(l)(k) (McKinney Supp.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>According to the official comments to the Uniform Commercial Code, section 9-301(4) was added in the 1972 amendments to establish \u201cthe extent to which advances made under a perfected security interest after the rights of a lien creditor have attached to the collateral will come ahead of the position of the lien creditor.\u201d On the facts of this case, section 9-301(4) is supposed to determine the extent to which advances made by Aetna to Best Banana after January 11, 1980, have priority over the Best Banana account upon which Warner obtained a lien on January 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The District Court\u2019s interpretation of Connecticut garnishment law prevented the Court from applying section 9-301(4) to resolve the dispute between Warner and Aetna. The District Court determined that because Best Banana\u2019s interest in its account was contingent, Warner did not have a valid garnishment, which is to say that Warner was not a lien creditor for purposes of section 9-301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">This analysis unnecessarily restricts the scope of the garnishment statute at the expense of the future advance clause. The reason why Best Banana\u2019s interest in the collateral was deemed contingent was that Best Banana had given Aetna a security interest in the collateral based on a security agreement that included a future advance clause. Since garnishments seem to be the only legal mechanism available in Connecticut to unsecured creditors for reaching accounts like the one involved in this case, the unintended consequence of the District Court\u2019s ruling is to give secured parties like Aetna, with broadly written future advance clauses, complete protection against intervening creditors like Warner, even as to future advances for which section 9-301(4) does not accord them priority. Clearly, neither New York nor Connecticut law warrants such extensive priority for secured creditors with future advance clauses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Given the far-reaching ramifications of the District Court\u2019s decision, we are reluctant to accept it unless compelled by Connecticut\u2019s law of garnishment. Connecticut cases require that for a debt to be subject to garnishment, the debt must be due and not contingent. <em>See Wilber v. New Haven Water Co., supra. </em>However, under Connecticut law, a garnishable debt need not be one on which the debtor could successfully demand immediate payment. <em>Wilber </em>itself recognizes that garnishments can be made on funds \u201cowing to a debtor at the date of garnishment, but payable in the future.\u201d 441 A.2d at 865. Furthermore, Connecticut holds that while a debt is not due if it does not arise until the occurrence of a condition precedent, <em>Chambers v. Blickle Ford Sales, Inc., </em>313 F.2d 252, 259 (2d Cir.1963); <em>Molloy v. Prudential Insurance Co., </em>129 Conn. 251, 27 A.2d 387 (1942), a debt is due and garnishable even though the debt may \u201cbe defeated by a condition subsequent.\u201d <em>Calechman v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>120 Conn. 265, 270, 180 A. 450, 452 (1935); <em>Goodman v. Meriden Britannia Co., </em>50 Conn. 139, 150 (1882). Thus, it is possible to say, as the District Court did, that the $45,789.11 in the Aetna account is not \u201cdue\u201d to Best Banana until Aetna\u2019s security agreement claims have been shown to be satisfied. But it could as well be said that the positive balance in the Aetna account was \u201cdue\u201d to Best Banana on January 11, 1980, subject to the condition subsequent that Aetna\u2019s claims \u2014 those for which section 9-301(4) entitles it to the benefit of its security interest \u2014 are satisfied out of the fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Given these two plausible ways of considering the \u201cdueness\u201d of the debt, we conclude that the better view is that, when<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ever the conditions of a security agreement affect the \u201cdueness\u201d of collateral, those conditions should be considered conditions subsequent. Collateral that is subject only to obligations arising out of future advances covered by a security agreement would then be garnishable under Connecticut law. This approach need not affect the normal operation of Connecticut garnishment law as to any debts except those held as collateral under security agreements. Our limited accommodation for debts held as collateral is warranted to give effect to the clear purpose of section 9-301(4) of the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so construing Connecticut law, we are emboldened by a recent decision of that state\u2019s Supreme Court interpreting, in a somewhat analogous situation, the law of attachment to accommodate the needs of related state statutory schemes. <em>See England v. England, </em>440 A.2d 790, 791-92 (Conn.1981); <em>see also Dorr-Oliver, Inc. v. Willett Associates, </em>153 Conn. 588, 593, 219 A.2d 718, 721 (1966) (\u201cgarnishment statutes should be liberally construed\u201d). We believe that if this case had not been removed from the state court, the Connecticut courts would have concluded that section 9-301(4) of the Uniform Commercial Code, which Connecticut has adopted, <em>see </em>Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 42a-9-301(4) (West Supp.1981), presupposes a legal mechanism that can reach collateral held for future advances and would also have found such collateral garnishable under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">\u2022 III.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Although we rule that Warner made a valid garnishment on Best Banana\u2019s account with Aetna, it does not follow that Warner\u2019s garnishment is now enforceable against Aetna in this scire facias action. Warner has simply achieved the status, effective January 11, 1981, of an intervening lien creditor. The priority of Warner\u2019s lien, as against Aetna\u2019s security interest for future advances, is determined by section 9-301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Because the District Court rested its decision on the conclusion that Warner was not a lien creditor, it did not consider the application of section 9-301(4) to this case. Consequently, we have neither the factual record nor the guidance of a district court\u2019s opinion in the first instance necessary to resolve this dispute on appeal. Several important issues remain unexplored. To begin with, there is considerable disagreement over which of the obligations Best Banana has or may incur after January 11, 1980, as a result of its Agreement with Aetna, qualify as future advances made pursuant to a commitment under section 9-301(4) and section 9-105(l)(k). Other circuits have been unwilling to consider attorneys\u2019 fees of the sort that Aetna is expending in its own defense in the letter of credit suit as having priority under section 9-301(4). <em>See In re Apollo Travel, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 841 (8th Cir. 1977). <em>But cf. In re Continental Vending Machine Corp., </em>543 F.2d 986, 993-94 (2d Cir.1976) (attorneys\u2019 fees recoverable in bankruptcy proceeding when secured debt had not been repaid). Moreover, there is even some reason to doubt that, if Aetna is forced to make payments under a letter of credit to the Ecuadorian firm, such payments would count as a secured future advance with priority over Warner\u2019s lien under section 9-301(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Determining which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>if any, of Best Banana\u2019s actual and potential obligations qualify as section 9-301(4) future advances raises difficult questions that may turn on the facts of the case. We do not resolve these issues, but instead remand the matter to the District Court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Upon remand, the District Court should consider whether the advances made by Aetna since January 11, 1980, and those it may make in the future pursuant to the security agreement qualify under section 9-301(4) as advances entitled to a priority over Warner\u2019s lien. It may not be necessary to adjudicate all the payments Aetna has made or may be called upon to make. It will be sufficient to adjudicate the status of payments only up to the amount of Warner\u2019s lien, $45,789.11. If the District Court determines that at least $45,789.11 of advances made by Aetna since January 11, 1980, are entitled to priority under section 9-301(4), then Best Banana\u2019s account will have been completely consumed by secured claims with priority over Warner\u2019s lien, and, in that event, the scire facias action should be dismissed with prejudice. <em>See Cibro Petroleum Products, Inc. v. Fowler Finishing Co., supra. </em>If the District Court determines that advances entitled to priority have not yet consumed the Best Banana account, but that Aetna may be called upon in the future to make at least $45,789.11 of advances entitled to priority, then the District Court should stay the execution of Warner\u2019s judgment against Best Banana for the time being, <em>see </em>Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-386 (West 1960), and dismiss without prejudice Warner\u2019s scire facias action against Aetna. In that event the garnishment filed in connection with Warner\u2019s successful suit against Best Banana will simply remain as a lien: Aetna may vacate the garnishment if and when it becomes clear that advances entitled to a priority have been made that consume the account, or Warner may institute a new scire facias action if and when it becomes clear that funds remain in the account that could not be consumed by advances entitled to a priority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, if the District Court determines that none of the advances Aetna has made since January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>11, 1980, and none that it may be called upon to make are or would be entitled to a priority, then Warner would be entitled to judgment in this scire facias action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. Section 9-301(4) also allows a secured party to have priority over an intervening lien creditor for future advances made within 45 days after the lien attaches and future advances made without knowledge of the lien. Neither of these circumstances applies to this case. Any additional obligations incurred by Best Banana to Aetna were incurred more than 45 days after January 11, 1980. In addition, Aetna had notice of Warner\u2019s lien on January 11, 1980, when the company was served with process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">. Like New York, Connecticut has adopted the future advance clause of the 1972 amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code. See Conn. Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 42a-9-301(4) (West Supp. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">. As a respected commentator has noted, it is not easy to tell whether conditions are to be considered precedent or subsequent for purposes of rendering debts subject to attachment. <em>See </em>E. Stephenson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 66, at 262; <em>see, also Clime v. Gregor, supra </em>(suggesting that a verdict in favor of a principal debtor may be garnished even though the verdict may subsequently be set aside).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b911-6\">. Elsewhere, the Uniform Commercial Code explicitly limits the power of a secured party to contract around intervening lien creditors. Section 9-311 renders ineffective any provision of a security agreement that purports to prevent involuntary transfer of the debtor\u2019s interest in collateral by way of \u201cattachment, levy, garnishment or other judicial process.\u201d <em>See </em>Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 42a-9-311 (West 1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b911-7\">. Arguably, section 9-301(4) covers only transactions in which the secured party advances new assets to the debtor and does not allow the secured party to increase its secured interest by assuming liabilities of the debtor, even if bound to assume the liabilities by a prior commitment. The rationale of such a theory would be that the secured party does not injure unsecured creditors when the secured party advances an asset because the debtor\u2019s assets increase by the same amount that the security interest increases following the advance. However, when the secured party assumes an unsecured liability of the debtor, the debtor\u2019s assets remain the same after the advance, although those assets remaining unsecured and available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>to unsecured creditors decrease. We need not and do not now assess this or any alternative theory of section 9-301(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\">. Connecticut\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for scire facias action, see Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-586 (West 1960), should present no bar to a second action by Warner. The statute does not begin to run until the cause of action accrues, and the cause of action does not accrue until Warner makes a demand for payment on Aetna as garnishee. See <em>Hayes v. Weisman, </em>97 Conn. 387, 116 A. 878 (1922). Under Connecticut law, a judgment creditor normally must make demand on a garnishee within sixty days after final judgment against the principal debt- or. Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-328 (West 1960); see <em>Quinlan v. City National Bank of South Norwalk, </em>105 Conn. 424, 135 A. 435 (1926). In this case, Warner obtained final judgment against Best Banana on June 25, 1980. However, the Connecticut statute governing the execution of liens after judgment recognizes that a judgment creditor\u2019s lien cannot be executed immediately after judgment if that lien is subordinate to a senior encumbrance. When a senior encumbrance exists, the judgment creditor has sixty days to execute its levy and demand payment on the garnishee \u201cafter such encumbrance has been removed.\u201d Conn.Gen. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-328. This extension for execution is necessary because, until the senior encumbrance has been removed, it is not clear how much of the garnishee\u2019s debt to the principal debtor remains to be demanded by the judgment creditor. <em>See Beers v. Place, </em>3 Fed. Cas. 71, 72-73 (D.Conn.1870) (No.1233), <em>reprinted in </em>36 Conn. 578, 581-83 (1870). In this case, Warner will have sixty days to demand payment from Aetna once it has resolved the extent of Aetna\u2019s superior claim under section 9-301(4). If at that time Aetna refuses to make payment, Warner will have a year to bring another scire facias action.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">In the future, judgment creditors like Warner might be better advised to take advantage of Connecticut\u2019s declaratory judgment provisions to determine the priorities governing garnished accounts subject to future advance clauses. <em>See </em>ConniGen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-235a (West 1960). The declaratory judgment provision is less cumbersome than the scire facias action, and was enacted to provide judgment creditors like Warner a simple mechanism for determining their priority in relation to other encumbrances. <em>See The Use of Declaratory Judgements [sic] When Scire Facie [sic] Proceedings Are Used: Hearings Before the Connecticut Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary and Governmental Functions </em>pt. 3, at 936-37 (Mar. 9, 1959) (remarks of Harold Yudkin, New Haven Bar Ass\u2019n).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b913-14\">. A variant of this last possibility might exist in the unlikely combination of events whereby (a) some of the advances already made are entitled to a priority and do not consume the entire account and (b) the District Court determines that none of the advances Aetna will be called upon to make would be entitled to a priority; Warner would then be entitled to payment on its lien out of whatever portion of the account has not been consumed by advances entitled to a priority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
