At trial, the court granted one defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the party from the action, ruling that there were no material facts which placed its liability in issue. Thereafter the remaining defendant asserted, <em>inter </em>alia, a defense based upon the dismissed party\u2019s negligence. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, and Golman moved for a new trial. The motion was denied, and Golman appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">I. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">On May 22, 1979, Rayford Kenneth Golman was injured when struck on the head by a \u201chydraulic tong\u201d affixed to a land-based drilling rig near Mobile, Alabama. He sustained immediate injuries to his face and head. The blow also aggravated his preexisting condition of spinal arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">At the time of the accident, Golman was operating one of two hydraulic tongs used in an operation known as \u201crunning a dual string of pipe.\u201d A hydraulic tong operates much as a power wrench; it screws together long sections of pipe which are carefully lowered into an oil well\u2019s deep hole. To prevent the pipe from twisting out of place and sliding deeply into the hole, the length of pipe is anchored by a \u201cpower slip\u201d which rests on the rig floor. Thus the power slip assists the hydraulic tongs in joining together the lengths of pipe, while simultaneously preventing the pipe from plummeting downward into the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Golman\u2019s accident occurred when the sections of pipe he had been wrenching together suddenly fell through the power slips. The tong, suspended from the rig by a cable, was yanked downward by the slipping pipe, striking Golman an abrupt blow to the head and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Golman sued in federal district court, seeking damages from Tesoro Drilling Co. (Tesoro), the rig\u2019s operator, as well as from B &amp; W, Inc. (B &amp; W), the lessor of the power slips. Relying on Louisiana law, Golman based recovery from each defendant on the separate theories of negligence and strict liability. B &amp; W impleaded Exchange Oil and Gas Co. (Exchange), the party which had contracted with Tesoro and B &amp; W for the drilling operation. Golman\u2019s employer, Pioneer Fishing &amp; Rental Tools, Inc. (Pioneer), intervened to recoup worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid to Golman. Tesoro\u2019s cross-claim against B &amp; W was disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Several months before trial, B &amp; W moved for summary judgment. The motion was denied; discovery continued and the case proceeded to trial. In his opening statement at trial, however, counsel for Golman suggested that B &amp; W was not in any way responsible for the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">Now, what caused this accident. We claim that the accident was caused by these slips being defective. Do I mean defective like come from the factory defective? No, I don\u2019t mean that. Do I mean because B &amp; W, the people that own the slips, did something wrong to the slips? No, I don\u2019t mean that. * * * It is our contention that at the time of the accident, the slips were unreasonably dangerous because they ... had caked up with rust and paraffin and were not cleaned as often as they should have been nor were they cleaned properly. What I mean properly will be explained to you by the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">We have sued Tesoro Drilling Company and also B &amp; W because I don\u2019t know what others will attempt to tell you about what B &amp; W did or shouldn\u2019t have done. We included B &amp; W in our suit even though we think Tesoro is responsible. We know Tesoro is responsible. We brought them in for any possible involvement on B &amp; W\u2019s part. That is only fair to Mr. Golman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>But, I have got to tell you that after conducting preliminary discovery and taking deposition and finding out about this case, I have no evidence that implicates B &amp; W directly. There will be a lot of maybe and could be and all of that nonsense. But, what this lawsuit is about is what the driller and the drilling crew did, the Tesoro people, for which Tesoro is responsible. I am not trying to point the finger at the driller, but I know what he should have done and what his employer let him do and we sued Tesoro as a responsible party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Counsel for Tesoro, however, opened by stressing that there were in fact three parties defendant: Exchange, the owner of the well; B &amp; W, the owner of the power slips; and Tesoro, the drilling company. Although counsel admitted that B &amp; W\u2019s power slips had not been defectively manufactured, he specifically mentioned that B &amp; W had provided an employee who was to act as a round-the-clock \u201ctrouble shooter.\u201d The issue of liability, as stated by counsel, required an inquiry into \u201cwho is really responsible for what at what particular time.\u201d Thus Tesoro\u2019s opening statements indicated that the company would defend on the grounds that Golman was contributorily negligent and, alternatively, that liability lay with either the co-defendant or the impleaded party.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">At the close of all opening statements, counsel for B &amp; W moved for summary judgment, stating that Golman had indicated that he had no evidence implicating B &amp; W directly and that Tesoro had admitted \u201cthat there was nothing wrong with the slips.\u201d Golman offered only feeble opposition to the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ako\">I know of no evidence to implicate B &amp; W, Incorporated. My concern is that we don\u2019t know what the evidence is going to be, and it may be that some witness or other called by one of the parties may put some responsibility on B &amp; W, Inc. that I don\u2019t see. I think that counsel is eminently correct in what he says. I don\u2019t know if that goes far enough to make out a summary judgment. At any rate, I make no opposition on any evidentiary matters I know of that would tend to hold B &amp; W in. * * * I don\u2019t want the plaintiff to be out of Court if someone else establishes evidence that I am not aware of, the responsibility on the part of B &amp; W, perhaps not its equipment, but its man that was on the site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Counsel for Tesoro offered no reason to deny the motion; however, he expressly indicated his intention to establish a defense to liability based on the negligence of a third party. The court granted the motion, dismissing B &amp; W from the suit. Upon the dismissal of B &amp; W\u2019s impleader action against Exchange, the litigation effectively involved only two parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">At trial, Tesoro adduced testimony establishing that B &amp; W\u2019s \u201ctrouble shooter\u201d had been present during drilling operations and that he may have failed to notice that debris was accumulating on the slip faces. In his closing argument, counsel contended that the accident had been caused by Golman\u2019s own negligence or by the negligence of non-parties, including B &amp; W. Over Golman\u2019s objection, the judge instructed the jury that one defense to Tesoro\u2019s liability would be the intervening fault of non-parties B &amp; W and Exchange. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Tesoro. In response to special interrogatories, the jury found that Tesoro had not been negligent, that Tesoro had been the legal custodian of B &amp; W\u2019s power slips, and that the slips had not been defective. Golman moved for a new trial, arguing that the court erred in allowing Tesoro to submit to the jury the issue of B &amp; W\u2019s fault. The motion was denied. Golman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">It is well established that a trial court\u2019s order denying a motion for new trial may be reversed on appeal only upon a clear showing that the court abused its discretion. <em>Meyers v. Moody, </em>693 F.2d 1196, 1120-21 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Brown v. Arlen Mgmt. Co., </em>663 F.2d 575, 582 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Jonas v. City of Atlanta, </em>647 F.2d 580, 586 (5th Cir.1981). Golman asserts that the district judge abused his discretion by incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sistently granting summary judgment in B &amp; W\u2019s favor and thereafter allowing Tesoro to rely on B &amp; W\u2019s fault as a defense to liability. He avers that the judge\u2019s rulings created serious confusion in the minds of the jurors, thus denying the parties a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Significantly, Golman does not contend that B &amp; W\u2019s motion for summary judgment was improperly granted. As the parties do not allege that the court erred in granting B &amp; W\u2019s eleventh-hour motion, we shall not review the propriety of that order. Rather, we focus on Golman\u2019s argument that the court erred (1) by charging the jury that they could find that B &amp; W\u2019s negligence had caused the accident, and (2) by allowing Tesoro to argue B &amp; W\u2019s fault as a defense to liability. Golman\u2019s five enumerated contentions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ultimately advance twin theories of relief: first, that Tesoro\u2019s admission that B &amp; W had not been at fault estops it from asserting a defense based on B &amp; W\u2019s fault; and second, that the trial judge violated the \u201claw of the case\u201d when he allowed Tesoro to argue B &amp; W\u2019s fault in the face of a binding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>A. Equitable Estoppel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">As to Golman\u2019s equitable estoppel argument, it should be noted that Tesoro\u2019s attempt to focus on allegations of B &amp; W\u2019s negligence as a defense to Golman\u2019s claims is facially proper. <em>Loescher v. Parr, </em>324 So.2d 441, 445-46 (La.1975); <em>see Olsen v. Shell Oil Co., </em>365 So.2d 1285, 1293-94 (La. 1979). As an essential premise to his estoppel argument, Golman asserts that counsel for Tesoro acted in derogation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) by failing adequately to apprise the court that he intended to rely upon B &amp; W\u2019s fault as a defense. In entertaining B &amp; W\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial judge interrogated counsel in an attempt to ascertain what material facts placed B &amp; W\u2019s liability in issue. A review of the trial transcript, however, reveals that Tesoro at no time indicated an intention to abandon the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">TESORO: Your Honor, I don\u2019t know of anything, any defect in B &amp; W\u2019s slips and for that reason, I would be hardpressed to say, as I said in the opening statement, to change that in the trial testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">The only thing I did indicate is that they were not owned and I think I had an obligation to tell the jury that they were not owned by us and that they had a man standing by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">THE COURT: The man who was standing .by was an employee of B &amp; W but he was not on the scene at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-15\">TESORO: To my understanding, I don\u2019t believe that he was, but I can\u2019t candidly tell the Court that, but other than that, those were the only points that I would have. Again, I don\u2019t think that brings it down\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-16\">THE COURT: Do you have a theory you plan to advance as to how the accident happened or are you merely saying that my client is not responsible and we don\u2019t know how it happened, is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-17\">TESORO: No, I am saying that Mr. Golman caused it by not timely checking the slips. But, I do not believe that B &amp; W supplied a defective set of slips. I think all of us would agree to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-18\">So, I think your Honor\u2019s ruling is correct. * * * I think in fairness and justice, ... I have to say that items that I indicated that I have to make to the jury I would have to make whether they [the dismissed parties] are here or not. * * * [B]ut I don\u2019t want to mislead the Court. I do have and will have to continue to make points that I did make. I think it is only fair to my client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-19\">The dismissal of B &amp; W from the suit resulted directly from Golman\u2019s admitted inability to produce evidence of B &amp; W\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>liability. \u201cThe doctrine of estoppel is for the protection of innocent persons, and only the innocent may invoke it. A party may not invoke an estoppel for the purpose of shielding himself from the results of his own fraud, dereliction of duty, or other inequitable conduct.\u201d <em>Meyers v. Moody, </em>693 F.2d 1196,1208 (5th Cir.1982). <em>See also Mitchell </em>v. <em>Aetna, </em>579 F.2d 342, 347-48 (5th Cir.1978). It would be inequitable, if not illogical, to hold that Golman\u2019s inability to produce evidence should redound to his benefit by estopping Tesoro from relying upon a legally valid defense. Therefore, Golman\u2019s first argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>B. The Law of the Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Golman\u2019s second argument is that the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment established the \u201claw of the case\u201d which was thereafter violated when the issue of B &amp; W\u2019s fault was presented to the jury. A trial court is not inexorably bound to the precedent it establishes in the course of a trial. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly provide that all trial orders are \u201csubject to revision at any time before the entry of [final] judgment.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.Pro. 54(b). Summary judgment is no exception. An order granting partial summary judgment is interlocutory; it has no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Erickson\u2019s, Inc., </em>396 F.2d 134, 136 (5th Cir.1968). \u201cWhile a ruling on the motion for partial summary judgment is the law of the case on the issue decided, this issue is not immutable and has no res judicata effect.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Horton, </em>622 F.2d 144, 148 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see White v. Murtha, </em>377 F.2d 428, 431-32 (5th Cir.1967). <em>But see In re Falstaff Brewing Co. Antitrust Litigation, </em>441 F.Supp. 62, 66 (E.D.Mo. 1977) (holding that an order granting partial summary judgment in a still-pending case \u201cis, in the sense requisite for raising an estoppel, a final judgment on the merits.\u201d) In this instance the trial court\u2019s order merely established that Golman had not met his burden of producing evidence sufficient to place in issue material facts relative to B &amp; W\u2019s fault. It was not intended to foreclose Tesoro\u2019s right to propound an argument firmly rooted in Louisiana jurisprudence. Therefore, Golman\u2019s second argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Golman has not established any trial error requiring the granting of a new trial. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">. In addition, Golman argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a motion for a directed verdict urged by Golman on behalf of B &amp; W. This contention patently is frivolous and does not merit discussion. Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 50(a). <em>See Boeing v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
