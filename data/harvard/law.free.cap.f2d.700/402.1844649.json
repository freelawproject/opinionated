Based on this finding the tax court disallowed deductions for losses incurred in renovating the farm. The sole issue presented for our review is whether the tax court\u2019s finding regarding petitioners\u2019 motivation was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Melvin Nickerson (hereinafter referred to as petitioner) was born in 1932 in a farming community in Florida. He worked evenings and weekends on his father\u2019s farm until he was 17. Petitioner entered the field of advertising after attending college and serving in the United States Army. During the years relevant to this case he was self-employed in Chicago, serving industrial and agricultural clients. His wife, Naomi W. Nickerson, was a full-time employee of the Chicago Board of Education. While petitioners were not wealthy, they did earn a comfortable living.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">At the age of forty, petitioner decided that his career in the \u201cyouth oriented\u201d field of advertising would not last much longer, and he began to look for an alternative source of income for the future. Petitioners decided that dairy farming was the most desirable means of generating income and examined a number of farms in Michigan and Wisconsin. After several years of searching, petitioners bought an 80-aere farm in Door County, Wisconsin for $40,000. One year later they purchased an additional 40 acres adjoining the farm for $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The farm, which had not been run as a dairy for eight years, was in a run-down condition. What little equipment was left was either in need of repair or obsolete. The tillable land, about 60 acres, was planted with alfalfa, which was at the end of its productive cycle. In an effort to improve this state of affairs petitioners leased the land to a tenant-farmer for $20 an acre and an agreement that the farmer would convert an additional ten acres a year to the cultivation of a more profitable crop. At the time of trial approximately 80 acres were tillable. The rent received from the farmer was the only income derived from the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">Petitioner visited the farm on most weekends during the growing season and twice a month the rest of the year. Mrs. Nickerson and the children visited less frequently. The trip to the farm requires five hours of driving from petitioners\u2019 home in Chicago. During these visits petitioner and his family either worked on their land or assisted neighboring farmers. When working on his own farm petitioner concentrated his efforts on renovating an abandoned orchard and remodeling the farm house. In addition to learning about farming through this experience petitioner read a number of trade journals and spoke with the area agricultural extension agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Petitioners did not expect to make a profit from the farm for approximately 10 years. True to their expectations, petitioners lost $8,668 in 1976 and $9,872.95 in 1977. Although they did not keep formal books of account petitioners did retain receipts and cancelled checks relating to farm expenditures. At the time of trial, petitioners had not yet acquired any livestock or farm machinery. The farm was similarly devoid of recreational equipment and had never been used to entertain guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">The tax court decided that these facts did not support petitioners\u2019 claim that the primary goal in operating the farm was to make a profit. We will examine the tax court\u2019s reasoning in more detail after setting out the relevant legal considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">\n<em>II. The Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 allows deduction of \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ing on any trade or business.\u201d Section 183, however, limits the availability of these deductions if the activity \u201cis not engaged in for profit\u201d to deductions that are allowed regardless of the existence of a profit motive and deductions for ordinary and necessary expenses \u201conly to the extent that the gross income derived from such activity for the taxable year exceeds [otherwise allowable deductions].\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 183(b)(2). The deductions claimed by petitioners are only allowable if their motivation in investing in the farm was to make a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Petitioners bear the burden of proving that their primary purpose in renovating the farm was to make a profit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Golanty v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. 411 (1979), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>647 F.2d 170 (9 Cir.1981); <em>Allen v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. 28 (1979). In meeting this burden, however, \u201cit is sufficient if the taxpayer has a bona fide expectation of realizing a profit, regardless of the reasonableness of such expectation.\u201d <em>Golanty v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. at 425-26; <em>Allen v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. at 33; <em>Dunn v. Commissioner, </em>70 T.C. 715, 720 (1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>615 F.2d 578 (2nd Cir.1980). Although petitioners need only prove their sincerity rather than their realism the factors considered in judging their motivation are primarily objective. In addition to the taxpayer\u2019s statements of intent, which are given little weight for obvious reasons, the tax court must consider \u201call facts and circumstances with respect to the activity,\u201d including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">(1) <em>Manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity. </em>The fact that the taxpayer carries on the activity in a businesslike manner and maintains complete and accurate books and records may indicate that the activity is engaged in for profit....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">(2) <em>The expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors. </em>Preparation for the activity by extensive study of its accepted business, economic, and scientific practices, or consultation with those who are expert therein, may indicate that the taxpayer has a profit motive where the taxpayer carries on the activity in accordance with such practices....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">(3) <em>The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity. </em>The fact that the taxpayer devotes much of his personal time and effort to carrying on the activity, particularly if the activity does not have substantial personal or recreational aspects, may indicate an intention to derive a profit.... The fact that the taxpayer devotes a limited amount of time to an activity does not necessarily indicate a lack of profit motive where the taxpayer employs competent and qualified persons to carry on such activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">(4) <em>Expectation that assets used in activity may appreciate in value....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">(5) <em>The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">(6) <em>The taxpayer\u2019s history of income or losses with respect to the activity....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">(7) <em>The amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">(8) <em>The financial status of the taxpayer. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">(9) <em>Elements of personal pleasure or recreation. </em>The presence of personal motives in carrying on of an activity may indicate that the activity is not engaged in for profit, especially where there are recreational or personal elements involved. On the other hand, a profit motivation may be indicated where an activity lacks any appeal other than profit. It is not, however, necessary that an activity be engaged in with the exclusive intention of deriving a profit or with the intention of maximizing profits....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b)(l)-(9). None of these factors is determinative, nor is the decision to be made by comparing the number of factors that weigh in the taxpayer\u2019s favor with the number that support the Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>There is no set formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>for divining a taxpayer\u2019s true motive, rather \u201c[o]ne struggles in vain for any verbal formula that will supply a ready touchstone. The standard set by the statute is not a rule of law; it is rather a way of life. Life in all its fullness must supply the answer to the riddle.\u201d <em>Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933). Nonetheless, we are given some guidance by the enumerated factors and by the Congressional purpose in enacting section 183.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">The legislative history surrounding section 183 indicates that one of the prime motivating factors behind its passage was Congress\u2019 desire to create an objective standard to determine whether a taxpayer was carrying on a business for the purpose of realizing a profit or was instead merely attempting to create and utilize losses to offset other income. <em>Jasionowski v. Commissioner, </em>66 T.C. 312, 321 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Congressional concern stemmed from a recognition that \u201c[wjealthy individuals have invested in certain aspects of farm operations solely to obtain \u2018tax losses\u2019 \u2014 largely bookkeeping losses \u2014 for use to reduce their tax on other income.... One of the remarkable aspects of the problem is pointed up by the fact that persons with large non-farm income have a remarkable propensity to lose money in the farm business.\u201d S.Rep. No. 91-552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1969 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2027, 2376. With this concern in mind we will now examine the decision of the tax court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\n<em>III. Decision of the Tax Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">The tax court analyzed the relevant factors and determined that making a profit was not petitioners\u2019 primary goal in engaging in farming. The court based its decision on a number of factors that weighed against petitioners. The court found that they did not operate the farm in a businesslike manner and did not appear to have a concrete plan for improving the profitability of the farm. The court believed that these difficulties were attributable to petitioners\u2019 lack of experience, but did not discuss the steps actually taken by Melvin Nickerson to gain experience in farming.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The court found it difficult to believe that petitioners actually believed that the limited amount of time they were spending at the farm would produce a profit given the dilapidated condition of the farm. Furthermore, the court found that petitioners\u2019 emphasis on making the farm house habitable rather than on acquiring or repairing farm equipment was inconsistent with a profit motive. These factors, combined with the consistent history of losses borne by petitioners, convinced the court that \u201cpetitioner at best entertains the hope that when he retires from the advertising business and can devote his complete attention to the farming operation, he may at that time expect to produce a profit.\u201d The court did not think that this hope rose to the level of a bona fide expectation of profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">\n<em>IV. Review of the Tax Court\u2019s Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">Whether petitioners intended to run the dairy farm for a profit is a question of fact, and as such our review is limited to a determination of whether the tax court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in determining that petitioners lacked the requisite profit motive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>383 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 24 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960); <em>Godfrey v. Commissioner, </em>335 F.2d 82, 84 (6th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 966, 85 S.Ct. 660, 13 L.Ed.2d 560. This standard of review applies although the only dispute is over the proper interpretation of uncontested facts. <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. at 291, 80 S.Ct. at 1199. It is not enough, then, that we would have reached a different conclusion had the decision been ours to make. Rather, \u201c[a] finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). This is one of those rare cases in which we are convinced that a mistake has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Our basic disagreement with the tax court stems from our belief that the court improperly evaluated petitioners\u2019 actions from the perspective of whether they sincerely believed that they could make a profit from their current level of activity at the farm. On the contrary, petitioners need only prove that their current actions were motivated by the expectation that they would later reap a profit, in this case when they finished renovating the farm and began full-time operations. It is well established that a taxpayer need not expect an immediate profit; the existence of \u201cstart up\u201d losses does not preclude a bona fide profit motive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">The presence of losses in the formative years of a business ... is not inconsistent with an intention to achieve a later profitable level of operation, bearing in mind, however, that the goal must be to realize a profit on the entire operation, which presupposes not only future net earnings but also sufficient net earnings to recoup the losses which have meanwhile been sustained in the intervening years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As\"><em>Bessenyey v. Commissioner, </em>45 T.C. 261,274 (1965), <em>ait\u2019d, </em>379 F.2d 252 (2nd Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied </em>389 U.S. 931, 88 S.Ct: 293, 19 L.Ed.2d 283; <em>see also Benz v. Commissioner, </em>63 T.C. 375, 384 (1974). The tax court was apparently of the view that petitioners\u2019 decision to spread these start-up losses over a period of years before starting full-time operation of the farm was inconsistent with a bona fide intention to make a profit. It is uncontested, however, that substantial time, effort, and money were needed to return the farm to a profitable operation, petitioners\u2019 only choice being when they would make this investment. We see no basis for distinguishing petitioners\u2019 actions from a situation in which one absorbs larger losses over a shorter period of time by beginning full-time operations immediately. In either situation the taxpayer stands an equal chance of recouping start-up losses. In fact, it seems to us a reasonable decision by petitioners to prepare the farm before becoming dependent upon it for sustenance. Keeping in mind that petitioners were not seeking to supplement their existing incomes with their current work on the farm, but rather were laying the ground work for a contemplated career switch, we will examine the factors relied upon by the tax court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The tax court found that the amount of time petitioners devoted to the farm was inadequate. In reaching this conclusion the court ignored petitioners\u2019 agreement with the tenant-farmer under which he would convert 10 acres a year to profitable crops in exchange for the right to farm the land. In this situation the limited amount of time spent by petitioners, who were fully employed in Chicago, is not inconsistent with an expectation of profit. \u201cThe fact that the taxpayer devotes a limited amount of time to an activity does not necessarily indicate a lack of profit motive wher\u00e9 the taxpayer employs competent and qualified persons to carry on such activity.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b)(3). There is no indication in the record that the tenant-farmer was not qualified to convert the land, or that 10 acres a year was an unreasonable amount. In these circumstances the tax court erred in inferring a lack of profit motive from the amount of time personally spent by petitioners on renovating the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The court also rested its decision on the lack of a concrete plan to put the farm in operable condition. Once again, this ignores petitioners\u2019 agreement with the tenant-farmer concerning reclamation of the land. Under this agreement the majority of the land would be tillable by the time petitioners were prepared to begin full-time farming. The tax court also believed that petitioners\u2019 decision to renovate the farm house and orchard prior to obtaining farm equipment evidenced a lack of profit mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tive. As petitioners planned to live on the farm when they switched careers refurbishing the house would seem to be a necessary first step. The court also failed to consider the uncontradicted testimony regarding repairs made to the hay barn and equipment shed, which supported petitioners\u2019 contention that they were interested in operating a farm rather than just living on the land. Additionally, we fail to understand how renovating the orchard, a potential source of food and income, is inconsistent with an expectation of profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The tax court took into account the history of losses in considering petitioners\u2019 intentions. While a history of losses is relevant, in this case little weight should be accorded this factor. Petitioners did not expect to make a profit for a number of years, and it was clear from the condition of the farm that a financial investment would be required before the farm could be profitable. Accordingly, that petitioners lost money, as they expected, does not cast doubt upon the sincerity of their motivation. In this regard, the tax court should have also considered the fact that petitioners were reaping what profit they could through leasing the land to a local farmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The court believed that most of petitioners\u2019 problems were attributable to their lack of expertise. While lack of expertise is relevant, efforts at gaining experience and a willingness to follow expert advice should also be considered. Treas.Reg. 1.183-2(b)(2). The court here failed to consider the uncontradicted evidence that Melvin Nickerson read trade journals and Government-sponsored agricultural newsletters, sought advice from a state horticultural agent regarding renovation of the orchard and gained experience by working on neighboring farms. In addition, petitioners\u2019 agreement with the tenant-farmer was entered into on the advice of the area agricultural extension agent. To weigh petitioners\u2019 lack of expertise against them without giving consideration to these efforts effectively precludes a bona fide attempt to change careers. We are unwilling to restrict petitioners in this manner and believe that a proper interpretation of these facts supports petitioners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The tax court recognized that the farm was not used for entertainment and lacked any recreational facilities, and that petitioners\u2019 efforts at the farm were \u201cprodigious,\u201d but felt that this was of little importance. While the Commissioner need not prove that petitioners were motivated by goals other than making a profit, we think that more weight should be given to the absence of any alternative explanation for petitioners\u2019 actions. As we previously noted' the standard set out by the statute is to be applied with the insight gained from a lifetime of experience as well as an understanding of the statutory scheme. Common sense indicates to us that rational people do not perform hard manual labor for no reason, and if the possibility that petitioners performed these labors for pleasure is eliminated the only remaining motivation is profit. The Commissioner has argued that petitioner was motivated by a love of farming that stems from his childhood. We find it difficult to believe that he drove five hours in order to spend his weekends working on a dilapidated farm solely for fun, or that his family derived much pleasure from the experience. Furthermore, there is no support for this contention in the record. At any rate, that petitioner may have chosen farming over some other career because of fond memories of his youth does not preclude a bona fide profit motive. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b)(9). We believe that the absence of any recreational purpose strongly counsels in favor of finding that petitioners\u2019 prodigious efforts were directed at making a profit. <em>See Allen v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. 28, 36 (1979); <em>Gregory v. United States, </em>76-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) U9220 (W.D.La.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Based upon these facts we conclude that the tax court erred in finding that petitioners had failed to prove a bona fide expectation of profit. We recognize that the scope of our review in this case is limited. In a similar situation the Supreme Court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">Decision of the issue presented in these cases must be based ultimately on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>application of the factfinding tribunal\u2019s experience with the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts of each ease. The nontechnical nature of the statutory standard, the close relationship of it to the data of practical human experience, and the multiplicity of relevant factual elements, with their various combinations, creating the necessity of ascribing the proper force to each, confirms us in our conclusion that primary weight in this area must be given to the conclusions of the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3x\"><em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. at 289, 80 S.Ct. at 1198. Nonetheless, when the basic facts are not disputed and the inference drawn from them by the trier of fact is the result of an overly restrictive view of what a party must prove in order to prevail we will not hesitate to exercise our power to reverse. In this case the court erroneously concluded that petitioners were required to prove a bona fide expectation of profit from their current efforts at the farm. We think that it is sufficient that petitioners had a bona fide expectation that their current work would allow them to commence profitable farming in the future, and that the uncontested facts establish that they had this expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">If this were a case in which wealthy taxpayers were seeking to obtain tax benefits through the creation of paper losses we would hesitate to reverse. Before us today, however, is a family of modest means attempting to prepare for a stable financial future. The amount of time and hard work invested by petitioners belies any claim that allowing these deductions would thwart Congress\u2019s primary purpose, that of excluding \u201chobby\u201d losses from permissible deductions. Accordingly, we hold that the tax court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous and</p>\n<p id=\"AjP\">Reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. The Code does provide a presumption that a taxpayer engaged in an activity with a bona fide profit motive when a profit is realized two of five consecutive years. I.R.C. \u00a7 183(d). Because of petitioners\u2019 consistent losses this is not available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">. Petitioners also raise the legal argument that the court erred in considering the farm\u2019s history of losses. We do not agree. A history of losses is relevant to the determination of whether a taxpayer actually expected to make a profit from the continued operation of a busi- . ness or other activity. <em>Allen v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. at 34; Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
