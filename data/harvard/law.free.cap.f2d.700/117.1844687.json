Because the agency failed to properly evaluate this condition in conjunction with the plaintiff\u2019s contentions of disability, we remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-27\">Plaintiff applied for payments under both the disability, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-432 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), and the supplemental security income, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1381-1385 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), provisions of the Social Security Act. After a hearing, the ALJ denied benefits in a ruling that was affirmed by the Appeals Council. The district court found there was substantial evidence to sustain the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-28\">Plaintiff is 61 years of age. He was an insurance adjuster for many years, but has not worked since 1973. He claims to be disabled because of paralysis on the left side, a heart condition, and a lung impairment. At the hearing before the ALJ, plaintiff stated, \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a heavy drinker,\u201d and added, \u201cI still love my booze but I wouldn\u2019t touch it now, I\u2019m afraid of it.\u201d However, he admitted that he still drank beer, and said, \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s no such thing as an alcoholic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The medical evidence, as gleaned from hospital records, shows that in 1975 plaintiff disclosed a history of drinking two quarts of beer and a half pint of whiskey per day. In March 1976, he was admitted to Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia and discharged three weeks later. The diagnosis was tuberculosis. An admission note commented on \u201cchronic alcohol abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In December 1978, plaintiff was admitted to St. Agnes Hospital in Philadelphia after being found at the foot of some subway steps with a laceration on the back of his head. The admission report stated that plaintiff \u201clooked severely intoxicated.\u201d The final diagnosis was fractured skull, cerebral contusion, alcoholism, and dementia. Plaintiff had a stormy, two-month confinement at the hospital. On discharge, the record noted, \u201cThe patient remained in a state of dementia, still confused, disoriented, hypokinetic with decreased level of speech.\u201d Plaintiff was then sent to a nursing home where he remained until November 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The next hospital record is also from St. Agnes Hospital, where plaintiff was admitted in November 1979 after another fall. It noted that plaintiff \u201cis known to have a left heiniparesis for the last four years ... and a heart condition.\u201d He was discharged two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At the request of the Secretary, plaintiff was examined in March 1980 by a first-year medical resident. The resident found \u201c[peripheral neuropathy of a mild degree, probably on a nutritional basis[,] [substantial alcohol abuse, with relative [sic] few stigmata of chronic alcohol or liver disease on physical examination[,] ... [p]robable seizure disorders by history, ... [n]eeds EEG and Brain Scan.\u201d During the examination, plaintiff conceded that he \u201cused to be a heavy drinker, up to over 1 quart a day of whiskey.\u201d Although the plaintiff\u2019s speech was fluent and coherent, \u201chis thought content was disjointed.\u201d The resident found that plaintiff had adequate ranges of motion and could sit for sustained periods, but submitted no opinion on whether he was able to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The EEG and brain scan apparently were not performed after the resident\u2019s medical examination. However, the St. Agnes Hospital records show that EEGs were performed there in January 1979 and indicated \u201cabnormal tracing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The ALJ cited the report by the resident, and discredited the plaintiff\u2019s testimony about his physical condition as inconsistent with the medical evidence. Plaintiff was found able to work except when it required prolonged sitting, standing, walking, or medium to heavy lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The medical records in this case reek of chronic and severe alcoholism. Nevertheless, the ALJ apparently discounted that evidence because of the resident\u2019s comment that there were \u201cfew stigmata of chronic alcohol or liver disease.\u201d No mention is made in the resident\u2019s report of a review of the prior hospital records, and it must be assumed that the medical history came from plaintiff. Under those circumstances, there is some doubt whether the resident would have come to his conclusion about a lack of physiological damage had he been given the other medical data that was available to the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The failure of the AU to closely scrutinize the examiner\u2019s report, however, is consistent with the general approach taken to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The ALJ minimized the subjective complaints about pain in the left side and recurrent blackouts, apparently without recognizing a possible connection between those conditions and plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">That disease may be severe enough to constitute a compensable disability. Early decisions under the Social Security Act demonstrated reluctance to award benefits to an alcoholic. <em>See, e.g., Mays v. Ribicoff, </em>206 F.Supp. 170 (S.D.W.Va.1962). However, in <em>Griffis v. Weinberger, </em>509 F.2d 837, 838 (9th Cir.1975), it was held that \u201cchronic alcoholism ..., standing alone, can, if serious enough, amount to a disability.\u201d As the court stated, \u201cThe proposition that chronic acute alcoholism is itself a disease, \u2018a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,\u2019 is hardly debatable today.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Ferguson v. Schweiker, </em>641 F.2d 243 (5th Cir.1981), agreed that alcoholism, either alone or combined with other causes, can constitute a compensable disability \u201cif it prevents a claimant from engaging in substantial gainful employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. <em>See also Cannon v. Harris, </em>651 F.2d 513 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Adams v. Weinberger, </em>548 F.2d 239 (8th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The ALJ in the case at hand apparently believed that if he found no objective physical impairment resulting from alcoholism, the inquiry was ended. That theory, however, has been rejected by the courts. In <em>Hicks v. Califano, </em>600 F.2d 1048, 1051 (4th Cir.1979), the court said, \u201cNothing in the Social Security Act permits rejection of a disability claim simply because the claimant has not experienced significant end organ damage, [citation omitted] Where there is evidence of alcohol abuse, the Secretary must inquire whether the claimant is addicted to alcohol and, as a consequence, has lost the ability to control its use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Further inquiry about the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism did not go beyond his denial of its existence and his testimony that he had curtailed the use of intoxicants. This approach fails to recognize that an alcoholic\u2019s negative attitude is a common accompaniment of the disease. The same issue was presented in <em>Adams v. Weinberger, </em>where the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held, \u201cSuch testimony may be relevant if, medically, the claimant has the power to control his alcoholism; otherwise, the statement represents the rationalizations of a sick individual who does not realize the extent of his illness.\u201d 548 F.2d at 245. <em>See also Ferguson v. Schweiker, </em>641 F.2d at 249; <em>Lofton v. Schweiker, </em>653 F.2d 215, 218 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Veal v. Califano, </em>610 F.2d 495, 497 (8th Cir.1979); <em>Swaim v. Califano, </em>599 F.2d 1309, 1312 (4th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">It is true that plaintiff did not list alcoholism as one of his disabling conditions. That, however, does not excuse the Department of Health and Human Services from scrutinizing a condition that was so directly brought to its attention. As the court observed in <em>Cannon v. Harris, </em>651 F.2d at 519, when the evidence of alcoholism raises an issue as to the plaintiff\u2019s mental and psychological capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity, the ALJ should pursue the matter. He must develop a full and fair record. <em>See also Coulter v. Weinberger, </em>527 F.2d 224 (3d Cir.1975); <em>Hess v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>497 F.2d 837 (3d Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The record here demonstrates conclusively that the issue of alcoholism was neither evaluated nor investigated properly. The case therefore must be remanded to the Secretary for additional fact finding and reassessment, to determine whether the alcoholism standing alone, or in conjunction with the plaintiff\u2019s other impairments, entitles him to benefits under either the disability or SSI provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Although we express no opinion about the ultimate decision on remand, we confess that we are troubled by the plaintiff\u2019s statement in the record that he \u201cvery seldom toueh[es] [alcohol]\u201d now because he \u201c[c]an\u2019t afford it.\u201d The implication is that if he had more money, he might imbibe more.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Awarding disability compensation where the net result would be to exacerbate a disabling condition is of questionable benefit to the recipient. However, the regulations covering beneficiaries of supplemental security income benefits are helpful in relieving our concerns. An alcoholic may be referred to treatment, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1720 (1982), and payments may be withheld if the claimant does not cooperate, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 416.-1725 (1982). The considerations to be used in determining whether .treatment is required are set out at sections 416.935-939.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Moreover, SSI payments for the benefit of an alcoholic may be made to a representative payee, including an institution caring for the claimant. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.601(a)(2) (1982). Enforcing these regulations should result in the benefits being applied to their intended use \u2014 support for the individual, rather than for his destructive habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Regulations covering disability benefits for workers also provide for payment to a representative payee, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.2001 (1982), and require recipients to accept vocational rehabilitation services, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 404.422 (1982). We believe that the Secretary\u2019s practices with respect to disability payments to alcoholics should be similar to those followed for SSI benefits. <em>See Adams v. Weinberger, </em>548 F.2d at 245-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Because plaintiff did not receive the full and fair hearing to which he is entitled, this case will be remanded to the district court with instructions to remand it to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
