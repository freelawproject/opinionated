She claims that this condition of employment had a discriminatory impact on females because a significant segment of the workforce consists of women who, like her, are divorced mothers with custody of minor children. Goicoechea argues that the adverse effect of travel requirements lies in their interference with these women\u2019s childcare responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">Assuming that it would be possible for the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination based on the adverse impact of such a policy on women, <em>see Gifford v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>685 F.2d 1149 (9th Cir.1982), we still must conclude that the employer here was entitled to summary judgment. There is no dispute that travel had a \u201cmanifest relationship\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s job as a cable splicer. <em>See Connecticut v. </em>Teal,U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 2531, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982); <em>Dothard v. Rawlinson, </em>433 U.S. 321, 329, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 2727, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977). Although the plaintiff would ordinarily have the opportunity to attempt to prove that the employer\u2019s business interest could be served without discriminatory effect, <em>Dothard, </em>433 U.S. at 329, 97 S.Ct. at 2727, the defendant in this case has a statutory defense. It is undisputed that employees\u2019 travel assignments were made on the basis of a seniority system which was adopted without discriminatory intent. The travel requirement is therefore lawful under the express provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h). <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>- U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1784, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">The defendant offered plaintiff two lesser paying, alternative jobs which did not require travel, and also permitted her to defer a scheduled trip because of her childcare problem. Nevertheless, plaintiff asserts that the employer\u2019s efforts were insufficient because it was required to make a \u201creasonable accommodation,\u201d as defined in cases involving discrimination on the basis of religious observance or practice, to her childcare duties. \u201cReasonable accommodation\u201d of employees\u2019 religious observance or practice is now mandated by statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). Even assuming, however, that an analogy could be drawn to religious discrimination cases, the seniority system would have to be respected. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, </em>432 U.S. 63, 79, 97 S.Ct. 2264, 2274, 53 L.Ed.2d 113 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Plaintiff has also alleged a claim of disparate treatment based on the employer\u2019s refusal to grant her a travel deferment upon the recommendation of a chiropractor. The employer stated under oath that during the period of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, only two males in her job classification were granted travel deferments and neither deferment was on the basis of a chiropractor\u2019s recommendation. Plaintiff\u2019s sworn statements that she had been told by someone else that he had earlier been granted such a travel deferment were insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. <em>See British Airways Board v. Boeing Co., </em>585 F.2d 946, 951-53 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 981, 99 S.Ct. 1790, 60 L.Ed.2d 241 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
