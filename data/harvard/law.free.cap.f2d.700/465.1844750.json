Arlen Beam, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b542-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In 1979 defendant-appellant, Bice Construction Company, an Arkansas corporation, contracted with plaintiff-appellee, CIT Corporation, a Georgia corporation, for a loan to purchase equipment for its business. CIT obtained and perfected a security interest in that equipment. When Bice filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1980, CIT requested a modified stay and sought to foreclose its security interest. Bice counterclaimed alleging that the interest rates in the contract were usurious under Arkansas law, and, therefore, the contract was void. The bankruptcy court dismissed Bice\u2019s counterclaim on December 2, 1980. On appeal the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court. <em>See Bice Construction, Inc. v. CIT Corp., Inc., </em>No. 80-259 (E.D.Ark. April 8, 1982) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The only issue before this court on appeal relates to which state\u2019s usury law applies to the loan agreement in question. The contract which included an interest rate in excess of ten percent per annum, would be usurious and void under Arkansas law. <em>See </em>Ark. Const. Art. 19 \u00a7 13; Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-602, -604, -608 and -609 (1979). However, the agreement also contained a provision in which the parties agreed that the law of Georgia governed all rights and obligations under the contract, and it is undisputed that the contract would not be usurious under that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">In addition to this contract provision, the district court considered the essential undisputed facts that: (1) the loan transaction primarily occurred in Arkansas and Tennessee; (2) the solicitation of the loan agreement took place in Arkansas; (3) the contract was executed by Bice in Arkansas; (4) acceptance of the agreement and execution by CIT occurred in Atlanta, Georgia, pursuant to the contract; (5) payments were to be made to CIT\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta. After a thorough review of Arkansas law, the district court determined that the choice-of-law principle set forth in <em>Cooper v. Cherokee Village Development Co., </em>236 Ark. 37, 364 S.W.2d 158 (Ark.1963) remains the law of Arkansas. <em>Bice Construction, Inc. v. CIT Corp., Inc., supra, </em>slip op. at 9. <em>See Wilkins v. M &amp; H Financial, Inc., </em>476 F.Supp. 212 (E.D.Ark.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>621 F.2d 311 (8th Cir.1980) (per curiam). Under <em>Cherokee Village, </em>where the parties stipulate in a multistate contract that a particular state\u2019s law will govern the validity of a contract, that state law will be held to apply, \u201cprovided that state has a substantial connection with the contract.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Cherokee Village, supra, </em>364 S.W.2d at 161. <em>See also National Surety Corp. v. Inland Properties, </em>286 F.Supp. 173, 190 (E.D.Ark. 1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>416 F.2d 457 (8th Cir.1969) (under <em>Cooper </em>chosen body of law must bear a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d to the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">Applying this principle to the facts of the present case the district court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-17\">the Bankruptcy Court was correct in holding that Georgia law governs the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>stant transaction. There exists a definite agreement between the parties that the instrument be \u201cinterpreted and the rights and obligations of the parties * * * be governed by the law of the State of Georgia.\u201d Additionally, Georgia had a \u201csubstantial connection with\u201d and a \u201creasonable relationship to\u201d the disputed transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><em>Bice Construction, Inc. v. CIT Corp., Inc., supra, </em>slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We have carefully considered the briefs, arguments and the district court order, and conclude that the court\u2019s decision is neither clearly erroneous as to its factual determinations nor mistaken as to the law as it was applied to the facts. Accordingly, we affirm pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of this court on the basis of the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-19\">.
