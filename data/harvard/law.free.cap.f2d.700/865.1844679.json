PRATT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">The central issue on this appeal, as in the companion case decided today, <em>Monferrato v. Schweiker, </em>700 F.2d 869 (2d Cir.1983), is whether mailing a request for review of an administrative law judge\u2019s decision constitutes filing within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under the Social Security Act, particularly 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.968(a). In this case the request for review was allegedly mailed on the last day of the 60-day period provided by the regulations and was dismissed as untimely by the Appeals Council. Reasoning that actual receipt of Dietsch\u2019s application was necessary for timely filing under the regulations, the district court concluded that the application had not been timely filed. Consequently, the court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the Appeals Council\u2019s dismissal of the request for review did not constitute a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b914-18\">In a decision dated August 22, 1980, the administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed the denial of plaintiff\u2019s claim for disability benefits. Under the applicable regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.968, Dietsch had 60 days from receipt of the AU\u2019s decision to request review by the Appeals Council. Receipt of the decision is presumed to be within five days of mailing; thus, plaintiff had until October 27, 1980 to file a timely request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">Dietsch\u2019s attorney claims he mailed the request for review on October 27, 1980, even though it was postmarked October 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>1980. After communicating with counsel concerning the reason for the late postmark, the Appeals Council dismissed Dietsch\u2019s request for review on the ground that it \u201cwas not filed until the afternoon of October 28, 1980\u201d, App. at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">At the administrative level, the Secretary stated that plaintiff\u2019s appeal was mailed, and thus filed, one day late. He therefore equated mailing with filing, which is precisely the position urged by plaintiff in the district court and on appeal. However, before the district court the Secretary altered his position and maintained that mailing does not constitute filing within the meaning of his regulations. Thus, according to the Secretary, even if the request was mailed on the last day of the time period, it was not timely. Without determining the fact issue of when the request was actually mailed, the district court agreed with the Secretary\u2019s legal argument and held that the regulations require that the agency actually receive the request for review on or before the filing deadline. As a result, the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that there was no final decision of the Secretary within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Plaintiff appeals from this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-33 (1976 &amp; Supp. V. 1981), establishes a comprehensive plan for administrative and judicial review of claims for disability benefits. Pursuant to \u00a7 405(a), the Secretary has promulgated regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.900 \u2014 404.983, to effectuate the plan. These include the procedures a claimant must follow to obtain a hearing before an ALJ, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.933, and to obtain Appeals Council review of an ALJ\u2019s adverse determination, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.968.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The regulation at issue, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-968(a)(1), requires that a written request for review be filed \u201c[w]ithin 60 days after the date [the claimant] receive[s] notice of the hearing decision or dismissal.\u201d When an AU\u2019s decision is sent to a claimant, an accompanying form notice states that it is \u201cpresumed that this notice is received within five days after the date [of the decision] * * *.\u201d App. at 17. Thus, a claimant in actuality has 65 days from the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision in which to file a request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The Appeals Council may dismiss an untimely request for review, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.971, and such a dismissal is not reviewable by the district court because it is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g). <em>Sheehan v. Secretary, Health, Educ. and Welfare, </em>593 F.2d 323, 326 (8th Cir.1979); <em>Maloney v. Harris, </em>526 F.Supp. 621, 622 (E.D.N.Y.1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>657 F.2d 264 (2d Cir.1981). The Appeals Council may also extend the filing time on a showing of good cause, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.968(b), but a refusal to do so, like a dismissal of an untimely request, is not subject to judicial review.- <em>Watters v. Harris, </em>656 F.2d 234, 239 \u2014 40 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Sheehan v. Secretary, Health, Educ. and Welfare, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 325; <em>Maloney v. Harris, </em>supra, 526 F.Supp. at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The Secretary contends that these eases are controlling here and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiff\u2019s claim because there is no \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Secretary. Section 405(g) provides that judicial review is available \u201cafter any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing\u201d and has been interpreted to require that, generally speaking, administrative procedures must be exhausted before judicial review is available. <em>See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 327-30, 96 S.Ct. 893, 899-900, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 757, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2462, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). In addition, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) provides that no action to recover on a claim may be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 or 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">In certain limited circumstances, however, federal courts have taken jurisdiction of social security cases where the exhaustion requirement has not been met. For example, the Supreme Court held it could review a plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge to a denial of a pretermination hearing although the claim had not been presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>to the Secretary. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 330-32, 96 S.Ct. at 900-01. And in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, supra, </em>where plaintiffs posed a constitutional challenge to the Act\u2019s duration-of-relationship requirement, the Court found that exhaustion was not required where the Secretary had \u201cdetermined that the only issue to be resolved [was] a matter of constitutional law concededly beyond his competence to decide\u201d. <em>Id., </em>422 U.S. at 767, 95 S.Ct. at 2467. In addition, we have found that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, which authorizes an action in the nature of mandamus, provides jurisdiction to review otherwise unreviewable procedural issues not related to the merits of a claim for benefits. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>643 F.2d 68, 78 (2d Cir.1981); <em>White v. Mathews, </em>559 F.2d 852, 856 (2d Cir.1977); <em>Frost v. Weinberger, </em>515 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">This case falls squarely within our decisions authorizing mandamus jurisdiction in <em>Ellis, White, </em>and <em>Frost. </em>Section 1361 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Assuming for the moment that plaintiff\u2019s' request for review was mailed within the 60-day period, then, if mailing constitutes filing, the Secretary erroneously dismissed plaintiff\u2019s timely request for review. Plaintiff\u2019s challenge is a procedural one: he seeks to compel the Appeals Council to perform its duty with respect to a timely request for review, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.967, 404.-981, and either deny the request or review his case. He has no other avenue for relief. And his procedural dispute is unrelated to the merits of his claim for benefits. We conclude that the district court had mandamus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 to consider his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">We turn now to the merits of plaintiff\u2019s argument that a request for review is filed when it is mailed. In view of the great deference traditionally given to an administrative agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations, <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Connecticut Fund for the Env\u2019t, Inc. and City of Middletown v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>696 F.2d 169, 173 (2d Cir. 1982), we need only look to the Secretary\u2019s own interpretation of \u201cfiling\u201d to determine that in this case mailing within the period would satisfy the filing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The regulation itself does not address the issue. However, the Secretary has interpreted his own regulations to equate mailing with filing. The form notice of the ALJ\u2019s decision sent to claimant states that \u201cyou may <em>file </em>your request for review <em>* * * by sending a letter, </em>requesting review, directly to the Appeals Council * * *.\u201d App. at 17 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the Secretary told the plaintiff, in effect, that by \u201csending\u201d his request for review he would \u201cfile\u201d it. In addition, when the council dismissed plaintiff\u2019s request for review it implicitly recognized that mailing was filing when it stated that the postmark on the request, \u201cthe afternoon of October 28, 1980\u201d, was \u201cprima facie evidence that the request for review was not <em>filed </em>until the afternoon of October 28, 1980.\u201d App. at 15 (emphasis supplied). Furthermore, this interpretation by the council was not accidental, for in the companion appeal, <em>Monferrato, </em>the council similarly determined the date of filing by reference to the date of mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">We recognize that the Secretary has broad statutory discretion to establish rules and regulations to implement the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (1976); <em>see Weinberger v. Salfi, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 766, 95 S.Ct. at 2467. He might have promulgated regulations expressly stating that only receipt, rather than mailing, of a request would satisfy the filing requirement. Conceivably, he might have proscribed mailing entirely. However, he has done neither, and where his own written communication to claimant equates mailing with filing, he cannot dismiss as untimely a request for review that is mailed, as invited, within the 60-day period. Just as we must bow to the Secretary\u2019s administrative interpretation, so must he live with it. We conclude, therefore, that plaintiff\u2019s request for review was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>timely if it was mailed within the time period provided by the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">There remains an issue of fact concerning the date on which plaintiffs request for review was mailed. The letter was postmarked October 28, the day after the expiration of the 60-day period, but counsel for plaintiff has sworn in an affidavit, which was not before the Appeals Council, that the request was mailed on October 27, the last day of the filing period. Since on this appeal the Secretary urged only that the mailing did not constitute filing, an argument which we reject, we do not now know if the Secretary accepts counsel\u2019s credibility on this critical fact. If he does not, then an administrative record with appropriate findings must be developed to establish when the request was mailed. If, in light of counsel\u2019s affidavit, there is no dispute over the date of mailing, then the Appeals Council should treat plaintiff\u2019s request for review as timely and proceed accordingly pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.967, 404.981. In either event, the case must be remanded to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the district court with a direction to remand to the agency for disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
