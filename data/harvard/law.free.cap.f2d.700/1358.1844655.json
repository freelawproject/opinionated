Section 955c, and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, 21 U.S.C. Section 955a(a). The appellants present many issues on appeal relating to jurisdiction, admission of a foreign document, cautionary instructions on a prior conviction, the sufficiency of the evidence, jury instruction on stateless vessels, the seizure of the vessel and the impartiality of the trial judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful consideration of the issues raised by Appellants, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-21\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-22\">On December' 24, 1980, the United States Coast Guard cutter \u201cDependable\u201d encountered a seventy-five foot vessel in the Caribbean Sea, approximately ninety miles south of Cuba and two hundred miles from the nearest point in the United States. The \u201cDependable\u2019s\u201d officers observed that the vessel was headed in a northerly direction, appeared to be heavily loaded and have a false waterline, bore no home port and the name \u201cOcean Lady\u201d was on a plaque affixed to the vessel\u2019s cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-23\">From a distance of approximately one hundred feet, Coast Guard Officer Nelson Romeu made contact with persons aboard the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d by using a cardboard loud-hailer. One of these persons, appellant Marino Sanchez Martin, identified himself as the captain of the vessel and responded to officer Romeu\u2019s questions by stating that the vessel\u2019s name was Ocean Lady, its country of registration was Costa Rica, there were nine crew members, all the crew members were Costa Ricans, the last port was Aruba, the destination was Tampico, Mexico and the vessel had no cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-24\">After this exchange, communication between officer Romeu and the captain resumed by C.B. radio. Romeu asked the same set of questions and the captain responded somewhat differently by stating that the vessel\u2019s country of registration was Honduras, there were thirteen crew members, all crew members were Columbians except himself, a Venezuelan, the last port was Barranquilla, Columbia, the destination was Tampico, Mexico and the vessel had no cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-25\">Captain Marino Sanchez Martin gave permission to the Coast Guard to board the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>\u201cOcean Lady.\u201d After boarding, the Coast Guard personnel noticed the odor of marijuana. The captain produced documents including a Honduran vessel registration certificate and granted officer Romeu\u2019s request to conduct a security sweep of the vessel. The Coast Guard found numerous wrapped packages in the vessel\u2019s engine room, which subsequent tests showed to contain marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">The Coast Guard initiated contact with the government of Honduras and remained on board the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d with the captain\u2019s permission waiting for word from Honduras. The Coast Guard informed the crew that Honduras denied registration of the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d and then placed the thirteen appellants under arrest, advised them of their rights, and transported them to the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Key West, Florida. The thirteen appellants were subsequently indicted, tried by a jury and all were found guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">THE SEIZURE</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">Appellants argue that the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d in international waters was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. Whether the Fourth Amendment applies to stateless vessels is considered an open issue in this circuit. <em>United States v. Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d 1373, 1384 n. 21 (11th Cir.1982). <em>Marino-Garcia, </em>suggested that a number of considerations militate against extension of the Fourth Amendment to stateless vessels and that even if the Fourth Amendment applies, a vessel\u2019s status as stateless may render any search and seizure reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">However, we need not and do not decide this issue because the stopping and boarding of the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d can be sustained under existing case law. As stated in <em>Mari-no-Garcia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-11\">[TTjnder international law, the Coast Guard has the authority to approach an unidentified vessel in order to ascertain the vessel\u2019s nationality. Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, the Coast Guard may subject the unidentified vessel to a seizure for the limited purposes of a document inspection where there is reasonable suspicion to believe either that the vessel is an American flagship or that the vessel is attempting to conceal its identity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1409-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1385. [citations omitted] The Coast Guard approached the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d to determine its nationality. After receiving inconsistent answers concerning the vessel\u2019s country of registration and noting that the name on the vessel\u2019s cabin was in the English language, the Coast Guard had \u201creasonable suspicion to believe\u201d the vessel was \u201cattempting to conceal its identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the vessel\u2019s captain gave permission to the Coast Guard to board the \u201cOcean Lady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-13\">Once on board, the Coast Guard has \u201cthe authority, indeed the duty, to act upon suspicions aroused during the boarding.\u201d <em>United States v. Postal, </em>589 F.2d 862, 889 (5th Cir.1979). When the Coast Guard boarded, the officers noticed the smell of marijuana. The Coast Guard then conducted a security sweep of the vessel, apparently with the captain\u2019s consent, and found packages of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-14\">There was nothing about the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping, boarding or seizure of the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d which violated the Fourth Amendment or would deprive United States federal courts of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-15\">NEXUS</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-16\">Prior to trial the appellants urged the district court to dismiss the indictment as premised on an unconstitutional statute, 21 U.S.C. Section 955a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants again raise this issue on appeal, contending that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>the United States does not have jurisdiction to prosecute a foreign crew member on a non-United States vessel for violation of federal controlled substance laws because there is no nexus between the person, vessel or acts and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">Appellants\u2019 argument is foreclosed by the recent decision of <em>United States v. Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d 1373 (11th Cir.1982), which concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-5\">[tjhere need not be proof of a nexus between the stateless vessel and the country seeking to effectuate jurisdiction. Jurisdiction exists <em>solely </em>as a consequence of the vessel\u2019s status as stateless. Such status makes the vessel subject to action by all nations proscribing certain activities aboard stateless vessels and subjects those persons aboard to prosecution for violating the proscriptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1383. Thus, <em>Marino-Garcia, </em>held that 21 U.S.C. Section 955a \u201cproperly extends the criminal jurisdiction of this country to any stateless vessel in international waters engaged in the distribution of controlled substances.\u201d 679 F.2d at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"AG9Q\">The decision in <em>Marino-Garda </em>is predicated on the vessel\u2019s status as stateless. Appellants, however contend that their convictions must be reversed because the jury instruction on stateless vessels was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-8\">In accordance with the convention on the High Seas,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial judge instructed the jury that \u201ca 'vessel subject to jurisdiction of the United States\u2019 is a vessel which is not validly registered under the law of any nation; or a vessel which claims two or more nationalities according to its convenience, notwithstanding the validity of any claimed nationality... . \u201d Appellants contend that the jury instruction was erroneous because it was not supported by the evidence. Specifically, Appellants contend that the government failed to adduce evidence that Appellants intended to use two flags or nationalities \u201caccording to convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-13\">The evidence at trial was that the Coast Guard received two different responses to questions concerning the vessel\u2019s country of registration (Costa Rica and Honduras), as well as inconsistent answers to other questions. There was testimony that the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d was flying a Honduran flag and that the vessel was not flying any flag. Under these circumstances, the jury instruction was proper. It was within the jury\u2019s province to determine whether Appellants were claiming two nationalities according to convenience. While the jury might have concluded that the vessel\u2019s captain did not understand the first set of questions enabling the jury to disregard the inconsistent answers, the jury instruction provided the jury with that opportunity. The jury instruction was therefore not erroneous as unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-14\">THE DOCUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-15\">A vessel may be stateless under the Convention on the High Seas if it claims two or more nationalities according to convenience or if it is a vessel which is' not validly registered under the law of any nation. The Government sought to prove the latter alternative by the introduction of a certificate of non-registration of the vessel \u201cOcean Lady\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>During the initial encounter with the Coast Guard, the vessel\u2019s captain produced various documents, including a Honduran vessel registration certificate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Coast Guard later informed the thirteen Appellants that the government of Honduras denied registration of the \u201cOcean Lady.\u201d At trial, the Government sought to introduce a certificate from the General Commander of the Naval Force of Honduras concluding that the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d was not registered in Honduras.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellants objected to the document as inadmissible hearsay and contend on appeal that the district court\u2019s admission of the document constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">The Government offered the document into evidence under Federal Rules of Evidence, Rules 803(10)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 902(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellants first contend that Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Evidence, Rule 803(8)(C)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> renders the document inadmissible against any defendants in a criminal proceeding because the document contains \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.\u201d Appellants rely primarily on <em>United States v. Oates, </em>560 F.2d 45 (2nd Cir.1977) to support their position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">In <em>Oates, </em>the Second Circuit concluded that the official report and accompanying worksheet of the United States Custom Service chemist who analyzed the white powdery substance seized from one of the defendants were hearsay and could not satisfy the public records and reports exception of Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(8) because of subsection (C). The <em>Oates </em>court found that the chemist\u2019s report was a report of \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law\u201d and therefore reasoned that Rule 803(8)(C) precluded the document\u2019s status as a public record. The Second Circuit, however, extended the proscription of Rule 803(8)(C) to Rule 803(b), the hearsay exception for records of regularly conducted activity predicated on its reasoning that the congressional intent was to \u201crender law enforcement reports and evaluative reports inadmissible against defendants in criminal cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Oates, </em>560 F.2d at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-10\">Even assuming we were to find the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning persuasive, <em>Oates </em>is inapposite. The document presently in question is not a law enforcement report or an evaluative report. Further, Appellants suggest that we extend Rule 803(8)(C) not to Rule 803(b), but to the entirely distinct hearsay exception for absence of public records or entry embodied in Rule 803(10). Such an interpretation would preclude admission against any defendant in a criminal trial of documents or testimony relating to the absence of any public record or entry. This is not the intent of the Federal Rules of Evidence,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nor has this Circuit ever intimated that the admission of documents or testimony under Rule 803(10) against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>criminal defendant is problematic.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore reject Appellants\u2019 argument that the document\u2019s admissibility was precluded by Rule 803(8)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">Appellants also contend that the document was inadmissible because it did not satisfy the criteria of Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(10). Specifically, Appellants contend that the document was deficient because it did not state there was a diligent search. In considering the admissibility of a document, courts are not bound by \u201cmagic words,\u201d which if they appear like an incantation cast a spell of admissibility on the document. This is especially true when considering translated documents. The Honduran Naval Force certificate recites that \u201can extensive search has been carried out\u201d and the failure to specifically state that a <em>diligent </em>search has occurred does not render the document erroneously admitted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, the \u201cdiligent search\u201d language of Rule 803(10) appears to apply to testimony rather than to certificates in accordance with Rule 902. There is no doubt that the certificate complied with Rule 902(3) concerning self-authenticating foreign public documents. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">Appellants also contend that the Government failed to prove that records of vessels were regularly made and preserved for all of Honduras in that office. Appellants place much emphasis on the fact that the General Commander of the Naval Forces of Honduras is in the City of Comayueguela, Central District, but that the license found aboard the \u201cOcean Lady\u201d was issued by the Commander of the port of Tela, Honduras. The certificate is signed by the \u201cGeneral Commander\u201d of the Naval Force of Honduras and recites its conclusion that after a search at the \u201cheadquarters of this Command of the Title of Registration for the vessel denominated \u2018Ocean Lady\u2019 \u201d that such vessel is not matriculated in Honduras. Appellants\u2019 arguments address the weight to be given to the document by the jury, but do not impair the document\u2019s admissibility when the document is self-authenticating under Rule 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">We therefore conclude that the district court properly admitted the document from the General Commander of the Naval Force of Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-14\">Appellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdicts of guilt on both the conspiracy and possession counts. As we recently stated in <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>694 F.2d 233 (11th Cir.1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-15\">In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>the standard of review is: \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 233. The evidence must be examined in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">The evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The thirteen appellants were aboard a seventy-five foot shrimping vessel with over 26,000 pounds of marijuana. Coast Guard personnel could smell the marijuana as soon as they boarded the vessel. The vessel\u2019s captain gave inconsistent answers regarding the vessel\u2019s country of registration, destination, number and nationality of crew members and last port. Additionally, the captain stated there was no cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">\u201cIt is well established that where crewmen are found aboard a vessel upon which the presence of contraband is obvious, their conspiracy is inferable.\u201d <em>United States v. Julio-Diaz, </em>678 F.2d 1031 (11th Cir.1982). Further, a jury could reasonably conclude that the crewmen constructively possessed the marijuana because more than mere presence has been established. <em>United States v. Biker, </em>670 F.2d 987 (11th Cir.1982). Thus we find that a reasonable jury could have concluded that the thirteen appellants were guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and decline to overturn Appellants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">RICAR-SANCHEZ\u2019S CAUTIONARY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">Appellant Ricar-Sanchez contends that the district court committed error requiring reversal of his conviction by denying his requested cautionary instruction concerning jury consideration of a prior conviction for conspiracy to import marijuana. The evidence of the prior conviction was properly admitted, over objection, in accordance with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 920, 99 S.Ct. 1244, 59 L.Ed.2d 472 (1979), because intent was a seriously contested issue during the trial. Appellant Ricar-Sanchez then requested a cautionary instruction \u201cto the effect that the conviction can only be considered as against Mr. Ricar insofar as it may reflect on the knowledge and intent issue and cannot be used to infer guilt of this charge.\u201d Tr. at 771. The trial judge responded, \u201cI am not going to get into commenting on the evidence. I am simply going to say the government is offering it against Ausberto Ricar-Sanchez and it may only be considered by the jury in their consideration of the verdicts involving his case.\u201d Tr. at 771. After the evidence concerning the prior conviction of Ricar-Sanchez, the trial judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHM\">Ladies and gentlemen, just very briefly, the testimony of the last witness will be considered by you in determining the verdict with respect to Ausberto RicarSanchez.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-12\">It is not admitted into evidence for any other purpose against any other defendant. All right. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-13\">Tr. at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-14\">Without question, the trial judge did not sufficiently instruct the jury. We can only speculate why the judge failed to give the instruction approved by the District Judges Association.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We remind district judges in this circuit of the absolute importance of giving a cautionary instruction to the jury when evidence of extrinsic offenses is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-15\">We must therefore consider whether the district judge\u2019s failure to give the jury a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>sufficient cautionary instruction requires reversal or whether the error is harmless. The doctrine of harmless error does not require reversal of criminal convictions if the error had no substantial influence on the verdict and there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict apart from the error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>573 F.2d 330 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">We find that the error in this case was harmless. There was sufficient evidence to support the verdict without the evidence of the prior conviction of Appellant Ricar-Sanchez. The evidence against all thirteen Appellants was virtually identical. The extrinsic offense evidence against Ricar-Sanchez could not have had a substantial influence on the jury\u2019s verdict where other Appellants, against whom evidence of prior convictions was not admitted, were also convicted. Further, during the final jury charge, the district court instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendant is not on trial for any act or conduct or offense not alleged in the indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that on the specific facts of this case, the failure to give the proper cautionary instruction is harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S IMPARTIALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">Appellants argue that the district judge was not impartial. After a review of the transcript, we find no evidence that the trial judge failed to maintain an aura of impartiality. The trial lasted over a week, involved thirteen defendants and was complicated by language barriers requiring interpreters. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that everything done or said by the trial judge did not please the numerous counsel involved. It appears to us that the trial court was even-handed with all concerned. We therefore find Appellants\u2019 contention to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">Having considered all the issues raised by Appellants and finding that none require reversal, the convictions of all thirteen Appellants are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1408-18\">.

Rule 803(8)(C) provides an exception to the rule excluding hearsay as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-8\">... in civil actions and proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">. Appellants also rely on <em>United States v. Davis, </em>571 F.2d 1354 (5th Cir.1978), which considered the admissibility of certain documents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Agreeing with the district court, <em>Davis </em>concluded that the government\u2019s proffer of the documents did not meet the criteria of Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(8) and also was insufficient to overcome the hurdle posed by subpart (C) precluding admission of \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law\u201d against the defendant in a criminal case. <em>Davis </em>reversed the district court\u2019s admission of the documents on the basis of Rule 803(6). Importantly, <em>Davis </em>did not apply the Rule 803(8)(C) exception to Rule 803(6), but construed Rule 803(6) as precluding the treatment of the documents as records of regularly conducted activity of the agency. Thus, <em>Davis </em>does not lend support to Appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1412-12\">. As noted by one commentator on the Rules of Evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-13\">Rule 803(10) also deals with the question of how the absence of the record may be proved. At common law, absence could not be established by the custodian\u2019s certificate of due search and inability to find. A number of cases predating the federal rules or procedure endorsed this approach, which Wigmore prophesied \u201cwill some day be reck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>oned as one of the most stupid instances of legal pedantry in our annals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-8\">Rule 44(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which makes Rule 44(b) applicable to criminal proceedings, abrogated the common law refusal to allow proof by certificate of a lack of a record. Rule 44(b) authorized proof by a statement in writing declaring that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor was found in the records designated by the statement. This statement had to be authenticated in the same way as Rule 44(a)(1) provided for domestic official records in the case of a domestic record, or according to Rule 44(a)(2) if a foreign record was involved. Rule 44(b) did not prevent resort to any other method authorized by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-9\">4 J.

I would go further than the majority and hold that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the stopping and boarding of a stateless vessel by the Coast Guard. Without such a right, the Coast Guard has no way of determining the vessel\u2019s nationality, which could be United States. This is certainly true of a vessel displaying the name \u201cOcean Lady,\u201d but I do not limit my opinion to vessels with an English language name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 955b subjects to the jurisdiction of the United States \u201ca vessel without nationality.\u201d 14 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 89 authorizes the Coast Guard \u201cupon the high seas\u201d to \u201cgo on board of any vessel subject to the jurisdiction ... of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">Thus, I have no problem interpreting these statutes to authorize the actions of the Coast Guard in this case. To accept the argument of appellants, the Coast Guard could not go on the vessel until a search warrant was obtained. This would require a delay. After boarding, as done here, there would be another delay while awaiting verification of the vessel\u2019s Honduran registration. In my opinion, the defendant\u2019s rights were protected when there was no arrest until the Coast Guard verified the lack of Honduran registration and that the vessel was in fact stateless. <em>See United States v.
