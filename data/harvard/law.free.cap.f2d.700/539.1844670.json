Marolda, president and business manager of Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, Local 19 (\u201cLocal 19\u201d) was indicted on 33 counts of mail fraud and one count of embezzling union funds, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c). The mail-fraud charges were dismissed by the district court; a conviction under \u00a7 501(c) was eventually reversed by this court. <em>See United States v. Marolda, </em>648 F.2d 623 (9th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 9, 1979, Catherine E. Mullens, a member of Local 19, filed internal union charges against Marolda in accordance with the constitution of the international union and the bylaws of Local 19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mullens\u2019 charges tracked those of the federal prosecution of Marolda.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">More than 3 months of union inaction followed the filing of charges, prompting Mullens to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor (\u201cSecretary\u201d) on August 30, 1979. Subsequently, on November 13,1979, the financial secretary-treasurer of Local 19, Ron Davis, notified Marolda and Local 19 vice president Vincent Curci of Mullens\u2019 charges against Marolda. Later that month, Curci was designated by the international union president to name a trial committee to hear Mullens\u2019 charges. Curci did not actually name a trial committee until July 8, 1981, shortly after our ruling on Marolda\u2019s appeal from his federal conviction. Two days later, the union trial committee informed Mullens that it intended to dismiss her charges unless she could demonstrate good cause why they should not be dismissed. Mullens\u2019 July 13, 1981, response stated that she did not intend to drop her charges, and that she did not feel the merits of those charges had been addressed in the rulings of the federal courts on the Marolda prosecution. Nevertheless, the trial committee dismissed Mullens\u2019 charges, informing Mullens of this by letter dated July 16, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">Meanwhile, on November 29, 1979, the Secretary brought an action against Local 19 under Title IV of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, (\u201cLMRDA\u201d), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 481-83. The complaint alleged that Local 19 had violated the LMRDA \u201cby failing to follow its Constitution and By-Laws pertaining to removal of an elected officer guilty of serious misconduct.\u201d Complaint, \u00a7 VIII. The Secretary concedes that the constitution and bylaws governing Local 19 provide an adequate removal procedure but argues that they were not followed in this instance. On November 17, 1981, the district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment and on November 24, 1981, ordered Local 19 to conduct a removal proceeding against Marolda under the supervision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">The dispositive question on this appeal is whether the LMRDA authorizes the Secretary to bring a civil action against a union for failure to follow its concededly adequate removal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">Generally speaking, the LMRDA was enacted to \u201ccorrect the abuses which have crept into labor and management .... \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>S.Rep. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2318, 2318, <em>and </em>1 NLRB, <em>Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, </em>397, 398 (1959) (hereinafter \u201cLeg.Hist.\u201d). <em>See </em>LMRDA \u00a7 2, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401; <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Association, </em>389 U.S. 463, 469-70, 88 S.Ct. 643, 647, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968); Cox, <em>Internal Affairs of Labor Unions Under the Labor Reform Act of 1959, </em>58 Mich.L.Rev. 819 (1960). The primary goal of Title IV of the LMRDA \u201cis to insure \u2018free and democratic\u2019 [union] elections.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers, </em>389 U.S. at 470, 88 S.Ct. at 648. Title IV also regulates procedures for the removal of union officers. This is our first occasion to examine the reach of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Union procedures for the removal of officers are governed specifically by \u00a7 401(h) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(h). It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">If the Secretary, upon application of any member of a local labor organization, finds after hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act that the constitution and bylaws of such labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for the removal of an elected officer guilty of serious misconduct, such officer may be removed, for cause shown and after notice and hearing, by the members in good standing voting in a secret ballot conducted by the officers of such labor organization in accordance with its constitution and bylaws insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">It is clear that this section grants no authority for allowing the Secretary to intervene in union removal proceedings in the absence of a finding that the union\u2019s constitution and bylaws provide an inadequate removal procedure. This is in contrast to \u00a7 401(e)\u2019s regulation of union <em>elections, </em>where it is required that \u201c[t]he election shall be conducted in accordance with the constitution and bylaws of such organization insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this title.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 401(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The Secretary admits that \u00a7 401(h), standing alone, does not regulate a union whose removal procedures, as written, are adequate. However, the Secretary argues that Title IV has a \u201cdual procedure\u201d for removing union officers. The second part of the Secretary\u2019s proposed dual procedure is found in \u00a7 402, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482, the enforcement provisions of Title IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Section 402 enforces the provisions of Title IV in the following way: Section 402(a) permits union members to file complaints against their union with the Secretary. Section 402(b) obliges the Secretary to investigate a member\u2019s complaint. If he finds probable cause to believe Title IV has been violated, he must bring a civil action against the union. Section 402(c) governs the trial and disposition of the Secretary\u2019s suit. Lastly, \u00a7 402(d) regulates appeals from court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The Secretary argues that a parenthetical in \u00a7 402(a) authorizes him to bring suit against a union for failure to follow its adequate removal procedures. In pertinent part, \u00a7 402(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">A member of a labor organization\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">(1) who has exhausted the remedies available under the constitution and bylaws of such organization and of any parent body, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">(2) who has invoked such available remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months after their invocation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">may file a complaint with the Secretary within one calendar month thereafter alleging the violation of any provision of section 401 <em>(including violation of the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization pertaining to the election and removal of officers).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">(Emphasis added.) The most natural reading of the emphasized parenthetical phrase is that it is meant to modify the preceding term, namely, \u201csection 401,\u201d and not to place a further substantive restraint on union removal procedures. But to the extent the parenthetical purports to define the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>reach of \u00a7 401, it is seemingly in error, since a violation of a union\u2019s constitution and bylaws relating to removal is generally not a violation of \u00a7 401.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To understand this apparent contradiction, an examination of the legislative history of the LMRDA is in order. See <em>United States v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>345 U.S. 295, 315, 73 S.Ct. 706, 717, 97 L.Ed. 1020 (1953); <em>International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. v. General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp., </em>518 F.2d 913, 917-18 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The focus of our inquiry into the legislative history of the LMRDA is the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The original Senate version of the LMRDA, S. 505, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), <em>reprinted in </em>1 Leg.Hist. 29, had a section governing removal procedures virtually identical to \u00a7 401(h) of the LMRDA. S. 505 \u00a7 301(f), 1 Leg.Hist. at 62.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The precursor to LMRDA \u00a7 402(a), however, had a different descriptive parenthetical. It read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">A member of a labor organization\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">(1) who has exhausted the remedies available under the constitution and bylaws of such organization and of any parent body, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">(2) who has invoked such available remedies without obtaining a final decision within four calendar months after their invocation, may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within one calendar month thereafter alleging the violation of any provision of section 301 [subsequently LMRDA \u00a7 401] <em>(including violation of the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">5. 505 \u00a7 302(a), 1 Leg.Hist. 62-63 (emphasis added). S. 505, as written, did not present the ambiguity found in the LMRDA as enacted, because the parenthetical in S. 505 \u00a7 302(a) merely emphasizes the point that the members may file a complaint with the Secretary concerning any violation of \u00a7 301, even those 'subsections of \u00a7 301 requiring unions, in certain instances, to follow procedures found in their constitutions and bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">The Senate Committee made over 40 amendments to S. 505 and reported it out in a clean bill as S. 1555. <em>See </em>1 Leg.Hist. at vii. With one minor exception,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the reported bill contained sections identical to those finally enacted as LMRDA \u00a7\u00a7 401(h) and 402(a), including the disputed parenthetical. <em>See </em>S. 1555, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7\u00a7 301(g), 302(a) (1959), <em>reprinted in </em>1 Leg.Hist. 338, 375-76. The crucial question is what the Senate Committee intended by its amended parenthetical. For\u2019 this we turn to the Committee report.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">Part I of the Committee report is entitled \u201cPurpose of the Bill.\u201d There we find the following statement: \u201cIn brief, the bill, S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>1555, would accomplish the following: .. . (30) Procedures whereby a union officer guilty of serious misconduct in office may be removed by a secret ballot vote after court proceedings <em>if the union\u2019s constitution does not provide adequate machinery for such removal . </em>... \u201d S.Rep. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2318, 2318, 2320, <em>and </em>1 Leg.Hist. 397, 398, 400 (emphasis added). This strongly suggests that the provisions in the bill allowing the Secretary to intervene in union removal proceedings make such intervention contingent on a finding of inadequate union procedures. The statement of purpose does not, however, explain the amended parenthetical. The section-by-section analysis of S. 1555 is notably unenlightening, since it merely reiterates the statutory language. <em>See </em>S.Rep. 187 at 47-48; 1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 2364-65; 1 Leg.Hist. at 443-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The mystery of the amended parenthetical is solved by a reading of Appendix B to the \u201cMinority Views\u201d presented in the Senate report. The significance of the minority statement justifies quotation at some length.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[Section 302 of S. 1555, later LMRDA \u00a7 402] authorizes the Secretary to bring a civil action against the local union in a Federal court upon a complaint of a member of the local alleging that section 301 [LMRDA \u00a7 401] has been violated (i.e., that there is no adequate procedure for removal of officers in the local\u2019s constitution and bylaws) including violation \u201cof the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization <em>pertaining to the election and removal of officers.\u201d </em>Despite the italicized language which was added at the insistence of the minority, the phraseology of this provision (sec. 302(a)) [LMRDA \u00a7 402(a) ] is, at best, ambiguous in the extreme. It is exceedingly doubtful whether the Secretary is authorized to act on a complaint of a union member that his local\u2019s constitution and bylaws do contain an adequate procedure for the removal of officers, but the local or its officers is nevertheless refusing to comply with its own prescribed procedures in that regard. A close scrutiny of the language leads almost inevitably to the conclusion that these provisions establish a remedy in the courts through the Secretary <em>only </em>where the local\u2019s constitution and bylaws fail to provide an adequate procedure for removal of the local\u2019s elected officers, but do not give judicial relief where such a procedure exists but the local refuses to apply or follow it. The minority urged that section 301(g) [LMRDA \u00a7 401(h) ] be modified to permit the Secretary to sue in the courts upon a finding that an adequate procedure was lacking or, where it was provided <em>was not being followed, </em>but the majority would not agree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">S.Rep. 187 at 103; 1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2407; 1 Leg.Hist. at 499 (\u201cMinority Views,\u201d Appendix B) (all emphases in original). The minority\u2019s interpretation of the removal provisions of the bill could conceivably be discounted as an attempt to encourage opposition to the bill.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Senate Committee\u2019s reported failure to agree to the minority\u2019s proposed amendment to S. 1555 \u00a7 301(g) (LMRDA \u00a7 401(h)) demonstrates a Congressional refusal to grant the Secretary the very power he seeks to exercise in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This excerpt convinces us that the amended parenthetical was a cosmetic change agreed to by the majority on the understanding that the amendment did not entail an expansion of the Secretary\u2019s authority to intervene in union affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Further evidence that Congress did not intend to confer upon the Secretary the authority he now claims is derived from an examination of another labor bill referred to the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare during the period of the Committee\u2019s consideration of S. 505. This bill, S. 748, would have required that \u201c[e]very labor organization shall have <em>and follow </em>procedures which effectively insure to its members the opportunity directly to remove elected officers from office by majority vote upon a showing that a substantial number of the members desire a recall vote.\u201d S. 748, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 302(e) (1959), <em>reprinted in </em>1 Leg.Hist. 84,112 (emphasis added). This bill, which was never reported out of committee, featured clear language that would require a union to follow its removal procedures. The absence of such language from S. 1555, in the face of a competing bill containing such language, is further support for our conclusion that Congress did not intend to allow the Secretary to intervene upon a union\u2019s failure to follow its removal procedures where those procedures, as enacted, are adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The Secretary has also mined the legislative history, and has found what he believes to be a nugget. Senator Goldwater, on August 28, 1959, placed into the record a study \u201cprepared by a staff member\u201d that summarizes action taken by the conference committee on the respective labor bills of the House and Senate. In its summary of Title IV, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">Removal of union officers: House bill provides removal procedures where union constitution does not provide an adequate procedure for removal of union officers guilty of serious misconduct. Senate bill provides removal procedures even where there is an adequate procedure in union constitution but it is not being followed. Conference adopted Senate provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">105 Cong.Rec. 17,327 (1959), <em>reprinted in </em>2 Leg.Hist. at 1376.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For several reasons, we believe the wish was father to Senator Goldwater\u2019s vicariously attributed thought, and decline to assign it much weight.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>First, this analysis, or a similar statement, is notorious by its absence from the Conference Report, which, like the Senate Report on S. 1555, merely reiterates the language of the relevant sections in its section-by-section analysis. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 34-35, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2503, 2506-07, <em>and </em>1 Leg.Hist. 934, 938-39. Second, this statement was merely inserted unspoken into the Record, thus making it unlikely that a senator would be motivated to dispute the staff member\u2019s analysis. Third, the statement was placed in the Record more than 4 months after the Senate had sent S. 1555 to the House. Although the Senate had yet to approve the Conference Report as of the date this statement appeared, the Senate debate on the provisions of S. 1555 were essentially concluded. The statement is thus functionally equivalent to a post-enactment statement and, for that reason, possessive of little persuasive force.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Lastly, this statement contradicts previous statements of Senator Goldwater himself. Senator Goldwater was a signatory to the Minority Views of the Senate Report quoted <em>supra </em>p. 540. Later, on May 7, 1959, Senator Goldwater had inserted into the Record a staff report which contains this statement: \u201cMost shockingly ... is what appears to be the failure of the bill [S. 1555] to provide any remedy where the union\u2019s constitution or bylaws do contain an adequate removal procedure but the union refuses to apply them.\u201d 105 Cong. Rec. 7632, <em>reprinted in 2 </em>Leg.Hist. at 1272. On July 24,1959, in a speech to the National Press Club that was also placed into the Record, Senator Goldwater states, \u201cUnder the Senate bill there is some doubt whether there is any provision which permits union members to invoke or enforce the procedures contained in their union\u2019s constitution or bylaws for the removal of union officers guilty of serious misconduct.\u201d 105 Cong. Rec. 14,203, <em>reprinted in 2 </em>Leg.Hist. at 1322. All these various statements analyzed the identical language.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">We conclude from the legislative history of the LMRDA that Congress did not intend to expand the substantive legislation on union removal procedures beyond the limits of \u00a7 401. It necessarily follows then that those regulations found in 29 C.F.R. Part 417, Subpart B, that purport to give the Secretary a general authority to intervene in union affairs upon a finding that a union has failed to follow its adequate removal procedures are void for lack of statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">We should emphasize that our reading of \u00a7\u00a7 401(h) and 402(a) does not render \u00a7 402(a)\u2019s parenthetical \u201csuperfluous, void, contradictory or insignificant.\u201d <em>Rockbridge v. Lincoln, </em>449 F.2d 567, 571 (9th Cir.1971). There is in fact one occasion where the Secretary is entitled to ensure that a union follow its removal procedures. This intervention is authorized when a union fails to follow its procedures in a removal vote subsequent to a court order compelling the union to conduct a removal procedure. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u25a0 401(h). Of course, the previous court order can only be issued following a finding that the union has inadequate removal procedures, but that finding would not exclude the possibility that a union\u2019s procedure for the removal vote itself are adequate. In this narrow set of circumstances, the LMRDA does authorize the Secretary to go to court to compel a union to follow its adequate removal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">We are mindful that the language of a labor statute such as the LMRDA should be read \u201cagainst the background of its legislative history and in light of the general objectives Congress sought to achieve.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers, </em>389 U.S. 463, 468, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>88 S.Ct. 643, 646, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968). An examination of the legislative purpose behind the LMRDA generally, and Title IV specifically, confirms our reading of the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The primary purpose of the LMRDA was undoubtedly to remedy perceived abuses by labor unions, although it also imposed requirements on employers. However, Congress was very determined not to interfere with union affairs if not absolutely necessary. The Senate Report on S. 1555 lists three guiding principles behind the bill. The first two speak directly to this Congressional concern.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Supreme Court has recently reemphasized this point, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">In drafting Titles II through VI, Congress was guided by the general principle that unions should be left free to \u201coperate their own affairs, as far as possible.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1684, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1958). It believed that only essential standards should be imposed by legislation, and that in establishing those standards, great care should be taken not to undermine union self-government. Given certain minimum standards, \u201cindividual members are fully competent to regulate union affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, for example, in Title IV, which regulates the conduct of union elections, Congress simply set forth certain minimum standards. So long as unions conform with these standards, they are free \u201cto run their own elections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-12\"><em>United Steelworkers of America v. Sadlowski, </em>457 U.S. 102, 117, 102 S.Ct. 2339, 2348, 72 L.Ed.2d 707 (1982) (quoting <em>Wirtz </em>v. <em>Bottle Blowers, </em>389 U.S. at 471, 88 S.Ct. at 648).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">This counsel of limited government interference in union affairs applies particularly well to the situation now before us. If the Secretary were to make a practice of interfering in union removal proceedings under circumstances similar to those of Local 19, he would run the danger of excessive involvement in union politics. The LMRDA itself provides remedy for union faithlessness to removal procedures in two ways. Section 504, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 504, makes it a criminal violation for a person convicted of a serious offense to hold union office.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Lesser offenses justifying removal will eventually be considered by union members during their election of officers, which must occur at least once every 3 years, and which must be conducted in accordance with adequate election procedures. LMRDA \u00a7 401(b), (e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(b), (e).

The House was working on a different track from that of the Senate on matters eventually covered by Title IV. The House Bill, H.R. 8400, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959) (Landrum-Griffin), <em>reprinted in </em>1 Leg.Hist. 619, did have a provision comparable to LMRDA \u00a7 401(h) in that it only allowed intervention in removal proceedings upon a finding that the union had inadequate removal procedures. <em>See </em>H.R. 8400 \u00a7 401(g), 1 Leg.Hist. at 656. (Although the House Bill was technically H.R. 8342, the text of H.R. 8400 was substituted for the original text of H.R. 8342 on the House floor.) However, the bill did not contain any language comparable to the LMRDA \u00a7 402(a) parenthetical, and, in fact, did not provide a role for the Secretary in enforcing Title IV. <em>See </em>H.R. 8400 \u00a7 402(a), 1 Leg.Hist. 657. Instead, theHouse bill would have allowed individual union member.s to go directly to court if they were harmed by a violation of \u00a7 401. <em>Id. </em>The Conference committee explicitly adopted the provisions of the Senate Bill for both LMRDA \u00a7 401(h) and \u00a7 402(a). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.

Generally speaking, the remarks of legislators opposed to legislation are given little weight in the construction of statutes. See <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfeider, </em>425 U.S. 185, 203 n. 24, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1385-86 n. 24, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>Mastro Plastics Corp. v.

However, where the statements are made at a point where a response by proponents of legislation would be appropriate, and there is no response, the statements of opposing legislators merit some consideration. <em>See Arizona v. California, </em>373 U.S. 546, 583 n. 85, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 1489 n. 85, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963); <em>Pariane Sportswear Co. v.

A review of the record reveals that Senator Goldwater was critical of S. 1555 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>because, in his view, it inadequately regulated union behavior. <em>See, e.g., </em>105 Cong.Rec. 6742, reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist. 1254 (explanation of vote against S. 1555).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b594-15\">. <em>See </em>note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">. 1. The committee recognized the desirability of minimum interference by Government in the internal affairs of any private organization. Trade unions have made a commendable effort to correct internal abuses; hence the committee believes that only essential standards should be imposed by legislation. Moreover, in establishing and enforcing statutory standards great care should be taken not to undermine union self-government or weaken unions in their role as collective-bargaining agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">2. Given the maintenance of minimum democratic safeguards and detailed essential information about the union, the individual members are fully competent to regulate union affairs. The committee strongly opposes any attempt to prescribe detailed procedures and standards for the conduct of union business. Such paternalistic regulation would weaken rather than strengthen the labor movement; it would cross over into the area of trade union licensing and destroy union independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">S.Rep. 187 at 7; 1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.

Local 19 has requested an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the Secretary.
