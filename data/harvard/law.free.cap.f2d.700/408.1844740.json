The defendants contend that because they intended to commit only one state crime (arson), the indictment charging them with multiple violations of the Travel Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was multiplicious, and also that the district judge erred in sentencing the defendants to consecutive terms of imprisonment. The defendant Briggs contends that the trial court likewise erred when it admitted into evidence the identification testimony of two witnesses that resulted from \u201cunduly suggestive [identification] procedures.\u201d Schlacks asserts that the trial judge erred in denying Schlacks\u2019 motion for a new trial and/or resentencing based on newly discovered evidence, and both defendants allege that the trial court erred in denying their motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-19\">The defendants-appellants were charged with violating the Travel Act and conspiring to violate the Travel Act for their involvement in a scheme to burn down the Anson &amp; Gilkey Company lumber mill in Merrill, Wisconsin. Specifically, Briggs and Schlacks were charged with conspiring to commit the state crime of arson and with causing other individuals to travel from Chicago, Illinois to Merrill, Wisconsin with the intent to commit the arson. Both defendants were also charged with using an interstate facility (i.e. a telephone) in furtherance of the arson scheme while Briggs was also charged with traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to commit the arson. Prior to trial, two of the defendants\u2019 co-conspirators (MacKenzie and Welchman) entered into plea agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>with the government, and in exchange for their testimony at trial, the government agreed not to charge them as co-conspirators of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the close of a three week trial, the jury found the defendants Briggs and Schlacks guilty on all counts. The trial judge denied both defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n.o.v. and sentenced Briggs to three consecutive terms of 18 months imprisonment each on counts I, II and III and Schlacks to three consecutive one-year terms of imprisonment on counts I, III and IV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Briggs was also sentenced to three years probation on count IV to commence upon his release from physical custody. Briggs and Schlacks have appealed from their convictions and sentences. Schlacks has also appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial and resentencing based upon newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">1. <em>Identification Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The government offered evidence demonstrating that during the course of the conspiracy to burn the Anson &amp; Gilkey plant, the defendant Briggs traveled with Fred Welchman and Roderick MacKenzie from Chicago, Illinois to Merrill, Wisconsin to give them an opportunity to view the physical layout of the lumber mill. During the return trip to Chicago, Welchman was stopped and issued a speeding citation by Illinois State Trooper Leland Files. At trial Officer Files testified that at the time he issued Welchman the citation, the defendant Briggs and one other male were in the vehicle with Welchman. Defense counsel objected to this identification on the grounds that Files\u2019 in-court identification was \u201ctainted,\u201d and the trial court granted counsel\u2019s request to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of Officer Files.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the <em>voir dire </em>examination, Officer Files testified that approximately two weeks after stopping Welchman for speeding an FBI agent visited his house and showed him two photographs and a candid snapshot and asked him to identify the men depicted therein. Files was able to identify the mug shots of Welchman and MacKenzie as being two of the three individuals in the car he had stopped for speeding, but was unable to identify Briggs from the family-type snapshot of Briggs and another person on the same picture. Files stated to the FBI agent that the third individual was \u201ca heavy set man but I could not make out the description of the man because he was in the back seat.\u201d During <em>voir dire </em>Officer Files further testified that while he was waiting outside of the courtroom to be called as a witness he observed Briggs conversing with another individual and at this time without any prompting or suggestion from anyone, he realized that Briggs was the \u201cheavy set man\u201d he had seen seated in the back seat of the car at the time he (Files) stopped Welchman for speeding. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial arguing that Officer Files\u2019 in-court identification of the defendant Briggs was \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d The trial court denied the motion ruling that Officer Files\u2019 identification of Briggs was not impermissibly suggestive and that Files\u2019 previous inability to identify Briggs from the small family-type snapshot went to the trustworthiness of the witness\u2019s identification of Briggs and not to its admissibility and thus raised a question for the trier of fact, the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Prior to this incident but during the same return trip to Chicago, Welchman, MacKenzie and Briggs stopped at a pizza restaurant in Wausau, Wisconsin and asked for directions to an automobile junkyard or body-shop in the area, as they were looking for an old car to steal a set of Wisconsin motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>vehicle license plates therefrom in order to conceal the ownership of the automobile they intended to use on the contemplated arson trip. At trial, the government offered the testimony of Lance Longo, a waiter in the Wausau pizza restaurant, who stated that on the night in question he had waited on three men, two of whom he identified as Welchman and Briggs. During the <em>voir dire </em>examination Longo explained that when he was shown the home-type candid snapshot of Briggs and another person on one picture, he was unable to identify Briggs as one of the men. However, he related that while waiting to testify at trial he saw Briggs in the courtroom and later in the hallway and, without any prompting or suggestion, he alerted federal agents that he recognized Briggs as one of the three men he had spoken with in the restaurant. Defense counsel again objected to this type of in-court identification of Briggs on the grounds that the identification was \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d After an exhaustive <em>voir dire </em>examination of the witness during trial but in the absence of the jury, the district judge denied counsel\u2019s motion, ruling that Longo\u2019s inadvertent presence in the courtroom while others were testifying did not taint his identification of Briggs and was not \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d In fact no proof was offered at trial that anyone had suggested to Longo that he identify Briggs as one of the men in the restaurant on the night in question. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not persuaded that the testimony that Mr. Longo heard was influential or would have impaired his ability to be a fair witness; and I am not persuaded in view of the number of people at counsel table, that Mr. Longo\u2019s being in the courtroom and seeing all those people lined up would have made his identification of Mr. Briggs so impermissibly suggestive as to be disallowed in this proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Relying upon <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375,34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), the defendant Briggs asserts that the district court erred in refusing to apply the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to determine the reliability of the witnesses\u2019 in-court identification of Briggs. Briggs argues that <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>requires an examination of a number of factors (such as the witness\u2019s degree of attention at the initial confrontation between the defendant and the witness, the accuracy of the prior description of the defendant, etc.) in order to determine whether the witnesses\u2019 identification of the defendant should be admitted at trial. 409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382. However, in this fact situation we disagree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>as requiring an examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding Files\u2019 and Longo\u2019s ability to identify Briggs. The <em>Biggers </em>Court stated that the central question was \u201cwhether under the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 [test] the identification was reliable <em>even though the confrontation procedure was suggestive.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis supplied). Thus, it is incumbent upon a defendant to establish that the confrontation procedure in fact was suggestive prior to reaching the threshold \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Before a court excludes an in-court identification of a defendant by a witness on the grounds that the identification procedure was suggestive, the defendant must establish that there has been \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 198, 93 S.Ct. at 381. <em>See also Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). Briggs contends that \u201cintervening circumstances [exist] which cast doubt on the accuracy of [Files\u2019 and Longo\u2019s] identifications\u201d of Briggs. The defendant asserts that Files\u2019 identification is not reliable because Files initially observed Briggs during an \u201cunremarkable\u201d traffic stop on an unlighted highway in the middle of the night. The defendant ignores the fact that the traffic stop was not \u201cunremarkable\u201d since Officer Files testified that he was wary of stopping the individuals in Welchman\u2019s car as officers in the 1970s have been trained to guard against the possibility that the occupants of the car may often be armed and dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>and/or fleeing a crime. Files further revealed that he illuminated the interior of the car with his spotlight and also shined his flashlight on the occupants\u2019 hands and faces, thus providing him with the opportunity to make a clear observation of the identity of the occupants of the car. Briggs challenges Longo\u2019s identification on the grounds that Longo was directed by a secretary to sit in the courtroom during another witness\u2019s testimony in violation of the sequestration order and further that Lon-go\u2019s initial contact with Briggs was also \u201cunremarkable\u201d and therefore Longo\u2019s testimony was likewise suspect. However, it is not unusual for witnesses to sit in the courtroom during trial, and there is no proof in the record that the secretary who so directed Longo was aware of any sequestration order. Furthermore, the record fails to reveal that there was anything in the courtroom setting that would \u201cimpermissibly suggest\u201d to Longo that he identify Briggs, as Briggs was seated at a table with five other individuals, all of whom conceivably could have been defendants in this case. Longo also testified that he remembered his contact with the defendant because on the night the men visited the restaurant premises, the restaurant was empty and the weather was especially bad. Finally, Files and Longo each testified that no government agent made any suggestion to them whatsoever that they specifically identify Briggs as the man they saw on the night in question. Officer Files testified that when he recognized Briggs in the hallway adjacent to the courtroom, he did so without any prompting or suggestion and the defendant has failed to cite any evidence in the record that Files\u2019 confrontation in the hallway with Briggs was impermissibly suggestive. Furthermore, as noted above, when Briggs was identified in court by both Longo and Files, he was seated with his counsel at the defense table along with the other two defendants and their respective counsel. The witnesses (Files and Longo) could have identified any of these six individuals (i.e., three defendants and three attorneys) as being Briggs, but because of their prior contact with Briggs, the witnesses identified him as being the one in the company of MacKenzie and Welchman. Therefore, since the record reveals that the defendant has failed to meet the threshold test of establishing that there was a \u201csubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d of Briggs, we hold that a suggestive confrontation procedure was not employed in this case and the spontaneous identifications of Briggs were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We also disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have excluded the identifications solely because of the witnesses\u2019 previous inability to identify Briggs from the home-type snapshot. The defendant has failed to support this novel theory with any controlling case law and our review of relevant case law suggests that a witness\u2019s prior inability to identify a defendant goes to the credibility of the in-court identification and not to its admissibility, and thus raises a proper question of fact for the jury to determine. For example, in <em>United States v. Black, </em>412 F.2d 687 (6th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1018, 90 S.Ct. 583, 24 L.Ed.2d 509 (1970), an eyewitness was unable to pick out the defendant\u2019s picture from a pretrial photo spread but nonetheless was able to correctly identify the defendant at trial. The court held this identification was admissible, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cThe fact that eye witnesses to an occurrence cannot make a positive identification of an individual from an examination of photographs of a number of persons, does not necessarily detract from the validity of their in-court identification where they see the individual in person. The weight to be given to their in-court identification is for the jury to determine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Briggs\u2019 defense counsel during <em>voir dire </em>and in the presence of the jury exhaustively examined and cross-examined Files and Longo concerning their initial contacts with the defendant and their inability to identify Briggs from the snapshot, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>jury apparently chose to believe the witnesses. Furthermore, there is no proof that the snapshot of Briggs which was shown to these witnesses was of good quality; testimony at trial revealed that it was .a candid photo of the defendant and an unidentified woman, taken in a home while the defendant was talking on the telephone. Therefore, since the defendant has failed to establish that there was a \u201cvery substantial likelihood of misidentification,\u201d and because Files\u2019 and Longo\u2019s prior inability to identify Briggs went only to the reliability of their testimony, the weight to be given to Files\u2019 and Longo's in-court identifications of Briggs was a question properly for the jury\u2019s consideration and we hold the district court did not err in allowing the testimony of these witnesses identifying Briggs to be received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">2. <em>Closing Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">During the closing argument of defendant Schlacks\u2019 attorney, the trial judge on two occasions interrupted the defense attorney. The defendant Schlacks contends that the district court\u2019s interruption of his counsel\u2019s closing argument was unduly critical of his trial counsel and was prejudicial to him (Schlacks). The first interruption took place as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Now let\u2019s take an example. Rod MacKenzie. You saw him on the stand. The mental illness of the man is just unbelievable. I mean, you saw his paranoia; you saw the way he looked, you saw his answers to questions presented to him. There is a man who went to jail and tried to commit suicide. I mean, a perfect example of somebody who isn\u2019t well in the head. He tried to commit suicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">And then he talks about his lying. I know the man is a pathological liar. He comes up to us and he brings us\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">The Court: Mr. Grauer, I\u2019m going to break in and suggest that you\u2019re not in a position to give a psychiatric evaluation of the witness. You can suggest attributes or traits that you observed, but you\u2019re not in a position to characterize</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">those as having some recognized psychiatric medical definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">Defense Counsel: All right, Your Honor, I apologize.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Later during the same closing argument, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">\u201cDefense Counsel: And, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Schlacks] has been charged with a crime. But I\u2019ll tell you what the real crime is here, Ladies and Gentlemen. It\u2019s a crime that Dan Schlacks has had to come to this Court and defend himself\u2014 Prosecutor: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">The Court: Mr. Grauer, that goes beyond the bounds of good argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">Defense Counsel: I apologize. \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">It is well settled that to warrant reversal because of a trial judge\u2019s comments during a defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, \u201cit must appear that the conduct [of the trial judge] measured by the facts of the case presented together with the result of the trial, was clearly prejudicial to the rights of the party.\u201d <em>United States v. Eldred, </em>588 F.2d 746, 750 (9th Cir.1978). Indeed, \u201c[a] federal judge has the right, and often the obligation, to interrupt the presentations of counsel in order to clarify misunderstandings or otherwise insure that the trial proceeds efficiently and fairly.\u201d <em>United States v. McGovern, </em>499 F.2d 1140, 1144 (1st Cir.1974). Moreover, as the reviewing court, we are \u201crequired to view these comments from the perspective of the proceedings as a whole\u201d to determine whether under the totality of the circumstances Schlacks was denied a fair trial. <em>United States v. Roell, </em>487 F.2d 395, 403 (8th Cir.1973). Our examination of the transcript leads us to the conclusion that the court did not abuse its discretion in commenting on counsel\u2019s statements, and the defendant was not \u201cclearly prejudiced\u201d by the trial judge\u2019s remarks.. It is apparent from the record that in referring to MacKenzie as a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who exhibited \u201cparanoia\u201d and who \u201cisn\u2019t well in the head,\u201d defense counsel was referring to MacKenzie in medical psychiatric terms in a possible effort to set forth a psychiatric evaluation of MacKenzie, regardless of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>there was no medical testimony from a qualified medical expert in the record to support the defense counsel\u2019s attempted \u201cdiagnosis.\u201d Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s statement that it was a \u201ccrime\u201d that Schlacks should be charged with the offenses in the indictment, if not actually going beyond the range of proper argument, it certainly borders on the same. In the trial of a lawsuit where defense counsel makes improper suggestions to the jury and his statements go beyond the range of what a judge determines is proper argument, we hold that it is well within the discretion of the trial judge to advise and caution defense counsel during the argument, as to the appropriateness of counsel\u2019s remarks. In so holding, we reaffirm that it is a trial judge\u2019s responsibility to protect both the defendant\u2019s and the prosecution\u2019s rights to a fair and speedy trial while insuring efficiency in the administration of the justice system and guarding against the added expense and delay necessitated when and if a mistrial were to be declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Furthermore, even if it had been error for the trial judge to interrupt' Schlacks\u2019 counsel during closing argument, which we hold it was not, before the conduct of the trial judge rises to the level of reversible error, the defendant must demonstrate that the judge\u2019s conduct was prejudicial and substantially interfered with the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>United States v. McPartlin, </em>595 F.2d 1321, 1356 (7th Cir.1979) (Pell, J., concurring). In establishing the standard against which reviewing courts must measure a judge\u2019s statements during trial, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201c[0]ur examination of the record as a whole leads us to the conclusion that the substantial rights of the petitioners were not affected. The trial was long and the incidents relied on by petitioners few. We must guard against the magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 83, 62 S.Ct. 457, 471, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">As we have reviewed the record in its entirety, the two comments by the trial judge, made near the close of the three week trial, were neither inflammatory nor prejudicial and, when viewed in their context, did not rise to the level of reversible error. In a case such as this, \u201cweighing the overall effect of this [alleged] error balanced against the testimony relating to the defendants\u2019 guilt as a whole, we conclude that at its worst, the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Haley, </em>452 F.2d 391, 396 (8th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 977, 92 S.Ct. 1205, 31 L.Ed.2d 253 (1972). The function of a federal judge \u201cis not that of an umpire or of a moderator at a town meeting. He sits to see that justice is done in the cases heard before him; and it is his duty to see that a case on trial is presented in such a way as to be understood by the jury, as well as by himself.\u201d <em>United States v. Cole, </em>491 F.2d 1276, 1278 (4th Cir.1974). As the Supreme Court stated \u201c[w]e must guard against the magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting.\u201d <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 83, 62 S.Ct. at 471. We refuse to allow Schlacks to \u201cmagnify\u201d the trial court\u2019s remarks in his appeal to this court because, when viewed in the context within which they were made in light of the record as a whole, the judge\u2019s remarks were of an inconsequential nature, totally irrelevant to the eventual outcome of the case against Schlacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Both Briggs and Schlacks assert that the government presented insufficient evidence at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they participated in the conspiracy to commit arson and that they used interstate facilities in furtherance of the attempted arson. The law is clearly established that if a defendant attacks the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury verdict, \u201c[o]nly when the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, may an appellate court overturn the verdict.\u201d <em>Brandom v. United States, </em>431 F.2d 1391, 1400 (7th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 1022, 91 S.Ct. 586, 27 L.Ed.2d 2634 (1971). (\u201cWhen an attack is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>made on the sufficiency of the evidence, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government [and] the jury\u2019s verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence to support it.\u201d <em>United States v. Zarattini, </em>552 F.2d 753, 761 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 942, 97 S.Ct. 2661, 53 L.Ed.2d 262 (1977)). Furthermore, it is not the function of this court to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. <em>See generally United States v. Cavale, </em>688 F.2d 1098 (7th Cir.1982). A substantial amount of the prosecution\u2019s evidence implicating the defendants was revealed in the testimony of their co-conspirators, Welchman and MacKenzie. Initially, it should be noted that the defendants exhaustively examined both witnesses during cross-examination concerning the plea bargain arrangements between the witnesses and the government. Welchman testified that Schlacks agreed to participate in the arson scheme and offered to provide a \u201cteam of arsonists\u201d who were \u201ctailor made\u201d for the job. Welchman further related, and MacKenzie confirmed that Welchman traveled with Briggs and MacKenzie from Chicago, Illinois to Merrill, Wisconsin to plan the arson and inspect the physical layout prior to the contemplated \u201ctorching\u201d of the Anson &amp; Gilkey plant. MacKenzie also stated that he assisted Schlacks with the purchase of the flammable liquids for the arson and that Schlacks transported these liquids in the trunk of his car. MacKenzie further testified that at the direction of Briggs and Schlacks he again traveled from Chicago to Merrill, this time with two other men, to commit the arson. The government bolstered the identification evidence at trial with the testimony of Officer Files and Lance Longo and established that Briggs had in fact traveled between Merrill, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois with MacKenzie and Welchman a short time prior to the attempted arson. Finally, the government introduced telephone company records and the testimony of MacKenzie and Welchman showing that Briggs and Schlacks used the telephone both prior to and on the night of the attempted arson to further the arson scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Essentially, both defendants disputed their involvement in the attempted arson by attacking the credibility of Welchman and MacKenzie. It is the function of the jury to assess the trustworthiness of witnesses and weigh the evidence, <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>562 F.2d 411, 414 (7th Cir.1977), and the jury saw fit to believe the testimony of Welchman and MacKenzie and an appellate court \u201cshould not attempt to usurp the function of the jury.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baren, </em>305 F.2d 527, 532 (2d Cir. 1962). Our examination of the record reveals that there is more than sufficient credible evidence in the record for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Briggs and Schlacks (1) conspired with each other and with Welchman and MacKenzie to commit arson; (2) used an interstate facility (the telephone) to promote and further the conspiracy to commit the state crime of arson; and (3) caused others to travel interstate for the purpose of committing the arson itself. Furthermore, the testimony of Welchman and MacKenzie along with the corroborating testimony of Officer Files and Lance Longo clearly demonstrates that Briggs did in fact travel between Illinois and Wisconsin with the intent to violate state law. We refuse to disturb the jury\u2019s findings as there is more than sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt as to the respective defendants beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">4. <em>Multiple Charges and Consecutive Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">As noted at the outset, the defendant Briggs was convicted of three violations of the Travel Act and of conspiracy to violate the Travel Act while the defendant Schlacks was convicted of two violations of the Travel Act and also of one count of conspiracy to violate the Travel Act. Both Briggs and Schlacks were sentenced to serve consecutive prison terms for their convictions on the substantive counts of violating the Travel Act. The defendants assert that their actions in violating the Travel Act were for the purpose of committing one single, noncontinuing state crime (arson), and therefore it was improper for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>government to charge them with multiple violations of the Travel Act and furthermore that the trial court also erred when it imposed consecutive sentences. The defendants assert that Congress did not intend for individuals to be charged with multiple violations of the Travel Act where those violations occurred in the promotion of one single criminal act (arson).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201c(a) Whoever travels in interstate or \u2022 foreign commerce or uses any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, including the mail, with intent to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(2) commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">and thereafter performs or attempts to perform any of the acts specified ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">(b) As used in this section \u2018unlawful activity\u2019 means</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">* $ * # sfc #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">(2) extortion, bribery, or arson in violation of the laws of the State in which committed or of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">The gravamen of a charge under section 1952 \u201cis the use of an interstate facility [telephone], with the intent to promote or further an unlawful activity in violation of state law, and the performance of some act designed to promote or further that illegal purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Rizzo, </em>418 F.2d 71, 74 (7th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 967, 90 S.Ct. 1006, 25 L.Ed.2d 260 (1970). Moreover, case law is clear that a defendant violates the Travel Act if he either causes another to travel in interstate commerce or to use an interstate facility with the intent to commit a violation of state law. <em>See generally United States v. Zizzo, </em>338 F.2d 577 (7th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 915, 85 S.Ct. 1530, 14 L.Ed.2d 435 (1965). Indeed, in the federal prosecution for the violation of the Travel Act, the defendants were not charged with committing the state crime of arson but rather were charged with traveling interstate with the intent to commit the state crime of arson. Therefore the defendants violated the Travel Act by traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to commit arson regardless of whether or not they succeeded in actually committing the arson crime. <em>Rizzo, </em>418 F.2d at 74. <em>See also United States v. Karigiannis, </em>430 F.2d 148, 150 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 904, 91 S.Ct. 143, 27 L.Ed.2d 141 (1970). Thus, our reading of the statute and case law construing it reveals that a defendant may properly be charged and convicted of committing a substantive violation of the Travel Act in three separate and distinct ways: (1) by traveling interstate with the intent to violate state law; or (2) by using an interstate facility (i.e. telephone, mail) with the intent to violate state law, or (3) by causing another to use an interstate facility or travel interstate with an intent to violate state law, and a criminal defendant violates federal law when he performs any of the above with the intent to violate state law. The record demonstrates that both Briggs and Schlacks used an interstate facility (i.e. a telephone) to further the crime of arson and caused others to travel interstate with the intent to commit the arson. The record is replete with evidence that Briggs traveled interstate with the intent to further the plan to \u201ctorch\u201d the Anson and Gilkey plant, in violation of state law. Because the statute encompasses three separate and distinct types of criminal activity (traveling interstate, using an interstate facility and causing others to travel interstate with the intent to commit a crime), we hold it was proper to charge the defendants with all three Travel Act violations. As we have ruled it was proper to charge the defendants with multiple counts of violating the Travel Act and the testimony was more than sufficient for the jury to convict them of the same, likewise we hold it was also well within the discretion of the trial judge to sentence the defendants to consecutive terms of imprisonment for these separate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>In spite of the fact that the Travel Act expressly provides for a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment or $10,000 fine or both for each violation of the Travel Act the defendant Schlacks asserts that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment rather than granting him probation. The district judge imposed consecutive one year sentences for each violation of the Travel Act, resulting in a total sentence of three years imprisonment, within the five year maximum as defined by the statute. It is settled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\u201cThe general rule on review of sentences in the federal courts is: \u2018once it is determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end,\u2019 unless the sentencing judge relied on improper or unreliable information in exercising his or her discretion, or failed to exercise any discretion at all, in imposing sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>United States v. Main, </em>598 F.2d 1086, 1094 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 943, 100 S.Ct. 301, 62 L.Ed.2d 311 (1979); <em>see also United States v. Madison, </em>689 F.2d 1300 (7th Cir.1982) and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brubaker, </em>663 F.2d 764 (7th Cir.1981). Our review of the presentence hearing reveals that the district judge specifically considered the fact that Schlacks\u2019 \u201cinvolvement was the most minimal of any of the persons who have been convicted\u201d and further that the contemplated arson \u201cwas certainly a serious crime of great magnitude.\u201d Because the sentences imposed on Schlacks were within the five year statutory maximum, we hold there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in sentencing Schlacks to a term of imprisonment rather than placing him on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">5. <em>Newly Discovered Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Subsequent to the verdict and sentencing, Schlacks filed a motion for a new trial and/or a reduction of sentence based upon \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d The \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d consisted of the transcript of a tape recording of a conversation between the defendant Schlacks and one of the government\u2019s witnesses, Fred Welch-man. The defendant Schlacks asserts the transcript of this tape recording reveals that Welchman committed perjury during the trial of the defendant and therefore the defendant should be granted a new trial. He contends that during this conversation Welchman recanted the testimony he had given at trial and stated that he had given false testimony against him (Schlacks) in order to enhance his (Welchman\u2019s) position with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The district judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and/or resentencing in the following written order which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201cThe transcript [of the tape recording] is incomplete, and larded with apparent omissions, labeled \u2018(inaudible)\u2019 and misspellings. It does not conform in tenor to my own memory of the same tape which I listened to in connection with the sentencing of this defendant. Even read as is, the transcript does not support defendant\u2019s contention that it is an admission of perjury of Welchman\u2019s part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">I am not persuaded that the transcript of the tape recording requires a new trial or even an evidentiary hearing on the question of a new trial. Far stronger evidence of perjury than this transcript would be necessary to support such a ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">Defendant moves in the alternative for a reduction of sentence. Because I listened to the tape recording prior to sentence I knew of Welchman\u2019s statements to Schlacks and of Welchman\u2019s attempt to apologize for testifying against defendant and helping to convict him of participation in the arson conspiracy. I took into consideration the implication of that recorded conversation that defendant has a lesser amount of criminal involvement in the scheme than did some of the other conspirators. I took into consideration also defendant\u2019s relatively crime-free background and his close family ties. I believed then and I continue to believe that the sentence imposed was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>moderate response to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">It is well settled that a motion for a new trial and/or reduction of sentence is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and should be granted only with great caution. <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>296 F.2d 461, 465 (7th Cir.1961). The trial court\u2019s denial of motions for a new trial or resentencing will be overturned only upon a clear showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Reese, </em>561 F.2d 894 (D.C.Cir.1977). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in deciding that this \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d did not warrant a new trial, we reviewed the transcript of this conversation and the transcript reveals that the thrust of the conversation involved Schlacks requesting Welchman to convince a third party identified as \u201cJudy\u201d to write a letter to the trial judge seeking leniency for Schlacks. The transcript reveals that Welchman made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m gonna say, you gotta look deeper Judy, this guy he ain\u2019t as bad as McKenzie [sic] made him out to be or I made him out to be and I had to use that in my testimony and I did it but I didn\u2019t to [sic] it belligerently to hurt him that bad, believe me he ain\u2019t that bad of a guy, look in his record, he\u2019s not capable of putting all these big crimes together, he\u2019s not that kind of a man to do it, he\u2019s a religious man, he\u2019s a devoted homemaker,. [sic] Take a good strong look at him, please, for my benefit I have nothing to win and nothing to lose, I don\u2019t want something to be done to somebody that don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">These remarks in no way suggest that Welchman was admitting that he perjured himself at trial. Indeed, his comments do not conflict with his testimony at trial and merely reflect his attempt to show concern and compassion and his effort to assist Schlacks in enlisting the aid of another to petition the court for leniency on his (Schlacks) behalf. Our reading of the transcript of this conversation and the record fails to establish that Welchman perjured himself at trial and the transcript falls far short of conflicting with his previous testimony, arid thus we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant Schlacks\u2019 motion for a new trial and/or resentencing.
