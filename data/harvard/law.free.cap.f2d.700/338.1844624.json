Cissell appeals his jury conviction for violating the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and 1963. Appellant, while a special bailiff of the Jefferson County Circuit Court, allegedly accepted money from criminal defendants in exchange for promises to affect the outcomes of their cases. The government failed to show that appellant ever actually gave any money to any Kentucky judge or communicated an offer of money to a judge. The parties have stipulated, in fact, that if called as witnesses, the Jefferson Circuit judges would all testify that they had had no contact with the appellant and had received nothing of pecuniary value from Cissell.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">Appellant was convicted of one count of unlawfully participating in a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of the RICO statute, which defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d to include \u201cbribery ... which is chargeable under State law.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). The predicate offenses for Cissell\u2019s RICO conviction were three acts of bribery<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of Kentucky Revised Statute \u00a7 521.020. This state statute, enacted in 1974, provides as follows: 521.020 <em>Bribery of Public </em>Servant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-19\">(1) A person is guilty of bribery of a public servant when: (a) He offers, confers or agrees to confer any pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>benefit upon a public servant with the intent to influence the public servant\u2019s vote, opinion, judgment, exercise of discretion or other action in his official capacity as a public servant; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The statute in force prior to the enactment of KRS 521.020 provided explicitly that the government must prove as one element of bribery that the briber actually contacted the public servant with an offer of or gave pecuniary benefit to the public servant. The new statute does not refer to this element of the crime, and no Kentucky state court has interpreted this ambiguity in the statute. Therefore, this Court certified the following question to the Supreme Court of Kentucky pursuant to Kentucky Rule of Civil Procedure 76.37:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Whether KRS 521.020(a), the Bribery of a Public Servant statute, is violated by a person who is not himself a \u2018public servant,\u2019 when said person accepts money from another upon the promise to \u2018pay off\u2019 a judge or influence a judge's actions, where the person accepting the money, in fact, never has any contact with the judge, directly or indirectly, regarding such payment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The Supreme Court of Kentucky, 642 S.W.2d 901, responded to this question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">It is the opinion of this court that if the person accused of bribery has neither conferred any pecuniary benefit upon nor directed any communication to the public servant he has not violated KRS 521.-020(l)(a). Hence the answer to the question is \u2018no,\u2019 and the law is so certified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMz\">The opinion of the Kentucky Supreme Court on this question is attached as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Since the government has not shown that Cissell conferred any pecuniary benefit upon or directed any communication to a judge, the government has failed to prove that Cissell violated the Kentucky bribery statute. It follows that the appellant should not have been found guilty under the RICO statute \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and 1963. Appellant raises several other errors in his conviction but we find it unnecessary to review these issues in light of our finding discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">APPENDIX \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADs\">SUPREME COURT OP KENTUCKY</p>\n<p id=\"Ax6\">82-SC-759-CL</p>\n<p id=\"A35\">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA APPELLANT v.
