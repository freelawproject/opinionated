Since no senior judge is a member of the panel, none is eligible to participate in the en banc process. In any event, they would not have a vote in the en banc polling process. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-25\">Nine judges in regular active service have disqualified themselves in this case. There are sound reasons for this situation. Rulings of regulatory agencies often have a pronounced ripple effect. This causes 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(4) and Canon 3(C)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct for United States Judges to erect very broad barriers to a judge\u2019s participation in appeals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>This is intensified by the only opinion of the Advisory Committee on Codes of Conduct specifically relevant to appeals from this agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The inclusion of such appeals in the general mix of cases assigned to randomly selected panels of this court created an abnormal number of disqualifications and resulted in numerous docketing problems. In response, the court administratively created a special panel of judges whose property ownership would not regularly cause disqualification in Federal Power Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">This \u201cGas Panel\u201d solution worked acceptably until the number of judges who were not disqualified dwindled to three. At least one judge thinks the court\u2019s consensus interpretation for participation standards in this class of cases is uniquely too narrow.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even though it has recently risen to four, that number seems to me to constitute an entirely unacceptable judicial base to permit this court to continue to review significant challenges to the broad-ranging and financially impactive affairs involved in many of these appeals. Litigants are entitled to the full statutory right of review, including hearing or rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">I hasten to acknowledge that to date no litigant has ventured a challenge to this court\u2019s competence to handle these reviews. However, this is a situation I attribute to discretion rather than valor or any extraordinary confidence in those few who have recently manned the \u201cGas Panel\u201d of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">I feel compelled to write as I do, because the denial of rehearing could give an erroneous impression, appearing as it does to come from the measured consideration of thirteen judges when, in reality, it results from the fact that no \u201cGas Panel\u201d case can ever go en banc due to disqualifications. It is also written with the hope that emphasizing the situation may assist rectification by changing the views of presently disqualifying judges or the appointing authority, or, failing in that, through the Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory power.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-17\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.

A paragraph of Advisory Opinion 62 reads: A judge who was the beneficial owner of a fractional interest in land under mineral lease to two oil companies, raised the question as to his serving on a special panel that would have cases before it, the disposition of which could result in increasing prices of oil or gas. There is presently no production from the land in which the judge has an interest, but he does share in annual lease payments. Since the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect his beneficial interest in the leases, the Committee concluded he had a disqualifying financial interest in the subject matter in controversy (Doc. 180).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-15\">.
