We conclude that the information in question falls within FOIA\u2019s Exemption 3 and, accordingly, affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the State Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b787-19\">Raul Medina-Hincapie, a Colombian national, sought entry to the United States by applying for an immigrant visa in 1977. On 24 June 1977 State Department officials denied that application. Believing that the denial was based on erroneous information, Medina-Hincapie filed a FOIA request with the State Department seeking copies of \u201call notes, memoranda, correspondence, and other records relating in any way to Mr. Medina-Hincapie\u2019s visa application or its denial.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Department denied this request on 13 August 1979, concluding that since information contained in a visa application is protected from disclosure by section 222(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the requested documents were exempt from FOIA\u2019s disclosure provisions under FOIA\u2019s Exemption 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-20\">Medina-Hincapie administratively appealed the denial of his FOIA request and, when the Department failed to respond within the requisite time period, filed the present action seeking <em>de novo </em>review of the Department\u2019s refusal to disclose the requested information. Three months later, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the Department supplied Medina-Hincapie with a document index briefly describing the 28 documents coming within the scope of his FOIA request. At the same time, the Department returned some documents to Medina-Hincapie. These included documents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>applications, and letters filed by MedinaHincapie or his attorney and responses sent by the Department to Medina-Hincapie and his attorney. The Department returned these documents because it determined that since Medina-Hincapie had at one time or another possessed each of these documents (either directly or constructively through his attorney) they were not covered by the confidentiality limitation of section 222(f) and therefore were not protected under Exemption 3. However, the Department continued to withhold the majority of the documents, relying on Exemption 3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On 31 December 1981 the district court, without opinion, entered judgment for the Department. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">II. Applicability of Exemption 3</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">As this court has previously noted, \u201cFOIA combines a strong disclosure mandate with nine rather specific exemptions.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, as the Supreme Court has observed, \u201cunless the requested material falls within one of these nine statutory exemptions, FOIA requires that records and material in the possession of federal agencies be made available on demand to any member of the general public.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State Department determined that the material requested by Medina-Hincapie was exempted from FOIA\u2019s disclosure provisions by Exemption 3. The correctness of that determination is the only issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Exemption 3 removes from the disclosure mandate of FOIA matters \u201cspecifically exempted'from disclosure by statute ..., provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, in order to determine the propriety of the Department\u2019s denial of Medina-Hincapie\u2019s request we must engage in a two-step analysis. First, we must decide whether section 222(f) qualifies as a withholding statute under Exemption 3. Second, we must determine whether the material requested by Medina-Hincapie is \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure\u201d by section 222(f). Applying this two-step analysis, we conclude that the Department\u2019s denial of Medina-Hincapie\u2019s FOIA request was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">A. <em>Section 222(f) as an Exemption 3 Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">Section 222(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-13\">The records of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be considered confidential and shall be used only for the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States, except that in the discretion of the Secretary of State certified copies of such records may be made available to a court which certifies that the information contained in such records is needed by the court in the interest of the ends of justice in a case pending before the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">In order to qualify as a withholding statute under Exemption 3, a statute must either<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> require that matters be withheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>from the public in such a manner \u201cas to leave no discretion on the issue,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or establish \u201cparticular criteria for withholding or refer[ ] to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Every court which has considered the issue has concluded that section 222(f) qualifies as an Exemption 3 statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only disagreement has been whether the statute qualifies under subsection (A) or (B).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that it qualifies under both.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Subsection (A) \u201cembraces only those statutes incorporating a congressional mandate of confidentiality that, however general, is \u2018absolute and without exception.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is clear that section 222(f), by its terms, incorporates a congressional mandate of confidentiality.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, Medina-Hincapie argues that section 222(f) cannot qualify under Exemption 3(A) because it expressly authorizes the Secretary to use his discretion in limited circumstances, authorizing him to provide certified copies of the material to \u201ca court which certifies that the information ... is needed ... in the interest of the ends of justice in a case pending before the court.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since the confidentiality mandate in section 222(f) is not absolute, Medina-Hincapie contends, that statute does not meet the requirements of subsection (A). This argument falls short, however, when both Exemption 3(A) and section 222(f) are carefully examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Although Exemption 3(A) applies only to statutes which \u201cleave no discretion\u201d to the administrative agency, that limitation applies only to the decision whether matters should be withheld <em>\u201cfrom the public.\u201d </em><footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under section 222(f) the Secretary of State has no authority to disclose material to the public. In that sense the confidentiality mandate is absolute; <em>all </em>matters covered by the statute \u201cshall be considered confidential.\u201d The Secretary has the discretion to disclose section 222(f) material to a court which certifies that the information is needed in the interest of justice in a pending case, but that authority does <em>not </em>relieve the Secretary of the mandate to treat the matter as confidential. The statute thus permits the Secretary to do only that which any agency subject to a confidentiality requirement would be required to do if it received a court order or subpoena to produce specified documents. Therefore, since the discretion granted the Secretary under section 222(f) does not relieve him of his absolute duty to keep the matters confidential,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we hold that the statute qualifies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>as a withholding statute under Exemption 3(A).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Section 222(f) also qualifies under Exemption 3(B).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A statute qualifies under this portion of Exemption 3 if it \u201cestablishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On its face, section 222(f) meets the latter of these two requirements. It requires the Secretary to withhold \u201crecords of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States <em>pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As the Third Circuit held in a case presenting this identical issue, \u201c[t]his category of information is sufficiently delimited to fit within the statutory [Exemption 3(B) ] <em>language.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Our conclusion that section 222(f) qualifies under Exemption 3(B) is also consistent with the policy behind the exemption. The limitations contained in subsections (A) and (B) of Exemption 3 were added to FOIA in 1976 in an effort to overrule legislatively the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Administrator, FAA v. Robertson.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Robertson </em>the Supreme Court held that the pre-1976 version of Exemption 3 covered a statute which vested the administrative agency with broad discretion to determine whether information should be disclosed. By including the proviso comprising subsections (A) and (B) in the present version of the statute, Congress sought to \u201cassure that basic policy decisions on governmental secrecy be made by the Legislative rather than the Executive branch.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Section 222(f) limits the Secretary\u2019s withholding authority to a definite class of documents \u2014 those pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas and permits. As the Third Circuit observed, \u201c[t]he potential for widespread administrative discretion over the withholding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>vast category of documents is simply lacking in \u00a7 222(f).\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Our conclusion is further bolstered by analogous precedent from this circuit. In <em>Irons &amp; Sears v. </em>Dann<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> this court held that section 122 of the Patent Act qualified as a withholding statute under Exemption 3(B). That statute is similar to section 222(f) in its relevant portion, which provides: \u201cApplications for patents shall be kept in confidence ... and no information concerning the same [shall be] given without authority of the applicant ....\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> After noting that the statute failed to meet the requirements of subsection (A) because it authorized the agency to disclose the information to the public \u201cin such special circumstances as may be determined by the Commissioner,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the court observed that \u201cSection 122 does satisfy the second prong [of Exemption 3(B)] because it \u2018refers to particular types of matters to be withheld\u2019 \u2014 namely, patent applications and information concerning them.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A reference to \u201cpatent applications and information concerning them\u201d is not any more particularized than one to visa applications and information concerning them \u2014 the scope of matters to be withheld under section 222(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Despite the force of the analysis outlined above, Medina-Hincapie argues that we should hold that section 222(f) does not qualify under Exemption 3 because the legislative history of Exemption 3 indicates an intent to exclude section 222(f) from its coverage. We find this argument unpersuasive. The legislative history of Exemption 3 is, at best, inconclusive with respect to the argument advanced by Medina-Hincapie. Indeed, the one circuit court that has considered that history in great detail<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> arrived at the opposite conclusion, finding that the legislative history indicated that \u201cCongress intended \u00a7 222(f) <em>to qualify </em>as an exempting statute under exemption 3(B).\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> While we are not as confident that the legislative history of Exemption 3 expressly evidences an intent to bring section 222(f) within the coverage of the exemption,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> we find nothing in it which weakens our conclusion that the statute is covered by the terms and policy of that exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">Having determined that section 222(f) qualifies as a withholding statute under Exemption 3, we turn to the second inquiry \u2014 whether the material requested by Medina-Hincapie is covered by section 222(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">B. <em>The Scope of Section 222(f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">The applicability of section 222(f) to the matters included in Medina-Hincapie\u2019s FOIA request is clear. Indeed, the request by its terms seems to be limited to matters covered by the statute.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>dina-Hincapie argues that the requested information is not specifically exempted from disclosure by section 222(f) because the statute merely requires that the information be considered confidential, it does not prevent disclosure to the applicant, who is already aware of the information. Therefore, Medina-Hincapie concludes, the information he requests is not covered by section 222(f) and Exemption 3 does not apply. We once again find appellant\u2019s argument less than persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Medina-Hincapie\u2019s reading of the statute is unduly restrictive. The scope of section 222(f) is not limited to information supplied by the visa applicant, it includes information revealing the thought-processes of those who rule on the application.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, while the statute may reflect a desire to protect the privacy of the applicant, as Medina-Hincapie suggests, it also evidences an intent to maintain the confidentiality of the decision-making process. It would be unreasonable to read the statute in such a way that would expose the inner workings of the State Department to a visa applicant merely because he was the subject of the decision. Accordingly, we hold that section 222(f) prevents visa applicants from obtaining more material than Medina-Hincapie has received in this case<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and that the Department was justified in denying the remainder of his request under Exemption 3 of FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Section 222(f) expresses Congress\u2019 belief that information pertaining to visa issuances and denials should be kept from the public. Exemption 3 of FOIA precludes a visa applicant from circumventing that congressional directive by the use of a FOIA request. The district court therefore correctly granted judgment in favor of the</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">State Department, and that judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"A5v\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-15\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-16\">.

A statute which allows disclosure to courts under other conditions or to other \u201cnon-public\u201d parties may or may not be covered by Exemption 3(A), depending on the exact nature of the statute. Nor do we find, as the Department suggests, that this case is controlled by <em>Fund for Constitutional Government v. National Archives and Records Service, </em>656 F.2d 856 (D.C.Cir.1981). In <em>Fund for Constitutional Government </em>this court held that Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was an Exemption 3(A) statute even though it permitted disclosure to government personnel and to a court under certain circumstances. The appellant in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>case conceded that the rule satisfied the criteria of Exemption 3 and the court merely noted its agreement with that conclusion. <em>Id </em>at 867-68.

Medina-Hincapie argues that the Department\u2019s actions in returning to him some of the documents in his visa application file \u201cillustrate! ] that the Department exercises unfettered discretion to withhold documents under section 222(f).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17. However, the Department\u2019s decision to return to Medina-Hincapie materials which had at one time or another been in his possession was based on its belief that the materials were not covered <em>at all </em>by section 222(f), not on a belief that although within the scope of the statute, the materials were nevertheless disclosable. The Department therefore returned the materials on the basis of its application of the <em>second </em>step of the Exemption 3 analysis \u2014 determining whether the materials are covered by the statute. These actions do not affect our decision with respect to the first step \u2014 determining whether the statute qualifies as a withholding statute. <em>See supra, text </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Medina-Hincapie also alleges that Department officials in Bogota showed his attorneys copies of some of the materials the Department now seeks to withhold. He argues that this exercise of \u201cunconstrained discretion\u201d to disclose documents at one time and withhold them later \u201cbelies the proposition that section 222(f) is an exemption 3 statute.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18. The Department, without admitting that the materials were disclosed to Medina-Hincapie\u2019s attorneys, states that if such occurred, \u201cthe disclosure was clearly unauthorized and in violation of Section 222(f).\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 28. An <em>unauthorized </em>disclosure of documents does not change the nature of the statute, nor does it constitute a waiver of the applicable FOIA exemption. <em>See Safeway Stores, Inc. v.

The House Judiciary Committee report on the original version of the bill expressly noted that \u00a7 222 came within that version of Exemption 3(B). H.R.Rep. No. 94-880, Part II, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 14-15 n. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 2224-25. However, that version was subsequently amended. Since the exact reason for the amendment is not entirely clear, we hesitate to rely on the statement as support for our decision. At the same time, however, there is no indication that the change was intended to eliminate statutes such as \u00a7 222(f). Indeed, the other statute referred to in the note in the House Judiciary Committee report (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(d)(3)) has repeatedly been held to be a withholding statute under Exemption 3, notwithstanding the subsequent amendment. <em>E.g., Halperin v.
