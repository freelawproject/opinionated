Litigation in this voting rights case has spanned over a decade, requiring two trips to the United States Supreme Court. The merits of this case having been finally resolved in <em>Graves v. Barnes, </em>446 F.Supp. 560 (W.D.Tex.1977), <em>affirmed, </em>435 U.S. 901, 98 S.Ct. 1444, 55 L.Ed.2d 492 (1978) <em>(Graves IV), </em>only the subsidiary issues of the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs are now before us on appeal. The district court directed defendant State of Texas to pay attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the plaintiffs in the following amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Costs and</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Attorney\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">$365,645.20</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">$166,125.00</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">$416,933.00</p>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b297-18\">$ 7,825.29 $ 10,000.00 $ 12,854.54</p>\n<p id=\"b297-19\">Name</p>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">Mexican-American Legal Defense Education Fund (MALDEF) and George Korbel</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">David Richards Don Gladden (including fees for paralegal time)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">Finally, by order dated May 18, 1982, the court ordered the State to pay Tony Korioth and John Collins jointly the sum of $3,600 in attorney\u2019s fees. For the reasons stated below, we modify the judgment, and affirm as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-23\">II. <em>Discussion:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">Before proceeding to analyze the propriety of the fee award, however, we must first dispose of a threshold issue raised by the State. Relying on <em>Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumer\u2019s Union, </em>446 U.S. 719,100 S.Ct. 1967, 64 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980), the State argues that since the defendants in this case, who were enforcement officials, merely followed the mandate laid down by the Texas legislature, they are entitled to absolute legislative immunity from suit. This argument misconstrues <em>Consumer\u2019s Union, </em>in which the Court stated that \u201c[f]ee awards against enforcement officials are run-of-the-mill occurrences, even though, on occasion, had a state legislature acted or reacted in a different or more timely manner, there would have been no need for a lawsuit or for an injunction.\u201d 446 U.S. at 739, 100 S.Ct. at 1978. <em>See also Fernandez v. Limmer, </em>663 F.2d 619, 637 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. </em>dismissed,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 5, 73 L.Ed.2d 1395 (1982). Moreover, this Court has recently awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing plaintiffs in a voting rights case. <em>See Flowers v. Wiley, </em>675 F.2d 704 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-29\">The State next contends that the district court abused its discretion by awarding excessive attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs. The standard in this circuit governing the computation of attorney\u2019s fees is set out in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974) and its progeny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-30\">In awarding attorney\u2019s fees, the district court is empowered to exercise its informed discretion, and a reviewing court will not disturb the judgment of the district court absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Lindy Bros. Builders v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161, 166 (3d Cir.1973), <em>affirmed, </em>540 F.2d 102 (3d Cir.1976) (en banc). In arriving at an appropriate amount, the district court is required to \u201cexplain the findings and reasons upon which the award is based, including an indication of how each of the twelve factors in <em>Johnson </em>affected [its] decision.\u201d <em>Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>624 F.2d 575, 581 (5th Cir.1980) <em>(Copper Liquor II). </em>Finally, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>court\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re First Colonial Corp. of America, </em>544 F.2d 1291, 1298 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 1696, 52 L.Ed.2d 388 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The Fifth Circuit recently adopted the \u201clodestar\u201d method of calculating attorney\u2019s fees relied upon by the Second,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Third,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and District of Columbia<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Circuits. <em>See Copper Liquor II, </em>624 F.2d at 583 n. 15; <em>Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>684 F.2d 1087, 1092-93 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.1982) <em>(Copper Liquor III). </em>Under this refinement of the <em>Johnson </em>test, \u201c[t]he \u2018lodestar\u2019 is equal to the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the prevailing hourly rate in the community for similar work. The lodestar is then adjusted to reflect other factors such as the contingent nature of suit and the quality of the representation.\u201d <em>Copper Liquor III, </em>684 F.2d at 1093 (citing <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 891-94).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In fixing the amount of the fee award, the district court relied on prevailing hourly rates, rather than on historical rates. Stated differently, the district court applied the rates prevailing at the time the fee application was filed, rather than those rates prevailing at the time the services were actually rendered. The court then multiplied these rates by a factor of two so that they might reflect the contingent nature of the case. The court explained its use of the contingency multiplier in the following manner: \u201cIn recognition of the often uncertain prospects of success on the merits and the protracted nature of this litigation, which served to exacerbate the tenuous nature of ultimate recovery, the fee award for work on the merits of these actions will be multiplied by a factor of two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In setting out principles that can be used by district courts in assessing the contingency multiplier, we adopt the analysis set out by the Third Circuit in <em>Lindy II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">Under the rubric of \u201cthe contingent nature of success\u201d the district court should appraise the professional burden undertaken \u2014 that is, the probability or likelihood of success, viewed at the time of filing suit. The court may increase the amount established in the computation of the \u201clodestar\u201d as a reasonable fee on the basis of a careful evaluation of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">1. Analysis of plaintiff\u2019s burden. Subsumed in this category are the following considerations: (a) the complexity of the case, \u2014 legally and factually; (b) the probability of defendant\u2019s liability,\u2014 whether it is clear or dubious; whether it has been previously suggested by other civil or criminal proceedings; whether it is asserted under existing case law or statutory interpretation, or is advanced as a novel theory; (c) an evaluation of damages, \u2014 whether the claims would be difficult or easy to prove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">2. Risks assumed in developing the case. This category subsumes consideration of: (a) the number of hours of labor risked without guarantee of remuneration; (b) the amount of out-of-pocket expenses advanced for processing motions, taking depositions, etc.; (c) the development of prior expertise in the particular type of litigation; recognizing that counsel sometimes develop, without compensation, special legal skills which may assist the court in efficient conduct of the litigation, or which may aid the court in articulating legal precepts and implementing sound public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">3. The delay in receipt of payment for services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\">If, having considered the foregoing or other relevant criteria, the district court desires to increase the \u201clodestar\u201d award, it should identify those factors supporting its conclusion, state the specific amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>by which the basic fee should be increased due to the contingency of success, and give a brief statement of reasons therefor. We reiterate that any such increment in the \u201clodestar\u201d award is to be considered and applied apart from the evaluation of the quality of services rendered in the particular proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afe\"><em>Lindy II, </em>540 F.2d at 117. The concept of compensation for delay in receipt of payment is founded on the principle that \u201c[p]ayment today for services rendered long in the past deprives the eventual recipient of the value of the use of the money in the meantime, which use, particularly in an inflationary era, is valuable.\u201d <em>Copeland v. Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880, 893 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The lodestar may also be adjusted through the use of a multiplier to reflect the quality of representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">Under the rubric of \u201cthe quality of an attorney\u2019s work,\u201d the court should appraise the manner in which counsel discharged his or her professional responsibilities. The district court may use this factor to increase or decrease the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">As a first principle, the court must recognize that a consideration of \u201cquality\u201d inheres in the \u201clodestar\u201d award: counsel who possess or who are reputed to possess more experience, knowledge and legal talent generally command hourly rates superior to those who are less endowed. Thus, the quality of an attorney\u2019s work <em>in general </em>is a component of the reasonably hourly rate; this aspect of \u201cquality\u201d is reflected in the \u201clodestar\u201d and should not be utilized to augment or diminish the basic award under the rubric of \u201cthe, quality of an attorney\u2019s work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\"><em>Lindy I, </em>then, permits an adjustment to the \u201clodestar\u201d \u2014 up or down \u2014 based on the all-round performance of counsel in the specific case: \u201cAny increase or decrease in fees to adjust for the quality of work is designed to take account of an unusual degree of skill, be it unusually poor or unusually good.\u201d 487 F.2d at 168. By this is meant simply that the district court may determine that the lawyer discharged the professional burden undertaken with a degree of skill above or below that expected for lawyers of the caliber reflected in the hourly rates. As previously rehearsed, we do not intend that this evaluation entail a detailed analysis of the lawyer\u2019s performance in each category of services rendered. Rather, the increase or decrease reflects exceptional services only; it may be considered in the nature of a bonus or penalty. The heavy burden of proving entitlement to such an adjustment is on the moving party-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">In determining whether to adjust the \u201clodestar\u201d for quality work or not, the district court may consider, <em>inter alia:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">1. The result obtained by verdict or settlement, evaluated in terms of (a) the potential money damages available to the class member, <em>i.e., </em>a comparison of the extent of possible recovery with the amount of actual verdict or settlement; (b) the benefit \u2014 monetary or non-monetary \u2014 conferred on the class, <em>i.e., </em>permitting the court \u201cto recognize and reward achievements of a particularly resourceful attorney who secures a substantial benefit for his clients with a minimum of time invested .... \u201d <em>[Merola v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,] Merola II, supra, </em>515 F.2d [165] at 168 [(3d Cir.1975)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">2. An evaluation of the professional methods utilized in processing the case,\u2014 rewarding the use of efficient methods to expedite the case and penalizing the use of methods the predominant purpose of which was to delay or obstruct the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">If, on the basis of the quality of services rendered, the court is persuaded that an increase or decrease in the \u201clodestar\u201d is warranted, it should identify those factors supporting its conclusions, state the specific amount by which the basic fee should be altered due to the quality of work, and give a brief statement of reasons therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-14\"><em>Lindy II, </em>540 F.2d at 117-18 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>We note that under the \u201cquality of representation\u201d rubric, consideration of the results of the litigation enters for the first time into the calculation of the fee award.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Where exceptional results are obtained \u2014 taking into account the hourly rate commanded and number of hours expended \u2014 an increase in fee is justifiable. However, it is important again to emphasize that a huge dollar recovery does not itself justify a huge fee award. The \u201clodestar\u201d itself generally compensates lawyers adequately for their time. An upward adjustment for quality is appropriate only when the attorney performed exceptionally well, or obtained an exceptional result for the client. For example, if a substantial monetary judgment was to be <em>expected, </em>that expectation normally is reflected in the hourly rate used to compute the \u201clodestar,\u201d and no further adjustment would be necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 894 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We wish to emphasize that a district court should not award a contingency multiplier in every case. Under appropriate circumstances, attorneys may be adequately compensated through the reasonable calculation of the lodestar.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Finally, we note that a court need not in determining the multiplier consider some factor already included in the calculation of the lodestar. Thus, where \u201cthe lodestar itself is based on <em>present </em>hourly rates, rather than on the lesser rates applicable to the time period in which the services were rendered, the harm resulting from delay in payment may be reduced or largely eliminated.\u201d <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 893 n. 23 (emphasis in original). <em>See also Copper Liquor III, </em>684 F.2d at 1096 n. 26; E. Larson, Federal Court Awards of Attorney\u2019s Fees 206-09 (1981), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by both awarding fees based on present hourly rates and using a contingency multiplier. Analysis of the district court\u2019s stated reasons for applying the multiplier reveals that \u201cdelay in payment\u201d did not figure in its calculus. The court based its award on the uncertain prospects of success on the merits, and relied upon the \u201cprotracted nature of this litigation\u201d only to the extent that this \u201cexacerbate[d] the tenuous nature of ultimate recovery.\u201d The court also adequately compensated plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for the delay in payment by its use of present hourly rates in determining the amount of the lodestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">We have reviewed the other arguments advanced by the State attacking the amount of the fee award. Having carefully examined the record, we conclude that the district court was not clearly erroneous in its findings of fact, and that its assessment of the total award due did not constitute an abuse of discretion. We note, however, that the court did make a minor error in its calculations. The district court specifically stated in its memorandum that the award for travel time was not subject to the contingency multiplier. However, in its calculation of fee awards in Table 2, the court mistakenly multiplied the amount for travel time by a factor of two. Accordingly, we modify the judgment of the district court to correct for this error as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">MALDEF and George Korbel $363,900.20</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Don Gladden $416,368.00</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">As modified, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Finally, we note that MALDEF requested this court to award it attorney\u2019s fees for their work bn this appeal. Since they have not submitted any affidavits in support of their claim, we REMAND this issue to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-25\">.
