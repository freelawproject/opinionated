The action was based upon an alleged property interest in the vessel pursuant to a divorce decree entered by the High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-25\">At the time of the decree the parties were residents of the Trust Territory of the Northern Mariana Islands. The High Court entered its decree before the date on which its jurisdiction was transferred to the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>of the newly constituted Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. (The transfer of jurisdiction from the courts of the Trust Territory to the courts of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was accomplished under the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands, Schedule on Transitional Matters, Section 4, and 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1694.) After the effective date of the transfer of jurisdiction, however, the plaintiff below moved the High Court to amend or modify the decree to clarify the nature of her property interest in the sailboat. The High Court declined to modify or amend the decree, but did issue an order of clarification. The clarification was substantially adverse to the position the plaintiff presented in the district court, and in the proceeding below she sought to avoid its consequences. The district court, however, relied upon the clarification to grant summary judgment based upon collateral estoppel. We think such reliance was correct, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Having properly assumed jurisdiction over the original cause of action for divorce, the High Court retained jurisdiction for purposes of amending or clarifying its prior order, even though original jurisdiction over such actions had been transferred to the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. The district court properly relied upon the High Court\u2019s clarification in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim, particularly where the clarification was made at her instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
