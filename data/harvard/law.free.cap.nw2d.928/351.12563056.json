Appellants challenge the district court's application of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03 and the public-trust doctrine to respondents' claims, and argue that the district court was without jurisdiction to make orders concerning the DNR's issuance of well permits. They also challenge the district court's findings of fact and the scope of its remedial order as unsupported by the record. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   White Bear Lake (the lake) is a large lake lying within Ramsey and Washington Counties. It has a surface area of between 2,100 and 3,100 acres, depending on its water level. It is a closed-basin lake, meaning that it has no major natural surface water inlets or outlets, such as rivers or streams. The lake depends on groundwater and precipitation for water. Because of this, and its relatively small watershed area, significant water-level fluctuations occur. Since 1924, water levels in the lake have ranged from 919.33 to 926.69 feet above sea level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Closed-basin lakes depend primarily on underlying groundwater levels for lake water. Two bedrock aquifers, commonly referenced together as the Prairie du Chien-Jordan aquifer (the aquifer), are located below the lake. The lake and the aquifer\n   are hydrologically\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   connected, and the lake's water levels are affected by groundwater pumping, among other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The aquifer is a main source of drinking water for the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. While the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are able to use surface water from the Mississippi River for their domestic water supply, most of the rest of the metropolitan area relies on groundwater pumped from municipal and private wells. Multiple high-capacity groundwater wells surround White Bear Lake, providing domestic water supply to area communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cities and municipalities must first obtain a water-use permit from the DNR before extracting groundwater for municipal use. The DNR has authorized the pumping of groundwater from the aquifer through groundwater-appropriation permits. The DNR is responsible for issuing and amending groundwater-appropriation permits, ensuring that permittees comply with those permits, and taking action as needed when groundwater permits negatively impact a natural resource.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondent White Bear Lake Restoration Association (the restoration association) initiated this action in April 2013, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief related to groundwater-appropriation permits issued by the DNR. The only defendants named in the summons and complaint were the DNR and then-Commissioner Thomas J. Landwehr. The complaint alleged that increased groundwater withdrawals under the DNR's groundwater-appropriation permits from high-capacity wells in the area of the lake had created and accelerated declines in lake-water elevations due to the DNR's failure to review and amend permits. The restoration association alleged that the DNR had allowed the lake's water levels to drop, and had violated MERA, Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 116B.01 -.13 (2018). The restoration association alleged that the resulting low water levels had diminished the lake's value as a recreational, historical, cultural, and aesthetic asset. The restoration association further claimed that, due to the lake's low water levels, noxious plant and animal species had increased, businesses had experienced significant losses, a beach had closed due to a dangerous drop-off created by the lower lake level, and homeowners needed to extend docks hundreds of feet to access the lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondent White Bear Lake Homeowners' Association (the homeowners' association) intervened as a plaintiff, alleging that the DNR had violated MERA and the common-law public-trust doctrine. Its complaint alleged that the increased groundwater appropriations authorized by the DNR have materially and adversely affected the environment and that White Bear\n   Lake and the aquifer have been materially and adversely impacted. Like the restoration association, the homeowners' association claimed that the declining water levels harmed native aquatic plants, exposed lakebeds, reduced recreational boating activity, impaired swimming and fishing, reduced access to the water for lakefront homeowners, and negatively impacted the economy around the lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their pleadings, respondents suggested that a potential solution to increase the water level of White Bear Lake would be to order the DNR to amend groundwater-appropriation permits it had issued to municipalities. That remedy would impact groundwater-appropriation permits held by cities and municipalities who rely on the permits to supply water to their residents. Appellants City of White Bear Lake and Town of White Bear intervened as defendants. The DNR challenged respondents' claims, arguing, among other things, that those claims are not properly asserted under either Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03 or the common-law public-trust doctrine. The DNR asserted that, instead, the available MERA relief was under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court denied appellants' pretrial motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, allowing respondents' claims to proceed under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03 and the public-trust doctrine. It rejected appellants' argument that the only viable MERA claim in this circumstance would be under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, providing that persons may initiate a civil action in district court for declaratory or equitable relief \"against the state or any agency or instrumentality thereof where the nature of the action is a challenge to ... [a] permit promulgated or issued by the state or any agency or instrumentality thereof for which the applicable statutory appeal period has elapsed.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From December 2014 to August 2016, the parties agreed to stay the district-court case while they jointly supported a request to the legislature to fund construction of systems to convert the domestic water supply in certain communities in the northeast metropolitan area from groundwater to surface-water sources. The district court lifted the stay after the legislature declined to fund the surface-water conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The case was tried to the district court. Multiple experts testified for the associations and opined that the DNR's groundwater-appropriation permits negatively impacted the lake's water levels. Contrary evidence was produced by appellants. The district court ultimately concluded that the DNR did not properly manage its permitting process in light of its knowledge that groundwater pumping affected the lake's water levels. The district court determined that the DNR knew, as early as 1998, that the groundwater-appropriation permits it issued could have significant effects on groundwater levels and ultimately on the water levels of the lake. The district court found that the DNR had failed to consider \"regional or cumulative impact\" when reviewing permit requests and instead issued and reviewed permits on a case-by-case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court concluded that respondents had properly asserted their claims under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03, that the lake and the aquifer are natural resources subject to MERA protections, and that the lake and the aquifer have been and will likely continue to be impaired by the DNR's permitting conduct. The district court declared that the DNR, through its actions and inaction in relation to groundwater-appropriation permits in the vicinity of the lake, had violated MERA, multiple\n   provisions of the state's water law, and the common-law public-trust doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court ordered injunctive relief that included requiring the DNR to review and amend all groundwater-appropriation permits within a five-mile radius of the lake, require permittees to submit contingency plans for conversion to surface-water supply, and impose a residential irrigation ban when the water level of the lake is below 923.5 feet (and continuing until the lake reaches 924 feet). The district court's order prohibited the DNR from issuing any new groundwater-well permits and from increasing appropriation amounts in existing groundwater-appropriation permits within a five-mile radius of the lake until it had fully complied with statutory requirements. The order also enjoined the DNR from issuing any groundwater-appropriation permits within that radius unless and until it had sufficient data to understand the impact of those appropriations on the lake and the aquifer. These injunctions affect the groundwater permits not only of the intervenors, but also of municipalities that are not parties to this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the district court's order and judgment, the DNR moved for an amended judgment, a new trial, and a stay of the district court's order pending appeal. The district court rejected the stay motion. Appellants appealed and sought review of the stay order by this court. We remanded, and the district court stayed parts of its order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The DNR is the state agency responsible for preserving and protecting Minnesota's water resources. Its duties include managing groundwater appropriation, issuing high-capacity well permits, and monitoring and controlling high-capacity groundwater pumping within the state. The DNR has authorized groundwater pumping from a number of high-capacity groundwater wells.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Appellants City of White Bear Lake and Town of White Bear are intervenors that hold groundwater-appropriation permits impacted by the ordered relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    White Bear Lake Restoration Association is a registered Minnesota nonprofit corporation dedicated to the restoration and preservation of White Bear Lake.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    White Bear Lake Homeowners' Association is an association of homeowners living on White Bear Lake dedicated to helping restore the lake.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    \"Hydrology\" is \"[t]he scientific study of the properties, distribution, and effects of water on the earth's surface, in the soil and underlying rocks, and in the atmosphere.\"\n    <em>\n     American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    862 (5th ed. 2011). \"Hydraulic\" means \"[o]f, involving, moved by, or operated by a fluid, especially water, under pressure.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 861.

Stat. \u00a7 116B.03, subd. 1. MERA broadly defines \"person\" as \"any natural person, any state, municipality or other governmental or political subdivision or other public agency or instrumentality ... or other organization ... and any other entity, except a family farm, a family farm corporation or a bona fide farmer corporation.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.02, subd. 2. Both respondents and appellants concede-and we agree-that the associations and the DNR are \"persons\" as defined by the statute. Likewise, the municipalities withdrawing groundwater are \"persons\" under MERA because they are governmental or political subdivisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    To maintain an action in district court under section 116B.03, a plaintiff must make \"a prima facie showing that the conduct of the defendant has, or is likely to cause the pollution, impairment, or destruction of the air, water, land or other natural resources located within the state.\" Minn.

The scope of the private right of action under section 116B.03, however, is limited: \"[N]o action shall be allowable under this section for conduct taken by a person pursuant to any environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement\n    or permit issued by the Pollution Control Agency, Department of Natural Resources, Department of Health or Department of Agriculture.\" Minn.

At issue, then, is whether the relief available under section 116B.10 is exclusive.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    We agree with appellants that, under the statute's plain language, section 116B.10 is the exclusive remedy available under MERA when the challenged action is that of a state agency in issuing a permit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    In situations where, as here, a permit issued by an agency pursuant to its duties under a regulatory scheme requires the application of rules or statutes to data within the realm of agency expertise, courts are generally deferential to agency determinations.\n    <em>\n     Minn.

Appellants' proposed construction of section 116B.10 as the exclusive remedy under MERA in this circumstance is consistent with this standard of review. Under section 116B.10, as more fully discussed below, the remedy upon a showing that an agency-issued permit is inadequate to protect natural resources is that the district court remits the parties to the agency that issued the permit for \"appropriate administrative proceedings,\" subject to further court review. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Moreover, and as appellants point out, to conclude that a section 116B.03 action is available to challenge an agency-issued permit would render section 116B.10\"both meaningless and superfluous.\" Again, we agree. Interpreting MERA to allow a section 116B.03 action to challenge whether an agency-issued permit adequately protects the state's natural resources puts the district court in the position of substituting its own judgment for that of the agency to which courts ordinarily defer. Moreover, there would seem to be nothing left of section 116B.10 if a district court may exercise jurisdiction over permit-issuing agencies under section 116B.03 to order relief within the scope of the legislature's\n    grant of authority to the agency.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    We also observe that section 116B.03, subd. 1, contains a provision that applies here: \"[N]o action shall be allowable under this section for conduct taken by a person pursuant to any ... permit issued by ... the Department of Natural Resources.\" Minn.

And another provision of MERA, Minn.

The complained-of conduct that impairs the lake is the withdrawal of groundwater in conformity with or under the authority of the DNR's permits.

The unambiguous language in section 116B.03 aligns with the evident legislative intent underlying section 116B.10, which applies when a MERA claim is a challenge to a permit issued by the state or any agency. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 1. Section 116B.10 authorizes a civil action in district court for declaratory or equitable relief where \"the nature of the action is a challenge to an environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement, or permit promulgated or issued by the state or any agency or instrumentality thereof for which the applicable statutory appeal period has elapsed.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243447\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/616/273/#p277\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Here, the nature of respondents' challenge is to permits \"promulgated or issued\" by the DNR. Despite the appeal period for the permits having elapsed, section 116B.10 provides for a process to remit the parties to the permit-issuing agency for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 2, pertaining to a \"civil action ... against the state,\" a plaintiff has \"the burden of proving the existence of material evidence showing said inadequacy of said environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement, or permit.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 2. But, unlike in section 116B.03, under section 116B.10, once a MERA plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of the inadequacy of a permit in protecting the environment, the district court remits to \"the state agency or instrumentality that promulgated the environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement, or permit which is the subject of the action.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 3.

Stat. \u00a7 116B.10 that confirms the plain\n    language of section 116B.03 barring permit-related challenges under that process and provision. We do not reach appellants' separation-of-powers arguments because the plain language of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03, subd. 1, renders it unnecessary to do so. The obvious legislative purpose is to entrust rule-making and permit issuance to the executive branch, subject to judicial oversight under chapter 116B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The district court erred in determining that section 116B.03 applies to respondents' claims, because it reasoned that the conduct at issue was not the DNR's permitting, but instead was the broader impact of the DNR's permits. But the conduct at issue here is groundwater pumping, which the DNR controls through its permitting authority. Because respondents' claims challenge the adequacy of DNR-issued groundwater-appropriation permits, and because the groundwater withdrawals are actions taken pursuant to DNR permits, the plain language of MERA requires that appellants' challenges be brought under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We are mindful of both parties' arguments that this case is controlled by our decisions in the\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake\n    </em>\n    series of cases.\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

We rejected the DNR's argument that section 116B.10 provides the exclusive mechanism by which a citizen may challenge an agency's conduct, but concluded that, under the facts of the case, the DNR could not be liable for the county's failure to maintain the dam in question.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7085125\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/771/529/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7085125\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/771/529/\">\n     at 538\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake III\n    </em>\n    , we further explained that if a plaintiff \"proves a violation of MERA, the district court may grant declaratory relief, temporary and permanent equitable relief, or may impose such conditions upon a party as are necessary to protect the air, water, land or other natural resources located within the state from pollution, impairment, or destruction.\"\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake III\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7077602\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/799/619/\">\n     799 N.W.2d at 625\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation omitted). But the relief granted-and the only relief available-in\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake III\n    </em>\n    was against Nicollet County, and there was neither evidence nor argument that\n    the county's neglect of the dam was action taken pursuant to a permit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The facts of\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake\n    </em>\n    significantly differ from the facts here.

To the contrary, the county's inaction was at issue in\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake\n    </em>\n    , and there was no DNR permit. The\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake\n    </em>\n    decisions stand for the propositions that MERA claims do not require the exhaustion of administrative processes, and that inaction-in that case by a county-can give rise to a MERA claim. Our\n    <em>\n     Swan Lake\n    </em>\n    decisions do not control here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    We hold that, because the conduct that respondents allege impairs the lake is taken pursuant to DNR permits, \"no action shall be allowable\" under section 116B.03. This does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    mean that respondents have no recourse. Relief under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, captioned \"Civil Action Against State,\" is available.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    To the extent that the DNR has itself violated the law, as respondents claim and as the district court found, the remedy for that is clear. When a district court remits the subject of a permit-related action to the agency for \"appropriate administrative proceedings,\" it \"shall retain jurisdiction for purposes of judicial review.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 3.

Under section 116B.10, temporary equitable relief is available \"to prevent irreparable injury to\" the lake. Whether and to what extent such relief should be ordered on remand is entrusted to the district court's discretion.

Also, the public-trust doctrine protects navigable waters, including White Bear Lake and its lake bed, therefore, respondents' common-law claim is authorized.

To explain my reasoning, I will begin with the statutory framework under chapter 116B, then consider the language of the no-action provision and the conduct challenged by respondent's lawsuit, and, finally, address whether an action under section 116B.10 is the exclusive remedy when a MERA claim relates to permits issued by an agency.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <em>\n     A.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Statutory framework\n    </em>\n    : Chapter 116B declares environmental rights and has 13 separate sections.

For ease of reference, I will call this a \"03 civil action.\" In section 116B.10, MERA created a civil action \"against the state or any agency or instrumentality thereof\" with a different focus, specifically, \"where the nature of the action is a challenge to an environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement, or permit ... for which the applicable statutory appeal period has elapsed.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 1 (2018). For ease of reference, I will call this a \"10 civil action.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    For both types of civil actions, the legislature set out the plaintiff's burden of proof. For a 03 civil action, the plaintiff's burden of proof depends on the challenged conduct, which it describes as (a) and (b). Under (a), when \"the subject of the action is conduct governed by any environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement, or permit,\" a prima facie showing is that the defendant's conduct \"violates or is likely to violate,\" for example, a permit. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.04(a) (2018). Under (b), if the 03 civil action is not about conduct governed by, for example, a permit, then a prima facie showing is that the defendant's conduct \"has, or is likely to cause the pollution, impairment, or destruction of\" natural resources.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . (b) (2018). The plaintiff's burden of proof for a 03 civil action thus includes proving\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    that the defendant's conduct violates, for example, a permit,\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    that defendant's conduct has caused pollution, impairment or destruction of natural resources.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In contrast, for a 10 civil action, the plaintiff's burden of proof is not described as conduct, but instead as proving that the \"environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement, or permit is inadequate to protect\" natural resources from pollution, impairment, or destruction. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 2 (2018). And the plaintiff's burden of proof under a 10 civil action is satisfied by proving the inadequacy of a permit to protect natural resources from pollution, impairment, or destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     B.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     No-action provision and the challenged conduct\n    </em>\n    : This statutory framework carries significant meaning when determining whether the no-action provision in a 03 civil action precludes all relief in a suit against the DNR for conduct by a municipality pursuant to a permit. In relevant part, a 03 civil action has an important exception that is not present in a 10 civil action.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    [P]rovided, however, ...\n    <em>\n     no action shall be allowable under this section for conduct taken by a person pursuant to any\n    </em>\n    environmental quality standard, limitation, rule, order, license, stipulation agreement or\n    <em>\n     permit issued by\n    </em>\n    the Pollution Control Agency,\n    <em>\n     Department of Natural Resources\n    </em>\n    , Department of Health or Department of Agriculture.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03, subd. 1 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Based on the plain-language of the no-action provision, I conclude that it does not apply here because respondents' action is \"for conduct\" taken (or not taken)\n    <em>\n     by the DNR\n    </em>\n    pursuant to its statutory authority and does not challenge a municipality's conduct pursuant to a permit. The no-action provision directly refers to a lawsuit's allegations of wrongful conduct when it states that \"no action\" is allowable \"for conduct.\" Respondents' MERA claim fits section 116B.04(b) 's prima facie showing for a 03 action because it claims that the DNR's conduct (or lack thereof) has impaired the lake and aquifer, which are both natural resources.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.02, subd. 4 (2018). In contrast, respondents' MERA claim does not fit section 116B.10, subdivision 2 's prima facie showing for a 10 civil action because it does not contend that a groundwater-appropriation permit is \"inadequate to protect\" natural resources. Instead, respondents' MERA claim challenges the DNR's failure to comply with state laws that mandate that it protect our surface and groundwater. I disagree that, because respondents' complaint alleges a MERA violation\n    <em>\n     relating\n    </em>\n    to conduct by a municipality pursuant to a permit issued by the DNR, the no-action provision bars a 03 civil action against the DNR.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    It is not accurate to describe the \"complained-of conduct\" in respondents' lawsuit as \"the withdrawal of groundwater in conformity with or under the authority of the DNR's permits.\" Respondents do not contend that any municipality's conduct violated state law or a DNR-issued groundwater-appropriation permit. Indeed, respondents did not maintain an action against any municipality, respondents did not seek to enjoin any municipality, and the district court's order did not enjoin any person other than the DNR. And neither the respondents' evidence nor the district court's findings criticize the issuance of any particular groundwater appropriation permit. Instead, the district court found that the DNR issued \"evergreen\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    groundwater-appropriation permits on a case-by-case basis for decades without considering the cumulative and adverse effect of those permits on the lake and aquifer and without following other statutory mandates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    It also is not accurate to state that the DNR \"has only one tool for regulating water appropriation-permits.\" Indeed, the district court found that the DNR violated Minnesota law by failing to comply with its statutory duties to protect Minnesota's surface and groundwater. The district court issued findings of fact supporting its determination that the DNR either directly or by omission violated multiple Minnesota statutes, and this portion of its opinion extends more than 15 pages. In its conclusions of law, the district court included a detailed analysis of the facts and applicable law, and determined that the DNR violated and \"will likely violate\" the following statutes and rules: (a) Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.211 (2018), by allowing public waters to be drained without replacement; (b) Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.287, subd. 5 (2018), by issuing groundwater-appropriation permits without a determination of sustainability; (c) Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.287, subd. 2 (2018), and Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.285, subds. 3, 6 (2018), by failing to set collective annual withdrawal limits for the lake, require permittees to submit a contingency plan, and specify how it will enforce the protected elevation level of the lake; and (d)\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%206115\">\n     Minn. R. 6115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .0670, subp. 3(C) (2017), by issuing groundwater-appropriation permits without sufficient hydrologic data. In addition, the district court made specific findings that the DNR's conduct has materially and adversely affected the lake and aquifer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The district court also found that the DNR had early and ample knowledge of impairment to the lake and aquifer, yet failed to exercise its statutory authority to protect these natural resources. Minnesota law authorizes the commissioner of natural resources (commissioner) to \"issue water-use permits for appropriation from groundwater\n    <em>\n     only if\n    </em>\n    the commissioner determines that the groundwater use is sustainable to supply the needs of future generations\n    and the proposed use will not harm ecosystems, degrade water, or reduce water levels beyond the reach of public water supply.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.287, subd. 5 (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    The district court found that the DNR violated this and other provisions, by, among other things, failing to exercise its authority to amend the permits with conditions,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.255 (2018), and failing to set a \"protective elevation for the water basin, below which an appropriation is not allowed.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.285, subd. 3(b) (requiring designation of protective elevations);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.287, subd. 2 (requiring certain steps when groundwater appropriations \"will have negative impacts to surface waters\").\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Because the respondents' claim is against the DNR for its own conduct that impaired the lake and aquifer and that violated the DNR's affirmative statutory duties, the no-action provision does not apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <em>\n     C\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Exclusivity of a 10 action and effect of the no-action provision\n    </em>\n    : Even assuming that respondents' claims relate to conduct by a municipality pursuant to a DNR permit and state a 10 civil action, I do not agree that a 10 civil action \"is the exclusive remedy available under MERA when the challenged action is that of a state agency in issuing a permit.\" No language in chapter 116B provides that a 10 civil action is exclusive and cannot be pursued in addition or in the alternative to a 03 civil action. In fact, a 10 civil action expressly carves out a specific niche for a citizen suit against (a) the state or an agency (not another type of defendant, as allowed in a 03 action), (b) where the claim is that, for example, a permit is inadequate to protect natural resources,\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    (c) \"the applicable statutory appeal period has elapsed.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10, subd. 1.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    As discussed above, a 03 civil action has a broader focus because it challenges a defendant's conduct that impairs natural resources. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.04(b). Thus, the statutory framework in chapter 116B allows for a variety of theories and, in the\n    absence of statutory language providing that a 10 civil action is exclusive, these theories may be pursued together or in the alternative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Additionally, MERA's no-action provision does not completely bar a citizen suit under section 116B.03. For two reasons, I conclude that, when applicable, MERA's no-action provision limits the issues and does not entirely preclude a 03 civil action. First, we must read sections 116B.03 and 116B.04 together and give effect to both provisions, which are explicitly linked.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Martin v. Dicklich\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7067363\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/823/336/#p345\">\n     823 N.W.2d 336\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 345 (Minn. 2012) (providing that a statute should be interpreted to give effect to all of its provisions). Section 116B.04(a), which sets out the burden of proof for the first type of 03 civil action, states that a 03 civil action is proven when \"the subject of the action is conduct governed by\" a permit. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.04(a). The no-action provision uses similar language, and states that \"no action shall be allowable under this section for conduct taken by a person pursuant to any\" permit issued by the DNR. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03, subd. 1. Reading these two provisions together, at the very least, a 03 civil action allows a MERA plaintiff to contend that a defendant's conduct violates or is likely to violate a permit, as expressly stated in section 116B.04.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.04.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Second, relevant case law holds that the no-action provision limits the issues and does not entirely preclude a 03 civil action when the plaintiff's burden of proof is set out in section 116B.04(b), which is the second type of 03 civil action for conduct that has impaired a natural resource. Our court has previously considered the application of the no-action provision to a consent order between a MERA defendant and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and we reversed a district court's decision that the no-action provision barred a 03 civil action.\n    <em>\n     In re Williams Pipeline Co\n    </em>\n    . reasoned that the consent order did not require \"this particular rerouting of the [defendant's] pipeline\" and the consent order allowed the defendant to \"choose among several alternatives,\" therefore, the 03 civil action was not barred.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11545763\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/597/340/#p345\">\n     597 N.W.2d 340\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 345-46 (Minn. App. 1999). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion and upheld a 03 civil action under MERA even though the defendant had entered into a consent order with the MPCA.\n    <em>\n     Kennedy Bldg. Assocs. v. Viacom, Inc\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375425\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/731/#p744\">\n     375 F.3d 731\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 744-45 (8th Cir. 2004). The Eighth Circuit held that where a consent order \"specifies general but not particular actions,\" the no-action provision \"does not preempt a MERA claim based on aspects of the defendant's actions that were not required by the consent order.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 744.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Consistent with the decisions in\n    <em>\n     Williams Pipeline\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Kennedy Building\n    </em>\n    , a 03 civil action may proceed so long as a MERA plaintiff bases its claim \"on aspects of the defendant's actions that were not required\" by the permit. In this case, respondents specifically claimed that the DNR violated\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    statutory duties, did not assert that the DNR permits were illegal, and contended that the municipalities were appropriating groundwater in compliance with DNR-issued permits. Thus, even assuming the no-action provision applies, respondents' lawsuit is not barred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    In conclusion, based on the plain language of section 116B.03, subdivision 1, and the specific conduct challenged by respondents' lawsuit, the district court correctly decided that MERA's no-action provision does not preclude respondents' 03 civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the state of Minnesota and against the DNR for its own conduct, which has impaired the lake and aquifer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Alternative remedies under MERA and exhaustion of administrative remedies\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    To support application of MERA's no-action provision to bar respondents' 03 civil action, appellants contend that respondents' claims are more appropriately brought under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.10. For two reasons, I disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    First, respondents' suit challenges the DNR's violations of state law and I can find no language in section 116B.10 that would provide relief for agency conduct that violates state law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. 116B.10, subds. 1, 2, 3. Indeed, a district court's role in a 10 civil action is very limited. After a prima facie showing by a plaintiff in a 10 civil action, a district court is directed to remit the parties to the state agency that promulgated, for example, a challenged permit, and require the agency to institute appropriate administrative proceedings.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., subd. 3. The court retains jurisdiction \"for purposes of judicial review to determine whether the order of the agency is supported by the preponderance of the evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . In contrast, a district court is authorized to grant broad relief in a 03 civil action, including declaratory and equitable relief, as well as to impose conditions on the parties to protect natural resources.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.07 (2018). Respondents' claims for the DNR's violations of state law cannot be addressed in a 10 civil action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Second, in\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Swan Lake Area Wildlife Ass'n v. Nicollet Cty Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs\n    </em>\n    , this court rejected a similar argument that a 10 civil action was a MERA plaintiff's sole basis for relief.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7085125\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/771/529/\">\n     771 N.W.2d 529\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 537-38 (Minn. App. 2009). After reading together the civil action alternatives set out in MERA, we held that \"these sections [116B.03 and .10] clearly provide two distinct ways for a party to challenge an agency's conduct. To construe section 116B.10 as overriding or usurping the plain language of sections 116B.02 and 116B.03 would be unreasonable.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 538. Thus, I disagree that respondents' claim is more appropriately brought under 116B.10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Appellants also contend that respondents were required to exhaust administrative remedies. The legislature anticipated the appellants' argument that citizens should first be required to pursue administrative relief and made clear that MERA gives them additional rights, separate from other rights and remedies: \"No existing civil or criminal remedy for any wrongful action shall be excluded or impaired by sections 116B.01 to 116B.13. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be in addition to any administrative, regulatory, statutory, or common law rights and remedies now or hereafter available.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.12 (2018) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Swan Lake Area Wildlife Ass'n v. Nicollet Cty Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8990655\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/711/522/\">\n     711 N.W.2d 522\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525-26 (Minn. App. 2006) (rejecting appellant's argument that respondent failed to exhaust administrative remedies and holding that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over respondent's MERA claim \"regardless of the administrative processes and remedies available\" under other provisions),\n    <em>\n     review\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     denied\n    </em>\n    (Minn. June 20, 2006). Accordingly, exhaustion of administrative processes is not required before bringing a claim under MERA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Agency deference and separation of powers\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Appellants make a number of arguments about agency deference and separation of powers. In a 03 civil action, the district court does not review any agency decision and accord it deference; it sits as the finder of fact. This principle is solidly established by precedent that is more than 40 years old. In\n    <em>\n     Minn. Pub. Interest Research Grp. v. White Bear Rod &amp; Gun Club\n    </em>\n    , the Minnesota Supreme Court noted that, when deciding a 03 civil action, \"the trial court sat as a court of first impression and not as an appellate tribunal.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10690972\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/257/762/\">\n     257 N.W.2d 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 782 n.13 (Minn. 1977). In the same case, the supreme court observed that MERA \"does not prescribe elaborate standards to guide trial courts, but allows a case-by-case determination by use of a balancing test, analogous to the one traditionally employed by courts of equity, where the utility of a defendant's conduct which interferes with and invades natural resources is weighed against the gravity of harm resulting from such an interference or invasion.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 782. Thus, appellants have no basis for claiming error on the grounds of agency deference.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Similarly, the district court's decision does not overstep the bounds created by the separation of powers for two reasons. First, respondents brought this suit to compel agency compliance with statutes enacted by the legislature. Respondents' request for relief is consistent with MERA's purpose, which the supreme court has described as promoting citizen action: \"The need for citizen vigilance exists whether or not specific environmental legislation applies, and MERA is clearly a proper mechanism to force an administrative agency ... to consider environmental values that it might have overlooked.\"\n    <em>\n     People for Envtl. Enlightenment &amp; Responsibility (PEER), Inc. v. Minn. Envtl. Quality Council\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10690014\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/266/858/#p866\">\n     266 N.W.2d 858\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 866 (Minn. 1978).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Second, as stated, MERA authorizes the district court to provide broad relief: \"The court may grant declaratory relief, temporary and permanent equitable relief, or may impose such conditions upon a party as are necessary or appropriate to protect the air, water, land or other natural resources located within the state from pollution, impairment, or destruction.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.07. The district court's order is well within its statutory authority to force the DNR to act to prevent the impairment of the lake and aquifer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The central feature of the district court's order provides that the DNR not issue new groundwater appropriation permits \"until it has fully complied\" with applicable statutes and \"has sufficient hydrologic data to understand the impact\" on the lake and aquifer. The order also provides that the DNR must comply with applicable statutory requirements for all groundwater appropriation permits within a 5-mile radius of the lake, which includes the DNR (1) setting a collective-annual-withdrawal limit for the aquifer, (2) enforcing a trigger elevation of 923.5 feet for the implementation of protected elevation, (3) preparing and enacting a residential irrigation ban, (4) requiring an enforceable plan to decrease per capita residential water use, and (5) amending all permits within the 5-mile radius of the lake to require a contingency plan for conversion to total or partial supply from surface-water sources.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Each of these provisions in the district court's order is grounded in statutes governing the DNR's duty to manage surface and ground water and are supported by the record and the district court's findings. Therefore, I conclude that the district court's decision appropriately balances the utility of agency conduct with the gravity of the harm to prescribe appropriate relief and does not offend agency deference or separation of powers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Public-trust doctrine\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The public-trust doctrine is described as the state's holding in trust \" 'navigable waters and the soil under them for [the] common use,' \" along with the state's authority and duty as trustee to maintain and protect navigable waters, for navigation, boating, swimming, and other public uses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    <em>\n     Save Mille Lacs Sportsfishing, Inc. v.

No legal authority holds, and I am not persuaded to conclude for the first time, that a private interest in groundwater negates or bars a public-trust claim to protect navigable water.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The record does not distinguish between the groundwater that lies below the lake and the groundwater that is extracted \"outside of the boundaries of the lake and lake bed.\" As discussed below, the district court's findings of fact should be affirmed under the applicable standard of review. These findings include that the groundwater permits allow for extraction from wells located outside the boundaries of the lake, and also that the groundwater lies beneath the lake, is continuous, and extends far beyond the lakeshore. The district court also found the lake and the aquifer are \"strongly hydraulically connected,\" and the district court specifically found that pumping from wells within five miles of the lake has a \"very significant influence\" on the lake's levels.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Thus, respondents are entitled to relief under the public-trust doctrine to protect the lake.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Joinder\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Appellants contend that the district court erred by failing to dismiss respondents' claims for failure to join the permit-holder municipalities as necessary parties. A party is necessary if complete relief cannot be granted in its absence or it claims an interest in the subject of the litigation. Minn. R. Civ. P. 19.01. A district court's decision to deny a motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     Rilley v.

Here, the district court denied the DNR's motion to dismiss because (a) the proper solution, if the parties are necessary, is joinder, not dismissal; (b) a permittee does not have an established right of groundwater use or appropriation; and (c) the relief sought by respondents is premised on the DNR's alleged violations of MERA, not the municipalities' conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The record supports the district court's findings that adequate notice of respondents' action was provided to ten permit-holder municipalities, only two asked to intervene, and both requests were granted. While appellants criticize the notice given, the record does not disclose a request for additional notice to be given, as provided for in MERA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116B.03, subd. 2 (authorizing a district court to order additional notice to interested persons). Additionally, the district court's order requires the DNR to review and amend permits within a 5-mile radius consistent with statutory provisions. Presumably, the DNR will follow the appropriate administrative process to do so and will provide all permit-holders with an opportunity to be heard.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    More fundamentally, the district court concluded that respondents' failure to join the permit-holder municipalities did not require dismissal and, at most, only affected the relief obtained. I am persuaded by the Minnesota Supreme Court's reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Cruz-Guzman v. State\n    </em>\n    , where the parents of children enrolled in public schools brought a putative class-action complaint against the state alleging a violation of Minnesota's constitutional provision for an adequate education, among other claims.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557530\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/916/1/#p4\">\n     916 N.W.2d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 4 (Minn. 2018). There, the plaintiff-parents had failed to join school districts and charter schools, which the state argued were necessary parties.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 13-14. The supreme court rejected the state's argument because \"the relief appellants are seeking from the State does not require the joinder of school districts and charter schools.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 14. Similarly, respondents seek relief from the DNR, not from the municipal permit-holders. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the DNR's motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      District court's findings of fact\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Appellants contend that a number of the district court's factual findings were clearly erroneous. \"In an appeal from a bench trial, we do not reconcile conflicting evidence.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <em>\n     Porch v.
