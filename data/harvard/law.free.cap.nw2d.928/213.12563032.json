The Court of Appeals erred in asserting that the erroneously admitted testimony of Tameachi Wilder regarding her knowledge of the defendant's prior firearms-related convictions was harmless due to the \"untainted and unequivocal testimony\" of two police officers that they saw the defendant in possession of the gun. The Court of Appeals failed to acknowledge that two other witnesses (Charmell Richardson and Carlos Wilder) offered testimony that contradicted that testimony. That failure resulted in the Court of Appeals effectively determining that the officers' testimony was credible and that Richardson's and Wilder's was not. On remand, the Court of Appeals shall engage in \"an examination of the entire cause,\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Lukity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"897923\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/460/484/#p495\">\n    460 Mich. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495-496,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=596%20N.W.2d%20607\">\n    596 N.W.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), and reconsider whether it is more probable than not that the error was outcome determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
