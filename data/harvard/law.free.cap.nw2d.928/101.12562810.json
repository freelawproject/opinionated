Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   This case requires us to interpret recent amendments to the Public Employment Relations Act limiting the mandatory subjects of collective bargaining and the matters an arbitrator may consider if the dispute enters binding arbitration. Under the 2017 amendments, when a bargaining unit does not have at least thirty percent public safety employees, bargaining is limited to \"base wages and other matters mutually agreed upon.\" 2017 Iowa Acts ch. 2, \u00a7 6 (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.9\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 20.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (2018)). If such bargaining reaches impasse and the impasse persists, the dispute goes to binding arbitration, but the arbitrator may not consider \"[p]ast collective bargaining agreements between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13 (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.22\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 20.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8)(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   )(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Seeking to clarify the meaning of these provisions, a union sought a declaratory order from the Iowa Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) and then judicial review of the declaratory order. Both PERB and the district court ruled that \"base wages\" meant the \"minimum (bottom) pay for a job classification, category or title, exclusive of additional pay such as bonuses, premium pay, merit pay, performance pay or longevity pay.\" In addition, both ruled that \"past collective bargaining agreements\" meant agreements that predate the current expiring agreement. The union appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On appeal, we now hold that PERB and the district court correctly interpreted the 2017 amendments. In the abstract, terms like \"base wages\" and \"past collective bargaining agreements\" are ambiguous, but the context allows us to determine their meaning here. We conclude that \"base wages\" means the floor level of pay for each job before upward adjustments such as for job shift or longevity. The term \"past collective bargaining agreements,\" in the context of a law that limits the arbitrator's potential award to a certain percentage increase in base wages,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.22\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 20.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   )(1) (2018), allows the arbitrator to consider the existing collective bargaining agreement but not ones that came before.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.22\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20.22(8)(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   )(1).

Background Facts and Proceedings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America (UE) is the parent of two local unions based in Iowa: UE Local 893/Iowa United Professionals and UE Local 896 (COGS). Both locals are certified by PERB to represent bargaining units of State of Iowa public employees. Local 896 represents a unit of graduate and professional students employed by the University of Iowa. Local 893 represents the science and social services units of state employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Iowa legislature enacted House File 291 in February 2017 to amend the Public Employment Relations Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Iowa Acts ch. 2 (codified in part at Iowa Code ch. 20 (2018)). Previous law required public employers and certified bargaining representatives\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   to negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, vacations, insurance, holidays, leaves of absence, shift differentials, overtime compensation, supplemental pay, seniority, transfer procedures, job classifications, health and safety matters, evaluation procedures, procedures for staff reduction, in-service training and other matters mutually agreed upon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.9\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 20.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

Thus, for many public employees in Iowa, the only mandatory subject of collective bargaining became \"base wages.\" The amendments did not define base wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, if a collective bargaining negotiation stalled and binding arbitration was required, previous law required the arbitrator to consider \"[p]ast collective bargaining contracts between the parties including the bargaining that led up to such contracts.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.22\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 20.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (2017).

At the same time, the 2017 amendments required the arbitrator to \"consider and specifically address in the arbitrator's determination ...

The employee organization therefore has requested arbitration. The contract ending June 30, 2018 provides for an annual base wage for all employees of $ 45,000.00. The employer[']s final offer at arbitration is an annual base wage of $ 35,000.00 for all the employees in the bargaining unit. The employee organization's final offer for arbitration is an annual base wage of $ 55,000.00 for all employees in the bargaining unit. The public employer states that the arbitrator cannot consider the employee organizations award since it is greater than the increase in the consumer price index and in any event is greater than 3%. The employee organization states that the arbitrator can neither consider or even be informed of base wages paid to employees under the expiring contract in that the law as amended provides:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    \"The arbitrator shall not consider the following factors:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    (1) Past collective bargaining agreements between the parties or bargaining that led to such agreements.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    Thus, the employee organization states that neither side can rely on a collective agreement whose terms have expired. Thus, just as the employer is free to ignore the prior agreement and offer a wage substantially less than the employees were receiving, the employee organization is free to propose a substantially greater base wage. To hold otherwise would require the arbitrator to look at the wages paid in the past collective bargaining agreement which the arbitrator specifically is precluded from doing. To hold otherwise would\n    mean that the terms of a contract that had expired in June of 2018 absent voluntary agreement limit the wages that an arbitrator could award and an employee could receive in perpetuity. In other words, the ending base wage rate in the June 30, 2018 contract would be the starting point for the consideration of every wage rate thereafter be it twenty-five or fifty years in the future.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    The question posed is may the arbitrator look to the past collective bargaining agreement, the one expiring June 30, 2018 and consider the wage paid in past collective bargaining as consideration for an award on base wages.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    On June 29, PERB issued a declaratory order. It determined that subparagraphs C, D, E, F, and G of Proposal I involved permissive subjects of bargaining, i.e., hours, holidays, vacations, leaves of absence, and overtime pay rates. PERB added, however, that the employer has a good faith duty to disclose its position on \"quantity-of-work-related permissive topics\" so that the employee organization can \"knowledgeably and rationally bargain employee base wages.\" PERB declined to answer Proposal II without information on whether each employee occupied a different job classification. As to Proposal III, PERB indicated that only the floor level of compensation (Year 1) was a mandatory subject of bargaining; longevity pay would be a permissive subject of bargaining. Concerning Proposal IV, PERB stated that any \"shift differential\" (assuming the proposal was for higher pay for those working 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. within the same job classification) would also be a permissive subject of bargaining. Lastly, regarding Proposal V, PERB stated that to harmonize and give effect to all of the amendments to Iowa Code section 20.22, \"past collective bargaining agreements\" must mean agreements other than the current expiring agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    On September 19, UE filed a petition in the Polk County District Court seeking judicial review of PERB's declaratory order (except as to Proposal II). The State of Iowa and the Iowa Board of Regents moved to intervene, and their motions were granted. On March 15, 2018, the district court entered an order affirming the PERB's decision and denying and dismissing UE's petition for judicial review. UE appealed, and we retained the appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

A reasonable person, I think, could consider the legislature's use of the term \"base wages\" implies a term with a different meaning than the preexisting term \"wages.\" And since the qualifier \"base\" could be considered a restricting qualifier, a reasonable person might reach the interpretation advanced by appellees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    There is caselaw supporting this approach to the term \"base wages.\" A disputed contract in Minnesota defined \"salary\" as including base wages, selection premium, overtime, shift differentials, longevity payments, and other types of compensation.\n    <em>\n     City of Minneapolis v.

Resolving the Ambiguity.\n    </strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Iowa legislative history.\n    </em>\n    There is a notable difference between the 2017 amendments to Iowa Code section 20.9 as first introduced and the legislation that ultimately became law. In addition to limiting the mandatory subject of bargaining to base wages for unions not composed of at least thirty percent public safety employees, the original legislation would have prevented bargaining on \"seniority and any wage increase\" as well as an \"employment advantage based on seniority.\" H. Study B. 84, 87th G.A., Reg. Sess. (Iowa 2017). On the date the legislation passed the legislature, the latter exclusions were removed by a unanimous amendment. Amendment H-1101 to Amendment H-1096 to H.F. 291, 87th G.A., Reg. Sess. (Iowa 2017). The limitation to bargaining over base wages remained unchanged.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652914\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/148/737/#p739\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    I find this legislative history only marginally helpful. If the original legislation had become law, it would have been quite clear that step increases, for example, were not subject to collective bargaining. But these specific provisions were amended out of the statute. One might argue that the legislature did not want the prohibition and so deleted it. On the other hand, one could argue that the prohibition was redundant and did not need to be included in the legislation in the first place. Standing alone, I do not think either party can make a persuasive case out of this piece of legislative history.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Comparison with Wisconsin statute.\n    </em>\n    According to recently enacted Wisconsin law, a Wisconsin public employer is prohibited from negotiating, with certain unions, \"pay schedules[ ] and automatic pay progressions\" but may negotiate \"total base wages.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20111.91\">\n     Wis.

Thus, Wisconsin law expressly distinguishes between base wages and other matters bearing on the wages an individual is actually paid. Assuming the Iowa legislature was aware of the Wisconsin precursor, one could argue that by not including the specific prohibition of pay schedules and automatic pay progressions as was included in the Wisconsin statute, the Iowa legislature intended a different result. Or, again, perhaps the legislature deemed the specific prohibition unnecessary. I think the failure to follow the Wisconsin model is interesting, and knowing the proclivities to follow beaten paths, points somewhat toward the union's interpretation of base wages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Legislative direction to narrowly interpret the statute.\n    </em>\n    Thus, based solely on the terms of the statutory provision and the very limited legislative history, I would likely lean slightly toward the union's position. But the Iowa legislature has directed that this statute should be narrowly interpreted. Iowa Code section 20.9(1) (2018) provides, \"Mandatory subjects of negotiation ... shall be interpreted narrowly and restrictively.\" This legislative directive materially changes the interpretive calculus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The legislative direction in Iowa Code section 20.9 is the opposite of that contained in other statutes. For instance, the Iowa Civil Rights Act contains a provision stating that its terms should be \"construed broadly\" to effectuate the purposes of the law.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20216.18\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 216.18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1).

The only remaining question is whether the narrow interpretation would defeat the underlying purposes of the statute or create a conflict with other statutory provisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Conflict with legislative purpose or other statutory provisions.\n    </em>\n    There can be no dispute that restricting a union to only negotiating base wages will diminish unions' ability to achieve their goals and at least potentially undermine unions' ability to function.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Laborers Local 236, AFL-CIO v.

Indeed, the changes in the 2017 amendments were plainly designed to, and have the effect of, restricting collective bargaining rights. Certainly an interpretation of the term \"base wages\" that is limited to the wages of a new employee in a given job classification is consistent with the general purpose of the 2017 amendments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    But we must also consider the broader picture. Although the mandatory terms of collective bargaining are to be construed narrowly and restrictively, we still, I take it, should construe the provisions of the statute \"to promote harmonious and cooperative relationships between government and its employees by permitting public employees to organize and bargain collectively.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.1\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 20.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1). This general declaration of statutory purpose has not been repealed and is, like Iowa Code section 20.9, designed to guide courts in interpretation of the statute. If we interpret the 2017 amendments to permit some unions to bargain for the wage paid to a new entrant in a given job classification without regard to other employees with more seniority, are those more senior public employees denied representation?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Other provisions of chapter 20 similarly raise the question of whether interpreting section 20.9(1) to only allow negotiations for the wages paid to some employees but not others is consistent with the statute. For instance, an employee organization is \"an organization of any kind in which public\n    employees participate and which exists for the primary purpose of representing employees in their employment relations.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.1\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 20.3(4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Similarly, an employee organization is \"the exclusive representative of\n    <em>\n     all public employees\n    </em>\n    in the bargaining unit and shall represent\n    <em>\n     all public employees\n    </em>\n    fairly.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.1\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 20.17(1) (emphasis added). The term \"all\" is used twice. Can a union represent all employees fairly if it can only negotiate wages for some of them?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Further, \"[p]ublic employees shall have the right to .... [n]egotiate collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.1\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 20.8(2). Is a public employee's right to negotiate collectively nullified by an interpretation that allows negotiation only for the wages paid to others?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    We cannot ignore these larger statutory considerations. Still, by negotiating base rates, the union can establish what amounts to a floor within a job classification. Negotiating a raise in the entry level salary might bump up the employer's compensation offered to more experienced employees. But, yet, it might not. Such an increase would be in the sole discretion of the employer. The more experienced employees have no right to have a collective bargaining representative bargain for them directly with the employer for a contractually based increase in wages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    I conclude that the interpretation that limits base wages to entry level positions in each job classification cannot be squared with the larger legislative purposes of the statute. Under the statute, the union is to represent all employees, not just some. The construction of the statute that eliminates the ability of the union to negotiate wages for all employees cuts too deeply into the purposes of the collective bargaining framework. I would conclude that for the purposes of the statute, all employees have a base wage and that the term \"base wage\" may be narrowly construed to include only the lowest pay necessarily available to that individual, absent bonuses, incentives, or supplemental pay of any kind.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Wages as Including Rate.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    The second issue in this case is whether the term \"base wage\" also includes a concept of rate. In other words, under the statute as amended, can a public employer refuse to negotiate on the amount of services that must be rendered for a given economic reward?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    In my opinion, by providing that base wages is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, the legislature intended to allow bargaining over both the economic reward and the level or amount of services to be rendered for that reward. This is consistent with our precedent and the legislature's use of the word \"wages\" in other contexts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Waterloo\n    </em>\n    , we held that the term \"wages\" encompasses an economic reward based upon services rendered.\n    <em>\n     Waterloo Educ. Ass'n v. Iowa Pub. Emp't Relations Bd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n     740 N.W.2d 418\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 430 (Iowa 2007). Quoting a state public employee relations board, we explained, \"It is only possible to rationally bargain for 'an honest day's pay' if one can also negotiate the boundaries and the contents of 'an honest day's work.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Or.

We further observed, \"The employee's economic interest in more pay for more work is precisely the kind of employee interest that leading commentators for decades have suggested should be subject to collective bargaining.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (collecting authorities). Finally, we noted that the proposal would not limit management's discretion to assign work, but relates solely\n    to payment for an amount of services rendered.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    In interpreting the term in\n    <em>\n     Waterloo\n    </em>\n    , we said that the legislature intended a \"relatively narrow construction,\" but not the \"narrowest possible interpretation,\" of the term.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n     at 429-30\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Consequently, we gave the term its \"common and ordinary meaning.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371443\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/740/418/#p419\">\n     at 430\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    In 2017, in addition to requiring that some unions are only able to bargain over base wages, the legislature stated that the mandatory subjects of bargaining applicable to all types of unions \"shall be interpreted narrowly and restrictively.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.9\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 20.9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1). Since the legislature's directive may require a different interpretive approach than we took in\n    <em>\n     Waterloo\n    </em>\n    , there arises a question as to whether our decision in\n    <em>\n     Waterloo\n    </em>\n    remains good law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    I do not believe the legislature intended a different result on this issue than that reached in\n    <em>\n     Waterloo\n    </em>\n    . Most importantly, the legislature continued to use the word \"wages.\" That was the term considered in\n    <em>\n     Waterloo\n    </em>\n    . Further, in other parts of the Iowa Code, the legislature indicates that the term \"wages\" is a reflection of an economic reward for services rendered. One example is the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law. The term \"wages,\" for purposes of that law, means \"compensation owed by an employer for [l]abor or services rendered by an employee, whether determined on a time, task, piece, commission, or other basis of calculation.\" Iowa Code \u00a7 91A.2(7)(\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    It is true that under the legislative changes, \"hours\" is no longer a mandatory subject of bargaining for disfavored unions. But to me, the term \"hours\" means the times employees are required to report to work and remain there.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Finally, I do not agree with the majority that requiring an employer to inform the union of expected services to be rendered as an element of good faith bargaining resolves this issue. First, if the number of hours is not part of contractually bargained for wages, the employer may simply change them unilaterally. For example, a union might negotiate an increase in pay for entry level teachers of two percent, but in response, the employer might unilaterally increase the number of classes to be taught by twenty-five percent or even fifty percent. The argument, as I understand it, is that a person who receives a fifty percent increase in time on the job for the same pay gets the same wages. I doubt that many workers would agree with that proposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Second, if an employer does not inform the union of the amount of work expected for a certain wage, the union has no timely remedy. An unfair labor practice proceeding will not likely resolve the issue in time to meet the bargaining deadlines required by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020.17\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 20.17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3) and (9).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    For the above reasons, I conclude that the term \"wages\" includes within it the amount of work expected to be performed for the compensation offered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    I would reverse and remand the district court judgment. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Wiggins, J., joins this concurrence in part and dissent in part.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-173\">\n     https://library.municode.com/pa/bensalem/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeld =PTIADLE_CH24PE_ARTIIPEPL_DIV3EMPODE_S24-71DE [https://perma.cc/3TPLC6YU].\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
