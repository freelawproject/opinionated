In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that an insured is entitled to compensation under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for an injury sustained while performing \"maintenance\" of his or her vehicle without regard to whether the vehicle might be considered \"parked\" at the time of the injury. The Court concisely explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   There is an apparent tension between these two sections [ MCL 500.3105 and MCL 500.3106 ] of the no-fault act: requiring, on the one hand, compensation for injuries incurred in the maintenance of a vehicle [ MCL 500.3105 ] but not requiring, on the other hand, compensation for injuries incurred in the maintenance of a\n   <em>\n    parked\n   </em>\n   vehicle, with three exceptions [ MCL 500.3106 ]. Since most, if not all, maintenance is done while the vehicle is parked, and since the three exceptions appear addressed to circumstances unrelated to normal maintenance situations, a conflict appears.

The relevant common definition of \"park\" at the time was \"to halt (one's vehicle) with the intention of not using it again immediately.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    The Random House College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (1975). There is clearly a temporal component to the term that suggests that the vehicle may continue to be used as a motor vehicle. But to hold, as did the Court in\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and several other published cases, that a vehicle which cannot be operated is \"parked\" extends the term well beyond its ordinary meaning.

In my view, none of these vehicles were \"parked\" in the common sense of the term. In each circumstance, a person can ask themselves, if they had been given the key to drive the vehicle, whether they would consider the inoperable vehicle \"parked.\" I submit the reasonable answer would be no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, this understanding is entirely consistent with the parked-car exceptions contained in MCL 500.3106. \"Each exception pertains to injuries related to the character of a parked vehicle as a motor vehicle-characteristics which make it unlike other stationary roadside objects that can be involved in vehicle accidents.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1945891\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/411/633/\">\n    411 Mich. at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20N.W.2d%20544\">\n    309 N.W.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the characteristics of an inoperable motor vehicle are in fact\n   <em>\n    like\n   </em>\n   other stationary roadside objects that can be involved in vehicle accidents. While I understand that giving meaning to the term \"parked\" in this context is not an easy task, I think this Court ought to attempt to do so before resorting to the \"absurd results\" doctrine. In other words, given that the term \"parked\" obviously does not refer to inoperable vehicles, I cannot conclude that \" 'the absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in' \" ignoring the term \"parked.\" Scalia &amp; Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   (St. Paul: Thomson/West, 2012), p. 237, quoting\n   1 Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (2d ed.), \u00a7 427, p. 303.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Markman, J., joins the statement of Zahra, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
