Plaintiffs represent juvenile prisoners who claim that they were subjected to sexual assaults, sexual harassment, and degrading treatment by prison staff and adult prisoners. Plaintiffs, who are mostly juvenile male inmates serving terms of imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections (DOC) brought claims against the Governor, the DOC, the former and current heads of the DOC, and many prison wardens. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Civil Rights Act (CRA), MCL 37.2101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for sexual assaults, a sexually hostile prison environment, age discrimination, and other claims arising from the DOC's alleged failure to segregate\n   them from adult prisoners and failure to report abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

Defendant again moved for summary disposition, and the court again denied the motion, ruling that the CRA's 1999 amendment excluding prisoners from its purview violated equal protection and was unconstitutional. The court also denied defendants' claim of governmental immunity on the CRA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a split decision, adopting the constitutional analysis set forth in Judge BECKERING 's dissent in the prior appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge O'CONNELL issued a sharp dissent. He conducted a \"traditional constitutional analysis\" and concluded there was obviously a rational basis for the Legislature to exclude prisoners from the CRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   He questioned the majority's approach, wondering \"what, if any, law would pass such a contrived test ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also identified the primary error of the majority opinion as its adoption of plaintiffs' assertion that prisoners and nonprisoners are similarly situated in all aspects of this case. He concluded that \"[p]risoners and nonprisoners have never been similarly situated, are not currently similarly situated, and hopefully will never be similarly situated. That a rational basis exists for treating prisoners differently from free citizens is obvious.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that \"the deterrence of meritless lawsuits and the preservation\n   of scarce resources through the reduction of costs associated with resolving those lawsuits reflects a legitimate government interest,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Prisoners file an unprecedented number of lawsuits, and the cost to the state has skyrocketed. In one instance, a prisoner has filed 5,813 lawsuits and counting. The Legislature recognized that including prisons in the definition of \"public service,\" MCL 37.2301(b), is problematic. Prisoners could sue for the loss of their right to vote or for the loss of their Second Amendment right to carry a gun in prison.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The stark contrast between the opinions of Judge O'CONNELL and Judge BECKERING speaks volumes as to why leave to appeal should be granted in the instant case. This Court should have the final word on this significant issue of Michigan constitutional law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Further, the Court of Appeals majority's conclusion that Article 3 of the CRA operates as a waiver of governmental immunity under the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , presents great tension if not outright conflict with this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Hamed v. Wayne Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, we addressed \"whether Wayne County and its sheriff's department may be held vicariously liable for a civil rights claim under MCL 37.2103(i) based on a criminal act of a deputy sheriff committed during working hours but plainly beyond the scope of his employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the Court cautioned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Artful pleading would also allow a plaintiff to avoid governmental immunity under the [GTLA]. A school district, for example, could not be vicariously liable in tort for a teacher's sexual molestation of a student because the GTLA would bar the claim. However, if the plaintiff styled its claim as a CRA action, the school district could be vicariously liable under a theory of quid pro quo sexual harassment affecting public services. Plaintiff's preferred approach, under which public-service providers would be strictly liable for\n   <em>\n    precisely the same conduct\n   </em>\n   as that for which they would typically be immune, is inherently inconsistent with the Legislature's intent. If the Legislature had intended such a result, it should have clearly abrogated the common-law rule for purposes of the CRA.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As pointed out by Judge O'CONNELL , \"\n   <em>\n    Hamed\n   </em>\n   clearly holds that plaintiffs cannot avoid the GTLA by simply alleging a violation of the [CRA].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   And yet, \"to their innovative credit,\" plaintiffs appear to \"have artfully pleaded a cause of action exactly as the\n   <em>\n    Hamed\n   </em>\n   Court cautioned should not be done.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In sum, the instant case presents two questions of great jurisprudential significance that this Court should resolve.

In my opinion, this focus is directed at the wrong section of Const. 1963, art. 1, \u00a7 2. I believe that the analysis misses a more significant and dispositive issue. That is, whether the Legislature has authority, given the constitutional directive in Const. 1963, art. 1, \u00a7 2 pertaining to\n    <em>\n     all citizens\n    </em>\n    , to carve out a particular class of individuals and exclude them from the protections of the [CRA].\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    I would hold that the Legislature acted outside of its constitutional authority by removing prisoners from the scope of the [CRA] and thereby denying protection to all. Where the analysis in this case should start, and end, in my opinion, is with the idea that Const. 1963, art. 1, \u00a7 2 contains more than just the guarantee of equal protection of the laws; it contains a directive to the Legislature to implement legislation that protects the rights of\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    citizens.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    ... [T]he Legislature is not permitted, pursuant to the implementation language contained in Const. 1963, art. 1, \u00a7 2, to define the persons to whom civil rights are guaranteed. The Constitution already answers that question, unequivocally guaranteeing that legislation to protect civil rights must be extended to all, without reservation or limitation. Any implementation language contained in Const. 1963, art. 1, \u00a7 2 should not be construed as giving the Legislature \"the authority to circumvent the protections that the section guarantees.\" See\n    <em>\n     Midland Cogeneration\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     Venture Ltd.

If it did, just as the Court cautioned in\n    <em>\n     Midland Cogeneration\n    </em>\n    , the protection of \"any person\" would \"lose [its] strength\" and the Legislature would render such protection meaningless.

In ruling that the amendment of the CRA violated Const. 1963, art. 1, \u00a7 2, the Court of Appeals relied solely on the implementation clause of that provision, which states that \"[t]he legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.\" See\n    <em>\n     Does 11-18\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12558118\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/917/730/\">\n     323 Mich.

By doing so, the Court of Appeals ruled that there was an equal-protection violation without engaging in an equal-protection analysis. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12558118\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/917/730/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    That is, the Court of Appeals failed to apply the rational-basis standard (or any other standard of review recognized by the courts, for that matter) in addressing plaintiffs' equal-protection claim. The Court of Appeals' reasoning in this regard strikes me as a quite peculiar deviation from decades of equal-protection caselaw and would seem to warrant our review, particularly because \"[t]his Court has held that Michigan's equal protection provision is coextensive with the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\"\n    <em>\n     Shepherd Montessori Ctr.
