Dart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567504\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/243/#p243\">\n    418 P.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243-44 (Wyo. 2018). Respondent was publicly censured in Wyoming for failing to diligently pursue a client matter, failing to communicate with the client, and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wyo. R. Prof. Conduct 1.3, 1.4, 8.4(c). Several mitigating factors were also found in the Wyoming matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Respondent and the Director have entered into a stipulation for discipline. In it, respondent waives his procedural rights under\n   Rule 12(d), Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR), and unconditionally admits the allegations in the petition. The parties jointly recommend that the appropriate discipline is a public reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This court has independently reviewed the file and approves the jointly recommended disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Respondent Nahshon Joshua Dart is publicly reprimanded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Respondent shall pay $ 900 in costs pursuant to Rule 24, RLPR.\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
