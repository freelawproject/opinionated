We note that a similar issue was presented in\n   <em>\n    In re Parole of Layman\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 157104), which we remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted by order dated April 3, 2018, and which was decided in\n   <em>\n    In re Parole of Layman\n   </em>\n   , unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued September 20, 2018 (Docket No. 341112). Further, we note that a similar issue is presented in\n   <em>\n    In re Parole of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 159032), which we remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted by order dated June 12, 2019. In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Viviano, J. did not participate because he presided in the circuit court as the sentencing judge in the underlying criminal case.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
