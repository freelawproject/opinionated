The application for leave to appeal the June 6, 2019 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered and, pursuant to MCR 7.305(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we REVERSE the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We agree with the dissenting Court of Appeals judge that the Warren Charter provides for a single class of city council members, subject to the term limits of the greater of\n   three complete terms or 12 years in that office. See Warren Charter, \u00a7\u00a7 4.3(d) and 4.4(d). We also agree that, because it is not disputed that the challenged candidates will have served those maximum terms by the time of the 2019 election, they are ineligible under the Warren Charter to be certified as candidates for that election. Further, we agree with the dissenting judge that plaintiff's ability to show a clear legal right or a clear legal duty for purposes of mandamus does not depend upon the difficulty of the legal question presented.

It is always important to have\n   as little delay and confusion as possible in the organization of such bodies, which directly represent the people, and are assumed to have as correct a sense of official duty as any other representative bodies. Public policy does not favor needless disturbances in the tenure of office, and the practice referred to has commended itself generally, and is probably as little liable to error as any other popular administrative machinery.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, Michigan courts have regularly given effect to such provisions, declining to second-guess a determination made by such a legislative body.

Until an election is actually completed, and a winner announced, a challenged individual is merely a\n   <em>\n    candidate\n   </em>\n   , rather than a\n   <em>\n    member\n   </em>\n   , of a legislative body. See\n   <em>\n    Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (1974) (defining \"candidate\" as \"one that aspires to or is nominated or qualified for an office, membership, or award\" and \"member\" as \"one of the individuals composing a group\"). A mere candidate would have no grounds for claiming membership within a legislative body before an election has occurred. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Barry v. United States ex rel.

In the context of a post-election contest, these concerns make sense, as judicial review of an election leaves the legislative body in limbo. However, in the context of a pre-election challenge, judicial review can have the opposite effect, avoiding post-election challenges to an official who was ineligible to have his or her name included on the ballot in the first place. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 4.2 does not apply to a pre-election challenge. As a result, plaintiff was not required under \u00a7 4.2 to present his challenge to the Warren City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons articulated by the Court of Appeals dissent, we conclude that the city elections commission had a clear legal duty to perform the ministerial act of removing the names of the challenged contestants from the ballots.
