The circuit court affirmed his conviction, rejecting\n   defendant's statutory and First Amendment arguments. We granted leave to appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we now affirm.\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This matter arose out of defendant's interest in a criminal case involving Andrew Yoder, who had been charged with \"a [Department of Environmental Quality] violation\" for \"illegally draining wetlands.\" After hearing of the case, defendant decided to attend the pretrial hearing on November 4, 2015, because despite not actually knowing Yoder, the case \"piqu[ed] [his] interest.\" At the pretrial hearing, the court scheduled Yoder's trial for November 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant returned to the courthouse on the day set for trial and stood outside the front entrance to pass out pamphlets entitled, \"Your Jury Rights: True or False?\" that he had obtained from the Fully Informed Jury Association (FIJA) website. The pamphlet explains that jurors may vote according to their conscience. It further advises readers to be aware \"when it's your turn to serve\" that \"[y]ou may, and should, vote your conscience,\" that \"[y]ou cannot be forced to obey a 'juror's oath,' \" and that \"[y]ou have the right to 'hang' the jury with your vote if you cannot agree with other jurors!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although defendant handed or attempted to hand the pamphlet to a number of people that day, his charge for jury tampering resulted from his distribution of the pamphlet to Jennifer Johnson and Theresa DeVries, two people summoned to the court for jury selection. Johnson testified that she arrived at the courthouse unsure of where to go and that she approached defendant, thinking he was out front to \"direct traffic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although she could not remember who broached the subject, it was established between them that she was there for jury duty. Defendant proceeded to hand her a pamphlet \"and sort of pointed at the door.\" DeVries, on the other hand, testified that as she approached the courthouse, defendant specifically asked if she was there for jury selection. When she confirmed that she was, he handed her a pamphlet and said, \" 'Do you know what your rights are for being a jury [sic] on jury duty?' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was ultimately arrested and charged with obstruction of justice, MCL 750.505, and jury tampering. Yoder's case, however, never went to trial because the parties reached a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before trial in his own case, defendant moved the district court to dismiss both charges. The district court granted the motion with respect to obstruction of justice but declined to dismiss the jury-tampering charge. In so doing, the court rejected defendant's argument that the charge should be dismissed because the term \"juror,\" as used in MCL 750.120a(1), does not encompass individuals like Thompson and DeVries who were summoned for jury duty, but who were never actually selected or sworn, and took defendant's First Amendment argument under advisement. The circuit court affirmed the district court's decision, and defendant was denied leave to appeal by this Court,\n   <em>\n    People v. Wood\n   </em>\n   , unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered December 2, 2016 (Docket No. 334410), as well as by the Michigan Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    People v. Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20963\">\n    500 Mich. 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=891%20N.W.2d%20495\">\n    891 N.W.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant's two-day jury trial was held in district court. When asked why he had decided to distribute the pamphlets, defendant testified that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   learned a really interesting fact that 95 percent of all criminal cases in the United States, they are pled out before they go to trial. And so there was a-there was a\n   very high likelihood that the\n   <em>\n    Yoder\n   </em>\n   case was not going to go to trial, but then I also believed that there were going to be a lot of people around the\n   courthouse and it was going to give me a really good opportunity to educate as many people to hand out the pamphlets and get this information to their hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   He further stated that he did not know \"who was summoned as a potential juror\" and that he just handed the pamphlet \"[t]o anybody that would receive one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the prosecution rested, defendant renewed his motion to dismiss on First Amendment grounds, but the district court rejected the argument, reasoning that defendant \"was targeting jurors that were coming in that day\" and that there was \"a compelling interest in making sure for both the Prosecutor and the defense that there is a fair and impartial jury being chosen and that it is also very clear to me that [defendant] was very interested in that case and knew that the case was set for trial that day.\" Further, the court found it to be irrelevant that a trial never occurred in Yoder's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the close of trial, the district court provided the following instructions to the jury regarding the elements of jury tampering:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   First, that Jennifer Johnson and/or Theresa DeVries was a juror/were jurors in the case of\n   <em>\n    People v. Yoder\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, that the defendant willfully attempted to influence that juror by the use of argument or persuasion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Third, that the defendant's conduct took place outside of proceedings in open court in the trial of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A person acts willfully when he or she acts knowingly and purposefully.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The word \"juror\" includes a person who has been summoned to appear in court to decide the facts in a specific trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   An \"argument or persuasion\" can be oral or written.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant was ultimately convicted and then sentenced on July 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal in the circuit court, defendant argued that: (1) \"the State\" violated his First Amendment rights when he was \"arrested and charged because of the content his pamphlet contained,\" and such conduct would fail a strict-scrutiny analysis, (2) he was denied his right to due process because MCL 750.120a(1) is unconstitutionally vague, (3) the district court erred by defining the term \"juror\" to include persons summoned for jury duty, and (4) even if the district court's interpretation was correct, he should not have been convicted under MCL 750.120a(1) because Yoder's case never proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The circuit court issued its opinion and order on February 2, 2018, affirming defendant's conviction. In so doing, the court first rejected defendant's First Amendment argument, reasoning that the content of the pamphlet was not at issue because \"[t]he statute relates solely to when a person attempts to 'influence' a juror's decision, not to 'influence' them as to any topic whatsoever,\" and defendant willfully attempted to influence people he believed to be jurors. Secondly, the court concluded that because\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed.) defines \"juror\" to include those selected for jury duty, the juror-tampering statute applied. And lastly, the court ruled that no evidence existed to support defendant's argument that he was denied a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. DID DEFENDANT TAMPER WITH A \"JUROR?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant first argues that both trial courts erroneously defined \"juror,\" as used in MCL 750.120a(1), to include those summoned for jury duty. Specifically, he asserts that he could not have tampered with \"a juror\n   in any case\" under MCL 750.120a(1), because the term \"juror\" only\n   encompasses those selected and sworn for jury duty, and no jurors were ever selected in Yoder's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    PNC Nat'l Bank Ass'n v.

The definition of \"juror\" found in both lay and legal dictionaries in publication at the time the statute was enacted supports the trial courts' determination that the term, as used in MCL 750.120a(1), includes those summoned for jury duty, even if never selected nor sworn to serve on a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In deciding defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss, the district court relied in part on\n   <em>\n    Black's Law\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (Revised 4th\n   ed.), published in 1968, which defines \"juror\" as \"[o]ne member of a jury,\" and includes a usage note which states, \"The term is not inflexible, and besides a person who has been accepted and sworn to try a cause 'juror' may also mean a person selected for jury service.\" The same definition and usage note appears in\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (Deluxe 4th ed.), published in 1951 and cited by defendant in support of his argument. Moreover, the usage note is consistent with the definition of \"juror\" in a lay dictionary from 1955.\n   <em>\n    Webster's New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (1955), provides that a juror is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [o]ne of a number of men sworn to deliver a verdict as a body; specif.,\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   , a member of a jury, or one designated and summoned to serve on a jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Juror\n   </em>\n   \" is uniformly used by the jurists most familiar with the subject as including persons designated or ordered to be summoned as\n   <em>\n    jurors\n   </em>\n   . For stronger reasons, it would include them after they are summoned and have appeared in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Similar definitions for \"juror\" also appear in more current legal and lay dictionaries.\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed.) defines \"juror\" as both \"a member of a jury\" and \"a person summoned to serve on a jury[.]\" And in\n   <em>\n    Random House Webster's College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2001), \"juror\" is defined as \"a member of a jury,\" \"a member of the panel from which a jury is selected,\" or \"a person who has taken an oath or sworn allegiance.\" Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed.) states that a \"juror\" is \"[a] member of a jury; a person serving on a jury panel.\" The definition of \"jury panel\" directs the reader to \"VENIRE,\" which is defined as \"[a] panel of persons selected for jury duty and from among whom the jurors are to be chosen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, given the dictionary definitions from 1955 and\n   today, a \"juror\" under MCL 750.120a(1) includes a person summoned for jury duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant's assertions that MCL 750.120, M. Crim. JI 1.1, and MCR 6.412(B) support his argument regarding the definition of \"juror\" also fail. MCL 750.120,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which punishes jurors who accept bribes, provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Any person summoned as a juror or chosen or appointed as an appraiser, receiver, trustee, administrator, executor, commissioner, auditor, arbitrator or referee who shall corruptly take anything to give his verdict, award, or report, or who shall corruptly receive any gift or gratuity whatever, from a party to any suit, cause, or proceeding, for the trial or decision of which such juror shall have been summoned, or for the hearing or determination of which such appraiser, receiver, trustee, administrator, executor, commissioner, auditor, arbitrator, or referee shall have been chosen or appointed, shall be guilty of a felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant highlights the language \"[a]ny person summoned as a juror\" to assert that \"[i]f the legislature truly intended for jury tampering to include every person who has been summoned, it would have used the same language from the immediately preceding statute.\" But \"the specific rules of statutory construction are merely aids to interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

Looking at MCL 750.120 in its entirety, and considering the context in which the phrase is used, it is obvious to us that the Legislature simply used the phrase \"[a]ny person summoned\" to describe the act of being called for jury duty, just as it used a descriptive phrase for the rest of the positions listed in the\n   statute, i.e., \"[a]ny person ... chosen or appointed as[.]\" No comparable language was necessary or appropriate in\n   MCL 750.120a(1), as it applies only to jurors.

Defendant concedes that the government has a compelling interest in preventing jury tampering but states that he \"does not concede ... that the State has a compelling interest to criminalize [his] distribution of a juror rights pamphlet on a public sidewalk.\" Yet this argument is based on the premise, rejected outright by the jury, that defendant only intended to educate the general public with his pamphlet. The jury, in fact, determined the opposite, as it found that defendant had distributed the pamphlets in an attempt to willfully influence the decision of jurors in a particular case. We cannot overemphasize the importance of the jury's finding that defendant intended to influence two jurors summoned for Yoder's case. It is that specific level of intent that takes defendant's case out of the general pamphletting activities protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Further, we reject defendant's argument that the government does not have a compelling interest in preventing tampering with \"\n   <em>\n    potential jurors\n   </em>\n   .\" First, as we have already concluded, Johnson and DeVries were \"jurors\" for purposes of MCL 750.120a(1), not \"potential jurors.\" Second, there is no basis in the law that would allow us to recognize the government's interest in protecting the impartiality of jurors only after they have been selected and sworn, as juries are chosen from the pool of people summoned for jury duty. Jurors summoned for duty that are tampered with do not lose that taint if they end up on the jury. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant asserts specifically that the government exercised the most extreme option available in response to his conduct by arresting and prosecuting him and that the government could have instead employed valid time, place, and manner restrictions to regulate his distribution of pamphlets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the argument is based entirely on the rejected premise that defendant's distribution of the pamphlet was an attempt to educate the public rather than a willful attempt to influence the decision of jurors in Yoder's case. Second, although at the time defendant was arrested and charged it appears that certain government actors did not know of defendant's interest in the Yoder case and disapproved of the pamphlet's contents, the jury ultimately found defendant guilty of violating MCL 750.120a(1), which requires a specific intent to influence jurors. And the evidence presented at trial supported these findings. The law defendant was convicted under does not address the random distribution of pamphlets to the general public outside a courthouse. Instead, the Legislature was concerned with an individual's purposeful attempt to tamper with jurors, which is a compelling state interest. The statute also touches upon only a narrowly defined class of people and speech, i.e., those who purposefully communicate with specific jurors summoned to serve on a case with the intent to influence the decision of a juror. Defendant cannot rely on less restrictive means relating to an entirely hypothetical governmental interest not present in this case, and the government clearly has no obligation, through statute, regulation, or rule, to designate places and times during which an individual may engage in criminal behavior, speech-related or not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.

That requirement serves as a constitutional safeguard. As the Ninth Circuit reasoned in\n   <em>\n    Turney\n   </em>\n   , 400 F.3d at 1204, \"innocent\" conversations with jurors will rarely violate a jury-tampering statute because such communications will usually lack \"the requisite intent.\" If a person is not attempting to influence a juror's decision in a case, that person can freely communicate with the juror without violating MCL 750.120a(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In its amicus brief, the American Civil Liberties Union contends that \"[t]he state's interpretation of the jury tampering statute criminalizes a great variety of First Amendment protected expression,\" and provides it the following hypotheticals:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Consider whether a citizen committed to decriminalizing possession of controlled substances, passing out material regarding the issue outside a courthouse, would be charged with jury tampering if a prospective juror received the material. Would a group advocating for tort reform be prevented from protesting outside the court on days when products liability cases were being tried? Can the court prevent a women's rights organization from holding a rally when sex discrimination cases are on the docket?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Similarly, in its amicus brief, the Cato Institute posed hypotheticals involving op-ed writers, radio personalities, protesters with signs urging conviction, and a wife reminding her husband who has been selected for jury duty that he should not assume government witnesses are more credible than other witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Despite these concerns, the simple fact is that the conduct prosecuted in this case has no relationship to the eye-grabbing hypotheticals posed, all of which ignore the intent element of MCL 750.120a(1). For instance, an op-ed writer or radio personality expressing an opinion about a particular case or types of cases would likely not possess the intent necessary to be convicted of jury tampering under MCL 750.120a(1). There is a significant\n   distinction between an individual targeting jurors for a particular case and providing them with information calculated to influence how they conduct their duties as jurors, and an op-ed writer or protester who opines about the general propriety of a prosecution or civil matter, with no intent to influence a particular juror.

He testified about when he learned of the pamphlets, his interaction with defendant, and his subsequent conversation with 77th District Court Judge Peter M. Jaklevic. Further, he testified that Yoder's case was the only case scheduled for trial on the day in question. This testimony was cumulative to that of other witnesses, namely 77th District Court Judge Peter M. Jaklevic, and had little bearing on whether defendant actually violated\n   MCL 750.120a(1). Moreover, we see nothing to suggest that the jury would have reached a different result had it concluded that Magistrate Lyons was biased against defendant and not credible.

Next, given that the statute punishes \"attempts\" to influence a juror, a person need not successfully influence a juror's decision in order to be held criminally responsible. Additionally, Subsection (1) of MCL 750.120a is limited to proscribing conduct and communications entailing \"argument or persuasion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In defining the meaning of the term \"juror\" so as to accurately decipher the Legislature's intent, I believe it is vital to take into consideration the surrounding language and the context in which the term is used in MCL 750.120a(1). Under MCL 750.120a(1), argument or persuasion cannot be employed in a willful attempt to influence \"the decision of a juror in any case.\" In my view, the statutory phrase, \"the decision of a juror in any case,\" tells us all that we need to know in resolving this appeal, making it unnecessary and improper to resort to dictionary definitions of the term \"juror\" or to engage in a constitutional analysis. I conclude that a person is not \"a juror in a[ ] case,\" let alone a juror who has the capacity to make a \"decision,\" at the point in time that he or she has merely been summoned for jury duty and arrives at the courthouse. Rather, at the very earliest, one who has been selected as a venireperson, as distinguished from the larger group of individuals summoned for jury duty, might perhaps be characterized as a juror in a case, given that a venireperson would be subjected to voir dire for purposes of a particular case. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4187831\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/491/575/\">\n    491 Mich. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 n. 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=822%20N.W.2d%20124\">\n    822 N.W.2d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (differentiating a venire, which consists of a panel of potential jurors called into a courtroom, from a group of people generally summoned to appear for jury duty). In sum, I cannot conclude that MCL 750.120a is implicated until the trial process in a case is underway, starting with selection of the venire, if even at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This position is buttressed by the language in MCL 750.120a(1), which provides an exception for argument or persuasion that is \"part of the proceedings in open court\n   <em>\n    in the trial of the case\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) This language presupposes that a trial was indeed commenced. Moreover, MCL 750.120a(3) provides that Subsection (1) does not \"prohibit any\n   <em>\n    deliberating juror\n   </em>\n   from attempting to influence other members of the same jury by any proper means.\" (Emphasis added.) This language contemplates not only a trial, but a concluded trial, followed by jury deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Giving meaning to the words in MCL 750.120a(1), such that none of the words are treated as surplusage, and reading the words and phrases in the context of the whole statute, the Legislature plainly envisioned MCL 750.120a(1) being implicated only after the trial process has commenced. Jennifer Johnson and Theresa DeVries were simply not\n   <em>\n    jurors in the case\n   </em>\n   against Andrew Yoder when approached by defendant and given the juror-nullification literature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In further support and contrary to the majority's view, I believe that the Legislature's reference to a person \"summoned as a juror\" in MCL 750.120, absent comparable language in MCL 750.120a(1), reveals that the MCL 750.120a(1) reference to \"a juror\" was solely meant to encompass seated jurors and perhaps venirepersons. MCL 750.120 was enacted in 1931 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1931%20PA%20328\">\n    1931 PA 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and MCL 750.120a was added in 1955 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1955%20PA%2088\">\n    1955 PA 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, had the Legislature intended for MCL 750.120a(1) to cover a person summoned as a juror, it would and could have used the previously employed and more expansive language, yet the Legislature chose not to do so. \"Generally, when statutory language is included in one statutory section but omitted from another, we presume that the drafters\n   acted intentionally to include or exclude the language.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Robar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555556\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/328/#p121\">\n    321 Mich.

I find the majority's arguments rejecting application of this statutory principle strained and unavailing. I do wish to emphasize, however, that although I conclude that defendant did not commit a criminal misdemeanor under MCL 750.120a(1), I am not prepared to state, nor is it necessary to state, that a trial court, under its inherent and constitutional powers, cannot prohibit or control the possible tainting of summoned jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   I would reverse defendant's conviction. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
