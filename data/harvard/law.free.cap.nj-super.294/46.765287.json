Plaintiff claims that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the psychologist did state within the required degree of reliability that plaintiffs psychological disorders were caused by <em>her </em>falls. We agree and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Plaintiffs action sought damages for injuries she suffered from two falls on the steps of defendant\u2019s apartment complex. A five day trial was held before a jury at the conclusion of which the jury found in favor of plaintiff, but awarded her only $7000 in damages. Plaintiff moved for a new trial, or in the alternative, additur. Her motion was denied and she filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Suffice it to say that following the two falls plaintiff had extensive osteopathic and orthopedic care, including physical therapy, without substantial relief from the injuries suffered to her left side, neck and arm. Plaintiff then began seeing a psychologist, Dr. Inge Stafford, and was prescribed anti-depressants. Two weeks prior to trial, plaintiff was admitted to the mental health unit of Mountainside Hospital because of anxiety attacks and depression. At the time of trial, plaintiff had been classified as permanently disabled and was receiving Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Plaintiffs medical experts described her disability as permanent. However, the defense experts described plaintiffs prognosis as excellent because they found no objective evidence of injury. The defense contended that plaintiff was employable, and was suffering only from a low-grade form of rheumatoid arthritis entirely unrelated to the falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">A defense psychiatrist testified plaintiff was suffering from three conditions: somatoform disorder, the presentation of physical symptoms which are not supported by diagnostic' testing; histrionic personality disorder, where the individual presents symptoms in a highly theatrical manner; and chronic depression. He opined that plaintiff was able to move both arms and that her physical complaints were not supported by the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">In her video-taped deposition, Dr. Stafford testified that plaintiff was suffering from panic disorder with agoraphobia and also from a major clinical depression. With respect to the depression, Stafford concluded that it was the result of a \u201csingle episode.\u201d She also testified that three \u201cstressors\u201d \u2014 significant points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of pressure or trauma \u2014 contributed to plaintiffs emotional state. These were: the falls, which resulted in the chronic pain; plaintiffs inability to work; and her financial hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Plaintiffs counsel then undertook the following questioning of Dr. Stafford:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">As a psychologist, would you be able to state definitively what caused Miss Eckert\u2019s current psychological state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">A. No, I couldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">Q. And why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">A. Because we really don\u2019t talk about causation when we\u2019re talking about specifically anxiety disorders or, for that matter, most psychological or psychiatric illness. We can talk about predisposing factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">Q. Did Miss Eckert exhibit any predisposing factors for her current condition? A. I specifically questioned her as to a history of anxiety disorders in her family and/or a history of major depression in her family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">And she denied that that was the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">Q. And so to answer my question, did you find any predisposing factors from your interview with Miss Eckert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">A. None that I could identify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-16\">Other than \u2014 are there other types of factors besides predisposing factors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-17\">A. We can also talk of precipitating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">And these are, let\u2019s say, triggers or immediately precede the onset of symptoms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-19\">Q. Would a fall and resultant injury classify as a precipitating factor in Miss Eckert\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-20\">A. Yes, it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-21\">Q. What about financial hardship that may have resulted from an inability to work, would that classify as a precipitating factor in Miss Eckert\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-22\">A. Yes, it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-23\">Q. Are you then able to say that it\u2019s more probable than not that her fall and injury and resultant economic hardship has caused her current psychological state? A. Again, I can\u2019t talk about causation. But X can \u2014 I certainly would say that there is a strong relationship and connection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>At the start of the trial, in granting defendants\u2019 motion to preclude Dr. Stafford\u2019s deposition from being presented as part of plaintiffs case-in-chief, the trial court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADD\">the standards set forth by the eases are that the standard has to be that it is based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty and/or probability, in this particular circumstance, that Dr. Stafford takes the position that she can\u2019t talk about causation. Causation isn\u2019t in her vocabulary, and therefore, she can\u2019t say whether this condition was caused by the fall or not caused by the fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">What I have before me is Dr. Stafford, apparently based on her deposition, is taking the position that she is not able, and is unwilling to assess reasonable medical probabilities to this condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Plaintiff later requested that she be allowed to rebut the defense psychiatrist\u2019s testimony with Dr. Stafford\u2019s deposition. The trial judge initially withheld his ruling, and at the close of defendants\u2019 ease, plaintiff again sought to introduce Dr. Stafford\u2019s videotaped deposition to rebut the defense testimony. Plaintiffs counsel noted that Dr. Stafford refused to appear in court. The judge ruled that while plaintiff could not use the deposition for expert testimony, portions could be used as factual testimony. After a recess, plaintiffs counsel announced that she had decided not to read the small portion of the deposition which the judge would allow because she saw no benefit in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The parties had agreed that the video-taped deposition of Dr. Stafford could be used in place of her in-court testimony, if her testimony was otherwise admissible. There is no dispute that Dr. Stafford was qualified as an expert. What is in dispute is the sufficiency of the psychologist\u2019s opinion with respect to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">In New Jersey, with regard to causation, it has been held \u201cthat medical-opinion testimony must be couched in terms of reasonable medical probability; opinions as to possibility are inadmissible.\u201d <em>Johnesee v. Stop &amp; Shop Companies, Inc., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 431, 416 A.2d 956 (App.Div.1980). Thus, generally the foundation required for a medical expert witness\u2019s opinion as to the cause of the patient\u2019s injuries is that the causal connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>rises to the level of a reasonable medical probability. <em>Bondi v. Pole, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 240, 587 A.2d 285 (App.Div.1991). Failure to provide such a causal connection can lead to the conclusion that the expert\u2019s statement is nothing more than a \u201cnet opinion.\u201d <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In <em>Aspiazu v. Orgera, </em>205 <em>Conn. </em>623, 535 A.2d 338 (1987), a worker brought a personal injury action against a co-worker, and the issue on appeal was whether a treating psychiatrist\u2019s written report concerning the plaintiffs condition should have been excluded because it failed to establish causation to the degree of certainty legally required. <em>Id. </em>535 A.2d at 342. The Supreme Court of Connecticut noted that the problem with the report was that it made \u201cno statement expressly concluding that the alleged assault was responsible for the plaintiffs treatment for mental distress.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, the court held that it was not necessary for the expert to use the \u201c \u2018talismanic\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018magical words represented by the phrase \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quotation-cite omitted). Rather, what was needed was for the trial court to be persuaded that \u201cthe doctor was reasonably confident of the relationship between the plaintiffs injury and his psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Connecticut court reasoned that the report \u201ccould reasonably have been interpreted by the jury ... to meet the acceptable standard of reliability ...\u201d because it \u201ccharacterized the plaintiffs condition as \u2018[p]ost-traumatic neurosis\u2019 [and the] jury could reasonably have found that the trauma referred to [was] the alleged assault,\u201d which plaintiff on direct examination made clear was the reason he sought psychiatric help. <em>Ibid. </em>The court concluded: \u201cA fair reading of the report as a whole makes it clear that the alleged assault was the precipitating event that created the condition for which [the psychiatrist] treated the plaintiff....\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\"><em>In </em>this case, plaintiff made it clear in her testimony that the reason she sought the aid of a psychologist was as a consequence of the injuries and hardship she suffered from her falls. Dr. Stafford\u2019s deposition demonstrates that the two falls and conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>quent hardships suffered by plaintiff were the precipitating events leading to plaintiff seeking treatment. Plaintiffs psychologist noted that plaintiff was suffering from a major depression, \u201csingle episode,\u201d because it appeared that this was the first time that she was suffering from depression. She added that plaintiff had no \u201cpredisposing factors\u201d for depression, that the falls and injuries were a \u201cprecipitating factor\u201d with respect to plaintiffs condition, and that there was a \u201cstrong relationship and connection\u201d between plaintiffs falls and injuries and her psychological state.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In <em>Matott v. Ward, </em>48 <em>N.</em>Y.2d 455, 423 N.Y.S.2d 645, 399 N.E.2d 532 (1979), the New York Court of Appeals observed that the causation requirement \u201cis not to be satisfied by a single verbal straight jacket alone, but, rather, by any formulation from which it can be said that the witness\u2019 \u2018whole opinion\u2019 reflects an acceptable level of certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>423 N.Y.S.2d at 647, 399 N.E.2d at 534 (quotation-eite omitted). The court further noted that this \u201cneed for flexibility\u201d stems from the fact that \u201c[tjraining in the inexact and continually expanding science of medical investigation implants in its initiates a reluctance to quantify their judgments as to cause and effect.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court aptly stated it must take into account the fact that because the cause and effect relationship, by its very nature, may not be established with scientific certainty, the reservations expressed by the doctor \u201ccan be seen as candid indications of the limitations inherent in medical opinion and, as such, a useful revelation to the jury in reaching its own conclusion as to the merits of the parties opposing contentions on causation. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>423 <em>N.Y.S.</em>2d at 648-49, 399 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">It was error to exclude the testimony of Dr. Stafford for lack of a \u201ccorrect\u201d response on causation. This error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Not only was the psychologist\u2019s testimony an integral part of plaintiffs affirmative case, but because the deposition testimony was excluded the defense psychiatrist\u2019s testimony went before the jury unchallenged. The jury heard only that plaintiff was suffering from a somatoform disorder, in which her physical symptoms were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>supported by objective testing, and a histrionic personality disorder, whereby her symptoms were presented in a highly theatrical manner. Thus, the jury was led to conclude that plaintiff was either making up or exaggerating her complaints. Dr. Stafford\u2019s deposition might well have persuaded the jury that plaintiffs complaints and disability had a valid basis and were caused by the trauma of the falls and their aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial as to damages only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
