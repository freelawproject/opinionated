Pursuant to the agreement, plaintiff sought reimbursement from defendants for expenses including attorney\u2019s fees. In due course, defendants cross-moved for dismissal of the complaint for failure to give a pre-action notice of claim for legal fees pursuant to <em>R. </em>L20A-6 and for referral of the fee dispute to the District Fee Arbitration Committee under <em>R. </em>L20A-2. In his written opinion, the Law Division judge denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment and granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">The motion judge rejected plaintiffs argument that defendants were contractually bound to reimburse plaintiff for whatever legal fees plaintiff paid as long as plaintiff paid them in \u201cgood faith.\u201d The judge found that the provision in the agreement entitling the surety \u201cto charge for any and all disbursements made by it in good faith ...\u201d was, in his words, \u201ccontrary to the policy set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>by the Supreme Court (which has the ultimate authority to regulate payment of attorney\u2019s fees) in <em>R. </em>l:20A-6 which allows the party whose actions necessitated the legal fees and who is paying the legal fees to request fee arbitration.\u201d The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">Rule l:20A-2 grants jurisdiction to the Fee Committee to arbitrate this matter. Thus, plaintiff was obligated, pursuant to <em>R. </em>l:20A-6, to give defendant a PreAction Notice of its intent to sue for legal fees. Failure to give this notice and to allege the giving of the notice in the complaint requires dismissal of the claim for reimbursement for legal fees. <em>R. </em>l:20A-6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">After denial of its motion for reconsideration, plaintiff filed this appeal from the October 25, 1994 order granting reimbursement only for the uncontested expenses and denying reimbursement for legal fees. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">At the time plaintiffs action was instituted, <em>R. </em>l:20A-2, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">Fee Committees shall have jurisdiction to arbitrate third-parly legal matters where the lawyer is retained by one other than the client but where the client is specifically billed for those services, except that Fee Committees shall not have jurisdiction of such cases where one party to the settlement of a legal action agrees to pay for the legal fees of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">This provision was amended effective March 1, 1995 to provide in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">(a) Generally. Each Fee Committee shall, pursuant to these rules, have jurisdiction to arbitrate fee disputes between clients and attorneys. <em>Fee Committees shall also have jurisdiction to arbitrate disputes in which a person other than the client is legally bound to pay for the legal services, except that Fee Committees shall not have jurisdiction of such cases if the obligation arises out of the settlement of a legal action.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\"><em>[R. </em>l:20A-2; Emphasis Added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">The official <em>Comment </em>to the 1995 revision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-13\">R. l:20A-2 has been rewritten for clarity. Paragraph (a) states the general jurisdictional powers of fee committees. In addition, the rule now makes clear that the decision of the fee arbitration committee is final and binding on the parties, and that, pursuant to R. l:20A-3(c), the Board, alone, has appellate jurisdiction in these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-14\">Paragraph (a) states initially the general rule that only fee disputes between clients and attorneys are subject to arbitration, with the exception of third-party legal matters where one other than the lawyer\u2019s client is legally responsible to pay the legal fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-15\">[Official Comment to 1995 Revision, <em>R. </em>l:20A-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The 1995 revision clarifying the earlier provision is helpful in interpreting the earlier rule. <em>See Cobo v. Market Transition Facility, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 680 A.2d 1103 (App.Div.1996). We, therefore, accept the premise that <em>R. </em>L20A-2 grants jurisdiction to the Fee Committees in matters such as this. <em>Cf. Andre Construction Assoc., Inc. v. Catel, Inc., </em>293 <em>N. J.Super. </em>452, 681 A.2d 121 (Law Div.1996). However, this does <em>not </em>compel the conclusion that fee arbitration is mandatory in all circumstances and that this non-attorney-plaintiff was obligated to give defendants pre-action notice of its intent to sue for legal fees. <em>See R. </em>L20A-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Merely because the Fee Committees have jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that notice and/or arbitration are mandatory. We conclude that arbitration is not mandatory in these circumstances. Under <em>R. </em>l:20A-3(a)(l), not substantially changed in the 1995 Revision, \u201c[a] fee dispute shall be arbitrated only on the written request of a client or a third party defined by Rule l:20A-2.\u201d We assume defendants meet this definition. However, it is <em>R. </em>L20A-6, entitled <em>Pre-Action Notice to Client, </em>that imposes upon attorneys the <em>requirement </em>of notice of the <em>client\u2019s </em>right to require arbitration. Under this provision, even as revised in 1995, it is exclusively in the client\u2019s control as to whether there will be arbitration. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>1.-20A-6. The requirement of pre-action notice is imposed <em>only </em>against a lawyer instituting a suit, which this plaintiff is not. <em>See In re LiVolsi, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>576, 600, 428 A.2d 1268 (1981). We, therefore, conclude it was error to dismiss plaintiffs action for failure to give pre-action notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Lastly, we reject plaintiffs argument that as long as the expenditure for legal fees was made in good faith, its reasonableness cannot be placed in issue in an action to compel reimbursement. We do not interpret the indemnity agreement to compel that result as such a conclusion is disfavored. <em>See Cohen v. Radio-Elec. Officers, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 645 A.2d 1248 (App.Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>1994). Moreover, we are of the view that our courts should reject the view that under an indemnity agreement the obligor has no defense and that even truly unreasonable payments must be reimbursed as long as they are made in good faith. Failure to oversee the reasonableness of such awards could result in inequities if not promote corruption. <em>See Perkins v. Thompson, </em>551 So.2d 204 (Miss.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs action and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
