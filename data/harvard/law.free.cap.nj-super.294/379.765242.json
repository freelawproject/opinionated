Rutgers appeals from the grant of summary judgment to NJM dismissing Rutgers\u2019 declaratory judgment action seeking equitable pro-rata contribution from NJM and requiring its participation in arbitration. Rutgers claims entitlement to such relief under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-11 (section 11) and argues that enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 (section 4.2) has no effect on NJM\u2019s obligations under section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">NJM defends the summary judgment under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.2, contending that our opinion in <em>USF &amp; G v. Industrial Indem. Co., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 624 A.2d 1014 (App.Div.1993), is distinguishable because the injured person there was not a named insured under either policy (whereas here she is a named insured under the Rutgers policy) and that, in any event, our approval in <em>USF &amp; G </em>of <em>Cokenakes v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 313-14, 505 A.2d 243 (Law Div.1985), was erroneous as a matter of policy and legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">NJM contends that section 4.2 makes the named insured\u2019s carrier solely responsible unless the PIP benefits are exhausted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Rutgers argues that the section merely assures the obligation of the primary carrier to pay PIP benefits while the question of contribution is arbitrated. In <em>USF &amp; G, supra, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382, 624 A.2d 1014, decided after the 1990 amendment to section 4.2, we held that a primary carrier may seek contribution under section 11 from \u201cother available PIP coverage\u201d and that the enactment of section 4.2 did not affect that obligation. We held that \u201cthe purpose of \u00a7 4.2 was to identify a source for the <em>immediate </em>payment of PIP benefits, thereby insulating covered persons from delays caused by squabbles between insurers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 624 A.2d 1014. We adhere to that holding and conclude that <em>USF &amp; G </em>governs even when the insured party is a named insured, notwithstanding that section 4.2 expressly provides that the PIP \u201ccoverage of the named insured shall be the primary coverage for the named insured....\u201d In these circumstances that carrier is \u201cprimary\u201d but may nevertheless seek contribution under section 11 even though the PIP payments did not exceed the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
