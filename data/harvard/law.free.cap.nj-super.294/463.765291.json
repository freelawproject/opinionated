On April 12, 1991, at a time when plaintiff was absent from the nursing home, Dolores P. Koch, a registered nurse, noticed that one of plaintiffs patients seemed to be in acute distress. After first unsuccessfully attempting to telephone plaintiff and his substitute physician, Koch consulted with one of her supervisors, who told her to transfer the patient to a hospital. While Koch was waiting for the ambulance to transport the patient, plaintiff arrived at the nursing home. Upon learning that the nursing staff had decided to transfer his patient to a hospital without consulting him, plaintiff became very angry. He went to Koch\u2019s work station, grabbed her arm and steered her into the nurses\u2019 lounge. According to Koch, plaintiff pointed a finger in her face, while continuing to hold her arm and walk forward, and began screaming at her. Plaintiff told Koch that the patient was chronically ill, that nothing could be done for him in the hospital and that she would be held personally responsible for his hospital bill. As this encounter escalated, Koch continued to retreat, eventually backing into the edge of a table and bending over backwards. According to Koch, this movement caused a serious injury to her back, including a herniated disc. Koch also alleges that plaintiff slapped her on the shoulder which caused a further injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Koch subsequently filed a personal injury action against plaintiff, alleging both negligence and assault and battery and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiff demanded that defendant Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange (MIIX), with which he had a medical malpractice policy, and defendant Aetna Life and Casualty Insurance Company (Aetna), with which he had a homeowners policy, provide a defense and indemnify him for any judgment that might be entered. Both insurers denied coverage, prompting this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The case was brought before the trial court by cross-motions for summary judgment. The court concluded in a written opinion that Aetna was entitled to summary judgment because the incident fell within the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion of its homeowners policy. However, the court granted plaintiff summary judgment against MIIX, concluding that the incident and Koch\u2019s alleged injuries \u201carose out of the rendering of professional services.\u201d The court entered an order requiring MIIX to defend the action and to indemnify plaintiff for any judgment for negligence that might be entered. The order further provided that MIIX had no obligation to indemnify plaintiff for punitive damages and that MIIX would be required to indemnify plaintiff for a judgment for assault and battery \u201conly if a jury determines that [plaintiffs] alleged intentional acts resulted in improbable and unintentional consequences to Nurse Koch.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>MIIX appeals from the order requiring it to defend and indemnify plaintiff and plaintiff appeals from the summary judgment in favor of Aetna. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The medical malpractice policy MIIX issued to plaintiff provides coverage for \u201cinjury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render ... professional services\u201d and defines \u201cprofessional services\u201d to mean \u201cservices requiring specialized knowledge and mental skill in the practice of the profession.\u201d There is no reported New Jersey decision construing this policy language.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we must consider prior decisions in this State construing similar language in other kinds of insurance policies as well as decisions in other jurisdictions construing this standard provision of a medical malpractice policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Preliminarily, we note that \u201c[wjhen members of the public purchase policies of insurance they are entitled to the broad measure of protection necessary to fulfill their reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 337, 495 A.2d 406 (1985) (quoting <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 170 A.2d 22 (1961)). Consequently, any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be resolved in the insured\u2019s favor. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The practice of medicine includes the diagnosis of a patient\u2019s condition and the determination of whether that condition requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>hospitalization. Thus, if plaintiff himself had decided to transfer his patient to a hospital and the patient or the patient\u2019s family had filed a claim based upon that decision, plaintiff clearly would have been entitled to coverage under the MIIX policy for malpractice in \u201cthe rendering of professional services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">However, the MIIX policy provides coverage not only for claims of malpractice in the direct \u201crendering of professional services\u201d but also for any other claim \u201carising out of\u2019 the rendering of professional services. The phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 has been defined broadly in other insurance coverage decisions to mean conduct \u201coriginating from,\u201d \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 or having a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with the activity for which coverage is provided. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Cos., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 312 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152, 319 A.2d 732 (1974); <em>Franklin Mut. Ins. Co. v. Security Indem. Ins. Co., </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 340-41, 646 A.2d 443 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>185, 652 A.2d 173 (1994); <em>see also Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City, Inc. v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 157-59, 671 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.1996); <em>Minkov v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 516, 149 A.2d 260 (App.Div.1959). Consequently, if plaintiff had consulted with Koch in deciding whether to transfer a patient to the hospital and negligently stepped on her toe during the course of that consultation, any resulting injury could reasonably be said to \u201coriginate from,\u201d \u201cgrow out of\u2019 or have a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with plaintiffs rendering of professional services and thus fall within the coverage of the MIIX policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Although plaintiffs discussion with Koch may have had a less direct relationship to his professional services than this hypothetical, we are nevertheless satisfied that it \u201carose out of\u2019 the rendering of those services. When plaintiff accosted Koch, the patient was still in the nursing home waiting for the arrival of the ambulance. Consequently, plaintiffs actions could be viewed as an effort to prevent the patient\u2019s transfer to the hospital until after plaintiff had had an opportunity to determine his condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and to speak with members of his family.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, since plaintiff had a substantial number of other patients in the Crest Haven Nursing Home, he had a direct interest in the nursing home\u2019s general practices and procedures relating to the transfer of patients. Therefore, plaintiffs discussion with Koch regarding the nursing staff decision to transfer his patient to a hospital \u201coriginated from,\u201d \u201cgrew out of\u2019 and had a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with his rendering of professional services to patients residing in the nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">This conclusion is not affected by the fact that plaintiff grabbed Koch by the arm, directed her into another room and screamed at her. Coverage under the MIIX policy is established by the existence of a substantial nexus between the subject matter of the plaintiffs discussion with Koch and his professional practice rather than by plaintiffs conduct during that discussion. Indeed, our courts have held that conduct which has a substantial nexus to an insured activity may be found to \u201carise out of\u2019 that activity even if it is unlawful. In <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Cos., supra, </em>the Court held that automobile policies insuring against liability from \u201cbodily injury ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of [an] automobile\u201d provided coverage to the driver and passenger in a car who were sued by a bicyclist injured by a stick the passenger had thrown out of the car. Rejecting the insurance carriers\u2019 argument that the bicyclist\u2019s injuries did not result from the use of the automobile but rather from the passenger\u2019s intentional act of throwing the stick, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">[W]e do not agree that the words \u201carising out of the * * use\u201d require or justify the interpretation that before coverage exists it must appear that the injury is a direct and proximate result, in a strict legal sense, of the use of the automobile \u2014 If such a meaning was intended .... it is difficult to understand why a phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>which clearly conveyed the idea of proximate causation, such as \u201ccaused by\u201d or \u201cresulting from,\u201d was not employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">[T]he phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 must be interpreted in a broad and comprehensive sense to mean \u201coriginating from\u201d or \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 the use of the automobile. So interpreted, there need be shown only a substantial nexus between the injury and the use of the vehicle in order for the obligation to provide coverage to arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 37-38, 312 A.2d 664.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Similarly, plaintiffs discussion with Koch arose out of the rendering of his professional services even though he had physical contact with her during the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Although the decisions in other jurisdictions construing medical malpractice coverage for \u201c[ijnjury arising out of the rendering of ... professional services,\u201d have not focussed upon the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d they have generally construed malpractice policies liberally to extend coverage to various kinds of claims brought by parties other than individual patients. <em>See, e.g., Pacific Indem. Co. v. Linn, </em>766 <em>F.2d </em>754, 761-62 (3d Cir.1985) (malpractice insurer must defend personal injury claims against doctor arising out of alleged bad advice in a diet book); <em>Geddes v. Tri-State Ins. Co., </em>264 Cal-App.2d 181, 70 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>183, 185 (1968) (malpractice insurer must defend slander suit brought against psychiatrist who made disparaging remarks about another psychiatrist during a consultation with a third psychiatrist); <em>Mellow v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>567 A.2d 367, 368 (R.I.1989) (malpractice insurer must defend invasion of privacy suit based on physician\u2019s release of blood-alcohol test results that were subsequently obtained by a newspaper); <em>compare Inglewood Radiology Med. Group, Inc. v. Hospital Shared Servs., Inc., </em>217 <em>Cal.App.</em>3d 1366, 266 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>501, 503 (1989) (malpractice insurer has no duty to defend a doctor\u2019s suit for wrongful termination of hospital privileges since \u201cthe decision to terminate employment is a business or administrative decision,\u201d rather than a professional service); <em>see generally, </em>Debra E. Wax, Annotation, <em>Coverage and Exclusions of Liability or Indemnity Policy on Physicians, Surgeons and Other Healers, </em>33 <em>A.L.R.4th </em>14 (1984). The primary type of ease in which courts generally have found no coverage under the same or similar policy language have been ones involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ing sexual assaults upon patients. <em>See, e.g., Roe v. Federal Ins. Co. </em>412 <em>Mass. </em>43, 587 N.E.2d 214, 217 (1992); <em>Niedzielski v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>134 <em>N.H. </em>141, 589 A.2d 130, 131 (1991); <em>but see St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Jacobson, </em>48 F.3d 778, 782 (4th Cir.1995) (physician covered under \u201cprofessional services\u201d clause where liability arose out of artificial insemination of his own sperm into patients); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Asbury, </em>149 <em>Ariz. </em>565, 720 P.2d 540, 542 (Ct.App.1986) (coverage provided for alleged sexual assault by gynecologist which occurred while he was rendering professional services); <em>Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, supra. </em>However, where an alleged sexual assault has arisen out of the performance of medical services, such as where a psychiatrist has engaged in sexual relations with a patient as a purported cure for \u201ctransference phenomenon,\u201d in which the patient becomes enamored with her therapist, the courts have found coverage. <em>See, e.g., St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>164 <em>Ga.App. </em>215, 296 S.E.2d 126 (1982); <em>Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Kambly, </em>114 <em>Mich.App. </em>683, 319 <em>N.W.2d </em>382 (1982). Most significantly, the out-of-state cases recognize that there are \u201cmany situations,\u201d such as those involving a consultation with another health care provider, \u201cwhere a medical practitioner would be rendering professional services, but not rendering those services directly to a patient.\u201d <em>Inglewood Radiology Medical Group, Inc. v. Hospital Shared Servs., Inc., supra, </em>266 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 503 n. 4. Therefore, the decisions in other jurisdictions support our conclusion that the policy MIIX issued to plaintiff should be construed to provide coverage for the pending action arising out of his altercation with Koch.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We turn finally to plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of his complaint against Aetna. The liability sections of the Aetna homeowners policy include a series of exclusions, one of which is for any bodily injury \u201carising out of the rendering or failing to render professional services.\u201d The language of this exclusion is nearly identical to the basic coverage provision of the MIIX medical malpractice policy. The evident intent of such a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>in a homeowners policy is to exclude coverage for claims that ordinarily would be covered by professional malpractice insurance. <em>See Frankenmuth Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kompus, </em>135 <em>Mich.App. </em>667, 354 <em>N.W.2d </em>303, 311-12 (1984); <em>Fire Ins. Exchange v. Alsop, </em>709 P.2d 389, 390 (Utah 1985). Since we have previously concluded that Koch\u2019s claim against plaintiff is such a claim, it comes within the \u201cprofessional services\u201d exclusion of the Aetna policy. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion upon which the trial court based its dismissal of plaintiffs action against Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> Plaintiff did not cross-appeal from this part of the order. However, MIIX argues that if the trial court\u2019s declaration that its policy provides coverage to plaintiff for Koch's claim is affirmed, the case should nevertheless be remanded to the trial court \"for a determination, to be made after the trial of the Underlying Action, as to whether the extent of Ms. Koch's injuries were improbable or unintended by [plaintiff].\" We see no need for such a remand. Even if the trial court in the Koch case determines that the question whether plaintiff intended to cause Koch's injuries should not be submitted to the jury, see <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>18, 25, 483 A.2d 402 (1984); <em>Burd </em>v. <em>Sussex Mut. Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 389-90, 267 A.2d 7 (1970), a jury verdict of no cause of action on Koch's assault and battery claim would make it unnecessary for the court to decide this question. If the trial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Koch's complaint leaves this question unresolved, MIIX may seek appropriate relief at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\"> A panel of this court recently held, with Judge Keefe dissenting, that a medical malpractice policy providing coverage for any \" medical incident\u2019 arising out of ... supplying professional services\u201d provides coverage for a claim based on an alleged sexual assault even though the policy contained an exclusion for \"injury resulting from [the] performance of a criminal act.\u201d <em>Princeton </em>Ins. <em>Co. </em>v. Chunmuang, 292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 354, 678 A.2d 1143 (App.Div.1996).
