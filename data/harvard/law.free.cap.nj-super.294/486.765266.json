While trespassing on Mischief Night, fourteen-year old plaintiff, Samuel Vega, fell into an air/light shaft between two three-story apartment buildings owned by defendants. In granting summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that the air/light shaft did not pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d because it was an \u201cobvious\u201d danger. Concluding that the fall was an \u201cact of youthful recklessness and bravado\u201d on Samuel\u2019s part, the judge found that plaintiffs failed to satisfy clauses (b) and (c) of \u00a7 339. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Defendants owned two contiguous multiple-family dwellings on State Street in Perth Amboy; Piedilato owned number 685, and the Puffs owned number 687. Both buildings are three stories, approximately forty-feet high at them respective rooftops. The roofs are relatively flat, pitched only for drainage. The structures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>abut at the front and rear of the buildings, but an air/light shaft separates them in the middle of the common property line. The air/light shaft is irregular in shape and approximately fifteen-feet long. At its greatest width, the air shaft is approximately fifteen feet across. A twenty-inch high parapet surrounds the air/light shaft on 687 State Street; there is no parapet on the 685 State Street side of the shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Samuel was nearly fifteen years old on the evening of October 30, 1991, \u201cMischief Night.\u201d He and two friends, Manuel Rodriguez and Jose Rodriguez, decided to throw tomatoes and eggs at cars from the roof of the Puff building (# 687), in which Manuel lived. Vandals had damaged the locking mechanism on the entrance to the Piedilato building (# 685), enabling the boys to enter it without difficulty. They gained access to the Piedilato roof via a missing roof-hatch door, breaking through a plastic bag which covered the opening. Once on the roof of the Piedilato building, they simply stepped onto the Puff building. After the boys ran out of eggs and tomatoes they left the roof to retrieve more. They returned to the roofs and were joined by another friend, Omar Pichardo. Omar left before the accident happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">All of the boys, including Samuel, had crossed back and forth between the two roofs several times during the evening. Manuel stated that they crossed at the front and rear of the air/light shaft in order to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Joseph Triano, when asked whether the air/ light shaft would have been observable to Samuel, testified \u201cI can only presume that since they entered the roof at 685 and went to the roof of 687 that the air shaft is very obvious and that they would know that it was there.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 other expert, Herbert Feist, described the air/light shaft as \u201cfairly substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">After being on the Puff roof for approximately three hours, Manuel spotted a police car and yelled to Samuel and Jose that the police were coming. They all ran to escape. According to Manuel, in order to avoid being seen from the rear of the building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>he and Samuel decided to jump over the air/light shaft near the middle of the roofs. Manuel\u2019s deposition testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALzu\">Q Where did you run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">A We were trying to jump that big hole to the other building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Q So you were going to try and jump over the big hole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">Q Why didn\u2019t you go to the front or the back where the roofs were touching? A We went to the back, the police was coming, so we were like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s coming.\u201d So the big hole, we jumped that big hole. We were scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">Q So after you saw the police coming did you start running toward the back of the building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">A No, to the middle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">Q You started running toward the middle of the building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">Q Which way did [Samuel] start running after you told him the cops were coming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">A To the big hole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">Q He started running toward the big hole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">Q So you were right behind him. When he got to the big hole what did he do? A He hit a bump, I don\u2019t know, a little bump, and he just fell down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-17\">Q Well, I thought you said he was going to try and jump over the big hole. A He was going to try, but he felt like a bump, so he fell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">Q So what you saw was [Samuel] tried to leap from the roof on the left of this picture to the roof on the right, but when he jumped he got his foot caught right here where you drew the X? [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWg\">A Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-19\">Samuel sustained severe injuries from the fall, including brain damage. As a result of his injuries, he was unable to be deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">The thrust of the deposition testimony and written reports of plaintiffs\u2019 experts was that there should have been a roof barrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>separating the two buildings; the Piedilato building lacked adequate security and failed to comply with pertinent state and federal codes; and a high fence should have been eonstiucted around the air/light shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Piedilato testified at his deposition that he was aware people were gaining access to his roof, and admitted that his tenants had told him that children were playing there. He called the police in response to these complaints and \u201ccut the bottom two rungs off the [fire escape] ladder so it would be more difficult to pull it down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Wayne Puff denied any knowledge that children had been using his roof, but acknowledged he was concerned about drug activity on the rooftops. To prevent this, he installed locks on the entrance doors and roof hatch. He made monthly inspections of the building, including the roof. As a result of the inspections, he knew that the Piedilato building was not maintained as well as his, and that his roof could be accessed easily from the Piedilato roof. He did not, however, walk across to inspect that roof and therefore had no knowledge of the type of security provided for the Piedilato building.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In granting summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that plaintiffs failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case under the <em>Restatement, </em>\u00a7 339, the so-called infant-trespasser rule. The judge determined that there were fact questions as to whether Piedilato knew or should have known that children were playing on his rooftop. By contrast, the judge noted that Wayne Puff had denied knowledge, and declined to adopt plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the Puffs had a duty to discover whether or not children were trespassing on the rooftop.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">However, the judge found that, although the air/light shaft \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d posed a risk of serious bodily injury or death to children, that risk was not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 339(b). According to the judge, the risk of harm posed by a fall from the roof was so obvious that \u201ca 14-year-old child can be expected to appreciate\u201d it. He incorporated comment i of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Restatement, </em>which provides that liability \u201cdoes not extend to those conditions the existence of which is obvious even to children and the risk of which should be fully realized by them.\u201d <em>Re statement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 339, comment i. It was the judge\u2019s view that, based upon the undisputed facts, it would be \u201cincredible\u201d for Samuel not to have been aware of the air/light shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\"><em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to children trespassing thereon caused by an artificial condition upon the land if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">(a) the place where the condition exists is one upon which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">(b) the condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(c) the children because of their youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">(d) the utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">(e) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Section 339 is an exception to the common-law rule immunizing the possessor of land from liability resulting from injury to the trespasser, absent willful or intentional conduct. <em>Simmel v. New Jersey Coop. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7-8, 143 A.2d 521 (1958). This exception is rooted in a \u201cprudent and essential\u201d accommodation of the landowner\u2019s right to use his property and society\u2019s interest in protecting the life and limb of its youth. <em>Strang v. South Jersey Broadcasting Co., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>38, 45, 86 A.2d 777 (1952). Since our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strang, </em>the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>infant-trespasser rule under \u00a7 339 has been firmly entrenched in the law of this State. <em>See Haase v. North Hudson Scrap Iron Corp., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>263, 264-65, 300 A.2d 561 (1973); <em>Simmel, supra, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>at 9, 143 A.2d 521; <em>Turpan v. Merriman, </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 594, 155 A.2d 266 (App.Div.1959), <em>certif. denied, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>549, 158 A.2d 450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(1960). <em>See also DeRobertis ex rel. DeRobertis v. Randazzo, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>144, 157, 462 A.2d 1260 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Section 339 is intended to cover \u201ctrespassing children of tender years who because of immaturity are wanting in the discretion and judgment essential to their own security.\u201d <em>Strang, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 86 A.2d 777. No inflexible rule can be set forth concerning the \u201cprophylactic measures\u201d which must be taken in a particular- case. <em>Simmel, supra, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>at 9, 143 A.2d 521. \u201c[T]he measure of duty is care in proportion to the foreseeable risk.\u201d <em>Strang, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 86 A.2d 777. All circumstances of each case are of pivotal significance in applying the rule and in deciding whether a jury question exists in applying the elements under the rule. <em>See Diglio v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>39 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 145, 120 A.2d 650 (App.Div.1956). What is clear, however, is that plaintiffs must establish every element under \u00a7 339 in order to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Coughlin v. U.S. Tool Co., </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 346, 145 A.2d 482 (App.Div.1958), <em>certif. denied, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>527, 147 A.2d 305 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Applying clause (a) of \u00a7 339 to the facts of this case, the question is whether defendants knew or \u201cha[dj reason to know\u201d that children were trespassing upon their rooftops. The words \u201creason to know\u201d denotes the fact that \u201cthe actor has information from which a person of reasonable intelligence or of the superior intelligence of the actor would infer that the fact in question exists, or that such person would govern his conduct upon the assumption that such fact exists.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 12(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We are convinced that, based on the competent evidential material submitted, a rational fact-finder could resolve this issue in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Piedilato was aware that children were gaining access to and were playing on the rooftops. Wayne Puff admitted that he was concerned with drug activity on the rooftop, that he was aware that the Piedilato building was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>adequately maintained, and that his roof could be accessed easily from the Piedilato roof. Viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, a jury question existed as to whether a landowner of reasonable intelligence would have \u201creason to know\u201d that children had access to both rooftops and were trespassing thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">However, the pivotal question is whether plaintiffs made out a <em>prima facie </em>case under clauses (b) and (c) of \u00a7 339; that is, whether the defendants had reason to know that the air/Iight shaft posed an \u201cunreasonable\u201d risk of death or serious bodily injury to trespassing children; and whether Samuel did not discover the condition or \u201crealize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 339(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In applying clauses (b) and (c) of \u00a7 339, there is no hard and fast rule of liability (or no liability) based solely on the age of the child. <em>Hoff v. Natural Ref. Prods. Co., </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 231, 118 A.2d 714 (App.Div.1955) (citing James, <em>Tort Liability of Occupiers of Land: Duties Owed to Trespassers, </em>63 <em>Yale L.J. </em>144, 166-69 (1953)). <em>See also Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339, comment c (\u201cthere is no definite age beyond which the rule here stated does not apply. As the age of the child increases, conditions become fewer for which there can be recovery under this rule, until at some indeterminate' point, probably beyond the age of sixteen, there are no longer any such conditions\u201d). Whether there is a jury question concerning application of clauses (b) and (c) usually depends upon the combined and interrelated factors of each case, including: (1) the degree of maturity of the child; and (2) the obviousness of the hazard. <em>Hoff, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 228, 118 A.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Clause (b) requires a showing that the condition \u201cis one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an <em>unreasonable risk </em>of death or serious bodily harm to such children!)]\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339(b) (emphasis added). The comments to \u00a7 339 make clear that a condition does not involve an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>trespassing child if the child, considering his age and the obviousness of the danger, can be expected to appreciate it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">The duty of the possessor, therefore, is only to exercise reasonable care to 1 eep the part of the land upon which he should recognize the likelihood of children\u2019s trespassing <em>free from those conditions which, though observable by adults, are likely not to be observed by children, or which contain the risks </em>... <em>which are beyond the imperfect realization of children. It does not extend to those conditions the existence of which is obvious even to children and the risk of which should be fully realized by them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\"><em>[Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339 comment i (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Thus, \u201c[t]he question here is not whether [the child] does in fact understand\u201d the risks involved, \u201calthough that too has its importance; it is rather <em>what the possessor may reasonably expect </em>of [the trespassing child].\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 59 at 407 (5th ed.1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The <em>Restatement </em>adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">There are many dangers, such as those of fire and water, <em>or of falling from a height, which under ordinary conditions may reasonably be expected to be fully understood and appreciated by any child of an age to be allowed at large. To such conditions the rule stated in this Section ordinarily has no application, </em>in the absence of some other factor creating a special risk that the child will not avoid the danger, such as the fact that the condition is so hidden as not to be readily visible, or a distracting influence which makes it likely that the child will not discover or appreciate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\"><em>rRestatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 339 comment j (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Stated differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">Since the risk of <em>falling from a height to the ground </em>or of falling into an excavation, pit, or ditch <em>is considered obvious even to very young children, a landowner is, </em>as a general rule, <em>under no obligation, to fence or otherwise guard such places. Thus, there can be no recovery under the special rule for injuries resulting from, such a fall.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">[62 <em>Am.Jur</em>.2d, <em>Premises Liability, </em>\u00a7 352 (1990) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">The exceptions to this \u201cnonliability\u201d rule involve: (a) a concealed dangerous condition; (b) a defective or hazardous condition; (c) a distracting influence; or (d) a present danger that a child of \u201ctender years\u201d could not readily apprehend. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\"><em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 389(b), must be read in conjunction with clause (c). The focus under clause (c) is not the landowner\u2019s foreseeability of an \u201cunreasonable\u201d risk, but whether the trespass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ing child observes the dangerous potential of the condition and the \u201cfull extent\u201d of the risks in \u201cintermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it[J\u201d Therefore, the burden here is on the plaintiffs to prove that because of Samuel\u2019s youth, he did not discover the condition or realize the risks involved. \u201c[T]he possessor [of land] is not subject to liability to a child who in fact discovers the condition and appreciates the full risk involved, but [nonetheless] chooses to encounter it out of recklessness or bravado.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339 comment m.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">However, in order to bar recovery, the child must realize the \u201cfull extent\u201d of the risk involved \u201cand must have as full a perception of the risks which are being run as though the child were an adult.\u201d 62 Am.Jur.2d, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 329. Realization of the \u201cfull extent\u201d of the risk involved may be shown by direct evidence, <em>see Coughlin, supra, 52 N.J.Super. </em>at 348, 145 A.2d 482, or by circumstantial evidence, such as the age, intelligence and experience of the injured child, as well as the obviousness of the risk. 62 <em>Am.Jur</em>.2d, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We applied <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339(c) in <em>Coughlin, </em>where a fourteen-year old boy climbed onto a garage and, in darkness, moved from building to building, each time jumping over a parapet and landing on the next roof. 52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 345, 145 A.2d 482. After successfully jumping twice, he leaped a third time and fell to the ground. The boy admitted that \u201che was aware of the risk and danger involved in traversing the roof top in the dark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 145 A.2d 482. In affirming dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, we concluded that \u00a7 339(b) was not satisfied because the roof was simply not \u201cof such character as likely to cause an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm within the true meaning of the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 145 A.2d 482. We also determined that \u201cno jury could have found that this 14- to 15-year old \u2018infant\u2019 did not realize the risk,\u201d and therefore \u00a7 339(c) was not satisfied. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[W]e are strongly of the opinion that to allow recovery under the facts of this case would make every property owner an insurer for infant trespassers contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in the <em>Simmel </em>case, <em>supra. </em>To apply here the infant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>trespasser doctrine would <em>be to </em>throw off all limitations <em>on </em>landowner\u2019s liability. We cannot permit liability to be based upon the maintenance of natural conditions, common or ordinary objects such as walls, fences, gates, simple tools and appliances. The same degree of care cannot be required in the case of an article which is in such common use that people generally keep it about their premises. We draw the line on allowing liability herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\"><em>[Id </em>at 348-49, 145 A.2d 482 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We agree with the motion judge that the rooftops and air/light shaft were not \u201cunreasonable\u201d risks under \u00a7 339(b). This is so because a reasonable possessor of land would expect that the air/light shaft would be readily observable by a fourteen-year old child, and that such a child would fully understand the risks of falling into it. The danger here was the \u201cfalling from a height,\u201d a danger not ordinarily covered under the <em>Restatement </em>because, as stated, it is a condition which \u201cmay reasonably be expected to be fully understood and appreciated by any child of an age to be allowed at large.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339, comment j. Photographs submitted to the motion judge and to us depict the large, irregular air/light shaft, fifteen feet in width at the middle, traversing over one-half of the common side separating the two roofs. As stated, Triano, plaintiffs\u2019 expert, testified that anyone moving from one roof to the other would clearly observe the air/light shaft. The motion judge, based on the motion papers and discovery presented to him, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Clearly, an air shaft between two buildings is a condition which is apparent even to children and the risk of falling in the shaft should be fully realized. This is not a trap maintained by the owners of the building; it is merely caused by the way the buildings were constructed. This is no defect. Section 339 exists to protect children from their childish lack of attention of judgment and from things that are beyond the imperfect realization of children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">We agree. We conclude that the evidence presented was so \u201cone-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law\u201d on the question whether the air/light shaft constituted an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d of danger. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 533, 540, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Based on the same evidential material, we also concur with the motion judge\u2019s findings that plaintiffs failed to satisfy \u00a7 339(c). In our view, the judge\u2019s conclusion that Samuel had to be aware of the air/light shaft and its attendant danger cannot rationally be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>disputed. As the judge noted, the shaft was patently \u201cobvious\u201d; Samuel had to \u201crealize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 339(c). This knowledge is inferred from the deposition testimony and Samuel\u2019s own conduct prior to his fall. Samuel and his friends had climbed nearly four stories to reach the roofs and were on the rooftop for over three hours before he fell. Also, no rational fact-finder could conclude that Samuel did not observe the air/light shaft when the undisputed testimony was that he and the other boys crossed the roof several times before the fall by walking around the shaft in order to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that summary judgment should have been denied because there was some question whether Samuel \u201ctripped\u201d into the air/light shaft, or was attempting to jump over it. Although Manuel testified that Samuel had tripped, he acknowledged on several occasions during his deposition that before the trip, Samuel was running toward the air/light shaft intending to jump over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In any event, whether Samuel tripped or jumped is not dispositive. There is no liability if the trespassing child \u201crealize[s] the risk involved in intermeddling with it or <em>in coming within the area made dangerous by it.\u201d Restatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 339(e) (emphasis added). Samuel was running \u201cwithin the area\u201d made dangerous by the air/light shaft in order to avoid being apprehended by the police. On these undisputed facts, a jury could not rationally conclude that Samuel did not fully \u201crealize\u201d the risks involved in running \u201cwithin the area\u201d of this patently obvious danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Plaintiffs raise the alternative argument that, although the danger of falling from a height is one which may be expected to be appreciated by a fourteen-year old child, liability may be imposed if there exists a \u201cdistracting influence\u201d that \u201cmakes it likely that the child will not discover or appreciate [the danger].\u201d In this case, plaintiffs reason, \u201cthere obviously was a distracting influence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>A police car had entered the area. Thinking that they were about to be apprehended by the police, the children cut and ran.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The <em>Restatement </em>observes that, despite the obviousness of dangers such as \u201cfalling from a height,\u201d liability may be imposed if there are other factors \u201ccreating a special risk that the child will not avoid the danger, such as ... a distracting influence which makes it likely that the child will not discover or appreciate it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 339 comment j. We agree with defendants that the <em>Restatement </em>illustrations reveal that the \u201cdistracting influences\u201d referred to must inhere in the land itself in order to establish liability. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 339 comment j, illustrations 6 and 7. Landowners have no control over unexpected events such as the arrival of police to investigate the mischief of the trespassers themselves. Also, as landowners, defendants could not reasonably foresee such an event, or that the event would distract the trespassers. The \u201cdistracting influence\u201d exception has no applicability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that Samuel\u2019s own conduct should be considered only in the context of comparative negligence, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1, and not in deciding whether defendants owed a duty of care under \u00a7 339 of the <em>Restatement. </em>We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Essentially, plaintiffs would have us dismantle \u00a7 339 of the <em>Restatement </em>by erasing clause (c) to the extent its application may depend upon the trespassing plaintiffs own conduct. Such an approach ignores the fact that the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>infant-trespasser rule is firmly rooted in our jurisdiction and has not been questioned by our Supreme Court since enactment of the Comparative Negligence Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 to -5.3. <em>Of. Renz v. Penn Central Corp., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>437, 459-60, 435 A.2d 540 (1981) (the Court engrafted upon the railroad immunity act the \u201cnew\u201d doctrine of comparative negligence, replacing the \u201cnow\u201d extinct common-law rule of contributory negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Under the <em>Restatement, </em>Samuel\u2019s conduct is relevant under clause (c) in establishing whether he had discovered the danger or realized the \u201crisk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it.\u201d If he had, defendants owed no duty. As stated, the principal reason for the rule distinguishing trespassing children from trespassing adults is the inability of the child to protect himself but, \u201cif the child is fully aware of the condition, understands the risk which it carries, and is quite able to avoid it, he stands in no better position than an adult with similar knowledge and understanding.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 59 at 408. As <em>Prosser </em>emphasizes, the child\u2019s knowledge and own conduct \u201cis not merely a matter of contributory negligence or assumption of risk, <em>but of lack of duty to the child,.\u201d Id. </em>at 409 (emphasis added). Absent such a duty, Samuel\u2019s conduct vis-a-vis comparative negligence is not even considered by the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Unlike plaintiffs, we do not read <em>Brett v. Great American Recreation, Inc., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>479, 677 A.2d 705 (1996), as supportive of the proposition that <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 339(e) should be ignored in favor of a comparative negligence analysis. In <em>Brett, </em>the Court concluded that the Ski Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:13-1 to -11, did not apply to a nonpaying tobogganist. <em>Id. </em>at 498, 677 A.2d 705. However, applying the doctrine of invited error, the Court refused to accept on appeal the defendants\u2019 newly-found argument that the Ski Act was inapplicable, after defendants had argued its applicability during trial. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 677 A.2d 705. The Court therefore concluded that the trial judge correctly interpreted and charged the Ski Act\u2019s provisions, and upheld the jury verdict in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 677 A.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The <em>Brett </em>Court found that, even if the Ski Act had not been applied by the trial court, plaintiffs\u2019 verdict would have been the same had the common law been charged. <em>Ibid. </em>It rejected defendants\u2019 argument that since plaintiffs were trespassers, defendants owed no more duty than to refrain from willfully injuring them. <em>Ibid. </em>Noting that landowners owe a \u201chigher duty even to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>trespassers when their presence is foreseeable, particularly if an artificial condition or \u2018dangerous instrumentality\u2019 on the land poses a danger to them,\u201d the Court defined the common law duty owed by defendants based on the specific facts of that case to include, at a minimum, \u201ca duty to remove obvious, man-made hazards as soon as practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 677 A.2d 705 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We do not read <em>Brett </em>as being a retreat from or abrogation of the infant-trespasser rule under \u00a7 339. The case did not even deal with a child trespasser. The Court simply departed from the general rule applicable to adult trespassers because such a rule in the special circumstances of that case would have been unfair and unjust. Simply stated, the duty defined in <em>Brett </em>was dictated by the peculiar and unique factors associated with the operation of an illuminated ski slope.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">As the Court in <em>Brett </em>states, the ultimate question \u201cis whether, \u2018in light of the actual relationship between the parties under all of the surrounding circumstances,\u2019 the imposition of a duty on the landowner is \u2018fair and just.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 438, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993)). The structure of \u00a7 339 and its sub-parts provides the type of \u201cfairness\u201d analysis discussed in <em>Brett; </em>our decisions have, without exception, recognized that it is \u201cfair and just\u201d to impose liability upon a landowner under \u00a7 339 for injuries sustained by infant trespassers, provided that the preconditions under the rule are satisfied by plaintiffs. Nothing in <em>Brett </em>suggests modification of the <em>Restatement </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-21\"> Jose testified that the air shaft was visible that night.
