Defendant was sentenced to thirty days in jail, with a credit for eight days already spent in custody, on the contempt violation, which constituted a disorderly persons offense. He was fined $100 on the harassment conviction, a petty disorderly persons offense. No issue of merger is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">The harassment complaint alleged that defendant engaged \u201cin a course of alarming conduct in violation of 2C:33-4(c).\u201d On this appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">POINT I The Decision of the Trial Court Should Be Reversed Because the Evidence Does Not Support a Finding that the Defendant-Appellant Violated The Final Restraining Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>POINT II The Trial Court Erred in Finding That the Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Conduct Constituted Alarming or Harassing Conduct In Violation of the Final Restraining Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Final Restraining Order under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act was issued on September 9, 1991, and the event giving rise to this appeal occurred on June 18,1992. The restraining order prohibited defendant \u201cfrom having contact with the victim <em>including, </em>but not limited to ... entering plaintiffs residence, place of employment, business or school.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The order also prohibited him \u201cfrom harassing plaintiff ... in any manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Mrs. T. testified that at around 8 a.m. on June 18, 1992 she \u201cwent to let the dogs out and [defendant] was on the ground staring at me ... sitting on the ground staring at the apartment, the townhouse.\u201d He \u201cgot up\u201d when his wife went outside, but said nothing to her. Mrs. T. was \u201cseared\u201d because of \u201c[p]rior problems\u201d with defendant and, based on where defendant was, did not want to walk to her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Mrs. T. acknowledged that defendant was not on her property and that her property was about nine feet from the fence on the other side of which defendant was located. At approximately 10:40 a.m., police officers responded to Mrs. T.\u2019s call for assistance. Officer William Pessler located defendant two or three feet on the other side of \u201cthe fence.\u201d Defendant told Pessler he was aware of the restraining order and \u201cwas doing nothing wrong.\u201d He subsequently told police in a formal statement at headquarters that he \u201cdid not violate any restraining order\u201d and \u201cwas not on the marital property at any time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He further stated he \u201cdid not ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>speak to or harass anyone in anyway,\u201d had no \u201ccontact\u201d with Mrs. T. \u201cin anyway,\u201d did not damage any property, \u201cdid not commit any act of violence\u201d and \u201chad no intent to do any of the above.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Defendant did not testify on his own behalf. The trial judge concluded that defendant violated the restraining order and was in contempt of court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">I find that the charges of harassment under the petty disorderly persons \u2014 a petty disorderly persons offense. And the charge of violating the court order, a disorderly persons offense. I find the defendant guilty of both of these because I find that the conduct that was described m the testimony constitutes harassment. I believe that if you take this statement of Mr. [T] in which he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t violate any restraining order. I was not on the property. I didn\u2019t speak to or harass anybody. I didn\u2019t contact [Mrs. T]. I didn\u2019t damage any property. I didn\u2019t commit any acts of violence.\u201d I believe that implicit in this statement is that Mr. [T] wanted to see just how far he could go without violating this restraining order. ... Mr. [T] knew that he was to stay away and not in anyway bother her. And I find that his presence in \u2014 obviously from the circumstances I have to conclude that [ J ho was there for the purpose of being seen. He did not conceal himself. He wasn\u2019t lurking in the bushes peeking out from the foliage and Mrs. [T] had to strain to see him or he wasn\u2019t at a distance. He was at a distance of what I discern to be 20/25 feet away. And in plain sight. His announcing his presence to his wife, I have to conclude is there for the purpose of being annoying, alarming. It is a passive form of a threat. And it\u2019s announcing his presence that he\u2019s there just to bother her. So I find from all the testimony that a ease for harassment has been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">As we recently said in <em>State v. B.H., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. 588, 597, </em>676 A.2d 565 (App.Div.1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">[A] person is guilty of harassment, if, -with the purpose to harass another, <em>E.K. v. G.K., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 575 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1990), he or she engages in an act prohibited by the statute. Standing alone, proof of a defendant\u2019s purpose to harass a victim is insufficient to sustain a conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:38~4. The purpose to harass must be coupled -with the performance of one of the acts proscribed by Sections (a), (b) or (c) of the statute in order to constitute harassment. <em>Cf. Grant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>v. Wright, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 196, 536 A.2d 319 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>562, 546 A.2d 493 (1988) (interpreting Section (e) of the Act). These sections address categories of conduct which can be broadly described as communications, physical contact, and course of conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">... and Section (c) prohibits a course of alarming conduct or repeated acts done with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\"><em>[State v. B.H., supra, </em>290 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 597, 676 A.2d 565.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Section (c), under which defendant was convicted, \u201cforbids a course of alarming conduct or repeated acts committed with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy the victim. In short, the leitmotif which runs throughout the sections is a prohibition against conduct of some consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 676 A.2d 565; <em>see also State v. L.C., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 449, 662 A.2d 577 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>325, 670 A.2d 1066 (1996); <em>Peranio v. Peranio, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 55-56, 654 A.2d 495 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The trial judge referred to a prior violation of the restraining order, but there was no proof thereof introduced into evidence for purposes of proving defendant\u2019s purpose or his \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d Based on the testimony, the trial judge had to determine whether defendant, by situating himself as he did, engaged in a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct\u201d \u201cwith purpose to harass another.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(c). Defendant\u2019s insistence that he did not violate the restraining order nor intended to do so is not controlling. Rather, it is a question for the fact-finder to decide based on defendant\u2019s conduct. Here, the trial judge found that defendant situated himself \u201cfor the purpose of being ... alarming,\u201d thereby engaging in a course of alarming conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Our scope of review is limited. The only question before us is whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s conclusion. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). Based on defendant\u2019s knowledge of his wife and the premises, it cannot be doubted that defendant positioned himself in a location where his wife could see him as she exited the house \u2014 whether to let the dog out, go to her car or otherwise. And he did so despite the injunction from \u201chaving contact\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>his wife and from \u201charassing [her] in any manner.\u201d That he was there with the purpose to harass her can be inferred, beyond a reasonable doubt, from the totality of circumstances. There is a difference between engaging in a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct\u201d and \u201crepeatedly committing] acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy\u201d another, and the fact repeated acts were not involved does not mean defendant did not engage in a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Placing oneself in a location and remaining there for some time may constitute a \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d In addition, defendant \u201cgot up\u201d and moved in such a way that his wife could see him as soon as she opened the door. \u201cConduct\u201d may be \u201cany positive or negative act\u201d and \u201cits accompanying state of mind,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(5th ed.1979), and does not require any minimum amount of time, duration, or separate components. It can be the \u201cchosen manner of conducting oneself\u2019 at a particular time or period. <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(9th ed.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The State points out that, incident to the final restraining order, defendant was to obtain counselling from the \u201cAlternatives to Domestic Violence\u201d program, that defendant was previously found guilty of violating the same restraining order on September 30, 1991,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that at the sentencing therefor on April 20, 1992 defendant was reminded to stay away from his wife and that as a condition of the sentence he was \u201crestricted from contact with the victim.\u201d The State contends that \u201ca trial judge may rely on [such prior proceedings involving] proven facts and common sense to infer that a defendant intended to harass his victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">We agree with the State that such prior conduct may be relevant to whether defendant had the necessary purpose. However, while proof \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d permits the issuance of a restraining order, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29(a), here defendant was being prosecuted for disorderly persons and petty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>disorderly persons offenses, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-9(b), 2C:33-4, \u201coffenses\u201d under the Code of Criminal Justice, see <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:1-4(b), 2C:l-14(k), 2C:43-8, for which the State has the burden of proof of \u201ceach element of such offense ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-13(a); see <em>also, e.g., State v. Janiec, </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 32-33, 74 A.2d 605 (App.Div.1950), <em>aff'd, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>608, 80 A.2d 94 (1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 <em>U.S. </em>955, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>1007, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>1376 (1951) (holding that judicial notice of prior conviction is not permissible to prove violation of Habitual Criminal Act). Further, the rules of evidence prescribe the manner of taking judicial notice of prior proceedings dining trial, with each party having an \u201copportunity to be heard\u201d on the subject, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>201(e), and they do not include the judge\u2019s reliance on his own recollection of such proceedings. <em>See Evid. R. </em>9-12 in effect at the time of trial; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In noting that a \u201cpurpose to harass\u201d is an element of harassment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4, we need not pass upon the State\u2019s suggestion that the judge can take judicial notice of prior proceedings in order to sustain the convictions. Here, the record justifies the convictions based on the proofs introduced at the trial and the judge\u2019s findings thereon. Of course, the judge could properly consider the prior conviction and conduct for purposes of determining the sentence. <em>See, e.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>79, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>596, 606, 477 A.2d 300 (1984) (prior conviction not element of offense requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt for purposes of sentencing; \u201ccourt is free to consider all relevant material, not merely that admissible at trial\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:25-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> When distances are estimated, as here, by measurements or comparisons to the courtroom, the judge should state the estimated distance for the record. The State's brief says that Mrs. T. \u201cwas startled by defendant, who was sitting on the lawn about twenty to twenty-five feet away....\" The witness' reference to a diagram should also be preserved for the record. According to defendant's brief, he \u201cwas separated from [Mrs. T.] by her backyard, a fence, a large driveway that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>serves the entire apartment complex, another fence and the additional distance between defendant-appellant and the fence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\"> At the end of the State\u2019s case the judge excluded \"any testimony\u201d regarding statements made in response to questions asked by the officers when they arrived because, the judge reasoned, they knew of the restraining order and thought defendant\u2019s presence constituted a violation. The judge did not exclude the subsequent \"Mirandarizefd]\u201d formal statement taken at police headquarters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> Although not contained in the appendix before us, the State notes that defendant was also charged with and convicted of trespass at the same time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
