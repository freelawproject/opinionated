We conclude that it did not and reverse the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Following the denial of his motion to suppress evidence in the Wayne Municipal Court, defendant Joseph R. Zutic was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance (CDS), namely, approximately fifteen grams of marijuana, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(4); resisting arrest, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-2a; possession of CDS in a motor vehicle, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-49.1; and making an unsafe lane change, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4 \u2014 88(b). Defendant was acquitted of possession of drug paraphernalia, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:36-2. The municipal court merged the possession of CDS in a motor vehicle into the drug possession conviction and imposed appropriate fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Defendant appealed to the Law Division where the trial judge, following a trial <em>de novo </em>on the record, denied the motion to s\u00fappress and again found defendant guilty of the offenses, imposing the same fines and penalties as the municipal court. This appeal is taken from the Law Division judgment of convietion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Defendant makes the following arguments on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">THE POLICE OFFICER LACKED PROBABLE CAUSE TO STOP THE DEFENDANT\u2019S VEHICLE ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED MOTOR VEHICLE VIOLATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">THE POLICE OFFICER LACKED PROBABLE CAUSE TO SEARCH THE DEFENDANT\u2019S VEHICLE UNDER ANY EXCEPTION TO THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">THE SUPERIOR COURT ERRED IN UPHOLDING THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE BASED ON THE TIP THAT THE OFFICER RECEIVED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">A. There was an incomplete and insufficient record from the municipal court with respect to the details of the tip, its veracity and the reliability and basis of knowledge of the confidential informant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">B. The facts of the ease at bar are distinguishable from the facts in <em>State v. Foreshaw, </em>and the search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was not objectively reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">THE DEFENDANT WAS DENIED A FAIR TRIAL WHEN THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY MERGED THE TESTIMONY FROM THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND SUBSTITUTED THAT TESTIMONY IN ITS ENTIRETY AS THE STATE\u2019S CASE IN CHIEF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On July 26, 1993, Detective Michael O\u2019Connor of the Narcotics Bureau of the Wayne Police Department set up surveillance at approximately 6:15 p.m. on Route 23 North in Wayne. He testified that the basis for the surveillance was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-17\">information that [was] received from a confidential reliable <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> informer that a vehicle, bearing registration BC-584V, ... a \u201993 red Toyota, would be travelling up 23 North from New York City after the party had purchased marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The informant\u2019s tip had been received at approximately 6:00 p.m. At that time, the informant related that defendant had just departed for New York City in order to purchase marijuana. The officer then testified that a round-trip to New York City for the purpose of purchasing drugs could take between forty minutes and two hours depending on the location of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Two hours later, at approximately 8:00 p.m., defendant\u2019s red Toyota was observed by Detective O\u2019Connor on Route 23 North in the vicinity of Packanack Lake Road. After defendant\u2019s vehicle passed Detective O\u2019Connor, the officer proceeded to follow the automobile on Route 23 North in an unmarked van which remained approximately two or three car lengths behind defendant\u2019s vehicle. The officer testified he observed defendant effectuate a \u201csudden change of lanes\u201d from the center to the right lane of the highway without signalling. The officer then indicated that defendant exited from the highway into the parking lot of a service station adjacent to the roadway. Again, defendant purportedly failed to utilize his right turn signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Detective O\u2019Connor followed defendant\u2019s vehicle into the service station parking lot. As the officer approached, defendant, who had previously exited his vehicle, was re-entering the Toyota. Detective O\u2019Connor identified himself as a police officer and obtained defendant\u2019s driving credentials, which apparently verified his identity as Joseph Zutie. According to the officer, defendant appeared \u201cnervous and jittery\u201d and responded evasively to questions concerning the route he had travelled that day. Believing defendant was not answering his questions truthfully, Detective O\u2019Connor advised defendant of his Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights and asked him if there were any drugs in the automobile. After receiving a negative response, the officer proceeded to conduct a search of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Toyota and discovered a cigarette box on the right front seat which apparently, when opened, revealed marijuana \u201croaches.\u201d Noticing that defendant was motioning towards the front portion of his belt line, and observing a \u201cbulge,\u201d the officer asked defendant whether he had any drugs in his possession, to which defendant replied \u201cno.\u201d Not satisfied, the officer attempted to investigate the bulge further with his hand. A struggle ensued, culminating in the recovery of a plastic bag containing suspected marijuana <em>from </em>inside defendant\u2019s sweatpants.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Relying primarily on an opinion of this court in <em>State v. Foreshaw, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 584 A.2d 832 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>327, 598 A.2d 886 (1991), the Law Division judge determined that the State had demonstrated probable cause to make a warrantless stop and search \u201cupon Detective O\u2019Connor\u2019s sighting <em>of </em>the vehicle described by the informant and [his subsequent] verification of the informant\u2019s details.\u201d We disagree and reverse the denial of the suppression motion under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach for determining when an informant\u2019s data is sufficient to establish probable cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>213, 237-38, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 2332, 76 <em>L.Ed.3d </em>527, 548 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>an affidavit submitted in support of the application for a search warrant indicated that an anonymous letter had informed the police in Bloomingdale, Illinois of defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>dants\u2019 alleged drug trafficking activities and provided details as to an imminent transaction. The letter read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">This letter is to inform you that you have a couple in your town who strict\u2019/ make their living on selling drugs. They are Sue and Lance Gates, they live on Greenway, off Bloomingdale Rd. in the condominiums. Most of then- buys are done in Florida. Sue his wife dx-ives their car to Floi\u2019ida, where she leaves it to be loaded up with di\u2019ugs, then Lance flys down and drives it back. Sue flys back after she dx-ops the car off in Florida. May 3 she is di\u2019iving down thex-e again and Lance will be flying down in a few days to chive it back. At the time Lance drives the ear back he has the trunk loaded with over $100,000.00 in drugs. Px-esently they have over $100,000.00 worth of drugs in them basement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">They bi\u2019ag about the fact they never have to work, and make them entire living on pushei's.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">I guarantee if you watch them cax-efully you will make a big catch. They ax-e friends with some big di\u2019ug dealers, who visit theix- house often.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">[462 <em>U.S. </em>at 225, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2325, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 540.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Through surveillance the details of the letter were corroborated \u201cin major part,\u201d 462 <em>U.S. </em>at 243, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 551, and a search warrant was issued. Subsequently, the police executed the warrant when the defendants returned from a thirty-six hour excursion to Florida, seizing drugs and weapons from defendants\u2019 car and home.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The Court upheld the search by indicating that information obtained from an informant whose reliability has not been demonstrated in the record may be used to establish probable cause if the totality of the circumstances are sufficient to bolster the informant\u2019s veracity. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2332, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 548. In so holding, the Court determined that the letter \u201ccontained a range of details relating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted.\u201d 462 <em>U.S. </em>at 245, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2335-36, 76 L.Ed.2d at 552. Accordingly, the Court decided that the judge issuing the warrant \u201chad \u2018a substantial basis for concluding]\u2019 that probable cause existed\u201d to search defendants\u2019 car and home. 462 <em>U.S. </em>at 246, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2336, 76 L.Ed.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Probasco, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 358, 532 A.2d 262 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>72, 563 A.2d 835 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>(1989), we concluded that detailed information obtained from an untested informant and subsequently corroborated by the observations of the police was sufficient to establish probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle. In that case, a police surveillance team was advised by an informant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">[TJhat between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m. that night a white male named David would drive a maroon Ford to a stated address in the municipality to deliver drugs. David would be alone and \u201cpossibly armed____\u201d [T]he stated address was in a neighborhood known for illegal drug activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 356, 532 A.2d 262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Operating on the information, the surveillance team staked out the address and, at about 9:00 p.m. that evening, observed a white male arrive alone in a maroon Ford and park in front of the suspect address. After entering the building and remaining there for approximately thirty minutes, the male returned to his vehicle and proceeded to drive away. The police followed and shortly thereafter stopped the vehicle for a traffic violation. The investigating officer testified that, while the vehicle was being brought to a stop, defendant was observed leaning forward toward the center of the car as though he was \u201c[placing] something in that area.\u201d Concerned about the report that the defendant was armed, the officer directed defendant to exit the vehicle after which the police patted him down for safety reasons. A hunting knife was recovered from the defendant\u2019s belt area. An examination of driving credentials confirmed that the defendant\u2019s first name was David. A search of the area in the vehicle where the defendant had previously appeared to be secreting something uncovered an armband with a zippered compartment containing a quantity of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, we determined that the police had probable cause to conduct the search because the investigation had sufficiently verified the informant\u2019s data. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 532 A.2d 262. In so ruling, however, we noted that if the hunting knife had not been recovered from the predicted area during the pat-down search, \u201cthe veracity of the informant\u2019s information\u201d may not have been \u201csufficiently established to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tute probable cause to conduct a search of defendant\u2019s automobile for drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359 n. 3, 532 A.2d 262. We implicitly recognized then, as we expressly do now, that corroboration of the presence of a weapon as predicted lent reliability to the informant\u2019s tip because it was a fact that would not have been generally known.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Subsequent to <em>Probasco, </em>another part of this court concluded that the information received from an informant was sufficient to establish probable cause under the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Foreshaw, supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 176-77, 584 A.2d 832. However, in reaching that conclusion, the court did not allude to the nature of the informant\u2019s details.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These were the facts upon which probable cause was deemed established. The police were alerted by a confidential informant that \u201ca silver or gray El Dorado Cadillac with New Jersey license plates and a spare tire mounted on the back\u201d had departed Camden that morning for New York City to pick up a large quantity of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 584 A.2d 832. The informant advised that the vehicle would be returning to Camden at approximately 4:30 p.m. with three people, two Jamaican males and a Spanish female. Acting on this information, the police established surveillance and apprehended three individuals in a vehicle that matched the informant\u2019s description proceeding toward Camden at or about the predicted time. After stopping the vehicle and removing the occupants, the officers conducted a search of the vehicle and discovered a bag containing 502 grams of cocaine. This court concluded the police officers had probable cause to believe that contraband was present in the defendant\u2019s vehicle based on \u201cthe strength of the informant\u2019s data and their own follow-up investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 584 A.2d 832. In addition, the court noted that the inherent mobility of the vehicle contributed to already existing \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d and justified the stop and search of the ear. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Recently, another part of this court held that the police had sufficient facts to corroborate information provided by a confidential informant that illegal drug activity was occurring despite a dissenting objection that the details were too innocuous to justify a finding of probable cause. <em>State v. Paturzzio, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 548, 679 A.2d 199 (App.Div.1996). In <em>Paturzzio, </em>a confidential informant had advised the police that defendant was in a particular house, identified the owner of the house, and stated that the defendant would be leaving the residence shortly in a vehicle operated by another individual whose identity was provided. The informant also advised the police that the defendant possessed large quantities of phencyclidine (PCP) and marijuana and described a black knapsack defendant would be carrying. The record further reflects that the police were familiar with the vehicle and the operator of the vehicle described by the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Based on the foregoing, the police stopped the vehicle, searched defendant, and discovered a suspected marijuana roach in a pack of cigarettes contained in the black knapsack. Later, during processing at the police station, a satchel was removed from underneath the defendant\u2019s sweatshirt in which twenty-two envelopes containing PCP were discovered. Twenty-one bags of marijuana and two \u201cchunks\u201d of hashish were also found in the satchel.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The majority concluded that the police surveillance sufficiently verified the information provided by the informant, thus confirming the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 679 A.2d 199 (citations omitted). Dissenting, Judge Long disagreed, stating that \u201ca fair reading of <em>[Illinois </em>u] <em>Gates </em>requires the conclusion that more than corroboration of innocuous details of wholly unsuspicious circumstances is necessary to bolster the veracity of an untested informant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 679 A.2d 199 (Long, P.J.A.D., dissenting) (citing Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 3.3(3) at 161-62 (pocket part) (2d ed.1987)). Judge Long explained \u201c[t]he reason for this is that a casual observer or a mere rumormonger may be able to provide a wide range of details relating to easily obtainable facts and conditions existing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>time of the tip without knowing anything of substance about a suspect\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 245, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2335, 76 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 552; <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>410, 416, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>584, 589, 21 L.Ed.2d 637, 644 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>itself recognizes, the relevant inquiry in determining the existence of probable cause is not \u201cwhether particular conduct is \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018guilty\u2019 but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 243-44 n. 13, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2335 n. 13, 76 L.Ed.2d at 552 n. 13. Additionally, even \u201c[i]f the details are not suspicious, they can still pass muster as indicative of reliability if they are of intimate, hard-to-know aspects of the subject\u2019s private life.\u201d <em>Paturzzio, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 553, 679 A.2d 199 (Long, P.J.A.D., dissenting) (citing <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 245,103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2335, 76 L.Ed.2d at 552-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In the present case, the informant\u2019s tip consisted of the following details: the identity of the driver, a description of the car and its license plate number, an allegation that defendant and some other unidentified person (referred to collectively by the informant as \u201cthey\u201d) had just left for New York where defendant would purchase marijuana, and that the vehicle would return on Route 23 North.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Applying the principles enunciated in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>and the dissent in <em>Paturzzio, </em>we are not satisfied that the informant\u2019s tip exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to establish probable cause despite the police corroboration of most of the informant\u2019s details. Consequently, the searche\u2019s were invalid. In so concluding, we embrace the dissent\u2019s view in <em>Paturzzio </em>that in the absence of a showing of suspicious circumstances or information consisting of \u201cintimate, hard-to-know aspects of the subject\u2019s private life,\u201d 292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 553, 679 A.2d 199, such as the corroborated fact in <em>Probasco </em>that the defendant would be armed, no basis exists upon which we can conclude that the informant here had probable access to reliable information to justify a finding of probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>cause. The corroborated act of driving to New York from nearby Wayne and back over a short period of time along a designated route lacks \u201cthe degree of suspicion\u201d and is not the type of \u201cintimate hard-to-know facts\u201d compelling a conclusion of reliability. <em>Ibid. </em>As the dissent in <em>Paturzzio </em>observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">[t]he [Constitution] simply does not allow an untested tipster to give information to the police and thus subject innocent citizens to searches merely by providing the kind of detail the local mailman could offer about the comings and goings of most of the people on his route.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 554, 679 <em>A.2d </em>199 (Long, P.J.A.D., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\"><em>Accord State v. Smith, supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257, 677 A.2d 250 (observing that \u201cinformant set forth details which in all likelihood only one conversant with the criminal activity would know ... [which] ... was far more reliable than a mere rumor uttered by one of the criminal milieu.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Our Supreme Court has long acknowledged \u201cthe narrow line that must be drawn to protect a citizen\u2019s privacy and freedom of movement and yet allow proper law-enforcement activities.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 504-05, 517 A.2d 859 (1986). Indeed, \u201cstrong safeguards against governmental interference with a citizen\u2019s rights of privacy and freedom\u201d have always been favored by the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 517 A.2d 859. We recognize there is no hard and fast rule that can be applied in every case to determine whether the totality of the circumstances justify a finding of informant reliability. However, it is clear that the corroborated details relied upon by the police to justify the search of defendant and his vehicle in this case were insufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">In the years since deciding <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>the United States Supreme Court has addressed the question of whether an anonymous tip containing generally innocuous details, although corroborated by independent police work, was sufficient to furnish \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d justifying a Terry<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> investigatory stop. <em>See Alabama v. White, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>325, 332, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2412, 2417, 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>L.Ed.2d 301, 310 (1990). In that case, an anonymous informant advised police that a specifically identified woman would leave a certain apartment building at a particular time and travel to a named motel in a brown Plymouth station wagon. The informant also indicated that the woman would be carrying a brown attache ease containing an ounce of cocaine. Shortly thereafter, a surveillance team observed a woman leave the described building, get into a brown Plymouth station wagon and drive toward the named motel. The police proceeded to stop the vehicle, claiming they had a reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant under <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>based on the informant\u2019s tip. A consent search was conducted and marijuana was discovered in the brown attache ease. Later, during processing at the police station, the police also discovered three milligrams of cocaine in the woman\u2019s purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The United States Supreme Court concluded that these facts presented \u201ca close ease\u201d as to whether \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d existed to permit a <em>Terry </em>stop, in light of the innocuous nature of the details provided by the informant. <em>Ibid. </em>We infer from that holding that probable cause would not have been established on such innocuous facts. Indeed, other courts have so concluded. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>920 F.2d 793, 797 (11th Cir.1991) (in the absence of corroborated information detailing suspicious or criminal activity, \u201cthe most that the ... police had was a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez, </em>969 F.2d 999, 1003 (11th Cir.1992) (although police observation of defendants\u2019 otherwise innocent behavior corroborated informants\u2019 tips, such information alone was insufficient to constitute probable cause because degree of suspicion was inadequate); <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>728 <em>F.Supp. </em>1544, 1547 (S.D.Fla.1990) (mere corroboration of innocent details in tip inadequate to demonstrate probable cause where such details were not, of themselves, suspicious).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Accordingly, we conclude the corroborated informant\u2019s tip was insufficient to establish probable cause for the search of defendant and his automobile under the Fourth Amendment and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the evidence should have been suppressed.
