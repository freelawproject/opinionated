Plaintiff had sustained injuries in an automobile accident while a passenger in an uninsured vehicle operated by Jerry Jorgenson. At the time of the accident, he and Jennifer were unmarried cohabitants. They had lived together for over eight years and have three children. Defendants denied coverage because plaintiff was not a \u201cfamily member\u201d as defined under the PIP and UM endorsements. The motion judge agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that (1) under <em>Dunphy v. Gregor, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>99, 642 A.2d 372 (1994), he should be considered a family member under Jennifer\u2019s policy; (2) we should apply the \u201ccommon\u201d meaning of family, which would include him in Jennifer\u2019s family; and (3) providing PIP and UM coverage to him is consistent with the remedial purpose of the no-fault law. We reject each contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The PIP endorsement under defendants\u2019 policy provides that the carrier will pay for reasonable medical expenses sustained by an \u201cinsured.\u201d The term \u201cinsured\u201d includes \u201cfamily memberfs]\u201d of the named insured. \u201cFamily member\u201d is defined as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d The UM endorsement uses the same definition of \u201cinsured\u201d and \u201cfamily member\u201d as is contained in the PIP endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Under New Jersey\u2019s no-fault law, every automobile liability policy must provide PIP coverage \u201cto the named insured and members of his family residing in his household....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1, which regulates UM coverage, contains no such language. Plaintiff urges that because \u201cfamily member\u201d is not defined in either statute, we should give the term the broadest application, consistent with the statutory language and remedial purpose of the no-fault legislation. <em>See Amiano v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>85, 90, 424 A.2d 1179 (1981); <em>Handler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>641, 646, 602 A.2d 796 (App.Div.1992). Thus, plaintiff argues, we should consider changing social mores concerning \u201cfamilies\u201d and recognize that plaintiffs relationship with Jennifer constitutes a \u201cfamily\u201d unit for purposes of no-fault coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">However, we have expressly held that an unmarried cohabitant is not a member of the insured\u2019s family living in his household for purposes of PIP coverage. <em>See Wood v. State Fairm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 609, 429 A.2d 1082 (App.Div.1981). This is so because courts cannot ignore the clear and unambiguous language in the PIP statute which requires coverage only to traditional family members, despite our liberality in affording broadest protection to accident victims. <em>Ibid. </em>We reasoned in <em>Wood:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\"><em>We </em>would be in disregard of the clearly expressed legislative intent if we were to open up the statute so as to extend its benefits to a friend of the insured, no matter how close and intimate that friendship might be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\"><em>UUd. </em>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Pizzi, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 505 A.2d 160 (App.Div.1986), we adopted <em>Wood\u2019s </em>reasoning in the context of UM coverage, concluding that an unmarried cohabitant was not the \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201crelative\u201d of the named insured and thus no coverage was offered, \u201c \u2018no matter how close and intimate that friendship might be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 505 A.2d 160 (quoting <em>Wood, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 609, 429 A.2d 1082). <em>See also Handler, supra, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 647, 602 A.2d 796 (\u201cpeople who live together, while not married, will not be deemed to be family or relatives for insurance coverage purposes\u201d). We have no reason to depart from this well-founded precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Plaintiff contends that we should nevertheless expand the concept of \u201cfamily member\u201d in view of our Supreme Court\u2019s recent declaration in <em>Dunphy, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>99, 642 A.2d 372, that a plaintiff who witnessed her fiance being struck by a car could sue for negligent infliction of emotional distress. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 115, 642 A.2d 372. <em>Dunphy </em>reasons that an unmarried cohabitant should be afforded the protection of \u201cbystander liability\u201d based on the \u201cexistence of an intimate familial relationship\u201d between the plaintiff and the victim of defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 642 A.2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The motion judge here rejected plaintiffs reliance on <em>Dunphy, </em>concluding that <em>Dunphy </em>\u201creally doesn\u2019t apply in a contract setting.\u201d We agree. <em>Dunphy\u2019s </em>holding was predicated on the expansion of the duty owed to bystanders under tort law, originally enunciated by the Court in <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 417 A.2d 521 (1980); it was not intended to redefine the family unit for purposes of contract or statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In fact, we so held in our opinion in <em>Dunphy v. Gregor, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super </em>110, 121-22, 617 A.2d 1248 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>99, 642 A.2d 372 (1994), when we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">The definition of \u201crelative,\u201d a term corresponding to \u201cfamilial,\u201d has been dealt with by the Appellate Division in cases involving automobile insurance. In applying statutory language, interpreting the terms of contracts of insurance, and divining the expectations of parties to those contracts, different panels have reached a variety of results in dealing with the technical intricacies of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>injury protection and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. These cases, which are based on principles of contract construction, are not useful in developing an understanding of the policies that inform the standards governing tort law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We adhere to that distinction and thus find <em>Dunphy </em>inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Equally unavailing is plaintiffs reliance on <em>Brokenbaugh v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 386 A.2d 433 (App.Div.1978). There, the plaintiff-claimant was the daughter of a woman who lived with the named insured, and it was undisputed that plaintiff was a member of the insured\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 386 A.2d 433. We found that plaintiff was entitled to PIP coverage as a member of the insured\u2019s household because she was a <em>de facto </em>ward or foster child of the insured within the terms of the PIP endorsement, which expressly covered a \u201crelative\u201d including persons \u201crelated to the <em>named insured </em>by blood, marriage or adoption (including a ward or foster child).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428-29, 386 A.2d 433. What was also critical to the <em>Brokenbaugh </em>court was the economic dependence of the child on the named insured. <em>Id. </em>at 430, 386 A.2d 433. No such ward, foster child-parent relationship exists here, nor has it been claimed that plaintiff is economically dependent upon Jennifer. <em>See also Wood, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 610, 429 A.2d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
