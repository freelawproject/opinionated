Persons legally in possession of such firearms prior to the effective date of the statute could retain these weapons by obtaining the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ate registration. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:58-12. Included in the definition of \u201cassault firearm\u201d is \u201c[a] semi-automatic rifle with a fixed magazine capacity exceeding [fifteen] rounds.\u201d N.J.S.A 2C:39-lw(4). Defendant was convicted of \u201cknowingly\u201d having in his possession an assault firearm, a semi-automatic rifle with a magazine capacity of seventeen cartridges. He appeals, contending that the trial judge erred by rejecting his claims of mistake of law and mistake of fact, and by instructing the jury it could convict if it found he knowingly possessed the weapon even if he did not know its fixed capacity exceeded fifteen rounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We need not recount the facts at length. Defendant, an expert marksman who at one point was employed as a firearms instructor, won a Marlin semi-automatic rifle in the late 1980\u2019s by placing first in a police combat match. An avid gun collector, defendant placed the weapon in his safe. Defendant claimed that he neither inspected nor used the firearm. When the police recovered the gun from defendant\u2019s residence in December 1993, it still had the manufacturer\u2019s tags and the owner\u2019s manual attached to the trigger guard. The owner\u2019s manual indicated that the rifle could hold at least seventeen cartridges. Defendant claimed that he never read the manual. While conceding that he knew the rifle was a semi-automatic weapon, defendant contended that he was unaware that the firearm had a magazine capacity exceeding fifteen rounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">At trial, defendant advanced the defenses of mistake of law and mistake of fact. He asserted that he made diligent inquiry respecting whether the guns in his collection constituted \u201cassault firearms\u201d when the 1990 legislation was enacted and obtained the requisite registration for some of his weapons. Defendant testified that he did not register the Marlin rifle because he did not know its fixed capacity exceeded fifteen rounds. The trial judge barred the defenses of mistake of law and mistake of fact on the grounds that the statutory prohibition was clearly written and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>published, and that knowledge of the specific character of the weapon did not constitute an element of the offense. In response to a question propounded by the jury during its deliberations, the judge charged that defendant could be found guilty if he knowingly possessed the firearm but was unaware that its fixed capacity exceeded fifteen rounds. Defendant was convicted and placed on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Defendant couches his argument in terms of whether the trial judge erred by barring the defenses of mistake of law and mistake of fact. We find no merit in these arguments. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(2). As to the defense of mistake of law, defendant did not prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that he \u201cdiligently pursue[d] all means available to ascertain the meaning and application\u201d of the statutory proscription. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-4c(3). By its very terms, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-lw(4) defines an \u201cassault firearm\u201d as a \u201csemi-automatic rifle with a fixed magazine capacity exceeding [fifteen] rounds.\u201d The statutory language is \u201cneither vague nor unclear,\u201d and was not an issue for the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>State v. Elrose, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 556, 649 A.2d 1351 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The defense of mistake of fact suffered from much the same infirmity. The common law defense required not only that the defendant subjectively misperceive a fact critical to establishing the offense but also that the error be reasonable. <em>See State v. Bess, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>10, 16, 247 A.2d 669 (1968); <em>State v. Fair, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>77, 91, 211 A.2d 359 (1965). The Criminal Law Revision Commission recommended that the objective test be abrogated and that any \u201chonest\u201d error suffice to exonerate the defendant. <em>Final Report, of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>comment to 2C:2-4 at 52-53 (1971). Our Legislature rejected that proposal by requiring that the defendant \u201creasonably arrive[ ] at the conclusion underlying the mistake.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-4a. Defendant\u2019s failure to inspect the weapon or read the owner\u2019s manual to determine whether it fell within the statutory definition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>unreasonable as a matter of law. We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to submit the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The prosecutor candidly points out that the trial judge instructed the jury that defendant could be found guilty if he knowingly possessed the firearm but was unaware its fixed capacity exceeded fifteen rounds. The question squarely presented is whether the State was required to prove that the defendant knew the gun in his possession was an assault firearm. We hold that knowledge of the character of the weapon is not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5f provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny person who knowingly has in his possession an assault firearm is guilty of a crime of the third degree.\u201d The word \u201cknowingly\u201d thus modifies the phrase \u201chas in his possession.\u201d The Code defines \u201cpossession\u201d in terms of whether the \u201cpossessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control [of it] for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lc. The Code provides that \u201ca person acts knowingly with respect to the nature of his conduct ... if he is aware that his conduct is of that nature.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">We are satisfied that the Legislature intended to proscribe knowing possession, as distinguished from knowledge of the illegal character of the article possessed. <em>Cf. State v. Labato, </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>137, 148, 80 A.2d 617 (1951). In that context, \u201c[k]nowing possession is not to be confused with criminal intent or guilty knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 80 A.2d 617. \u201cAt common law, scienter [was] an indispensable element.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But it is within the power of the Legislature to declare an act criminal irrespective of the motive of the actor. <em>Ibid.; see also United States v. Freed, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>601, 610, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1112, 1118, 28 L.Ed.2d 356, 362 (1971); <em>United States v. Balint, </em>258 <em>U.S. </em>250, 254, 42 <em>S.Ct. </em>301, 303, 66 <em>L.Ed. </em>604, 606 (1922); <em>United States v. Holland, </em>810 F.2d 1215, 1223 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>1057, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2199, 95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>L.Ed.2d 854 (1987); <em>State v. Edwards, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4, 607 A.2d 1312 (App.Div.1992); <em>State v. Torres, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 13, 563 A.2d 1141 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We are concerned here with a statute dealing with gun control. \u201cNew Jersey has carefully constructed a \u2018grid\u2019 of regulations\u201d on the subject. <em>In re Two Seized Firearms, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>84, 88, 602 A.2d 728, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Sholtis v. New Jersey, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>823, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>75, 121 <em>L.Ed.2d 40 (1992). </em>This is an area in which \u201cregulations abound and inquiries are likely,\u201d and where the overarching purpose is to insure the public safety and protect against acts and threats of violence. <em>State v. Hatch, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>179, 184, 313 A.2d 797 (1973); <em>see also Burton v. Sills, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>86, 248 A.2d 521 (1968). \u201c[T]he dangers are so high and the regulations so prevalent that, on balance, the legislative branch may as a matter of sound public policy and without impairing any constitutional guarantees, declare the act itself unlawful without any further requirement of <em>mens rea </em>or its equivalent.\u201d <em>State v. Hatch, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 184-85, 313 A.2d 797. When dealing with guns, the citizen acts at his peril. In short, we view the statute as a regulatory measure in the interests of the public safety, premised on the thesis that one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of such a highly dangerous offensive weapon is proscribed absent the requisite license.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
