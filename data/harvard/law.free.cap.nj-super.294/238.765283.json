American Reliance Insurance Company (American Reliance) insures Ordemann under a policy in which she is a named insured and which covers her own vehicles. At the time of the accident, Ordemann was driving, as part of her employment, a van owned by her employer and insured by American Casualty Company (American Casualty). Ordemann, though not a named insured, nonetheless is an \u201cother insured\u201d under that policy. It is agreed that the statutory criteria for triggering the U.I.M. coverages of both policies are satisfied since the liability limits of the tortfeaser\u2019s policy is less than the separate U.I.M. limits of the American Reliance and the American Casualty policies. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>17:28-l.l(e). Thus, it is undisputed that the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle is an \u201cunderinsured vehicle\u201d and Ordemann is an \u201cunderinsured\u201d under the American Reliance policy and the American Casualty policy. The trial judge, however, concluded that the American Reliance policy was \u201cprimary.\u201d He did so not based upon the policies\u2019 respective \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses but, rather, based upon the discussion in <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Insurance Cos., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>397, 403-05, 658 A.2d 1246 (1995), characterizing the nature of U.I.M. coverage as \u201cpersonal\u201d to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">In our view <em>Aubrey </em>has no impact upon the circumstances here. It is not disputed by either of the insurers that Ordemann is an insured under both policies. More importantly in terms of whether <em>Aubrey </em>is dispositive, it is not disputed that she is an \u201cunderin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sured\u201d under her own policy as well as American Casualty\u2019s. These were not the circumstances in <em>Aubrey. </em>Plaintiff Aubrey did not qualify as an \u201cunderinsured\u201d with respect to her own policy because the U.I.M. limits thereof were not greater than the liability limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 403, 658 A.2d 1246. And she most assuredly could not be considered an under-insured with respect to the \u201cother policy\u201d (the Harleysville policy) because the Supreme Court held that she did not qualify as an insured under the liability provisions of that other policy. 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 658 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">There is no need, therefore, for us to grapple with the meaning and scope of <em>Aubrey </em>as was required in <em>Market Transition Facility of N.J. v. Parisi-Lusardi, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 681 A.2d 660 (App.Div.1996), and <em>Taylor v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593, 674 A.2d 634 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>376, 678 A.2d 716 (1996). Unlike <em>Aubrey, </em>the circumstances here involve multiple policies that provide U.I.M. coverage because Ordemann qualifies as an underinsured under those policies. It is the terms of those policies, therefore, that govern. <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 260, 624 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1993) (\u201cthe manner in which multiple policies providing U.I.M. coverage are to be applied in a given circumstance requires the parties to turn to the provisions of the respective policies rather than the statute.\u201d). <em>See Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994); <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Atlantic Employers Ins. Co., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 611 A.2d 165 (Law Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">As to the issue of whether such coverage is primary, co-primary, or excess, we look to the terms of each policy. <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 419, 638 A.2d 924. We need not duplicate the critical terms in the respective policies. Suffice it to say we have compared them to the terms construed in <em>Royal. </em>They are identical. We see no basis for reaching a different holding than that in <em>Royal. </em>Consistent therewith, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>hold that the American Casualty policy is primary, whereas the American Reliance policy is excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
