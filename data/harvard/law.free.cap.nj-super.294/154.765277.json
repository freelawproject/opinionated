Defendants were convicted in the Atlantic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>City Municipal Court. On de novo review in the Law Division, defendants\u2019 convictions were affirmed. Each was sentenced to a probationary term of one year and assessed a fine of $250, along with the appropriate V.C.C.B. penalty and Assessment for Safe Neighborhood Services. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The State\u2019s proofs established that both defendants engaged in disruptive behavior while playing blackjack at the Showboat Casino Hotel on several occasions between November 29, 1992 and May 1, 1993. The disruptive behavior included using loud and abusive language directed at casino personnel, interfering with access to the blackjack tables by other patrons, and making derogatory comments to patrons about the bets they placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Following an incident on May 1, 1993, a casino official advised both defendants that they would no longer be welcomed to play blackjack. Defendants, however, were not barred from the casino. They were welcomed to come into the casino and participate in other games and activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">On May 2,1993, defendants returned to the blackjack table and demanded to play. They sat at the table for a period of forty minutes after being asked to leave and refusing to do so. Thereafter, defendants were charged with defiant trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">On this appeal defendants contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">I. <em>THE DEFENDANTS WERE NEVER GIVEN ACTUAL COMMUNICATION AGAINST TRESPASS AS REQUIRED BYN.J.SA 2C:18-S(b)(l) [SIC],</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">II. <em>THE CONVICTIONS VIOLATE THE HOLDING OF STATE v.

We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Garofolo in his oral opinion of October 20, 1995. We add the following additional comments concerning defense counsel\u2019s interpretation of <em>State v. Morse, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 647 A.2d 495 (Law Division 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">On appeal, at oral argument, counsel for defendants urged that <em>Morse, </em>establishes a maximum period of twenty-four hours that a patron may be excluded from a casino. The language in <em>Morse, </em>relied upon by counsel provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">Clearly, if a patron acts disorderly, a casino can lawfully exclude the patron for that day. However, fairness mandates that when the patron attempts to return to the casino and acts in accordance with all lawful conditions imposed, the patron cannot be excluded, as he is not interfering with any legitimate business interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 134, 647 A.2d 495.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">We disagree with defense counsel\u2019s interpretation of <em>Morse. </em>First, we are satisfied that the quoted language is dicta, and was not necessary for the determination or holding in <em>Morse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Second, that language in <em>Morse </em>cannot be construed or (understood or taken) to overrule <em>Uston v. Resorts Int\u2019l, Hotel, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>163, 445 A.2d 370, (1982). <em>Uston </em>sets forth the common law \u201cright of property owners to exclude from their premises those whose actions \u2018disrupt the regular and essential operations of the premises,\u2019 or threaten the security of the premises and its occupants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 445 A.2d 370 (citations omitted). At some point the property owner may even have a duty to remove the disorderly, intoxicated or repetitive petty offender and bar them from its entire premises. <em>Ibid. </em>The common law right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>property owners to. exclude disruptive patrons, or patrons who threaten the security of the premises and its occupants, is not limited to a per se twenty-four hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Finally, the Casino Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-1 to -210, recognizes the \u201ccommon law right [of a casino licensee] to exclude or eject permanently from its casino hotel any person who disrupts the operations of its premises, threatens the security of its premises or its occupants, or is disorderly or intoxicated.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-71.1. Although this portion of the statute was enacted after the events that gave rise to defendants\u2019 convictions, it applies here because the language is merely a codification of existing common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\"> Proper cite is <em>State v. Morse, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 647 A.2d 495 (Law Div.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
