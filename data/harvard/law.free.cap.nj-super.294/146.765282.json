It is undisputed that the local authorities maintain the HACs on file, as well as a list of the participating landlords, properties and the rent subsidies distributed under the Section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Plaintiff demanded disclosure of the HACs or select information contained therein under New Jersey\u2019s Right to Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -4, and the common law. In a comprehensive reported opinion, <em>see Lakewood Residents Ass\u2019n v. Township of Lakewood, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 682 A.2d 1232 (Law Div.1994), Judge Serpentelli determined that these documents were subject to disclosure under the Right to Know Law, provided that specific information pertaining to the identity of the tenants and the \u201ctenants\u2019 financial matters\u201d was redacted. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 682 A.2d 1232. He rejected defendants\u2019 argument that pertinent federal statutes and attendant regulations precluded disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 682 A.2d 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The judge first reasoned that the exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552, and the exceptions to the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act), 5 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 552a, affording confidentiality were inapplicable because defendants are not considered \u201cfederal agencies\u201d under those statutes, <em>see </em>5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 551(1), \u00a7 552(e) and \u00a7 552a(a)(l); <em>St. Michael\u2019s Convalescent Hosp. v. California, </em>643 F.2d 1369, 1373-74 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Lakewood Residents Ass\u2019n, supra, 294 N.J.Super. </em>at 215-18, 682 A.2d 1232. Alternatively, the judge concluded that even if defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>dants were deemed \u201cagencies\u201d subject to the federal statutes, the pertinent exemptions and exceptions under those federal laws were inapplicable to plaintiffs demand for disclosure of the HACs. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 682 A.2d 1232. Specifically, he rejected defendants\u2019 argument that 5 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 552(b)(4) of FOIA governed. <em>Ibid. </em>Section 552(b)4 exempts from FOIA \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\u201d Based on the legislative history of the exemption and the federal courts\u2019 narrow application of it, Judge Serpentelli reasoned that the exemption was \u201cintended to deal with documentary matters wholly unrelated to the HAC[s] involved here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 682 A.2d 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, the judge rejected defendants\u2019 argument that the HACs and data fell within the exception to \u201cpublic records\u201d under New Jersey\u2019s Right to Know Law, which protects documents deemed confidential pursuant to \u201cany Federal law, regulation or order.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-2. Defendants argued that two federal regulations, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 750.20 (1995) and 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 760.20(a) (1995), preclude disclosure of the HACs. Section 750.20 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">The collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of [Social Security numbers] and [Employer Identification numbers] obtained pursuant to this part, and of any information derived therefrom, must be conducted, to the extent applicable, in compliance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and all other provisions of Federal, State, and local law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Section 760.20(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">The collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of employee income information and wage and claim information under this part shall be conducted, to the extent applicable, in compliance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and all other provisions of Federal, State, and local law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The judge rejected defendants\u2019 argument, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">The difficulty with the defendants\u2019 argument is that it urges the court to give an overly expansive reading to language which is very specific. It is evident that \u00a7 750.20 is intended (as are many other federal regulations) to protect unwarranted disclosure of social security numbers or employer identification numbers. The potential for abuse of such information is well known. However, the release of the HAC[s] with the social security number redacted by court order, will not in any way violate the regulation or subject the [Public Housing Authorities] to the feared penalties. The same can be said with respect to \u00a7 760.20. Even assuming it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>any relevance to this case given its applicability to \u201cemployee\u201d income, wage and claim information, it is not clear how that data would be pertinent to the HAC[s] contents. The only connection is the defendants\u2019 repeated concern that tenant wage information can be surmised through the discovery that a tenant is receiving a Section 8 program subsidy. That perception will be addressed later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\"><em>[Lakewood Residents Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 222-23, 682 A.2d 1232.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Thus, determining that the HACs were \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file\u201d by defendants, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-2, the judge deemed them subject to disclosure. <em>Lakewood Residents Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 224, 682 A.2d 1282. He noted that plaintiff had consented to redaction of information concerning the tenants\u2019 identity and financial worth, and allowed defendants the option of providing a list of the landlords, their properties and rent subsidies in lieu of the HACs. <em>Ibid </em>With these safeguards in place, Judge Serpentelli conceded that, notwithstanding the redactions, plaintiff \u201cmay be able to determine\u201d the identity of the tenants and their approximate incomes. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the judge noted that \u201cthere is no clear showing that this feared result, and the \u2018stigma' which the defendants claim would automatically follow, is anything more than theoretical or interposed as a means to frustrate access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 682 A.2d 1232. Further, the judge accepted at face value plaintiffs representation that its sole purpose in obtaining this information is to \u201clook[ 1 for potential conflicts of interest in those landlords receiving subsidy payments[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>We </em>affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Serpentelli is his well-reasoned opinion. We add the following comments concerning an issue raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Defendants now contend that 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(6) (Exemption 6) of FOIA precludes disclosure. Exemption 6 permits the withholding of \u201cpersonnel and medical files and <em>similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Defendants note that the phrase \u201csimilar files\u201d has been held to apply to a \u201cwide variety of personal information.\u201d <em>See Professional Programs Group v. Department of Commerce, </em>29 <em>F. </em>3d 1349 (9th Cir.1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(names and addresses of persons registered to take patent bar examination); <em>Federal Labor Relations Auth. v. Department of Defense, </em>984 F.2d 370 (10th Cir.1993) (federal employees\u2019 names and home addresses); <em>Local 3, Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Elec. Workers v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>845 F.2d 1177 (2nd Cir.1988) (employer list containing employees\u2019 names, addresses, birthdates, Social Security numbers, sex, marital status, union membership, wages and tax information); <em>Carter v. United States Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>830 F.2d 388 (D.C.Cir.1987) (files containing records of dismissed disciplinary investigations that would lead, indirectly, to the identification of current investigation subjects); and <em>see Lamont v. Department of Justice, </em>475 <em>F.Supp. </em>761 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (FBI internal security records containing names and identifying information of private citizens and government employees).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Defendants also stress that \u201cwatchdog\u201d groups such as plaintiff have been denied access to records under Exemption 6 when the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in disclosure does not outweigh the significant privacy interests of others in the requested information, <em>Painting and Drywall Work Preservation Fund, Inc. v. Department of Housing and Urban Dev., </em>936 F.2d 1300, 1301 (D.C.Cir.1991), or where the public nature of the claimant\u2019s interest is doubtful, <em>Multnomah County Medical Soc\u2019y. v. Scott, </em>825 F.2d 1410, 1414-16 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u201cDisclosure, not secrecy, is the policy objective of FOIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1413. Under FOIA, \u201cthe strong presumption in favor of disclosure places the burden on the agency to justify the withholding of any requested documents.\u201d <em>Department of State v. Ray, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>164, 173, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>541, 546, 116 L.Ed.2d 526, 540 (1991) (disclosure of names and other identifying information contained in interviews with Haitian aliens returned to Haiti held to be an unwarranted invasion of returnees\u2019 privacy, since information identified returnees, related to their marital, family and employment status and would subject them to potential mistreatment in Haiti). Thus, Exemption 6 requires the agency to demonstrate that the individual\u2019s right of privacy should predominate over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>basic policy favoring disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 175, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 547-48, 116 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 541. <em>See also Federal Labor Relations Auth., supra, </em>984 F.2d at 374; <em>Multnomah County Medical Soc\u2019y, supra, </em>825 F.2d at 1413.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Generally, the federal courts consider four factors in determining whether disclosure constitutes a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d under Exemption 6. 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(6). The factors include: (1) the plaintiffs interest in disclosure; (2) the public\u2019s interest in disclosure; (3) the degree of the invasion of personal privacy, and (4) the availability of any alternative means of obtaining the requested information. <em>Professional Programs Group, supra, </em>29 F.3d at 1354. <em>See also Van Bourg, Allen, Weinberg &amp; Roger v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>728 F.2d 1270, 1273-74 (9th Cir.1984). In any event, withholding information to prevent \u201cspeculative\u201d harm contravenes Congress\u2019 firm policy favoring disclosure. <em>Carter, supra, </em>830 <em>F.2d </em>at 391. \u201cThe legislative history is clear that Exemption 6 was directed at threats to privacy interests more palpable than mere possibilities.\u201d <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. </em>352, 380 n. 19, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1592, 1608 n. 19, 48 L.Ed.2d 11, 32 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">During oral argument before us, plaintiff abandoned its demand for disclosure of the level of rent subsidies paid on behalf of individual Section 8 families. Thus, it currently seeks only the names of the landlords and the addresses of their subsidized rental properties. Consequently, the identity of the Section 8 recipients may not be \u201ceasily\u201d obtained by plaintiff. <em>Carter, supra, </em>830 F.2d at 391. Defendants\u2019 concern that plaintiff may seek out the identity of the recipients by visiting the addresses disclosed in the HACs is of doubtful merit, particularly in view of the fact, as Judge Serpentelli observed, that plaintiff has no interest in any personal information concerning the tenants. <em>Lakewood Residents Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>294 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 224, 682 A.2d 1232 (slip op. at 19). Defendants\u2019 claim that the identity of the tenants may be determined by use of a \u201creverse phone book\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>sheer speculation, given the fact that such a resource is not readily available.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Moreover, the Social Security numbers of the recipients have been redacted. Also, as stated, no financial or subsidy information will be disclosed which could form the basis upon which to calculate the tenants\u2019 gross income, the public disclosure of which could stigmatize the recipients due to their limited resources. Indeed, the public interest advanced by plaintiff focuses upon the potential conflicts of interest of the landlords, not on the financial wherewithal of the tenants. In short, absent here is the disclosure of specific \u201chighly personal information,\u201d as in <em>Ray, supra, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>at 175, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 547-48, 116 L.Ed.2d at 541, which could subject innocent third parties to public embarrassment or political retaliation and persecution. Defendants have failed to overcome the strong presumption under FOIA favoring disclosure of the redacted HACs or alternatively, lists of select information contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\"> The Section 8 program refers to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437 to 1437x.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
