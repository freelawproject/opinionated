Minor.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b79-4\">[Thursday, <em>October </em>17, 1799.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-3\">If an infant becomes security in a twelve months\u2019 replevy bond, a Court of Equity will grant a perpetual injunction, even against an assignee without notice <em>s</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-6\">For the infant in such case, having no day in the Court of Law, the application to the Court of Equity is regular.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\"><em>Mien </em>brought a bill in the High Court of Chancery, to be relieved against a twelve months\u2019 replevy bond, and stated that upon the 29th of <em>October, 1788, </em>he became security for <em>Joseph Watson </em>and <em>Daniel Hawes </em>in a twelve months\u2019 bond to <em>Payne, </em>who was assignee of <em>Durracott, </em>administrator of <em>Coles, </em>That at the time of entering into the said bond, the plaintiff was an infant under the age of twenty-one years, to wit, only 18 or 19 years of age; and therefore, that the said bond was void as to him. That <em>Payne </em>had assigned the bond to <em>Minor, </em>who had sued execution on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">The answer of <em>Minor </em>states, that he, as attorney for <em>Payne, </em>obtained the judgment on which the said twelve months\u2019 bond was given; that the right to the same, soon after devolved on <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Craxighton, </em>and <em>Payne </em>having removed out of the State, the defendant as his attorney, assigned the bond to a third person; who reassigned to him, in order to enable the defendant to make the necessary affidavit far obtaining the execution. That he knows nothing of the plaintiff; and, therefore, cannot say whether he be of full age or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">The infancy of the plaintiff, at the time of giving the bond, was proved. The Court of Chancery dismissed the bill with costs; and the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-10\"><em>Duval, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-11\">The plaintiff was an infant at the time of executing <em>the </em>bond, and, therefore, was not bound by it, unless some fraud had appeared; and, there is no proof of any. It will be no excuse that the Sheriff did not know his age, because it was his duty to have enquired and informed himself. At all events, his ignorance will not he allowed to prejudice the infant. The appellant came rightly into the Court of Equity for relief; for, the twelve months having elapsed, the plaintiff could have sued execution on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>his own affidavit, without application to the Court, and, therefore, a bill in equity was his only relief.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-4\"><em>\u00abAppellee\u2019s </em>counsel.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzS\">Although, an infant is not generally bound by his acts ' under age, yet he is, in all cases of fraud and deception; for, his age should be considered as a shield for his defence, and not as a sword for destruction: Therefore, although he may, by this plea, protect himself from injury, yet he cannot use it for the purposes of injustice towards others. His obtruding himself in the present ease, upon the public officer, as a person of competency to contract, in order to hinder justice and procure a restitution of the property to the prejudice of others, was a fraud and deception which renders him liable on the bond; especially to innocent assignees and others unacquainted with his age; and, who therefore, are in no fault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b80-7\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">Delivered the resolution of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">That as the plaintiff had no day in the Court of Law, his application to a Court of Equity was perfectly regular;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and, the jurisdiction being admitted, there could be no question upon the merits: Which clearly entitled the plaintiff to relief. That, therefore, the decree was to be reversed, and a perpetual injunction awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">[* And see <em>Spotswood </em>v. <em>Higgenbotham, </em>6 Munf. 313.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
