At any rate, the appellee may relinquish the damages in this Court, and take a simple affirmance of the judgment without the 10 <em>per cent, </em>damages, and then by the terms of the judgment which is strictly conformable to the directions of the act of Assembly, the appellee will be entitled to the 15 <em>per cent, </em>damages.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b194-7\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A4v\">Are you contented to take a simple affirmance without any damages for retarding-the execution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\"><em>Wickham. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\"><em>PER CUR. </em>Affirm the judgment then, without any damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
