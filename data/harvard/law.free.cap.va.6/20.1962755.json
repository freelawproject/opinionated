Where the Bill ifl Chancery is defective, not only for want of proper parties, but in other respects, so that no decree for the plaintiff can be entered, a decree dismissing the Bill altogether, ought to be affirmed:-hut, if it appear probable that something might berecovered upon a new bill properly drawn, such affirmance should be without prejudice to any other suit the plaintiff may be advised to bring.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">The appellees as co-heirs of William Icennon, filed a Bill in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Richmond District against Baskerville and others, stating that R~en~om, in December 1767, executed a deed of trust to Baker and others, upon certain property, including a tract of land called the Copper Mine tract, of 4800 acres, in Buckingham, which was, afterwards, in .WIa~j 1790, re-surveyed and patented to the said Baker and others, for the purposes of the deed of trust; by the terms of which, the said~ tract of land was not to be resorted to, unless absolutely nccessary;-that it was not necessary to resort to the said land, which had descended to the complainants as co-heirs of Icennon; that Baskeriiille and others had, upon pretences unknown to the complainants, taken possession of sundry parts of the land; and therefore the prayer of the Bill was to recover the possession; for an account of the profits; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">The defendants by their answer excepted t~ th~ jurisdiction of the Court, because the matters in the Bill were cognizable at law; and also claimed the land as purchasers, without notice, from William Gadbcrry, to whom it was pateiited, Julie 25th, 1787.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">It appeared by Exhibits, that a Patent for the Land actually issued to Gadberri~ on that day; and that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>fendants liad deeds from him: that the survey, for <em>Baker </em>and others the trustees aforesaid, was made <em>in June </em>1788, and the Patent to them issued <em>May 15th </em>1790, reciting, <em>\u201c </em>that <em>James-Christian </em>had made a survey of 5100 acres, \u201c 'which <em>William Kennon </em>had <em>caveated, </em>and obtained, or \u00ab the 6th of June 1768, a judgment of the Council in his favour, with an order that a patent should issue to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ajf\">The deposition of <em>John Patterson, </em>Surveyor of Buckingham, proved, that he surveyed the land for <em>Gadherry, </em>some years past; and, at that time, <em>Gadherry </em>and <em>Baskerville </em>informed him it was called <em>Kennon\u2019s Mine Trad.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-6\">A Memorandum from the Land Office was produced in the following words. \u201c 6 June 1768. <em>Grant to Wm.Kin- \u201c non Lands now in Buckingham. </em>Find no grant in the \u201c name of <em>Wrn. Kennon </em>from 1764 to 1774. <em>John Daven- \u201c port, </em>Clerk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">Chancellor Tayxob dismissed the Bill; and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-8\"><em>Call </em>for the Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-K\">The decree is erroneous, 1., because the judgment on the <em>Caveat, </em>and the Deed of Trust, (which was duly recorded,) were implied notice to <em>Gadherry </em>and those who purchased under him; and therefore the patent to him, and the deeds to the persons who purchased under him, were void against <em>Kennon </em>and his heirs;\u2014and 2., because the <em>name, </em>and general notoriety of the land, were likewise notice, which affected <em>Gadherry </em>and the purchasers from him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-9\">In <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm and wife, </em>2 <em>Munf. </em>257, it was decided that the inchoate right to a Patent, obtained by a decision in favour pf a <em>Caveator, </em>is not barred by length of time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-10\">\n<em>Wickham contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX4\">This case presents no real difficulty. The circumstances are stronger in favour of the appellees, who claim by the prior patent, than those by which such patent prevailed in <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, 4 Munf. 155, </em>and <em>Gooseman </em>v. <em>Martin, Ibid. 533.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-11\">Such a Bill as this of the appellants, can furnish no foundation for a decree.\u2014There is no allegation that <em>Kennon </em>ever was in possession, or that he, or any claiming under him, ever set foot on the land. When <em>Gad-berry </em>made his entry, it appeared waste and unappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ated. How was <em>he </em>bound to take notice of the proceed-in? before the Council, upon <em>Kennon\u2019s Caveat </em>against <em>Christian </em>in the year <em>1767 </em>?\u2014Ifhe was so bound, was not <em>Kennon </em>equally bound to take notice of <em>Gadberry\u2019s </em>proceeding to get his patent?'\u2014He should have <em>caveated him, </em>according to the decision in <em>Noland </em>v Cromwell.\u2014Even if <em>Gadberry </em>had known of the judgment in <em>1767, </em>he had reason to believe the claim abandoned, since <em>ICennonhui </em>taken no steps to get a grant, and had not taken possession;\u2014but if <em>he </em>had notice, the present <em>appellees </em>are entitled to protection; they being purchasers without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-3\">In <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, </em>there were various features distinguishing that case from this; particularly, continued <em>possession </em>by the party in whose favour the old judgment was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-4\">Another defect in the Bill is, that the Trustees are not made parties. This in fact is nothing more than an <em>Ejectment </em>brought in <em>Chancery </em>by the <em>cesiuy que trust </em>against <em>&amp; third </em>person, praying that he may be turned out of possession;\u2014alledging satisfaction of the Deed, and a resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff. Surely the suit should have been against the Trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">Different parcels are held by different defendants-.'\u2014'yet, by this proceeding, they are all joined in one Ejectment, and made to defend each other\u2019s titles.\u2014This too is wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\"><em>Wirt </em>in reply. This is not an <em>Ejectment </em>in Chancery. The legal title was in the trustees, not in the complainants, who therefore could not bring Ejectment, but were driven to a Court of Equity for relief. If proper parties wrere not made, the chancellor should not have dismissed the Bill, but granted leave to amend it; whereupon, if such amendment had not been made, the Bill might <em>then </em>have been dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">The cases of <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>and <em>Gooseman </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>did not relate to ancient claims under Orders of Council, but only to claims under the Land Law of 1779.\u2014 The Orders of Council were kept alive by Acts of Assembly, repeatedly, giving time to make surveys upon them. <em>Gadberry </em>therefore had no right, by his Entry, to prevent the appellants from getting the advantage intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ed for them by those Acts. It is evident that, when lie made that Entry, he knew of Kennon's previous right, and ought to have given him, or his heirs, notice; if which had been done, a Caveat might have been filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1D\">The Memorandum from the Land Office seems to imply that a Grant was issued to Kennon~, which now cannot be found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYIU\">The Decree ought to be reversed, and cause sent back, lbr new parties, and, I hope, with leave to make other amendments to the Bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO-\">Wick/zam. Where the statements in the Bill are so defective that the Court cannot decree upon it, such defect is not cured by the additional defect of the want of proper parties. The Court should affirm the decree, because the Bill was properly dismissed:-but the course in such case is, that if it appear probable that something may he recovered, by a new Bill stating the case pro. perly, the Court will add a clause declaring, that such affirmance shall be witliont prejndice to any new suit that may be brought to recover the Property ~fl controversy~</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Azf\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"Aa0\">pronounced the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">On consideration of this case, the Court is of opinion to affirm the decree:-but this affirm ance is to be without pr~judice to any other suit the appellants may be advised tp bring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
