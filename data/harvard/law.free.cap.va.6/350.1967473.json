That there are 326/. <em>5s. Id. </em>of outstanding debts. That the plaintiffs left with the defendants a cask described to contain snuff-boxes, and directed some to be forwarded to <em>Baltimore, </em>to <em>M\u2019Grea </em>and <em>Deanes, </em>to be left with the vendue-master on account of the plaintiffs, which the defendants complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-14\">The Court of Chancery referred the accounts to a commissioner; who reported, that he had appointed, at the instance of the plaintiff\u2019s agent, the 27th of <em>September, </em>1793, for carrying the decretal order into effect; notice of which not being served on the defendants on the 6th of <em>November, </em>1795, he appointed the 27th of that month for the purpose, but, the defendants, failing to attend, he appointed the 20th of <em>September, </em>1796; on the 14th of which month, the plaintiff\u2019s agent and <em>James Deane </em>attended, and <em>Deane </em>having filed his affidavit that <em>Rose, </em>a material witness, was absent on a trading voyage, further time was allowed. That the commissioner afterwards appointed the 21st of <em>April, </em>1797; that a notice to this effect, addressed to <em>James </em>and <em>Thomas Deane, </em>was served on <em>Francis B. Deane, </em>who appeared on the 26th of <em>May, </em>and said the notice was not legal as to <em>James </em>and <em>Thomas Deane, </em>because he, <em>Francis B. Deane, </em>was not a partner of the house of <em>James </em>and <em>Thomas Deane, </em>when the transaction happened, although he was at the then time of making the objection,, a partner in the business. That the said <em>Francis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Deane </em>then agreed, that if the report was postponed to enable <em>James </em>and <em>Thomas Deane </em>to take the deposition of <em>Rose, </em>the report might be made to the <em>September </em>term, and that a decree should be entered up at that term, and that the said <em>James </em>and <em>Thomas </em>would write to that effect, but, as they had failed, he proceeded to report, making a balance of 4957 15s. <em>3d. </em>due from the defendants to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-3\">The defendants excepted to the report: 1. Because the notice was not legal: <em>2. </em>That the defendants were debited with the outstanding debts. 3. That no commission was allowed the plaintiff. 4. That the defendants were debited with 947 3s. <em>9d. Pennsylvania </em>currency, for a box of hardware.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\">A witness examined for the plaintiff states, that in 1785 or 1786, he received from the defendants a large case said to contain hardware; but no invoice or instructions to sell the same were given. That it was afterwards taken away and sent, (as he understood) to Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">The Court of Chancery re-committed the report. And the commissioner in his second report, <em>stated, </em>that he appointed the 3rd of <em>March, </em>1798: That he received a letter from <em>James Deane, </em>requesting a postponement until the 7th, when he attended with an affidavit to prove that <em>Rose </em>had sailed for <em>New York, </em>and prayed .a continuance until he could procure his testimony. But, as it was not proved that any steps to take his deposition had been taken, he refused the continuance. That <em>Francis Deane, </em>on the 26th <em>May, </em>attended; and on behalf of the other defendants agreed, that if the report was delayed till <em>September, </em>a decree might then be entered up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">There is an affidavit on the 13th February, 1798, stat\u00bb ing, that <em>Rose </em>had sailed from <em>New York </em>to <em>London, </em>and was to remain there until <em>April </em>next, and that the deponent has reason to believe he will return <em>to Philadelphia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">There is an invoice of the box of hardware, signed by the plaintiffs, which is headed as follows: Contents of 1 box of sundries marked A. No. 20, consigned to Messrs. <em>M\u2019Grea fy Deanes </em>at Baltimore, with the prices affixed to in order to direct them at the sale of public vendue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">Upon the coming in of the second report, which made no alteration in the first, the Court of Chancery decreed the defendants to pay the whole 4957 15s. <em>3d. </em>with interest on 4397 11s. <em>Id, </em>from the 15th of <em>April, </em>1790, until paid. From which decree, the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Call, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">The notice was insufficient; for, the law requiring actual notice to the party, or a written notice to be left with some free person at the dwelling-house, one of those requisites must be complied with; which has not been done in the present case. Further time ought to have been allowed the appellants, to procure the testimony of their witness, as they state him to have been material. The box of hardware was sent to <em>Baltimore </em>-according to the directions which had been given; and there is no proof that it ever came to the hands of the appellants afterwards. Of course, they ought not to be charged' with it. The appellants were justifiable in selling on credit, and, therefore, the plaintiffs should bear the loss of insolvencies, if any, and the decree should have been, that the balance, in their hands, should be dischargeable in the bonds and debts due, for the sale of the goods consigned. \u25a0</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-9\"><em>Duval, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">Contended that the notice was sufficient upon the circumstances of the case. That time enough had been allowed the appellants to take the testimony of their witness. That the evidence shewed, that the box .of hardware was taken away by the order of the appellants. And that no regard should be had to the objection concerning insolvencies; because none had been shewn to exist, from 1786, (the date of the sales of the goods, as appears by the commissioner\u2019s report, and the defendant\u2019s own account) to this time: which is fourteen years.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b372-11\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"At-q\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">On the principal question, whether the Court of Chancery erred in not giving a further indulgence to the appellants, on account of his witness <em>Hickman Rose, </em>the Court have no difficulty. The commissioner had indulged them from 1792, to 1797; and, during that time, the witness, who was a sea-faring man, was going abroad and returning to <em>America </em>from time to time; and yet it does not appear, that the appellants had taken any steps to provide for taking his deposition, whilst he should be in <em>America.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>But, the principal dispute was, whether he should be accountable for the outstanding debts ? On which subject, it does not appear that <em>Rose </em>was material. And, above all, it is remarkable, that they never, in the five years of litigation, rendered an account of those debts, stating which had been collected, or remained due; and, whether any of the debtors, and who of them, were insolvents; which was in their own power, and which they ought to have rendered: Therefore, the Court is of opinion, that they ought to stand chargeable for the amount;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and, that so far, there is no error in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">But, as to the sum of 75l. <em>7s. Virginia money, </em>allowed by the commissioner for a chest of hardware, that article is not sufficiently supported by the testimony; and ought not, at present, to be allowed; but, as there seems some colour for the demand, that it ought to be left open for further enquiry. Therefore, that the decree, as to so much, ought to be reversed, with liberty to the appellees to make further proof, if they can, for establishing that part .of their demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Court then considered the question,' whether the decree as to the remaining claim was right, in continuing the interest to the time of payment, instead of the time of entering the decree ?</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The case of <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Clinch, </em>ante, 253, has been reviewed; and the question examined upon principle and authority: And upon the fullest investigation we are unanimously of opinion, that in all cases of simple contract, not bearing interest in their original, but on which, at law, interest is given by juries in the way of damages, the interest in equity can only be continued to tfi\u00e9 time of entering the final decree; and in the present case, the Court fix the interest to the period of entering the decree, on that part of the demand, which is affirmed. We are satisfied, that many decrees, for this contingent interest, have been affirmed; but, they passed <em>sub silentio, </em>and never were considered until the cause of <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Clinch, </em>which is now approved of, and considered as giving the rule in future, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALn8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>\u2018 </em>The Court is opinion, that there is error, in so much \u00b0f the said decree as allows the appellees seventy-five pounds seven shillings, for a chest of hardware and the interest charged by the commissioner and accruing thereon, that article not being sufficiently established by the testimony in the cause; that there is also error in so much of the said decree as to the residue of the demand, which omits to allow the commissions for collecting the outstanding debts charged to the appellants and which continues the interest thereon to the time of payment, instead of computing it to the time of the decree and making the recovery to be of the aggregate of principal and interest. Therefore, so much of the said decree, as is herein stated to be erroneous, is to be reversed with costs, and the residue affirmed, with this direction, that the commissions for collecting as aforesaid be allowed, and interest be computed on the balance to the time of entering the final decree, (as to that part,) in the said High Court of Chancery, in pursuance hereof, the appellants having unjustly delayed the final decree, by their appeal to this Court: But, the appellees are to be at liberty to make further proof of the article aforesaid, in the said High Court of Chancery, within a reasonable time to be limited by the said Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">[* See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Moody </em>et al. 17 Mass.
