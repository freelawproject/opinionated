The </em>defendant plead payment by his decedent; and fully administered, except as to 861.15s. 10i, The plaintiff took issue; and at a subsequent Court, by consent of the parties, the declaration was withdrawn, and a declaration upon the same bond was filed in the name of <em>Peter Eppes, </em>son and heir at law and devisee of <em>Peter Eppes, </em>deceased: Which assigned for breach of the condition, a recovery, and eviction, by <em>Demoville </em>and his wife, who was grand-daughter and heir of the said <em>Temple Eppes, </em>deceased. Whereupon, without any other pleadings, a jury were charged, who found a verdict for the plaintiff, which was set aside on the defendant\u2019s motion, and a new trial awarded. <em>At </em>a future term; another jury were charged, without any further pleadings, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, \u201c for the debt in the declaration mentioned to be discharged by the payment of six hundred and seventy-nine pounds and one penny damages, the value of the assets in the hands of the defendant.\u201d The defendant moved to arrest the judgment, and for cause assigned, that the action of the plaintiff, <em>&lt;( </em>is founded on a bond given to his ancestor, whereas by law no such action is maintainable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>by the heir on a penalty: the penalty of the bond being sum in gross, which after the death of the original obligee, could only be sued for by his personal representative.\u2019\u2019 The District Court gave judgment for the defendant; fi\u2019om which judgment, the plaintiff appealed <em>to </em>this Qourt,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-5\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">It is clear, that an action of covenant would have lain for the heir on account of the eviction, which happened in his own time and not in that of his ancestor. But, there is no real diffei\u2019ence between an action of debt and an action of covenant in a case like this. For, whatever form the instrument may wear, it is still a covenant; and an action of debt founded on it, is substantially an action of covenant: Because, by the act of Assembly, the plaintiff cannot, by bringing an action of debt, have his penalty: he can only have the damages assessed by the jury; which' puts him, in that respect, in the same situation, as if he had brought an action of covenant: But, to put him completely so, instead of being confined to one breach only, as formerly, he is at liberty to assign as many as he thinks proper, and he is to have a <em>scire facias </em>for new causes of action as they arise: In all which respects, it exactly resembles covenant. So, that, in fact, it is substantially an action to recover, not a stipulated certain sum, but uncertain damages for the violation of the contract, in proportion to the loss sustained: Which is the essence of an action of covenant. It is, therefore, an action of debt in name, but of covenant in effect. It is an action, which in form, affects to assert the penalty, but which in substance, can only enforce damages commensurate to the injury. The diffei\u2019ence, therefore, between the two actions, in cases of this kind, is imaginary, and not real.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">The bond, in this case, was a covenant which ran with the land, for the benefit of the heir; and, there is nothing personal in it: But, the owner of the land is entitled to all advantages ai\u2019ising from it. The damages ai'e in lieu of the land; which belonged to the heir, and were never personal assets: But, the condition being broken in the time of .the heir, and not in the life-time of his father, the heir was the only person entitled to redress, and the* executor had no cause of action. For, the covenant being knit to the estate, according to the expression of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>writers, descended on the heir; and, he alone could take advantage of it. 3 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 453, <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.] <em>[Lougher </em>v. <em>Williams,] 2 </em>Lev. <em>92, </em>1 Ventr. 175, S. C.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-3\">The analogy between the case of a <em>Nomine Pcense </em>put in <em>Bacon (ub. sup.) </em>and the case at bar, is particularly strong. For, that is a penalty as well as this; that is a sum certain, and so is this; that is a security for payment of a descendible rent, this of a descendible title; that goes to the heir as incident to the inheritance, and this upon the same principle must go to the heir also, as being equally annexed to the inheritance. But, it would be idle to say, that he should have the right and not the remedy to assert it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">Upon principle, therefore, nothing is more clear than that the action is sustainable; and, if there be no precedent of an action of debt brought by an heir in such a case, it is believed that no decision to .the contrary can be produced: In which case, the principle surely ought to prevail.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-10\">The heir cannot bring debt on a bond to the ancestor, although the condition may respect lands. For, it is a <em>chose in action, </em>and vests in the executor, as the <em>obligation is </em>for a sum in gross, and the condition is for the benefit of the obligor. It is, therefore, <em>debitum in prsesenti. </em>Litt. <em>Sect. </em>512; and a release of a personal action would discharge it. <em>Co. Litt. 292, (b). </em>The mere right to the damages, if it be admitted, that they belong to the heir, will not alter the rule, and give him' an action of debt upon the bond. For, there can be no doubt that the executor is entitled to the money due on a mortgage, and yet he cannot bring ejectment for the lands; but, the heir must do it: \u2019 Which clearly proves, that the legal distinctions are preserved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-12\">If a bond be given to A. with condition to enfeoff B., and the condition is broken, B. cannot sue upon the bond, although the condition is for his benefit. So if there be a bond to A. for payment of a sum of money to B., the latter cannot sue upon the bond at law, but would be driven into a Court of Equity; and yet he may release the debt. <em>Bro. </em>Oblig. <em>pl. </em>72. It was upon this idea, that the case of <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>1 Wash. 257, proceeded. The argument, that it was a covenant running with the land, proves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>nothing: for, if that circumstance enabled the heir to sue uPon the bond, then an assignee of the bond might likewise. But, that the latter could not maintain an action on it before the act of 1795, was settled by the case of <em>Craig </em>v.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMQ7\">Craig, 1 Call, [483,] in this Court at the last term. The doctrine contended for, would create confusion and embarrassment: For, suppose one breach in the life-time of the ancestor, and another in the time of the heir, if the latter can sue, the former will lose his action; because, the judgment is to stand as a security for future breaches, and the executor could not sue a <em>scire facias </em>upon a judgment in favor of the heir. Besides, it is an argument of some weight, that no action of debt was ever brought by an heir on a bond to his ancestor. Perhaps it may be questionable, whether an action of covenant would lie for an heir, upon .a bond to his ancestor? and, probably, the only case where the heir could maintain such an action, is where the breach arises out of a covenant contained in the conveyance for the land. However, be that as it may, this is not covenant, but debt; and the latter cannot be maintained by the heir: for, the form of actions is not to be departed from. ' This was settled in <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>1 Wash. 232; and the act of Assembly does not confound actions of covenant and debt together. The cases from 3 <em>Bac. </em>and 2 <em>Lev. </em>prove, indeed, that the heir may have the benefit of covenants real, which run with the land, but they decide nothing in the present case. The case of a <em>nomine pcense </em>is anomalous; but, at any rate, it will not disprove the doctrine which we contend for; especially, as the book does. not distinguish whether the heir may bring debt dr covenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">The declaration does not state that the eviction was by one entering as heir to <em>Temple Eppes, </em>and therefore is not certain enough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">There.is no. issue in the cause; for, the first declaration was withdrawn, and no new plea entered to the second; which, consequently, was never plead to at all, and therefore, the parties never were at issue on it: for, the pleas to the first declaration do not apply to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-8\">The equity of the case is clearly on our side, and therefore, the lav/ must be very pointed, to make us lose the benefit of our judgment, on a mere technical exception. There is no ground for the objection, that the eviction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>not sufficiently stated in the declaration, as the averment is, exactly, what Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>says it ought to be; for, the declaration states the whole matter specially, and that the heir of <em>Temple Eppes </em>sued the plaintiff, and turned him out of possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-4\">Although debt cannot be brought by the heir on money-bonds payable to the ancestor, it is otherwise as to bonds which concern lands; and in this case the heir is named expressly, for the bond is payable to the ancestor, his heirs, &amp;c.; which was proper, as it was for his benefit; and he is now the only person to whom compensation for the loss is due. If there be a bond for payment of rent, and there is a breach in the testator\u2019s life-time, the executor shall bring the suit; because the rent, incurred in the ancestor\u2019s life-time, was part of his personal estate. But, where the breach does not happen until after the ancestor\u2019s death, the heir shall have the action, because the rent was issuing out of, and concerned the lands. Although the condition is, generally speaking, for the benefit of the obligor, and the penalty for the benefit of the obligee, as has been said, yet that will not make any difference in this case; because, in all cases of this kind, the connection, between the penalty and the condition, is so great, that it is impossible to separate them: So that the condition is as much for the benefit of the obligee as the penalty is; and, substantially, the obligor only covenants for the terms in the condition. It was said, that the penalty goes to the executors, and not to the heir; but, no case to that effect is produced. It was also said, that the forms of actions were not to be departed from; and, that <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Cocke </em>had in effect decided, that the difference contended for, between debt and covenant,.ought to be observed. But, the cases are not alike; for debt and case do not substantially unite together, in the same manner as covenant and debt, upon bonds of this kind. The case of ejectment upon a mortgage does not apply, because the estate is absolute on nonpayment of the money, and it is the Court of Equity, and not the law, which gives the money to the executor: For, the law does not recognize the executor\u2019s right at all. But here, the bond is not for payment of money, nor was it intended to swell the personal estate at all, but it was merely given for the benefit of the heir, who may always sue, where he is the person actually interested. The reason why the <em>cestui que use </em>cannot sue upon the bond to not true, that an the trustee, is for want of privity. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>assignee of the land would not be entitled to sue on this bond; for, if he and the executor were contending about the bond, the assignee would be preferred; but, if he has a right to the bond, he would also have a right to the action, to enforce the contents of it. It is exactly like the case of a covenant for quiet enjoyment, in which case, either the heir or assignee may sue. The -case of the <em>nomine pcense </em>for rent, is exactly like this in principle; for, that is a penalty, and so is this: therefore, the same rule will apply to both cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">It is not correct to say, that there was no issue in the cause; for, as the first pleas were not withdrawn, they stood as pleas to the new declaration. But, at any rate, that objection would not go to destroy the action altogether; it could, at most, only produce a repleader.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>Cut. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAqP\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"pAYo\">This is an action of debt on a penalty conditioned for the performance of covenants, that is to say, a covenant for quiet enjoyment of a tract of land: it is brought by the heir of the original obligee; and the grounds on which he sets up his right, are, 1. That the bond is payable to <em>Peter Eppes, </em>his heirs, executors and administrators. 2. That the eviction is alleged to have been since the descent of the land to the heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">It is certainly a. general principle, that an executor is the proper party to recover debts due to the testator; and I have not been able to find a single instance of an action of debt being brought by the heir.</p>\n<p id=\"ASs\">It is admitted, that an heir may bring an action of covenant, upon a covenant running with the land, for a breach in his own time; and the executor may also bring the same action for a breach committed in the life-time of-the testator: And, it is alleged by the counsel for the appellant, that under our act of Assembly, this action is substantially an action of covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">If this position were true, it would, perhaps, materially vary the opinion I have formed upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">Covenants, the performance whereof is secured sby a penalty, are susceptible of a two-fold remedy. 1. An action of debt for the penalty, after the recovery of which the plaintiff cannot resort to the covenant; because, the penalty is a satisfaction for the whole. 2. An action of covenant, in which the plaintiff, waiving the penalty, pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>seeds </em>on the covenants, and may recover more or less than the penalty <em>toties quoties. Lowe </em>v. <em>Peers, </em>4 Burr. <em>2225. </em>The party, therefore, has his election; and, in the present ease, the plaintiff has elected to bring an action of debt for the penalty. :</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">A judgment in this action of debt will he in favor of the plaintiff for the whole penalty, although he cannot, (without a <em>scire facias, </em>assigning new breaches,) sue out execution for more of that penalty than is recovered, as a compensation for the breaches rightly assigned. One action is all that c\u00e1n be brought upon the penalty, proceeding by way of action of debt; but proceeding by action of covenant, and waiving the penalty, ever so many actions may be brought, and separate judgments will be given in each, for the damages respectively sustained. I am, therefore, warranted in saying, that the position, that this action is substantially an action of covenant, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">This opinion is' further confirmed, by considering the end and object of making our act relative to the assign- \u25a0 ment of breaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">At common law, before that act, in such an action as the present, the plaintiff could only assign a single breach; but, for that breach, he could recover judgment and sue execution, for the whole penalty; which often exceeded the real damage; and, therefore, the defendant was <em>driven </em>into equity for relief. It was to prevent that resort to a Court of Equity, and attain the same purpose in a Court of Common Law, that the act of Assembly was made. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But it never was intended, nor does it operate, to convert the action of debt into an action of covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">If, then, this be not, even in substance, an action of covenant, but entirely an action of debt, it is not enough to support it, for the plaintiff to shew, that the heir may take the benefit of a covenant, as appertaining to his inheritance, but he must proceed in that action which the law gives him: And the cases cited on this part of the subject all have reference <em>clearly to </em>an action of covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">If this action is sustainable, it vests a right in the present plaintiff to the whole penalty, (subject to his future assignment of breaches,) after which no resort can be had to the covenant itself. The consequence of which is* that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the executor is excluded from his for a breach committed jn \u00a3he testator\u2019s life-time; whereas, by confining the heir to sue his action of covenant, the executor may also sue his action of covenant, and each of them respectively recover the damages to which they are entitled. '</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">If it be said, on the other hand, that this action of debt upon the penalty, if sued by the executor, would, on his obtaining a judgment, equally exclude the heir from injuries done in his time, I answer, that the executor is the proper representative of the testator as to bringing actions of debt, that he can have no judgment without a breach; that, if he gets a judgment at all, it must be for the whole penalty; and that this is a consequence growing out of the nature of the security the testater has taken. Nevertheless, it may be that the executor would, in that case, be a trustee in equity, for the damages sustained by the heir. But the only question now before us, is, whether the heir has a legal right to sue an action of debt upon this penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"AMc\">I beg it may be understood, however, that I have formed no opinion (as being unnecessary in the case before us,) whether the present covenant is, or is not, such an one as the heir may sue upon, by action of covenant for an eviction in his time. -</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">There is no ground, whatever, for the position, that the heir has a right to sue in consequence of the word <em>heirs </em>being inserted in the <em>Teneri </em>of the bond, nor has a single authority been cited to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"pAlA\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"pAEh\">The single question is, whether the heir could bring an action of debt upon this bond? Every decedent leaves two representatives; the executor, who represents his personal rights; and the heir who represents his real rights. It is the duty of the executor to collect together the personal estate; of which he is a trustee for payment of debts and legacies; and, therefore, is entitled to sue all actions which relate to the personalty; because, he alone is entitled to the possession of the personal assets, for the purposes just mentioned. But the heir is entitled to the realty; and, therefore, every action, respecting that property, belongs to him. Now, the bond in question related to the lands altogether, and, therefore, constituted no part of the personal estate of the testator; as no breach had happened, or forfeiture incurred during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Ms life-time, so as to entitle the executor to a recompense for the damages which the testator had sustained: Consequently, the property in the bond belonged to the heir, as appertaining to the inheritance, which it was intended to secure. For, conditions and covenants real, or such as are annexed to estates, descend to the heir, and he alone can take advantage of them. 3 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 453, cites [<em>Wootton </em>v. Cooke,] 1 Anders. 53. If the bond had been conditioned for building a house upon the land, and the forfeiture had happened after the death of the testator, it would surely be more consistent with reason and justice that the heir, who was to be benefitted by the building, should have the remedy, whatever it was, in his own power, than that it should belong to the executor; who, having no interest in the matter, would not be concerned, whether the house was built or not. The case of the <em>nomine pcense </em>mentioned in <em>Co. Litt. </em>162, is expressly applicable; and shews that the interest in conditions and covenants of this kind, vests in the heir. All the foregoing principles more strongly apply In a case like the present, where the land has been lost altogether; and the money recovered is to be in lieu of it. In such a case, it would be strange if the law were to establish the useless security, of a suit first by the executor against the obligor, and then of a suit by the heir against the executor. It is certainly better to say, at once, that he who has the right, has the remedy to assert it. There is a passage in <em>Wentworth\u2019s </em>Off. Ex. which may be thought to militate against this doctrine. But the author appears to me to have had no fixed opinion concerning it. For, in one place he says, the money when recovered by the executor is assets, and' in another that he is trustee for the heir: Both of which cannot be true. But, they serve to shew, however, the oscillation of his own mind upon the subject; and, therefore, but little weight' is attached to his observations with respect to the point. It is said, that there is no case produced of such an action having ever been brought by an heir; but that argument will perhaps apply both ways; for neither has any authority been produced of its having ever been decided, that the action must be brought by the executor: which leaves it equally as uncertain, whether an action, by the executor, could be maintained; and that very uncertainty is of itself a reason, with me, for not sending the plaintiff back to explore the difficulty. Upon the whole, I am for reversing the judgment of the District Court, and entering judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<author id=\"pAfY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"pAXZ\">I concur with the Judge, who last delivered his opinion; which, if not supported by strict law, is, at least, agreeable to the soundest principles 0f justice and good sense.</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">But, the law is certainly with the opinion. In 3 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 65, it is said, that rents in lieu of profits, charters . and writings, relating to lands, go to the heir; and in the passage cited from 3 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 453, conditions and covenants real, such as are annexed to real estates, go to the Tieir also. So, that the' title to the security seems to be clearly vested in the heir: And, it is admitted, that an action of covenant would have lain for him. But, I cannot discover any reasonable distinction between debt and covenant in such a case. For, in both, the object is to recover compensation for a specific injury done to the inheritance, or in other words to the heir; and why the recovery should in one action enure to the heir, and.in the other to the executor, is very difficult to conceive.' .</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The bond in the present case, upon the very face of it, imports that it could not form any part of the personal assess. \u2019 For, it respected the title to the inheritance only, to'bl ich it was an appendage. The heir, therefore, had a right to it as one of the muniments of his title; and, as the breach happened in his own time, he had a right to sue upon it; and, might bring debt or covenant at his elecf tion. For, if the covenant binds the obligor and his representatives to the heir, the contents of it must belong to the heir likewise; and, the sum being certain, an action of debt to recover it was properly brought.</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\">Indeed, the conduct of the defendant admits the propriety of the action. For, instead of excepting to the form of the action, he has plead over, and stated assets to a certain amount. On which plea, an issue was taken; and, on the trial, a verdict passed for the plaintiff. After which, it would be too much to allow an exception to the action, without clear principles, or the most decisive authorities require it. But, as there are neither in the present ease, I think the judgment of the District Court should be reversed; and, that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<author id=\"AEn\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">This is a suit at Common Law, and must be decided according to the rules and principles of the Common Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>By the Common Law, all charters and writings relating <em>to </em>the freehold and inheritance, that is to say, deeds and covenants conveying lands, which can be transferred as I understand it, follow the interest of the land and belong to the heir to protect his title.

Such a bond will not enable the heir to recover or defend at law; it is not assignable at Common Law, and cannot be transferred to a purchaser: It is, therefore, useless to the heir in that respect. Money, and not land, is to be recovered on it; and, the whole penalty is forfeited by a single breach. It is true .at either party may have recourse to a Court of Equity; the obligee for a specific performance of the condition, and the obligor to be relieved against the penalty, on making compensation. But, at law the action must be for the p - nalty only, and as that is money and a gross sum, the suit must be brought by the executor as\u00b0 legal representative of the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In <em>Wentworth\u2019s </em>Off.

If after, the heir must, indeed, jtnake use of the executor\u2019s name in bringing the suit, but the recovery will be for his own benefit. So, that his interest is sufficiently protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">It was said, that the <em>nomine pcense </em>in a lease may be sued for, and recovered by the heir in his own name; which the appellee\u2019s counsel insists is analogous to the present case. But, that is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">For, the <em>nomine pcense </em>like the rent, it is incident to the reversion, and descends to the heir at Common Law. It waits on the rent, and cannot be released until the rent is behind: Non-payment, makes it a duty. [5 <em>Edw. </em>4, 42,] <em>Yelv. </em>215; 4 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The argument, that the act of Assembly by declaring that the penalty shall be discharged by payment of the damages found, does in effect destroy the distinction between debt and covenant, has no weight with me. For, that act does not alter the nature of the action, but the same judgment for .the penalty is still preserved by. the act, and a collateral relief only given, in order to prevent the necessity of applying to a Court of Equity. So, that the act, instead of confounding the distinction between them, does in express terms support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>There must have been many bonds for conveyances and assuring of titles in <em>England, </em>yet there is no precedent of any suit or declaration, by an heir, upon such a bond; and, if no such precedent can be shewn, then, according to <em>Littleton\u2019s </em>rule, it is a good argument, that an action lies not, because one was never brought. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">I am therefore of opinion, that there is no error; and that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b51-5\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"A_3\">The bond is to <em>Peter Eppes, </em>his heirs or executors, to operate in succession, and not to any two at the same time; to <em>Peter </em>during his life, in which no breach was made, and at his death it became payable to one of his two legal representatives, and not to both. So that the objection that the obligee was liable, at the same time, to be sued by two different persons, does not seem to have any force. The paper and the remedy can belong only to one; and the question is, to which ? The heir is as much the legal representative of the testator as to the real estate, as the executor is as to the personal; and, with the land, the heir takes all deeds and writings relating to them, whether for conveying the title or protecting his quiet enjoyment; with none of which could the executor intermeddle, as it is laid down by <em>Bacon </em>in his 3d <em>vol. </em>57, (from <em>Roll\u2019s Abr. </em>919, and <em>Wentw. 63,) </em>where he is professedly treating of the distinct rights of the heir and executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The same author in his Sd <em>vol. 4S3, </em>treating of the rights of the heir to take advantage of the conditions or covenants made to the ancestor, \u2022 lays down this general principle, \u201c conditions and covenants real, or such as are annexed to estates, shall go to the heir, and he alone shall take advantage of them.\u201d In a note he makes this obvious distinction, that in case of a breach in the testator\u2019s life-time it shall go to the executor; the land being gone and the substitute money.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">But we are embarrassed by the term penalty; which is money; was a debt from the date of the bond; and therefore, at law, must go to the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">This, if it could be true, would wholly derange the principles laid down by <em>Bacon: </em>And how is it proved ? I consider it to be the same as timber on the land; if sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>erecl in the testator\u2019s life-time, it will go to the executor; if growing, it will belong to the heir. It is laid down in , <em>Co. Litt. </em>292, that if a man be bound by deed to pay another a sum of money at a future day, a release of all actions before the day shall be a bar; because the debt was a thing in action, and although he could not sue, because it was <em>debitum in prsesenti, solvendum in futuro, </em>yet since the right of action was in him, a release of all actions was a discharge of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Penalties in their nature, follow the subject they are intended to enforce: And the case put of a <em>nomine poenae 3 Bacon, 453, </em>applies directly in terms, since he states the case of a penalty to enforce the payment of rent; which (that is the penalty) he says ought in reason to go to him who has a right to the rent. So, in the present case, the penalty is to go to him who lost the land intended to be protected by it. But it is said that there is no instance of a suit by the heir for a penalty. I have not searched for the precedent; but believe it would be, at least, as difficult to produce one, of an executor\u2019s suing for the penalty of a bond, which had a condition for quiet enjoyment of land annexed to it, and the condition not broken at the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">In this case, the heir has sustained the loss to be recompensed; he is named as obligee in the bond; has rightfully the possession of it; and I can find no principle of the most rigid law to prevent his recovery in the mode he has pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">A majority of the Court, therefore, is of opinion that the errors assigned to arrest the judgment, are insufficient for the purpose; and consequently that the judgment of the District Court is erroneous: It is therefore to be reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiff. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-11\">[* See <em>M'Call </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call, Ibid. 219.20] 146, and <em>Barrett &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>tazewell</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b51-15\">[* <em>Co.
