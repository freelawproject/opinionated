The woman <em>Winnifred </em>bequeathed to <em>Susanna Smith, </em>after her mother\u2019s death, had a child named <em>Milly, </em>born before the death of the testator, <em>Thomas </em>the elder; and not long after his death, his widow, the legatee for life, sent <em>Winnifred </em>and her child <em>Milly </em>to <em>Susanna Smith, </em>the legatee of <em>Winnifred </em>in remainder, whose husband <em>Maryland Thomas </em>was then living. After the death of the widow of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, the legatee for life, which happened in 1800, and after the death of <em>Maryland Thomas, </em>husband of <em>Susanna Smith, Thomas </em>the younger, by deed dated the 7th March 1801, gave and conveyed to his sister <em>Susanna </em>all his right and interest in the woman <em>Milly </em>and iier increase; <em>Susanna </em>being, at that time, the executrix of her husband, <em>Maryland Thomas. </em>But <em>John Smith </em>the heir at law, and other children of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, insisted, that that testator was intestate as to the woman <em>Milly, </em>and all the other increase of slaves bequeathed by him, in remainder after his wife\u2019s death, which were born before his death. And <em>Susanna Smith, </em>thus holding and claiming <em>Milly </em>and her <em>increase,\u2014Thomas Smith </em>the younger, holding and claiming, as residuary legatee, another slave named <em>Rohm, </em>born before the testator <em>Thomas </em>the elder\u2019s death, the remainder whereof was not specifically bequeathed by that testator\u2019s will,\u2014and <em>John Smith </em>the heir at law, and two of the other distributees, of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, claiming distribution of all these slaves, on the ground that that testator was intestate in regard to them,\u2014submitted their respective claims to arbitration; and the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tors, in March 1801, awarded, that <em>Robin </em>held by <em>Tho-</em>the younger, and <em>Milly </em>and her increase held by <em>Susanna, </em>ought to be equally divided among the distributees of the testator <em>Thomas </em>the elder. At the time arbitration and award, there were several other distributees of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, who were not parties to the submission. The original bill was filed by <em>John Smith </em>the heir at law, and the other two distributees, of <em>Thomas Smith </em>the elder, who were parties to the submission and arbitration, against <em>Thomas Smith </em>the younger, and <em>Susanna Smith, </em>to enforce the award. The Chancellor dismissed the bill, without prejudice to any remedy the plaintiffs might have at law. But, upon an appeal taken by the plaintiffs, this court reversed the det\u00edree, and held, that the case was properly relievable in equity; that the arbitrators did indeed decide the point of law submitted to them erroneously, yet the award was binding on the parties to the submission, so far as their interests were concerned; but that as to those of the distributees of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, who did not join in the submission to arbitration, <em>they </em>could claim nothing under the award; and the shares they would have been entitled to, if they had been parties to the submission, remained to <em>Thomas Smith </em>the younger, the residuary legatee, and his donee <em>Susanna Smith. </em>And the cause was remanded to the court of chancery for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">After the cause got back to the court of chancery, the plaintiffs amended their bill, conventingbefore the court, as parties defendants, the other distributees of <em>Thomas Smith </em>the elder, who were not parties either as plaintiffs or defendants to the original bill, and the legatees of <em>Maryland Thomas Smith, </em>who were in possession of some of the increase of the woman <em>Milly, </em>and claimed title 'to the same.

The deposition of the defendant <em>Susanna Smith, </em>who deposed, that her mother and brother, <em>Thomas </em>the younger, sent <em>Winnifred </em>and her child <em>Milly </em>to her and her husband, in 1785 ; that <em>Thomas </em>the younger, before and soon after the slaves were so sent to them, told her and her husband <em>Maryland, Thomas, </em>that he never should claim <em>Milly </em>and her increase; that she considered this a gift of <em>Milly </em>and her increase to her and her husband; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>that her brother, <em>Thomas </em>the younger, executed the deed of gift of the slaves in question to her, of his own accord. <em>2. </em>The deposition of <em>Thomas Smith </em>the younger, who deposed, that his father, <em>Thomas </em>the elder, died in j_iygg} an\u00bf that shortly after his death, he the deponent made a verbal gift of all his right and title in the woman <em>Milly </em>and her increase, to his sister <em>Susanna </em>and her husband <em>Maryland Thomas; </em>that after the death of <em>Maryland Thomas, </em>his sister <em>Susanna </em>having informed him, that she was uneasy about the title to <em>Milly </em>and her increase, because his gift thereof had not been in writing, he therefore gave her the deed of March 1801, conveying these slaves to her. And 3. the deposition of <em>Rachel Smith, </em>who deposed, that she heard the widow of <em>Thomas </em>the elder say, that she had given <em>Winnifred </em>and her child <em>Milly </em>to <em>Maryland Thomas </em>and his wife <em>Susanna, </em>because she believed her husband had intended, to give the child <em>Milly </em>as well as the mother <em>Winnifred </em>to them, and that it was through an omission in his will, that this intention was not expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">Both causes were heard together; and the chancellor dismissed the bill of the legatees of <em>Maryland Thomas Smith; </em>and made a decree in the other cause, plainly, and indeed acknowled'gedly, conforming with the decree made by this court, when the cause was here before, and in all respects right, if the bill of the legatees of <em>Maryland Thomas </em>was properly dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\"><em>Merrit &amp; wife </em>and others, legatees of <em>Maryland Thomas, </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-9\"><em>Johnson, for </em>the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyXF\">said, that <em>Susanna Smith </em>joined in the submission to arbitration in her own light, not as executrix of her husband, <em>Maryland Thomas Smith; </em>therefore, the award did not at all affect the rights of her testator\u2019s estate. And he endeavoured to maintain, that, upon the case stated in the bill of <em>Merrit Sp wife </em>and others, and the facts proved by the depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>sitions, the woman <em>Milly </em>and her increase were the property of <em>Maryland Thomas </em>in his lifetime, and at his death devolved to his representative and legatees: lor <em>Maryland Thomas </em>had actual possession of the woman <em>Milly, </em>for more than five years, taking the date of the gift from the deposition of the donor, <em>Thomas </em>the younger; and the statute of limitations gave him the title. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>3 Call 85.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-4\"><em>Leigh </em>answered, that <em>Susanna Smith </em>did not submit <em>the </em>justice of her own claim alone to arbitration; she submitted also the justice of the claim of the heir at la,w and distributees of <em>Thomas Smith, </em>the elder, and. their claim, being established by the award, equally defeated any claim <em>she might </em>have had as executrix of her husband, as the claim she set up in her own right. But, however, that might be, he said, it was plain, that <em>Maryland Thomas Smith </em>never liad any property at all in the woman <em>Milly </em>and her increase. For, 1. the depositions afforded very inconclusive proof of the case alleged in the bill. 2. It was obvious, that <em>Maryland, Thomas Smith </em>never held possession under the alleged donor <em>Thomas Sinith </em>the younger; he held under the widow of <em>Thomas Smith </em>the elder, who was the tenant for life; his donor, <em>Thomas </em>the younger, was only entitled to the remainder, which did not fall in during <em>Maryland Thomas's </em>life. But, 3. admitting that <em>Thomas </em>the younger made a verbal gift of the slaves in question to <em>Maryland Thomas, </em>in 1783 or 1785; and that <em>Maryland Thomas </em>held possession till his death in 1789 ; he acquired, neither by the gift nor the possession, any property in these slaves. The statute of limitations did not operate to perfect his title.; for that did not begin to run against the donor, till the death of the tenant for life in 1800. The verbal gift was void by the statutes of April 3757, ch. O. ^ 2. and September 3758, ch. 5. \u00a7 1. 7 Hen. stat. at large, pp. 319. 237. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>And though the statute of October 1787, ch. 22. \u00a7 2. \u00ab 506. which provided, that the former statutes should not be construed to extend to verbal gifts of slaves, whereof the donees had had possession, was passeq (Juring <em>Maryland Thomas Smith's </em>life, and while he held the possession, yet this statute did not operate retrospectively, to make good the previous verbal gift. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Wash. 139.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AFKn\">It is admitted, that the decree is right, if the bill filed by the legatees of <em>Maryland Thomas Smith </em>was properly dismissed. Therefore, the questions are, 1. Whether <em>Maryland Thomas </em>acquired any title in the woman <em>Mitty </em>and her increase, daring <em>his life ? and </em>2. Whether the submission to arbitration, and the award, embraced that title.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">As to' the first, let the facts alleged and contended for by the appellants, be taken as true, though they are very defectively proved. There was a parol gift by the tenant for life, followed by delivery of possession, to <em>Maryland Thomas, </em>in 1783 or 1785 ; then there was a parol relinquishment of his right and title by <em>Thomas </em>the younger, the remainderman; and <em>Maryland Thomas </em>held the possession till his death in 17S9: did he thereby acquire the title ? If we are to be governed by the laws in force at the time of the gift, as settled by the decisions of this court, the answer must be in the negative. The statutes of April 1757, ch. 6. \u00a7 2. and September 1758, ch. 5. \u00a7 1. provided that no gift of slaves should be good and sufficient to pass any estate in such slaves, unless the same should be made by will &amp;c. or by deed in writing, duly proved and recorded &amp;c. and those statutes remained in force, unaltered, till October 1787, when a statute was passed, reciting <em>the </em>statutes of 1757 and 1758, and that it had been determined by a late adjudication, that all gifts of slaves were void, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>unless made in writing <em>See. </em>and enacting, that, thence- .. ,-sii-ji forth, the statutes ox 17o7 and 1758, shouJd be construed to extend only to gifts of slaves, whereof the donors have, notwithstanding such gifts remained in the possession, and not to gifts of such slaves as had or should at any time come into the actual possession of, and have remained with, the donee, or some person claiming under such donee; 1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. \u00a7 51. p. 432. Now, in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Wash. 139. decided in 1792, this court held, that a parol gift of slaves made between April 1757 and October 1787, though accompanied by delivery of possession, was void, and that the statute of October 1787 was only prospective in its operation. See also <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>3 Call 85. and <em>Spiers </em>v. <em>Willison, </em>4 Cranch 398. The parol gift, in the present case, was made by the widow of <em>Thomas Smith </em>the elder, the tenant for life, in 1783 or 1785, and the gift or release of the remainder by <em>Thomas </em>the younger, was made soon after. By the law at that time, these gifts were void. If it be said, that the possession of <em>Maryland Thomas Smith </em>was sufficient to give him a title, and <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Murray </em>be relied on to shew that the parol gift may be given in evidence to shew in what right he held; the answer is, that during the life of old <em>Mrs. Smith, </em>the tenant for life, <em>Maryland Thomas\u2019s </em>possession could not be adversary to <em>Thomas </em>the younger, the legatee in remainder, who had no right to the possession during the life of his mother; and she lived till 1800. .1 conclude, therefore, that <em>Maryland Thomas Smith </em>had no title whatever to <em>Milly </em>and her increase, and, of course, could give none to his legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">R is, then, not worth while to discuss the question, whether this ground of claim was submitted to the arbitrators in .1801; for, whether it was or not, if <em>Maryland Thomas Smith </em>had no title at all, the bill of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>legatees was properly dismissed. I shall, however, merely add, that if <em>Susanna Smith </em>had really held the slaves as executrix of her husband, (which, in fact, she did not pretend) and his title had been better than -t we mugt have taken it as submitted by her to the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"AT9\">The other judges concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
