Evans, </em>late high sheriff of the county, for the purpose of setting aside certain assignments of bonds, and conveyances of real and personal property, made by <em>John Greer </em>to <em>Samuel Greer, </em>on the ground that they were made with intent to defraud the plaintiff. The bill charged that in April 1840, the plaintiff recovered a judgment, in an action at law in the Circuit court of <em>Jackson </em>county, for 700 dollars damages and 55 dollars 68 cents costs, against <em>John Greer. </em>That on this judgment <em>John Greer </em>was taken in execution, and took the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors, without surrendering any property in his schedule. That at the time he took the oath of insolvency, he had due to him from <em>Nehemiah Smith </em>a debt of 526 dollars, for which <em>Smith </em>had executed to him his bond in May or June <em>1839; </em>and that <em>John Greer </em>had, to defraud the plaintiff, assigned the bond to his brother <em>Samuel Greer, </em>a short time before the date of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment against him. That <em>George Gillaspie </em>also owed to <em>John Greer </em>200 dollars, or more, and the same was, in like manner and for the same purpose, assigned to <em>Samuel Greer. </em>That <em>John Greer </em>inherited from his father a share of a valuable farm lying in the county of <em>Mason, </em>and that he was entitled to a distributive share of the personal estate; and that he owned a tract of land containing one hundred acres, more or less, lying in <em>Mason </em>county, contiguous to the land of which his father died seized. That the plaintiff does not know what the said <em>John Greer </em>has done with his interest in the aforesaid lands and personal property, but believes that he has passed it over to <em>Samuel Greer ; </em>certainly he did not surrender it in his schedule. That all the said property, the plaintiff believes, belonged to <em>John Greer </em>at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>took the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors; and that the same thereupon vested by operation of law, in <em>Ephraim S. Evans, </em>the then sheriff of <em>Jackson </em>county. And that <em>Samuel </em>Greer, who claims the dept due to <em>Smith, </em>is a young man, and had no means of paying a fair consideration for that, and much less for the other property transferred to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">The two <em>Greers, Smith </em>the debtor, and <em>Evans </em>the sheriff, were made defendants, and the prayer of the bill was that the debts and the other property aforesaid might be subjected to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\"><em>Samuel Greer </em>answered the bill. He said that the debt of <em>Smith </em>to <em>John Greer </em>was sold to <em>Samuel </em>on the 3d of September 1839, at a discount of 50 dollars, and that the money was paid. That there were two notes of <em>Gillaspie's, </em>which were also sold to <em>Samuel Greer </em>on the 4th of December 1839, and the full amount thereof, deducting interest, was paid for them. That <em>John Greer </em>conveyed to <em>Samuel </em>his interest, which was one eighth, hi his father\u2019s tract of land, which contained one hundred acres. The conveyance was made early in the year 1838, and was in consideration that <em>Samuel Greer </em>should support his mother, who then resided on the land with him. That as to the one hundred acres of land alleged in the bill to have been owned by <em>John Greer, </em>he had obtained a patent therefor in 1830, and had sold it in 1834 to his brother <em>James Greer </em>for 80 dollars; that <em>James </em>cleared a few acres of it and farmed it for two or three years, and then removed to the county of <em>Jackson, </em>and agreed that <em>Samuel Greer </em>might have the land at the price he gave for it, and pay him when <em>Samuel </em>should find it convenient to do so : And he directed <em>John </em>to make a deed for the same to <em>Samuel Greer, </em>which was accordingly <em>done; </em>and the deed was recorded on the 20th of March 1838. That <em>Samuel Greer </em>had cultivated his father\u2019s tract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>land for ten years, and the other tract from the year 1836 or \u201937, and had been enabled to pay for the notes aforesaid from the proceeds of his labour. That he purchased in good faith, intended no fraud himself, and had no knowledge of any fraudulent intent on the part of <em>John Greer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\"><em>John Greer </em>also answered the bill. His answer was substantially the same as that of <em>Samuel Greer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The action in which the judgment was recovered by the plaintiff, was for seduction. The evidence in the cause satisfied the Court below and this Court, that the assignments of the notes of <em>Smith </em>and <em>Gillaspie </em>by <em>John Greer </em>to <em>Samuel, </em>were fraudulent; and when the cause came on to be heard in the Circuit court, that Court decreed that these assignments were fraudulent ; and that the conveyance, if one existed, from <em>John Greer </em>to <em>Samuel </em>for the interest of the said <em>John </em>in his deceased father\u2019s real estate in the county of <em>Mason, </em>was also null and void: and that his interest therein should be subjected to the complainant\u2019s debt. And it was further decreed, that the plaintiff recover against the defendants, <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Greer, </em>the sum of 755 dollars 68 cents, the debt and costs recovered at law, and the costs in this cause; and that the plaintiff have leave to issue execution on this decree to enforce the collection thereof. But this portion of the decree, authorizing the issuing of execution, was suspended for sixty days from its date, that if the said <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Greer, </em>or either of them, after they have been each served with a copy of the decree, within the period of sixty days aforesaid, shall surrender to <em>E. S. Evans, </em>late sheriff of the county, the whole of said notes and obligations of <em>Nehemiah Smith </em>and <em>George Gillaspie, </em>due and unpaid to them or either of them, their agents or attorneys, or in any manner unimpaired by their acts, within sixty days from the date of this decree, then no execution is to issue, unless by a future order and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>cree of this Court. And if any of the said notes or obligations, or any part of them, have been received by the said <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Greer, </em>they may surrender to the said <em>E. S. Evans, </em>the notes or obligations, with credits endorsed upon them, and shall receive a credit upon the execution for the balance actually due upon said notes and obligations; provided that by no act of theirs or either of them, the said notes and obligations have been cancelled, or the liability of the payees or obligors destroyed. And it was further provided, that if the notes and obligations were in suit, so that they could not be surrendered, that the defendants might assign them to <em>Evans, </em>and should have credit on the execution for the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">It was-further decreed, that unless the said notes and obligations were surrendered within the time prescribed, to the amount of the plaintiif\u2019s debt, or the debt was paid by said <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Greer, </em>that a commissioner should proceed to advertise in the mode prescribed in the decree, and sell at public auction, the interest of the said <em>John Greer </em>in the land of which his father died seized, upon the terms of one half the purchase money in cash, and the other half on a credit of four months, with interest from the date, &amp;c. And the commissioner of the Court was directed to take an account of the personal estate of which the father of <em>John Greer </em>died possessed, or which had come to his distributees since his decease; and to ascertain what aliquot portion of the personalty the said <em>John Greer </em>was entitled to ; and in what manner it had been disposed of; and its value. Prom this decree <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Greer </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-5\"><em>B. H. Smith, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-6\"><em>Fisher, for the </em>appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ake\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">The Court is of opinion, that there is no error in so much of said decree as declared that the assignments of the obligations therein described upon <em>Nehemiah Smith </em>and <em>George </em>Gillaspie, and the conveyance, if one exist, from <em>John Greer </em>to <em>Samuel Greer, </em>for the interest of <em>John </em>in his deceased father\u2019s real estate, were fraudulent, and therefore null and void as against the appellee, a creditor of said <em>John Greer. </em>The Court is further of opinion, that there is no error in so much of said decree as directs the commissioner to take, state and settle an account of the personal estate of which the father of said <em>John Greer </em>died possessed, or which has been distributed, to ascertain what portion the said <em>John </em>is entitled to <em>\u00a1 </em>and how it has been disposed of. The Court is further of opinion, that the residue of said decree, giving a joint and personal decree against the said <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Greer, </em>for the amount of the judgment at law against said <em>John, </em>and prescribing the mode in which said obligations should be surrendered, and directing a sale of the interest of said <em>John </em>in the real estate of his father, on condition said obligations were not surrendered to the satisfaction of the appellee, is erroneous. The complainant should have been required to make said <em>George Gillaspie </em>a party defendant ; to have matured his case against said <em>Nehemiah Smith </em>and <em>Gillaspie; </em>and if upon the hearing it appeared that the said <em>Smith </em>and <em>Gillaspie </em>were the debtors of said <em>John Greer </em>at the time of such fraudulent transfers, and that the appellee was still entitled to the application of said debts in the hands of the debtors, to the payment of his judgment, there should have been a decree compelling said debtors to pay into Court the amount for which they were chargeable, to be applied to said judgment and the costs of this suit; with leave to proceed against the said <em>Samuel </em>for any portion of said debts he may have received, or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>which he may by his improper acts or negligence, have rendered himself chargeable; and for the balance of said judgment and costs of this suit, after the application of the funds derived from the sources aforesaid, the interest saj\u00bf <em>John </em>in the real estate of his father should have been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It is therefore decreed and ordered, that so much of said decree as is herein declared not to be erroneous, be affirmed, and that the residue of said decree be reversed, with costs to the appellants, and that the cause be remanded, with leave to the appellee to make <em>George Gillaspie </em>a party defendant; and to be further proceeded in according to the principles before declared, in order to a final decree. Which is ordered to be certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
