A verdict in Eject~ ment, finding for the plaintW iii general terms~ a cci'tam \" nnm- \" 5cr of' acres \"part of the \"premises iii \"the decla\"i'ation men\"tioned,\" without designating th~ boundaries of such part, or referring to some certain standard t&amp; supply such defect, is to~ uncertain to warrant a judgment upon it~</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">1N Ejectmeiit, the declaration was, for \"ten Mes\"suages, twenty cottages, one thousand acres of wood-\"laud, one thousand acres of arabic land, OIIC thou\"sand acres of meadow and one thousand acres of \"pasture, lying aiid being in the County of Meck- \" lenburg,\" without setting forth any boundaries.The verdict was, \"We of the Jury find for the plaintiff \"his term yet to come in four hundred acres of land par\"ccl of the premises in the declaration mentioned, and: in the possession of the defendant,\" &amp;c.-with no farther descrq)tioIL Judgment being rendered for the plain~i1F, the defendant obtained a Sup ersedeas from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASQ\">Wickham for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkS\">The verdict is so uncertain that the Sheriff could not deliver possession of the land recovered. The very point is decided in Clay v. White, 1 Munf. 162.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A2N3\">Bouldin contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiY\">There is a difference between the Verdicts, in that case, and this. Thic verdict now in qiieslion is net to be distinguished from a general one..Though the declaration demands a thousand acres, yet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>if four hundred only are really in controversy, a general verdict is sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-3\">Such certainty as will enable the Sheriff to deliver possession, is not required in Ejectment; for the lessor of the plaintiff is to shew the Sheriff the land, and take possession at his periL<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Suppose, the declaration had demanded \"four hmidred acres part of a larger tract,\" and the Jury had found a general verdict, a Judgment upon it could not have been set aside. The verdict in this case is in the same words with such a declaration and verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-11\">The case of <em>Clay </em>v. <em>White </em>was on a <em>special </em>verdict, in which greater particularity is required than in general verdicts. In that case too, it was uncertain whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover at all. It did not appear <em>who </em>was in possession of the ninety acres, or against <em>whom, </em>the plaintiff was to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-12\">Was it ever demanded of a plaintiff in Ejectment, upon a declaration mentioning only a certain <em>number of acres, </em>that he should shew in what part of the defendant\u2019s possessions they lay?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-13\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply. The Jury have said that the plaintiff is entitled to his term yet to come in 400 acres <em>part o\u00ed </em>the premises in the declaration mentioned. I say <em>what </em>part ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-14\">This is not a general Verdict. If the suit were for an <em>undivided moiety, </em>and the Jury found the plaintiff entitled to an <em>undivided tenth part, </em>there would in such verdict be no uncertainty. But in this there is. There should have been an Order of Survey, and a finding by metes and bounds. The cases <em>mBurrow </em>are cases of general Verdicts, for <em>whole </em>tracts. There is no case where such a verdict as this has been supported.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-15\">Where the declaration is so defective, <em>as that no judgment can be entered upon it, </em>I think that even the act of Jeofails can not cui\u2019e it. Here the defect is not in the Verdict only, but the declaration; and not in <em>form, but </em>in <em>substance.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b46-4\"> Cottingham v.
