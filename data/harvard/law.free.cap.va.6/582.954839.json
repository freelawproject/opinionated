Beale </em>applied to the Judge of the Circuit court of <em>Fauquier </em>for an injunction. In his bill he alleged, that <em>John H. Digges </em>and <em>Charles W. Digges, </em>late merchants and partners, executed a deed, which was duly admitted to record, whereby they conveyed. to their brother <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>the books of the said firm, and all accounts and debts due to them, in trust to pay certain debts to creditors mentioned therein. That after the execution of the deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>and the acknowledgment thereon by <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>that he was in the possession of the books of the firm, a suit was brought in the Circuit court of <em>Fauquier, </em>in the name of the said <em>John H. &amp; C. W. Digges </em>against the said <em>Thomas E. </em>for a large amount claimed to be due by open account: That at the October term of the Court in 1839, the said <em>Thomas E., </em>by a collusive and private arrangement with the members of said firm, confessed a judgment in the case for the sum of 1763 dollars 27 cents, with interest on 1373 dollars 51 cents, from the 15th of October 1839 till paid, and the costs. He charged that this claim was utterly without foundation in law or equity, having neither a valuable nor a <em>bona fide </em>consideration on which to rest. That this confession of judgment was made but a short time before some slaves, the property of the complainant, but then in the possession of the said <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>were to be returned to him, in order, no doubt, to anticipate and prevent that event, and render them liable to the execution which might issue on said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">He further stated that an execution had been issued on the judgment aforesaid, and placed in the hands of the sheriff, who either had levied or was endeavouring to levy it on the said negroes, which were then in the possession of the complainant; though they had been formerly lent to <em>Thomas E. Digges. </em>That they were not the property of <em>Thomas E. Digges ; </em>and that the circumstances under which they were allowed to remain in his possession were not calculated, as complainant believed, to subject them to this debt, or to mislead the plaintiffs or any other of the creditors of <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>as it was known to <em>John H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>that he admitted the negroes were not his property, and expressed his intention to return them to the complainant, long before the confession of the judgment aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_F\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>He further stated that on the death of his daughter, who was the wife of <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>complainant demanded the slaves. That said <em>Thomas E. </em>admitted complainant\u2019s right to them, but prevailed on comPeinan* to let them remain with him the remainder of that year and the following, for the purpose and with a private understanding, as complainant believed, with said creditors, of giving colour, if not validity, to their claims to subject them to the debt aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-4\">The three <em>Digges </em>and the <em>cestuis que trust </em>in the deed, were made parties defendants, and the former were called upon to answer fully each and every allegation of the bill, to discover the consideration of the debt aforesaid, and what part thereof was <em>bona fide </em>due, how and by what means it became due, and to exhibit the books containing their mutual accounts, debts and credits, and dealings. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">The prayer of the bill was, that the said <em>John H., Charles W. </em>and <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>might be restrained from further proceedings under the said judgment as far as the said slaves, viz: <em>Charles, Jarred, Phil </em>and <em>Jane </em>were concerned; and for general relief. The injunction was granted; and in October 1840, the <em>Digges </em>filed their answers. <em>John PI. </em>and <em>Charles W. </em>Digges, admit the execution of the deed of trust. They say that subsequent to the execution of that deed, a settlement of accounts between the firm of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges </em>and <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>took place under the inspection and superintendence of <em>Col. Edward Digges, </em>which resulted in a balance being found due from said <em>Thomas E. to </em>said firm, for the sum mentioned in the bill, for which sum said <em>Thomas E. </em>confessed a judgment, and said claim was put under the control of the attorney of said firm, <em>Samuel Chilton, </em>to be by him collected and applied in discharge of certain debts due from the firm, which were provided for in the said deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>They further say, that <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>married the daughter of the plaintiff, a man of fortune, in December 1832, at which time said <em>Thomas E. </em>was a merchant in the town of <em>Warrenton, </em>and that he quit the business in 1833, and settled on a farm in the country. That in 1834, the plaintiff put the slaves in question into the possession of <em>Thomas E. Digges; </em>and that all of them, except <em>Jane, </em>remained in the possession of said <em>Thomas E. </em>until the 1st of January 1840. That <em>Jane </em>was returned to the plaintiff soon after the death of the wife of <em>Thomas E. Digges; </em>which occurred in July 1838. They charge that the slaves were put into the possession of <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>as an advancement to him ; but if they were intended as a loan, no record of it was made, and that the slaves having continued in the uninterrupted possession of <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>for more than five years, they were subject to the execution of the defendants. That they regarded the slaves as the property of <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>and credited him on the faith of them. They deny all knowledge of any arrangement between the plaintiff and <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>whereby the slaves were to be returned to the plaintiff on any contingency whatever. They deny that their judgment is not founded on a <em>bona fide, </em>valid and valuable consideration, and affirm that it is founded on such a consideration. They deny all fraudulent combination to procure said judgment, or to deprive the plaintiff of any legal or equitable right whatsoever, whether in connexion with said slaves or otherwise. They say that their execution was placed in the hands of the sheriff, who meeting with <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>he gave him a levy upon said slaves, except <em>Jane, </em>the sheriff not having seen them. That at the request of <em>Thomas E., </em>the sheriff, with the consent of the attorney in the execution, permitted the said <em>Thomas E. </em>to retain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>possession of the slaves until the day of sale, upon which day, the 1st of January 1840, they were brought to <em>Warrenton </em>for the purpose of being sold, when they were by the plaintiff, or his agent <em>John G. Beale jr., </em>secretly and fraudulently carried off, and concealed, so that the sheriff could not reach them, until one of them, <em>Charles, </em>was taken ; and then the plaintiff obtained his injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\">The answer of <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>states that he married the plaintiff\u2019s daughter in December 1832; that the plaintiff put the slaves in question into his possession between the 1st of January 1834 and the following August. That when the plaintiff put the slaves into his possession nothing passed between them, but the slaves were simply sent to him. That in the month of August 1838, the wife of <em>Thomas E. </em>died, leaving no children <em>; </em>and it was his intention to restore \"to her father all he had received by her, so far as he could do so consistently with the rights of his creditors. That he was largely in debt to several persons, whom he names, and prior to his wife\u2019s death, these creditors, or some of them, had claimed to hold said slaves responsible for their debts. That at the time of the death of his wife, he supposed the other slaves, without <em>Jane, </em>would be sufficient to pay his debts. That he informed the plaintiff of his wish to return said slaves, and of the difficulty interposed by his creditors. The plaintiff said he did not think they were bound, and proposed to the defendant to keep a portion of them, and restore to him the residue. That the defendant declined taking any of them, and told the plaintiff, that were they freed from his creditors, he would return them all. Several conversations of the same import passed between them; but prior to the death of the defendant\u2019s wife, no conversation touching said slaves, or the terms on which the defendant held them, ever passed between the plaintiff and the defendant. Nor was there any agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>other than might he implied from the aforesaid conversations, subsequent to her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">He further stated, that after the execution of the deed referred to in the bill, he came to a settlement with <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>under the supervision and control of <em>Col. Edward Digges, </em>who had the settlement of the affairs of said firm: upon which settlement he was found indebted to said firm in the sum specified in the bill, for which he confessed a judgment in the Circuit court of <em>Fauquier ; </em>as also in favour of several other persons, whom he named. That executions were issued on these judgments and placed in the hands of the sheriff, who meeting with the defendant, demanded a levy, and the defendant gave him up the slaves in controversy, except <em>Jane. </em>The slaves, however, except <em>Jarred </em>were not seen by the sheriff. That defendant requested the slaves might remain in his possession until the day of sale, to which the sheriff, with the assent of the plaintiffs, or their counsel, agreed. That on the 1st of January 1840, the day appointed for the sale, he produced the slaves at <em>Warrenton, </em>and they were, as he understood and charges, persuaded to leave <em>Warrenton, </em>by <em>John Gr. Beale jr., </em>acting as agent for the plaintiff, and go into the plaintiff\u2019s possession, where, as he has understood, they have since continued concealed, or so disposed of, that executions since issued could only be levied on <em>Charles, </em>which levy has resulted in the injunction of the plaintiff. He denies that the debt of J. <em>H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>or any of the other debts mentioned, rest or are founded upon any other than a <em>bona fide, </em>fair and valuable consideration. He denies all fraudulent combination in regard to the judgment of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges </em>aforesaid. And he denies all fraudulent combination, device or intention, to defeat, embarrass or affect in any manner whatever, the rights, legal or equitable, of the plaintiff touching the slaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>aforesaid, or any of them, or touching any other matter or thing whatsoever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-11\">The plaintiff at the October term of the Court for 1840, excepted to the answers of these defendants, because they were not responsive to the allegations of the bill, and because they did not discover the consideration of the debt in the bill mentioned, as called for, and did not submit the books which were called for to the inspection of the Court and parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-12\">At the same term of the Court, the defendants moved the Court to dissolve the injunction; but the motion was overruled, and the Court sustained the exceptions to the answers, and ordered the defendants to answer the plaintiff\u2019s bill more fully and sufficiently. And it was further decreed, that one of the commissioners of the Court should state, settle and adjust the accounts between the late firm of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges </em>and <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>and between the late firm of <em>Digges &amp; Hart </em>and <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>shewing by said settlements each item in the said accounts on both sides of the same. And the members of these late firms were directed to exhibit to the commissioner their <em>books; </em>and that they and <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>should submit to be examined on oath before the commissioner touching the said accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-13\">The commissioner returned his report on the 1st of September 1842. He says : <em>\u201c </em>Upon the subject of the accounts between the late firm of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>and <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>no proof or evidence has been laid before me except the accounts marked No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, herewith filed, and the books of the late firm of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>and the books of <em>J. H. &amp; T. E. Digges, </em>which books were exhibited before me by the defendants. These accounts and books, as they now stand, shew a balance of 1662 dollars 29 cents, due by <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>to <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. </em>Digges.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201cI am required by the counsel for the plaintiff to report that the ledgers of J. <em>H. &amp; T. E. Digges </em>and of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>upon the pages where the said accounts were kept, are much scratched, and in some places appear to have been altered, and the day books in some places are scratched, and appear to have been altered. In examining the books, I kept a memorandum of the particular places scratched, and which appear to have been altered, which memorandum is herewith filed, marked A, and prayed to be taken as a part of this report.\u201d This paper A, referred to numerous instances both in the ledgers and day books, in which the entries were scratched and altered; and also entries of payments in the ledger which did not appear in the cash account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">It appeared from the evidence that the slaves in controversy, except <em>Jane, </em>had remained more than five years in the possession of <em>Thomas E. Digges. </em>And there was evidence of his declarations, that he never considered the slaves his property, and also of his promise in September 1839, to the agent of the plaintiff, that he would send them to the plaintiff at the next Christmas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">In October 1842, the defendants filed their amended answers, in which they state that upon a settlement in the fall of 1839, of the accounts between the firms of <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges </em>and <em>J. H. &amp; T. E. Digges, </em>and between the latter firm and <em>John H. Digges, </em>one of the partners, <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>was found indebted to the first named firm, in the sum of 997 dollars 67 cents, and to <em>J. H. Digges </em>in the sum of 664 dollars 62 cents, as would appear by the accounts filed with the commissioner, marked No. 2 and No. 4, which accounts they say, were taken from the books of the firms; and they tender the books for the inspection of the plaintiff and the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>That after the settlement of the accounts, to avoid multiplicity of suits, with the assent of <em>Thomas E., </em>the balance found due from him to <em>John H. </em>Digges, was transferred to <em>J. H. &amp; C. W. Digges, </em>and a judgment was intended to be confessed for the aggregate of the two balances, amounting to 1662 dollars 29 cents, but by mistake in taking off the balances from the books they suppose, it was made 1763 dollars 27 cents, and to the extent of the difference between these two sums, they admit the judgment is erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-4\">The cause came on to be heard in May 1844, when the Court below dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill with costs. Whereupon the plaintiff applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-5\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-6\"><em>Morson </em>and <em>Robert E. Scott, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b610-7\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AdV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">It appears to the Court, that the slaves in the proceedings mentioned, with the exception of the woman <em>Jane, </em>remained by the space of five years in the possession of the appellee <em>Thomas E. Digges </em>under a pretended parol loan thereof from the appellant <em>Beale, </em>without demand made and pursued by due process of law on the part of the said pretended lender; and therefore that according to the terms, true intent and meaning of the act to prevent frauds and perjuries, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101, \u00a7 2, p. 373, as held by this Court in <em>Taylor v. Beale, </em>4 Gratt. 93, and other cases, became liable to the demands of the creditors of the said <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>though the possession thereof was resumed by the said <em>Beale </em>after the expiration of the said period of five years. But that the said woman <em>Jane, </em>not having so remained in the possession of the said <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>but the possession of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>having been resumed by the said <em>Beale </em>within such period of five years, she continued the property of the said <em>Beale, </em>and did not become liable to the demands of the creditors of the said <em>Thomas E. Digges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AN9V\">And the Court is further of opinion, that under the circumstances disclosed by the record, the Circuit court erred in dissolving the appellant\u2019s injunction and dismissing his bill, instead of causing an issue to be tried before a jury for the purpose of ascertaining whether the claim of the appellees <em>John H. Digges &amp; Charles W. </em>Digges, in the character of creditors of the said <em>Thomas E. Digges, </em>was fair and <em>bona fide, </em>or fictitious and fraudulent. And that whatever might be the result of such an issue, the Circuit court erred in dissolving instead of perpetuating said injunction so far as it restrained proceedings at law in regard to the said woman <em>Jane, </em>and in regard to the amount of the error admitted in the answers of the defendants, as to the sum for which the judgment at law was confessed by the said <em>Thomas E. Digges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Decree of the Circuit court reversed, with costs, injunction reinstated, and cause remanded, to be proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
